			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "President Iliescu Wants To Clarify </F> Ex-King's Position"]    [Text] "The ex-king must issue a clear statement to  receive an entry visa for Romania," President Ion Iliescu has  said in an answer to an AFP reporter's question. The Romanian  Government had an open attitude in 1992, when King Mihai I was  in Romania; in autumn 1993 he was asked to adopt a clear  position toward the rules of the Romanian Constitution. "I do  not want to take similar measures to those taken throughout  history by France, Italy, or Greece (in connection with former  monarchs and their direct descendants). Therefore, we want to  have a clear statement from him," said President Iliescu, who  avoided giving a clear answer to the question: "Will King Mihai  be granted an entry visa to Romania?"</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HEARING SOUGHT ON SEWAGE PLANT WAIVER;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: IN AN ACTION SURE TO REKINDLE CONTROVERSY OVER THE CARSON  FACILITY, THE COUNTY ASKS TO PRESENT MORE INFORMATION TO THE EPA.  </P> <P> In a move that drew fire from environmentalists, the Los Angeles County  Sanitation Districts on Friday requested a public hearing to seek a federal  waiver that would exempt its giant sewage plant in Carson from tighter  treatment standards.  </P> <P> The request, made to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, comes two  months after the EPA tentatively rejected the sanitation districts' formal  application for the waiver.  </P> <P> The hearing request is sure to rekindle controversy over treatment at the  Carson plant, which each day pumps 365 million gallons of effluent into the  ocean through outfalls south of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The facility serves  dozens of sanitation districts from Palos Verdes Estates to Pomona.  </P> <P> Sanitation officials have estimated that it would cost ratepayers $350 million  to meet federal standards requiring full secondary treatment, a system that  makes use of biological processes to remove 85% of solids from waste water.  </P> <P> Although 60% of the effluent from the Carson plant already receives secondary  treatment, the rest undergoes less intensive screening.  </P> <P> "The county sanitation districts have been spending an incredible amount of  taxpayers' money to evade and avoid going to full (sewage) treatment," said  Dorothy Green, president of Heal the Bay, a Santa Monica-based environmental  group. "We are thoroughly disgusted by the lengths to which they are willing to  go to avoid living up to their responsibilities."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the sanitation districts said his agency's request was a  well-intentioned attempt to get a fair hearing.  </P> <P> "This is not simply a delay tactic," said the spokesman, Joe Haworth. "We have  a need to put our evidence forward. We believe we've got some points to make  that we don't think (the EPA) responded to."  </P> <P> The sanitation districts argue that their effluent does not pose a threat to  marine life. They also say that removing more solids would be dangerous because  they help cap a layer of bay sediment contaminated by hundreds of tons of the  pesticide DDT discharged in the 1950s and '60s.  </P> <P> In its tentative denial Jan. 30 of the districts' waiver request, EPA Regional  Administrator Daniel McGovern rejected both arguments. However, an EPA official  said Friday that given the importance of the issue, it is likely that the  agency will grant the districts a public hearing.  </P> <P> "My guess is we will probably hold one," said Janet Hashimoto, oceans and  estuaries chief at the agency's San Francisco regional office.  </P> <P> Hashimoto said that arrangements have to be made and a 30-day public notice  period has to be held before the hearing, which would be conducted by an EPA  official.  </P> <P> After the hearing, the EPA will decide whether to stand by its Jan. 30 denial,  she said. Even if the tentative ruling is upheld, she added, agency rules allow  for further administrative challenges by the sanitation districts.  </P></p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / How to Spend It: A shopper's mailing list If you have ever longed to get hold of yukatas from Tokyo, puppets from Bangkok, a bureau from Portugal or even just fishing rods from Nottingham but seem unlikely to make it there in person then Richard McBrien's book The Global Shopper is the book for you. He starts with the boring but essential bits - how to order, what to do about customs and VAT and cards and bank drafts, as well as looking out for guarantees and pitfalls, all those vital bits of information that mail order fans so often forget about when they first pick up catalogue and pen. Then McBrien moves on to the more interesting bits for the shopaholics of this world - where to track down the best jeans, suits from Italy, camcorders or antiques from Hong Kong, contact lenses from California. It contains lots of useful indices and all for Pounds 9.99. Global Shopper, published by Headline Books, 404 pages, Pounds 9.99.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Mack's long haul back to health: Renault's attempts to shake up the US truck maker Mr Michael Helm, general manager at Mack Trucks' Macungie plant on the outskirts of Allentown, north-east Pennsylvania, points proudly to a huge void between the assembly lines. 'You could put a tennis court or two there,' he says. The void represents some of the 124,00 sq ft of space saved by complete overhaul of the plant's manufacturing methods since October 1990 when Renault of France acquired full control of Mack, a troublesome minority investment it had held since the early 1980s. Renault yesterday unveiled more than doubled net profits for last year, though operating earnings fell. The overhaul at Mack, following a study of Renault's methods at RVI, its truck and bus division, and after consulting Macungie's own workforce, has sharply boosted productivity. For example, parts which used to clutter the production line have been cleared, cutting inventory expense and making more efficient use of manpower: one team has been reduced from 10 men to seven because its members do not have to walk so far to pick up parts. The reforms Renault is introducing at Mack are mostly standard practice among leading vehicle manufacturers. But the fact that a state-owned French company, with a patchy profits record, is teaching such lessons to a grand old name of the American motor business highlights the blinkered concentration on the short-term which has led many US industrial companies to lose their competitive edge. 'There's an American thinking today that 'we know better',' says Mr Helm, 'when in point of fact that's not true.' 'Up to 1990 Mack was a totally egocentric company, with a parochial culture,' says Mr Elios Pascual, the 51-year-old Frenchman sent by Renault to turn the company around. 'It became the most fantastic machine for inventing excuses that I have ever seen.' About 18 months after the takeover, Mack is still losing money - Dollars 158m (Pounds 91.3m) last year - in a depressed US truck market. But Renault's reforms hold out the prospect of an eventual return to financial health. The company was founded early this century and its trucks, with their distinctive bulldog mascot, earned a reputation for toughness. However, in the 1980s the company went badly off the road when management failed to invest sufficiently in plant or manufacturing techniques and the quality of its vehicles began to deteriorate. The problems worsened in 1987 when it moved from Allentown to a new plant in South Carolina, to escape the United Auto Workers (UAW) union and high wages. However, after a legal battle the union won the right to represent the South Carolina workers. Then a lack of proper quality controls meant poorly finished vehicles quickly tarnished Mack's reputation. These factors, and a slump in US demand, prompted Renault to step in to protect its investment. It launched a takeover, assumed management control and sent Mr Pascual, a senior executive at RVI, to sort out the mess. He made a clean sweep of the company's top management, bringing a few senior French executives and hiring American ones from outside Mack's ingrown culture. Arguably his most important reform has been to implement a system for measuring and controlling quality. This is standard at most large industrial companies but at the old Mack, says Mr Pascual, 'the management didn't feel the need for quality tools because quality was given from God. 'When you have this frame of mind, you don't see things deteriorating.' The company has also negotiated with the UAW substantial changes in work rules - untouched since 1972 - to permit more flexible use of labour. And the number of employees has dropped by 16 per cent to 5,400 since the end of 1990. The result has been a dramatic improvement in productivity. Hours required to produce a truck have fallen about 35 per cent where the new techniques have been introduced. And the quality of vehicles has improved to the point where Mr Pascual can claim they are among the best in the industry. But none of this has translated into success in the market. Mack has seen its share of the North American heavy truck market drop from nearly 20 per cent at the start of the 1980s to around 11 per cent now. However, the company argues that this decline has been exaggerated by its reluctance to compete in the transport fleet market, where manufacturers have been winning orders through loss-leading discounts, and by the fact that the recession has hit hardest at markets important for Mack: construction and rubbish trucks in the north-eastern US. Mack aims at an 11.6 per cent market share this year, helped by well-received new models and engines and attempts to woo back customers. None of this means a rapid return to profits. For one thing, North America's heavy truck manufacturers - led by Navistar, Paccar and Daimler Benz's Freightliner, each with roughly 22 per cent of the market - are battling for market share at a time of weak demand. With at least twice as much manufacturing capacity as trucks sold, that spells slim profits for the strongest companies and heavy losses for the weakest. The reforms at Mack still have a long way to go. Productivity gains identified by the new management have to be pushed across the group followed by squeezing smaller improvements out of the system. Mack has too much manufacturing capacity - its plants operate at 40 per cent of their potential output. And it wants further concessions from the UAW which means some delicate manoeuvring next autumn, when the company begins negotiations over a new labour contract.

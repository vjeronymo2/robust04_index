			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Councils lack power of unions Company councils - the UK version of European works councils - are taken seriously only where they have some power, according to a survey from the independent employment analysts, Incomes Data Services. Although such councils are relatively rare, more than 100 UK multinationals will have to introduce them in the next few years under European legislation. Four of the six councils studied by IDS are non-union. IDS says councils tend to be most common in non-union companies, organisations undergoing widespread changes or wholly new enterprises such as Eurotunnel. At Northumbrian Water, Monarch and Pitney Bowes, the councils negotiate pay settlements; at Eurotunnel and Allied Colloids they discuss pay settlements, but have no power to negotiate, while at HP Bulmer pay remains the province of the unions. The councils tend to cover all manual and most white-collar employees. In most of the councils, employee representatives are elected by secret ballot. In some cases, the turnout in elections was close to 100 per cent. But if a council is not taken seriously by the employer, there will be a lack of interest among employees, leading to shortage of candidates for election. Company Councils IDS Study 561.

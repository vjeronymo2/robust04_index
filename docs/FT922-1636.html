			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (1): And now for the people - Since the 1950s, France's European policy has been determined by its Presidents. Now, for the first time, it is being put to a referendum, whose result will also be a judgment on the long reign of Francois Mitterrand THE French debate on the Treaty of Maastricht, which comes to a climax in the next few months, will be cathartic for France, and it should give new endorsement to the development of the European Community. But whatever its outcome, it is poetic justice that this French debate on Europe is taking place under the presidency of Francois Mitterrand. The debate will be cathartic because the French have long been ambivalent about Europe. From the beginning, French statesmen have always been in the forefront of the building of the Community; but other French statesmen have been among its fiercest opponents. Ambivalence is inherent in the clash between the nationalist and centralist legacy of French institutions and traditions, compared with the pluralist liberalism of the Community model; and it is manifest in the archetypal passions which set Socialists against Communists, Gaullists against Liberals. France has been part of the European Community for over 40 years; but this deep-seated ambivalence has still not been resolved. It has not been resolved, partly because it has never before been fully expressed. Public opinion polls have regularly shown consistently strong support for European integration; yet the paradox is that the French people have never before debated the implications of their European future as they are doing today. By the conventions of the Fifth Republic, the French public and the French parliament are expected to leave diplomacy and foreign policy to the President of the Republic; since Europe is treated as part of foreign policy, the electorate is not normally expected to say a word. In 1965, General de Gaulle carried his war against the Community to new heights, by walking out of the Brussels Council of Ministers; he was forced to think again after a setback in the Presidential election of December 1965; but he never offered a hint that he might need to seek parliamentary support for his belligerent policy to the Community. Today's debate on the Maastricht Treaty, in parliament and in the media, is by common consent the most intense debate on Europe that the French have ever conducted. Indeed, it might be truer to say that it is the only intense debate on Europe they conducted in the past 35 years. One would have to go back to the Rome Treaty in 1957, or even to the abortive project for a European Defence Community in 1954, for an event of comparable intensity. By contrast, the Single European Act of 1986, which laid the foundations for the Maastricht Treaty, and which was antagonistic to everything the Gaullist Party stood for, was ratified by the then Gaullist government without a murmur and almost without discussion. When the question is put, the French are likely to give a clear Yes to Maastricht. This is what the opinion polls have been saying, and this is what the leaders of most of the mainstream political parties will be campaigning for. The Communists, the extreme right-wing National Front, and the Greens will call for a No vote; but they do not command a majority in the country. By contrast, the Socialists, the Centrists and the centre-right UDF group will all call for a Yes; only the Gaullist party is still deeply split on Europe, but at the end of the day its leadership will probably call for a Yes. It is poetic justice that this referendum is taking place towards the end of the Presidency of Francois Mitterrand, because his deep commitment to European integration has been the most consistent theme in his long political career. Doubts have sometimes been expressed whether Mr Mitterrand is really a socialist, and if so in what sense; but his credentials as a committed pro-European are virtually never questioned, even by his adversaries; and when in the past, he has had to choose between 'socialism' and Europe, as in the spring of 1983, he has always chosen Europe. But this time, it is the French people who are being asked if they will choose Europe. If they do, they will confirm Francois Mitterrand's claim to a place in modern European history as one of the driving forces giving new impetus to the process of integration. France's Maastricht referendum will obviously be an inherently important turning-point for the future of European integration; it will also be a suitably elevated test of Mitterrand's reputation and political legacy. Because the political and international stakes are so high Maastricht is already starting to raise the level of political debate in France, as well as the calibre of President Mitterrand's public engagement. All politicians are conscious that the outcome of the referendum will be critically important for France and for Europe; they also know that the issues raised in this debate could have a decisive impact on the parliamentary election in March next year, as well as on the next Presidential election two years later. Most of the past year saw the government gripped in the doldrums of despair and disintegration. Once the Gulf War was out of the way, nothing went right for the regime. The President seemed to have lost his touch (but not his obstinacy) when he appointed Mrs Edith Cresson to the prime ministership; more and more members of the Socialist Party were tarnished by charges of financial corruption; the President and his Party were increasingly at loggerheads. The Party seemed to be sliding helplessly towards an annihilating defeat in the next general election; a treacherous chorus of voices began saying that the Party could only survive intact if the President resigned early. Even the President seemed at one stage to be aware that the domestic situation could become so unfavourable that he might have to consider early retirement. But that mood has now passed. The Maastricht referendum will enable President Mitterrand to face the electorate on an issue of high policy with a powerful and ambitious case to argue. If he secures a large Yes majority, the verdict may well boost his personal popularity, still at a desperately low ebb, as well as the election chances of his party. Conservative advocates of a Yes vote are determined to prevent the referendum from being turned into a personal plebiscite for President Mitterrand; they claim their decision to vote with President Mitterrand on Maastricht still leaves them entirely free to vote against him on other issues. But they know they cannot be sure of separating out the question from the questioner; they are compelled to campaign actively for Maastricht, just in case the electorate should vote personally against President Mitterrand. A year ago, when the government's rating was sinking to an all-time low, President Mitterrand promised a reform of the constitution, including a shortening of the seven-year term of the presidency. This constitutional project now seems to have faded from view. But it would be a pity if the growing excitement of the Maastricht controversy were to shut out the more modest case for a re-examination of the working of the constitution. In the depths of its political doldrums last year, some commentators suggested that France was afflicted by a deep sickness of the spirit. Of course, France was not sick; on the contrary, any casual observation would show that France is as well governed as its neighbours, and its economy better managed. On the other hand, it does seem that the French are increasingly sick of their political class. One factor is revulsion at repeated revelations of illicit party finance arrangements, mostly in the Socialist Party, and some of which have also involved personal corruption. A more general explanation, however, of which specific corruption is only one manifestation, lies in the constitution of the Fifth Republic, which gives too much power to the ruling party and far too much to the president, who is wholly unaccountable. This is a system where the tentacles of patronage and influence reach into every crevice of society, where the party of government is always tempted to abuse its power, and which in the end gives off a reek of pervasive corruption. Critics accuse the Mitterrand presidency of giving way to the self-important pretensions of a monarchical fin de regne, and some even insinuate that President Mitterrand has been continuously extending a politically decadent grasp while losing his intellectual grip. These added innuendoes are over the top and therefore miss the point. President Mitterrand is by now an elderly man. But those who under-estimated his strategic skills in the past often had cause to regret it, and the Maastricht process is likely to show that his faculties are as sharp as they have ever been. The central issue in this closing phase of President Mitterrand's presidency is not whether his successor will have noticeably shrewder judgment but whether the system gives him an unbalanced share of power.</p>

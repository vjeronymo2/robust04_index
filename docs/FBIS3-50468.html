			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with `Commander' Marcos, leader of the Indios </F> rebellion in Mexico, by "Gi. Pr." in San Cristobal; date not  given: "`It is Better To Die Fighting Rather Than Die of  Dysentery'" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction]    [Text] San Cristobal -- He was one of the few with his  face covered and armed with a machine gun. He was the only  non-Indios. As he spoke, he took a pipe out of his pocket and  slipped it into the opening of his balaclava. He expressed  himself clearly as an intellectual would when speaking to simple  people. He is definitely Mexican but his accent was  unrecognizable. A Japanese-eyed girl wearing a black balaclava  stood by his side during the entire interview.    [L'UNITA] Commander Marcos, you captured San Cristobal on 1  January. But who are you?    [Marcos] We are part of the Zapatist Liberation Army [name  as published] and we demand the resignation of the federal  government and the formation of a new transitional government  that will set August 1994 as the date for free and democratic  elections. We demand that the principal requests of the  peasants from Chiapas for bread, health, education, autonomy,  and peace, be resolved. The Indios have always been at war  because up to now the war was always waged against them, but now  it will be war for the Indios and the whites. In any case, they  will have the opportunity of dying fighting rather than of  diarrhea, the way the Indios from Chiapas normally die.    [L'UNITA] Have you any relations with peasant political  organizations?    [Marcos] We have no relations with any type of open  organization, our organization is solely an armed and  clandestine organization.    [L'UNITA] Have you sprung up out of nowhere, all of a  sudden?    [Marcos] We have been preparing ourselves in the mountains  for 10 years now. This movement is not improvised. We have  been maturing, thinking, learning, and we have reached this  decision.    [L'UNITA] Do your requests have a racial, ethnic  connotation?    [Marcos] The managing committee is made up of Tzotil,  Tzetal, Chol, Tojolabal, Mam, and Zoque Indios, the principal  ethnic groups in Chiapas. They all meet and in addition to  asking for democracy and representation, they ask for respect,  the respect that the whites have never given them. Primarily  here in San Cristobal, the whites [coletos] are very insulting  and discriminatory toward the Indios in everyday life. Now the  whites respect the Indios because they see them with weapons in  their hands.    [L'UNITA] What do you think the government's reaction will  be now?    [Marcos] The government's response does not worry us to the  same extent that the response of the people, the Mexicans, does.  We are interested in knowing what example this occurrence will  produce, what effect it will have on the nation's conscience.  We hope that something will happen, not only in terms of an  armed battle, but in every sense. We hope that this masked  dictatorship will end.    [L'UNITA] Do you not put your trust in the PRD [Democratic  Revolutionary Party] as an opposition party in the forthcoming  elections?    [Marcos] It is not so much in the political parties that we  have no faith as in the electoral system. The Salinas de  Gortari government is an illegitimate government, the result of  fraud, and this illegitimate government can only give rise to  illegitimate elections. We want a transitional government that  will call new elections but with a contest that is really fair  and equal, offering the same conditions to all the political  parties. In Chiapas 15,000 Indios die each year from diseases  that can be cured. This figure is similar to that caused by the  war in Salvador. Here, if a farmer with cholera goes to a field  hospital, they send him away to prevent people saying that there  is cholera in Chiapas. In this movement the Indios that are  part of the Zapatista army want to have talks with their own  people primarily. They are are the real interlocutors.    [L'UNITA] Excuse me, but you are not an Indios.    [Marcos] You must understand that our movement is not a  local Chiapas movement, but a movement that embraces the whole  country. So are the people, who come from other states, as I do.  There a people from Chiapas fighting in other places. We are  Mexicans and that is what unites us, together with our demand  for liberty and democracy. We want to elect our real  representatives.    [L'UNITA] But do you not fear strong repression now?    [Marcos] American Indians have been the vitims for  repression for 500 years. Perhaps you refer to the sort of  repression typical of South American regimes. Well, this South  American style of repression is the Indios' daily bread. Ask  the Indios living on the outskirts of San Cristobal.    [L'UNITA] What development would you consider successful?    [Marcos] We would like other movements from all over the  republic to join ours.    [L'UNITA] Must they be armed?    [Marcos] No, we are making a broad appeal: We are also  addressing people from civil, legal, open movements.    [L'UNITA] Why have you chosen 1 January and the city of San  Cristobal de Las Casas?    [Marcos] The managing committee made that decision. It is  clear that the date coincides with the TLC (free trade treaty),  which is a death sentence for the Indios. The coming into force  of the treaty represents the start of internationalized  destruction.    [L'UNITA] What do you think reaction abroad will be? Are  you not afraid that the United States may intervene as it has  done in other parts of Latin America?    [Marcos] Previously the United States used the excuse of the  Soviet Union; it feared Soviet infiltration in our country. But  now, what can it think of a movement that is only asking for  social justice? It can no longer think that we are being  manipulated by foreigners or that Moscow is funding us, since  Moscow does not exist any more: Ask Yeltsin. The Americans  must realize that we are fighting for what everybody wants, for  what the Europeans themselves wanted. Didn't the people in  Germany and Italy rebel against dictatorship? Is it therefore  unreasonable for the Mexican people to rebel as well? The North  Americans are much to blame for the situation that you can see,  the state of poverty of the Indios and their great hunger for  justice. The entire social system in Mexico is based on  injustice toward the Indios. The worst thing that can happen to  a human being is to be an Indios, with the heavy load of  humiliation, hunger, and poverty that he must bear.</p>

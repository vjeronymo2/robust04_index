			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / 'New dawn' for South Africa: Mandela hails disorganised but peaceful start to first all-race poll South Africa made a disorganised but largely peaceful start to democracy yesterday as citizens of all races voted together and as equals for the first time in the country's history. At special polling stations around the world, South Africans formed long queues, matched at home by lines of elderly and infirm 'special voters' for whom yesterday had been set aside. 'Today marks the dawn of our freedom,' said Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress and almost certain successor to state president F. W. de Klerk. Mr Mandela urged all South Africans to go to the polls and help in the birth of a new South Africa: 'Today is a day like no other before it.' At midnight last night, the blue, white and orange flag of the old South Africa was ceremonially lowered around the country for the last time, closing an era of white domination that began in 1652. As the new flag fluttered aloft, choirs in Cape Town, Johannesburg and other regional centres sang the moving hymn of African nationalism, Nkosi Sikele i'Afrika (God bless Africa). Although voters gathered outside stations well before the opening time of 7am some had to stand for hours. Ballot papers were delivered late, there were shortages of polling officers and the voting process to select candidates for both the country's national assembly and nine provincial legislatures was cumbersome. At some stations, the closing time of 7pm was extended. With 22.3m eligible voters, the high turnout expected today coupled with yesterday's difficulties may mean that voting, scheduled to end tomorrow night, may have to continue on Friday. Results are due to start being released from Friday morning unless polling is extended. The ANC complained that several voting stations in the Transkei and Orange Free State had opened late or stayed closed for the day, and accused officials of the Inkatha Freedom party of intimidating voters. However, Mr Pallo Jordan, ANC information head, said he saw no need for any annulment of results and was confident that the Independent Electoral Commission, responsible for organising the poll, would be able to address the 'teething problems'. The IEC's vice-chairman, Mr Dikgang Moseneke, conceded that the commission had 'hopelessly underestimated' the problems. The IFP - which decided only eight days ago to participate in the elections  -said many ballots were without the sticker carrying the party's logo and photograph of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, its leader, which is supposed to have been fixed to the bottom of the paper. 'It savours of sabotage,' said Chief Buthelezi, who said he had requested that the IEC allow for an extra 'two or three days' of voting. Any ballot without the IFP sticker will be counted as a spoiled ballot, according to IFP officials. The electoral commission intends, however, to exempt from that requirement those who voted outside the country. Mr Mandela, due to cast his vote today in Natal, dismissed fears that the rash of recent bombings might hamper the polling. He said the full force of state intimidation had never stopped the struggle for freedom. No serious incidents of violence were reported as more than 100,000 soldiers, police and reservists were deployed in and around 9,000 polling centres. Bomb blasts since Sunday have killed at least 21 people and injured over 160 in attacks attributed to extreme right-wingers.

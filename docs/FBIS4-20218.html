			<p>BFN     [Text] Nuremberg (DPA) -- The city of Nuremberg has banned  an election campaign rally of the radical right-wing  Republikaner. Two counterdemonstrations in the city center,  which had also been registered for Saturday [30 April], have  also been prohibited. Directives to this effect were issued by  the city's public order office on Tuesday, on the instructions  of Nuremberg Mayor Peter Schoenlein (of the Social Democratic  Party of Germany). Schoenlein argued that the planned rally on  the eve of 1 May was more and more becoming an "explosive danger  for the city's internal security and its good reputation," since  one had to expect the rally to take a violence course.</p>

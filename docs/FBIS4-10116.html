			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Federico Storani, Chamber of Deputies </F> Foreign Relations Committee deputy chairman, by Eugenio Andrea  Bruno; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] He is a national deputy. He has been elected to  Congress for three terms. He is an expert on international  economic relations for the opposition. "In my opinion, the  pressure exerted by U.S. Ambassadors Terence Todman and James  Cheek and Vice President Al Gore to approve the patents law  represents a lack of respect," he told LA PRENSA.    The former UCR [Radical Civic Union] National Committee  executive board international relations secretary believes in  Mercosur [Common Market of the South] because "this market is  our natural space, and it is the market we must work for."    He is very much against the idea of Argentina joining NAFTA:    "Argentina's election as a probable NAFTA member was  presented as an achievement. From the political point of view  the event might have some significance, but from the economic  point of view it has no meaning at all. At this time our two  countries' trade exchange is minimal. Besides, it is largely  favorable to the United States," Storani said.    The Radical Party legislator did not like the U.S. Embassy's  repeated requests to speed up the approval of a pharmaceutical  patents law. "I think the pressure exerted by former Ambassador  Terence Todman, who is returning home, as well as by current  Ambassador James Cheek and Vice President Al Gore is totally  negative. They publicly placed the need to approve a patents law  in accordance with U.S. companies' interests as a basic  condition. Mr. Carter [not further identified] said the same  thing to President Carlos Menem in Chile much more brutally. The  least Menem should have done, considering the insolence of this  second-class official who was addressing a head of state, is to  put him in his place."    Storani, however, assured us that he has "always supported  the need to change the law, but protecting our interests and  without encouraging the monopoly of foreign laboratories, which  has had fateful consequences in other countries."    "In some cases it is a matter of justice to give something  to  the inventor. But this gratification should be granted within  the framework of a broad health policy," Storani said. "We also  must take into account the interests of local laboratories,  which are not simply pirates stealing foreign technology."    [Bruno] But returning to NAFTA, the government says the  national economic interest requires...    [Storani, interrupting] Our economic interests are  absolutely  insignificant. They might be potentially important, but we will  see that later.    For instance, U.S. producers still receive subsidies, and  this is unfair competition affecting Argentine producers.    I have the impression that nothing is clear from an economic  viewpoint, and I insist our bilateral trade is grossly tilted in  favor of the United States. Besides, our exports cannot  diversify, and we cannot sell them more manufactured products.    [Bruno] Are NAFTA and Mercosur compatible?    [Storani] I visited the United States recently. Every single  official I talked to said NAFTA and Mercosur are incompatible.  Therefore, what [Foreign Minister Guido] Di Tella said about  compatibility is incongruous.    [Bruno] Let us suppose they really are incompatible, and we  have to choose between one or the other. Which one do you think  the government would chose?    [Storani] If this trend of carnal relations continues, I  think the government will chose NAFTA, even though we do not  have any economic interest at stake.    My position is that our natural space is Mercosur. The fact  that today we have economic differences with Brazil does not  mean we must leave that path.    I would like to participate in both markets, if possible,  and  even work for what George Bush proposed in the Americas  Initiative.    [Bruno] What is your opinion on the issue of a common  external tariff system between Brazil and Argentina?    [Storani] The unification of our different systems is a step  in the right direction, without a doubt. But I think the  Argentine Government is overacting on the issue of deadlines. We  need a gradual process of economic compatibility before our  tariff systems can be unified. Instead of establishing  deadlines, the government should have established conditions and  guidelines.    Regarding relations with Brazil, I think first we must look  at the development of the process of economic reforms, make our  economies compatible, and eliminate our differences.    Then we make evaluate progress in these areas and move  forward toward unifying our tariff systems. [passage omitted]</p>

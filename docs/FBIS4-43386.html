			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jacques Isnard: "A Senate Report Stresses </F> France's Difficulty in Deploying Its Long-Range Intervention  Forces"]    [Excerpts] In a report, the Senate, which discusses the  Military Programming Law on 14 and 15 June, notes that there is  a discrepancy between the government's political desire to give  France powerful "rapid deployment" forces and the resources it  has allocated to this plan. According to Jacques Genton  (Centrist Union sentor for le Cher), the report's author who  approves the programming law's broad outlines, this ambition  will nonetheless be difficult to achieve in view of the  inadequacy of the budget.    France's decision to form units -- on the scale of three  divisions -- which can be rapidly "deployed" over a long  distance is an objective which is deemed "particularly ambitious  and difficult to achieve" by the senators. This assessment,  shared by many other deputies, is featured in a 300-page report  commissioned by the Senate's foreign affairs and defense  committees, which Genton focuses on the Military Programming  Law which the Senate is debatting from Tuesday 14 to Thursday 16  June.    Both the defense white paper and the draft 1995-2000  Military  Programming Law suggest the creation of interservice units known  as "rapid deployment" forces, to deal with a series of scenarios  for French military involvement overseas. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Between 120,000 and 130,000 Men </H5>   The author of the Senate report notes that, according to  current estimates, "the requirements in available rapid  deployment forces have been assessed at between 120,000 and  130,000 men, which seems to be a particularly ambitious  objective and one which is difficult to achieve," because the  aim is to have, in all, between two and three divisions  "combining heavy resources, light resources, powerful air-mobile  resources, and deep and accurate fire." France has learned the  lessons of the Gulf War, when it had difficulty forming a  division of some 15,000 men. However, the shortfall in  equipment is far from having being resolved by the new Military  Program Law submitted to Parliament.    Mr. Genton gives some examples of this in his report, which,  however, welcomes the fact that the existing government has  pledged to halt, as of 1995, the slow erosion in funds allocated  to defense over the past 10 years or so.    First, the Army: In future it will only have eight divisions  out of the 15 which it still had in 1981; its stock of armored  vehicles will fall to 650 Leclerc tanks instead of 1,000 AMX-30  tanks; its battle helicopters will ultimately consist of 215  Tigre helicopters, compared with 340 Gazelle helicopters at  present, and its level of professionalization -- which is also  reflected in the number of officers or junior officers compared  with the conscript forces -- is much lower than that of the  allied armed forces.    Second, the Air Force: It will fall to 380 fighter planes,  instead of the 450 of previous years, and it is not due to have  its first six Rafale planes until the year 2001; its logistical  transport capabilities remain modest and it lacks in-flight  refueling planes; the reduction in its manpower between 1981 and  1991 has affected career staff (down 4,554) more than the draft  (down 3,012).    Finally, the Navy: In addition to the reduction in the  number of ships, which has gone from 150 in 1985 to 115 in 1994  and probably to 103 in the year 2004, there is the gradual aging  of the fleet, which should reach an average age of 18 years in  the year 2005; it is short of officers (between 5 and 6 percent)  considering the increase in its missions.    In these conditions, Mr. Genton thinks that the prime  minister and his defense minister are right to "resist the  temptation to launch new programs," with the exception of a  project for a missile fired with accuracy over a long range, and  to "continue the existing equipment programs," for which large  amounts of funds had already been spent. He nonetheless  expresses his anxiety about the idea that the funding of  research, which is the guarantee for the future, is suffering  the "repercussions" of the financial effort devoted to  operational equipment.    Aside from this observation, it is a fact that the military  program includes the postponment of a number of initiatives  until after 1997, because of the current financial constraints.  This is particularly true of the Navy, which is still the main  "vector" of a long-range action policy, with the postponement of  any decision on a second aircraft carrier, on the NH-90  logistical helicopter, and on the need to have three of four new  landing craft transporters.</p>

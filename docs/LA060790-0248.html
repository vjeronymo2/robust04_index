			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THIS YEAR, SINGBANDITH GOT DOWN TO BUSINESS;  </P> <P> BOYS' TRACK: MAGNOLIA TRIPLE JUMPER EARNS A SHOE BOX FULL OF MEDALS, AND A  COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP.  </P> <P> As a junior last year, Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia High School approached  the triple jump from a purely athletic point of view: Work hard, improve and  help the team get some points.  </P> <P> This year, Singbandith, The Times' Orange County athlete of the year in boys'  track and field, mixed in a little business savvy. Singbandith wanted more than  a shoe box full of medals and plaques by season's end. He wanted a college  scholarship.  </P> <P> As it turned out, he got both.  </P> <P> On April 22, two weeks after he jumped a then national-leading 51 feet 3/4  inches at the Arcadia Invitational, Singbandith signed a letter of intent with  Nebraska.  </P> <P> "I think once he hit 50 feet (early in the season) he stopped jumping for  rah-rah-sis-boom-bah and he started jumping for dollars in college," Magnolia  Coach Bob Mangan said. "Once he saw he could parlay his jumping into a college  ride, he became more serious, and those around him became more serious, too."  </P> <P> Mangan and assistant coach Al Wallin were cautious in their plans for  Singbandith this year, sometimes keeping him out of league meets if the points  weren't needed and having him make all-out efforts only at the most important  competitions.  </P> <P> Last year, their standout athlete spent most of the season dealing with various  injuries, some of them the result of playing on the school's basketball team.  </P> <P> "Phouphet would go in (the game), and I would literally cringe," Mangan said  last year. "I would just sit there, hoping he wouldn't twist another ankle."  </P> <P> Add that to a knee injury from the high jump, and Singbandith wasn't looking  too well going into last year's state meet.  </P> <P> "From the Orange County Championships on, Phouphet was one jump away from  ending his season, we felt," Mangan said. "I mean, his knee was wrapped, his  ankle was taped, he limped. . . . I'd sit in the stands and my stomach would  just churn. Even though he made it to the state meet, I did not enjoy last  season at all."  </P> <P> This year, of course, has been most enjoyable for the Singbandith camp. Not  only did he secure a full scholarship and avoid injuries, he also was  undefeated, winning the state title June 2 with the second-best leap in the  nation this year, 51-7 3/4. The nation's best is 52-0, set by Erick Walder of  Mobile, Ala.  </P> <P> That mark would have placed Singbandith 10th in the NCAA Division I triple jump  final, also held June 2.  </P> <P> Although Singbandith, a native of Laos, signed with Nebraska without visiting  the campus, he and his mother, Pany, talked it over and decided it was the  right place.  </P> <P> "My mother didn't want me to go (to college) in L.A. She said there were too  many gangs and too many bad things going on there," Singbandith said. "I think  Nebraska sounds good. But I've never been there."  </P> <P> Singbandith, who hasn't flown since he and his family immigrated to the United  States 10 years ago, will take a trip to Lincoln next month with Mangan. Mangan  already has helped him choose a dormitory, "one that's upwind from the  animals," Mangan said.  </P> <P> "Suddenly what's in front of him is very unclear -- it's exciting for him,"  Mangan said. "Nebraska is not Southern California, but neither is Laos. He's  made one transition, so he can make another."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALL-COUNTY BOYS' TRACK TEAM  </P> <P> Event: 100 Meters  </P> <P> Player, School: Tim Martin, San Clemente  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> Mark: 10.68  </P> <P> Fifth in the state 100-meter final, three spots ahead of county rival Erik  Mitchell  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: 200 Meters  </P> <P> Player, School: Erik Mitchell, Los Alamitos  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Mark: 21.34  </P> <P> Won the 200 at Mt.

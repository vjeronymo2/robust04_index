			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists bids Pounds 6.2m for Ayrshire Pharm LLOYDS Chemists, which recently took control of rival Macarthy via a Pounds 92.5m bid, has made a Pounds 6.2m share offer for Ayrshire Pharmaceuticals. Ayrshire operates 14 chemist shops, two drugstores and a pharmaceutical wholesaling business in Scotland. The offer involves Lloyds issuing 1.72m new shares, 1.5 per cent of the present total. Lloyds shares fell 5p to 360p. Holders of 51.3 per cent of Ayrshire's ordinary shares have given irrevocable undertakings to accept. Lloyds said it planned to use Ayrshire's 28,000 sq ft warehouse and office in Kilmarnock as the nucleus for its distribution and wholesaling activities in Scotland. The acquisition of Macarthy brought Lloyds the Savory &amp; Moore chain which has shops in Scotland.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Leading Article: A resumption of history When leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation gather for their summit in Brussels next Monday, they will have to work hard to make up for lost time. Four years have passed since the end of the cold war division of Europe. In that time, an important part of the former Soviet bloc has made giant strides towards democracy and market reform, while another part has slid towards fragmentation, political demagoguery and civil strife. Yet the western alliance has thus far seemed curiously unequal to the challenges and opportunities thrown up by the rapidly changing map of Europe. The Brussels meeting offers an opportunity to begin the task of renewing Nato's sense of purpose. The leaders need to map out a strategy both to consolidate the advances of the last four years and to guard against possible dangers in the future. If they fail, they will be condemning eastern Europe to a security vacuum that could easily invite a resumption of old European power games. The spectre at the summit is Russia, and in particular the strong showing in its recent parliamentary elections by the neo-fascist party of Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Is President Boris Yeltsin now strong enough to pursue economic reforms that will offer tangible benefits by the next presidential election? Or will he continue to mark time, and thus condemn himself to fail? The countries of central Europe - most clamorously Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics and Hungary - are too anxious to wait for the answer. Fearful of a reawakened Russian imperial urge, they want Nato to give them immediate membership and extend to them its security guarantee. So far, Nato has prevaricated, offering all the countries of the former Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact uniform and much looser association accords - first in the so-called North Atlantic Co-operation Council, now in a not dissimilar arrangement which President Bill Clinton has christened 'Partnership for Peace'. Buy time The prevarication is understandable. It is based in part on Mr Clinton's no doubt correct calculation that Congress would baulk at any precipitate move to extend the US defence umbrella to the east. It seeks to buy time while Nato and its would-be new entrants think hard about the scope of the alliance, and while events in Russia take their course. And it is an attempt to duck the awkward questions - how far east? what about the Baltics? what about Ukraine? - that the task of selecting new Nato members would throw up. None of these matters can be taken lightly. Nato could do nothing worse than extend its security guarantee without the ability to implement it if necessary. Nor is membership a panacea for central Europe, whose short to medium-term fortunes depend more on being able to trade freely with the west than on sheltering under Nato's nuclear umbrella. But prevarication is still not enough. What is needed is a more hard-headed assessment of the prospects for success in Russia and the broader consequences of failure. What is needed, too, is a more differentiated approach to Nato's eastern supplicants: one that offers countries that fit the bill a real prospect of joining when the time is right. Great opportunity Without such an approach, Nato will be a contradiction in terms: in effect telling the east Europeans they have little to fear from Russia, while insisting on its own continued need for collective protection against a Russian threat. It will also be missing the greatest opportunity since the second world war to consolidate and enlarge the realm of freedom in Europe. Certainly, a reforming Russia is still the main prize. If Mr Yeltsin allows a market economy and democracy to take root, then European security will be assured, and in the long term Nato will not need to exist. And it remains possible that he will succeed. Mr Zhirinovsky's forces are still outnumbered by pro-reform parties. So the west should focus its efforts on convincing Mr Yeltsin that continued reform is his only hope, and on helping to shore up other forces that sup-port it. This has a bearing on current Nato policy. For it is clear that an immediate offer of membership for the central European countries would be seen in Russia as a devastating rebuff for those who favour closer ties with the west, and a commensurate boost for the xenophobes. It would be unfortunate if in extending its guarantee against a possible Russian threat, Nato helped create a self-fulfilling prophecy. A sensible approach for Nato would lie somewhere between the woolly 'Partnerships for Peace' proposal and immediate central European membership. It would involve a reaffirmation of Nato's desire to intensify military co-operation with Russia; a clear statement of the criteria for membership (fully democratic political system, market economy, wide support for both among the populace); and confirmation that the alliance will at some point in the future be open to new members in central and eastern Europe. Finally, it would entail a solemn proclamation that Nato will make contingency plans to admit those applicants that meet the criteria immediately in the event that the nightmare of an expansionist Russia were to return. That way, the alliance would be working for the best, while simultaneously preparing for the worst.</p>

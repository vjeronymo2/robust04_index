			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Family life at top of managers' agenda FAMILY life, education and the environment are the most important items on the agenda of international managers, according to a survey of 12,000 men and women in 25 countries to be published by the Harvard Business Review, writes Simon Holberton. Far from being breast-beating free traders, managers show themselves to be economic chauvinists despite working for multinational companies. Managers in several countries say they favour legislation supporting local interests, although those in Japan display a stronger endorsement of free trade than most. Ms Rosabeth Moss Kanter, editor of the HBR and author of an article analysing the survey, says: 'The ideal of a global village where a common culture of management unifies business practice is still more a dream than a reality.' The typical senior manager, a male, is in his early 40s, married and bilingual. He is employed by an established but private-owned company employing several thousand people at home and abroad. He is more concerned about customer service, product quality, workforce skills and technology than he is about macroeconomic and political issues. He is sure that trade rules, government policies, currency risks and capital availability are neither significant success factors for his business nor significant worries. He is strongly in favour of work-site child care and is concerned about the quality of education. He believes that business has a significant role to play in improving education.

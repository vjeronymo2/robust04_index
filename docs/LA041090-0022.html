			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAY OPENS IN SUN, ENDS IN CHILL;  </P> <P> GRIFFEY'S HOME RUN LEAVES ANGELS IN COLD  </P> <P> The Angels expected to have more than five hits in their season opener Monday  night.  </P> <P> Bert Blyleven didn't expect the one-and-one fastball he threw to Ken Griffey  Jr. in the fifth inning to stay more outside than inside on the 20-year-old  outfielder, who turned it into a three-run home run.  </P> <P> But losing their home opener didn't create agony among the Angels.  </P> <P> Regret, maybe. Disappointment, certainly. But concern? Hardly. It's far too  early to worry.  </P> <P> Isn't it?  </P> <P> "No, we're going to panic and go home," Manager Doug Rader said with a serious  expression, before laughing at his own joke. "C'mon. Last year we lost our  first game of the season to the White Sox, and we won 91. Maybe it's an omen."  </P> <P> Their offensive production in a 7-4 loss to the Seattle Mariners looked more  like a repeat of last season than a peek at the future. Starter Brian Holman,  one of three players the Mariners acquired from Montreal last season for Mark  Langston -- who later signed with the Angels -- gave up three hits in five  innings before 38,406 at Anaheim Stadium. Blyleven, making his 12th opening-day  start, had only one rocky inning, but the Mariners made the most of it to score  five runs.  </P> <P> "Nobody wants to start out the way I did," Blyleven said. "We scored four runs,  and that should be enough for me to win. Everybody wants to win the opener. I'm  just sorry I didn't perform in the fifth inning.  </P> <P> "But, hey, we've got 161 more. One sixty-one and one wouldn't be a bad record."  </P> <P> His record is 0-1 because of Griffey's 365-foot shot over the wall in right  field. Blyleven had gotten through the first four innings unscathed, giving up  only two singles. And he might have escaped the fifth with little damage had  third baseman Rick Schu been able to start a double play on Brian Giles'  one-out grounder instead of only a force at second.  </P> <P> Pete O'Brien led off the fifth with a double to right field, moved to third on  Greg Briley's grounder and scored on Edgar Martinez's single to left. Dave  Valle sent a bouncer under Mark McLemore's glove for another single, sending  Martinez to third and bringing up Giles, who started at shortstop because of  injuries to Omar Vizquel and Mario Diaz. Schu corraled Giles' grounder, but not  deftly enough to get the double play.  </P> <P> "It hit the heel of my glove and bounced out," Schu said. "If I come up  cleanly, it's a double-play ball."  </P> <P> The Mariners exploited that gift, when Harold Reynolds singled to center and  Griffey pounded Blyleven's fastball over the fence.  </P> <P> "The fifth inning was a tough inning. I just got the ball up a little bit,"  Blyleven said. "I'm not happy with the way I pitched, but I felt good. I just  made a pitch to Griffey that was inside, and I didn't get it as inside as I  wanted and he hit the heck out of it . . . it was the same pitch I struck him  out on (in the fourth inning), maybe a little bit higher. I planned to go  through the fifth one-two-three. I didn't plan to give up 12 hits and five  runs."  </P> <P> He gave up seven hits, not 12. "It only seemed that way," he said. But the  Mariners got to five Angel pitchers for 15 hits, four by Griffey and three by  Valle.  </P> <P> The big fifth erased a 2-0 lead the Angels had built on Johnny Ray's  first-inning home run and his sacrifice fly in the third, set up by a single by  Schu and walks to Mark McLemore and Devon White.  </P> <P> "They had some two-out RBIs and we didn't," Rader said. "We had some  opportunities with two out and didn't capitalize, and that was the ballgame.  </P> <P> "A number of people on this ballclub are not anywhere near operating level.  We're emphasizing patience and understanding. I believe in these people because  this is a very good ballclub."  </P> <P> Griffey, who was enjoying a spectacular rookie season last year until he broke  a bone in his left hand, had an unsettling day before he unsettled the Angels.  </P> <P> "I had butterflies this morning and threw up once in the hotel right before I  came to the stadium," he said. "Last year, I didn't know what to expect, so I  couldn't be scared or nervous. This year, I know what to expect, and that made  me nervous. I don't know why. Those feelings went away after the first pitch,  the first at-bat. It was time to play ball."  </P> <P> The Angels weren't perturbed about losing their first game.  </P> <P> "There's still 161 left. It's too early for us to be troubled or for anybody to  think anything's wrong," said Willie Fraser, who yielded three hits and two  runs in relief of Blyleven in the sixth inning. "I don't know if the hitters  are ahead of the pitchers: Nolan Ryan went out today and threw five innings and  didn't give up a hit. It'll all even out in a couple of weeks. At least, I hope  it does for me."  </P> <P> McLemore believes things will even out sooner than a couple of weeks.  </P> <P> "The first game's nothing to worry about," he said. "A game like tonight, you  just look at the positives. We played good defense, but we didn't capitalize on  some chances . . . It's only been one game. It's a long season."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> The Angels' lineup contained two slight surprises -- right-handed hitter Rick  Schu starting at third against a right-handed pitcher instead of switch-hitter  Donnie Hill -- and Mark McLemore hitting ninth. Devon White was the leadoff  hitter early in the spring and McLemore had occupied that spot for most of the  later games.  </P> <P> Manager Doug Rader is determined to make a leadoff hitter out of White, who has  speed to create havoc when he reaches base but struck out 129 times and walked  44 times last season. "Hitting first helps him refine the skills he needs to  incorporate in his swing, and that's why he's hitting there," Rader said.  </P> <P> Injuries dictated that Chili Davis (sore groin) would be restricted to a  designated hitter role instead of playing in left field, and that Dante  Bichette would play left. Brian Downing's continued problems with sore rib  muscles also kept him from being the DH. Schu won out over Hill because of his  experience at third.  </P> <P> "The way (Schu) is swinging the bat right now, number one, and number two, his  background is third base and I just thought it would be a little bit easier  assignment for him today," Rader said. "Regarding Brian and Chili, the factors  were how proficient Chili would have been defensively with the groin and how  well Dante is swinging the bat. Brian is not 100 percent."  </P> <P> Rader said he felt "some butterflies and excitement" about opening day, adding  that "what I always want to do is get it over with and get into the grind of  the season where you get numb. Numbness usually takes two or three weeks into  the season . . . I'd rather be a little more calm and analytical than be caught  up in the excitement of opening day."  </P> <P> His Mariner counterpart, Jim Lefebvre, recalled his first opening day, as a  Dodger in 1965.  </P> <P> "Opening day is always special," he said. "We won the game. (Don) Drysdale  pitched. I popped up to the catcher four times, but who cared? It was opening  day and I was a Dodger."  </P> <P> As recognition for making the team, Schu -- who had worn uniform number 60 in  spring training -- was given the more conventional number 20. It was the number  of the man he unsuccessfully tried to replace in the hearts of Philadelphia  Phillie fans: Mike Schmidt.  </P> <P> "I was always a big fan of his," Schu said. "I couldn't get the number when I  was over there. I didn't care what number I got here, just as long as I was  here." Hill also got a new number -- 22, instead of the 52 he sported in spring  training.  </P></p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Alpha Airports valued at Pounds 211m in flotation Alpha Airports Group, now trading as the airport services division of Forte, finalised its flotation yesterday, pricing its shares at 140p to produce a market capitalisation of Pounds 211.1m. Forte will retain a 25 per cent stake in the company. A total of 113.09m ordinary shares are being placed. Half will be firmly placed with institutions, while the remaining 25 per cent (39.58m shares) will be subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. Mr Rocco Forte, Forte chairman, said he believed the flotation would provide a firm base for the long term development of Alpha. The Pounds 177.4m proceeds would be used to reduce Forte's borrowings and would enable it 'to continue the development of our core hotel and restaurant businesses'. The total value of the flotation to Forte, including Alpha's assumption of total debts of Pounds 30m, is Pounds 241m. Mr Paul Harrison, chief executive of Alpha, said the flotation would provide the new company with a springboard for further development. He is expecting to announce at least two flight catering joint ventures in the coming year. Earlier this month Alpha forecast a 19 per cent rise in operating profits for the year to January 31 to Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 17.3m) on turnover of Pounds 423.1m (Pounds 404.5m). Alpha's business is divided almost equally between catering for airlines and retail trading at airports. It expects profits of Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 13.1m) from the catering side on turnover of Pounds 210.1m (Pounds 197.5m). The retail side's turnover is expected to be Pounds 213m (Pounds 207m) with operating profits of Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 4.2m). Pro forma earnings per share are 8.75p, giving a p/e of 16. Notional dividend is 4.03p for a gross yield of 3.6 per cent. UBS are sponsors to the flotation. COMMENT Alpha is two distinct businesses that happen to operate at airports. The flight catering side looks set for continuing growth alongside increased international travel. It can also be argued that the consolidation of the airline industry will favour larger caterers. On the other hand, increased competition between airlines could lead to economies on catering. The retail side, much less profitable, needs to find a way forward when duty free shopping is due to end in the EU in 1999. With the City expecting earnings to grow to about 10p a share in the coming year, the price looks pitched about right both for Forte and potential investors. See Lex</p>

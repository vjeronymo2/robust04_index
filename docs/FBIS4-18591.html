			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From DDP/ADN's "Wirtschaftsdienst-Ost" economic service] </F>   [Text] Budapest (ADN) -- Bavarian Minister-President Edmund  Stoiber has urged partial membership of the European Union (EU)  for the Visegrad states -- Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic,  and Slovakia. Speaking at a news conference in Budapest at the  end of his visit to Hungary yesterday, Stoiber said the eastward  expansion of the EU is of fundamental importance. On this issue  he is in "relatively close agreement" with German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl, who also spoke of a special relationship with the  Visegrad countries. As a result in particular of the wave of  migration from East Europe, the increase in organized crime, and  a common asylum policy, these states should already have a place  at the table of the Twelve, or eventually the Sixteen.    Stoiber arrived in Budapest with a delegation of leading  Bavarian economic representatives yesterday morning. He  conferred with Prime Minister Peter Boross, Defense Minister  Lajos Fur, and Finance Minister Ivan Szabo. He also met with  President Arpad Goncz and with Gabor Kuncze, the Alliance of  Free Democrats candidate for the post of prime minister.</p>

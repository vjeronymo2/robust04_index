He said what the government has done is to finetune  the structural adjustment program to meet the needs of society,  particularly in the area of job creation, increasing capital  utilization, and in food production. This was in a message he  sent to the opening of the 16th Kaduna International Trade Fair.  State House correspondent Mohammed Labo reports:    [Begin recording] The head of state's message was presented  by the chief of general staff, Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya.  Specifically, the head of state explained that the fixing of  interest rates at between 12 and 15 percent, lending rate at 21  percent, and the exchange rate of the naira at 22 naira to the  dollar was the rational and patriotic decision to (?safeguard)  genuine economic activity. [passage omitted]    He said the objective of the 1994 budget is the creation of  a  favorable climate for economic revival and a conducive  atmosphere for investment, as well as increased capital  utilization of the manufacturing sector. He appealed to the  private sector to demonstrate a high sense of sincere commitment  to the development of the country by responding appropriately to  the policies. The head of state assured all investors of the  security of their investment and specifically to the foreign  investors the opportunity to repatriate returns on their  investment. He also solicited the assistance of the private  sector in monitoring the implementation of the budget which, he  said, is a cooperative affair, and charged sector to shout aloud  whenever there is a serious deviation on the part of the  government or its agencies.    The minister of commerce and tourism, Chief Melford Okilo,  unfolded a number of plans by his ministry to stimulate economic  recovery and development. They include setting up of a  Commodity Exchange Market, Comex, to give information on the  availability of markets and prices of primary products, the  promotion of nonoil exports, completion of the export processing  zone in Calabar, and the establishment of a trade malpractices  tribunal to handle cases of trade complaints which tarnish the  image of the country.

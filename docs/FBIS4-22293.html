			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Solih: "Toward Clarity"] </F>   [Text] Every day you read, hear or see various types of  information in the newspapers or on radio or television and you  draw conclusions about the life of the republic.    It is possible that my essay today will make a small  addition  to these conclusions you have drawn.    It is not possible to show political activity in Uzbekistan  today. In the street, the home, at the workplace -- everywhere  there are spies, every day there are new intrigues, new  investigations, new crimes, new punishments.    Together with everybody else, I have not remained without  sin. They have accused me of attempting to overthrow the state.    Let me briefly explain the situation: in the Summer of 1992  a  group of activists decided a public organization called  "National Assembly" in order to help Parliament in pushing  through laws. I was informed about this, but I said that the Erk  Party would not join this organization. They accused me of being  among the members of an organization which had still not been  organized. We were eight people intending to overthrow the  state. At the same time, the "National Assembly" plan had been  sent to the President in order to provide him with advice.    Now, do you imagine that men planning to overthrow the state  would send their plans to the man standing at the head of the  state? What would they say, "Respected president, we intend to  overthrow the state, here is some advice?"    Procurator Jorayev himself exposed to the entire world in  the  11 August issue of KHALQ SOZI newspaper that the accusation  which was made was meaningless. Jorayev wrote: "The National  Assembly program is known to all; it consists of generalities  taken from other sources and there is nothing new in it."    If the words in the "National Assembly" program -- the basic  documentation of the crime which was committed -- are words  known to everyone, and if this were not sufficient, if they were  general words taken from other sources and if there is nothing  new in them, what is the crime in this program?    Praise be to Jorayev: through the shrewdness of his words,  he  condemned the political order in Uzbekistan. But not even a  lawyer like Jorayev can revive the complete innocence of the  activists of the "National Assembly."    All of Uzbekistan was amused for days by this.    But our hope is in the future. Those striving to bring this  hope to life exist in Uzbekistan. Let me inform you briefly  about one of the components of these forces, the Erk Party.    The Erk Party is an opposition party. Why is an opposition  necessary?    First, an opposition is necessary in the capacity of a  helper, an advisor to the existing government in the urgent  political and economic questions in the republic. In addition,  the opposition is needed to control the rule of the party or  group that has gone to the pinnacle of the state. Thus, the  rulers should not become angry, nor should they view the people  as their own property.    Control by the opposition is completely different that  control by state organs -- this control is the control by  political forces, in the broadest sense, by social forces, which  are not in the government.    If the opposition party makes the people understand its  program in an election and this party comes into government; the  defeated party leaves th government and becomes the opposition  itself. And that is all it is.    This rule is a daily rule in the Western states. In these  states, no government would hasten to cut down the opposition as  quickly as Uzbekistan's government.    For three years, the Erk Party is a party that has survived  by evading the axe.    If this party came to government, what would it give the  people? Various people have asked me this question under various  conditions. Unfortunately, I have had slight opportunity to  answer it.    In Uzbekistan the majority of people are not familiar with  the Erk program. The government says that the people should  neither know nor hear about this program and, to a certain  extent, it has attained its goal.    Permission to print the economic program of the Erk Party in  the newspaper ERK, which is its own newspaper, has not been  granted because if the program is published the government could  not make the claim that "the opposition has no program."    If the program were published in the newspaper, proponents  of  Erk would increase and would become dangerous to the government.    According to the economic views of the Erk Party, I would  appeal first to the peasants: If Erk comes into the government,  it would not take anything out of your pockets but would  probably give you your own property. Then you would not stare at  the chairman when he tells you how much of our cotton the state  will take, but you would sell the cotton at the price you want.  At that time the chairman would not tell you and your  grandfather what to do because not only the cotton, but also the  land would be yours.    An Erk Party government would begin privatizing land bit by  bit. This means that it would be leased; profitable lands would  be the first to be leased; that is to say, these lands would be  given to the leaseholder in perpetuity.    At the same time, all kolkhoz lands would be converted into  the form of full leases and these, in the course of two of three  years based on the income taken out of them, would be turned  over to the leaseholders as private property.    As for the revived kolkhoz itself, if society benefits from  it, it is possible that it would survive on an equal basis with  private enterprises. But, we would have to see, because today  there is no kolkhoz which is not in debt to the state: for this  reason, the Erk Party thinks that the kolkhoz system has no  future.    It is possible that the privatization movement will not take  one-two years, but longer because before enterprises can take on  a new form it will be necessary to create the technical and  material basis for them. Until these enterprises are standing on  their own feet after these measures are taken, they will either  not be taxed or taxed at a minimal level.    In village areas small firms and factories would begin to be  built which would process the product on the spot. The state  would take on the responsibility of supplying them with  equipment because private enterprises could not survive at the  initial stage without help from the state.    In brief, the Erk Party will begin its work with land  reform;  in the first five years, the basic plan of action will take not  heavy industry, but light industry into consideration. Seventy  percent of Uzbekistan's population lives in villages and if land  reform is successfully implemented, 70 percent of the population  of our nation will be saved from sinking into poverty.    Through these economic measures, a national property census  will be taken. And, outside of large factories and heavy  industry, all middle-sized and small plants will begin to be  privatized.    The Erk Party will begin its fight for the preservation of  nature with the severe consequences of the cotton monoculture. A  state must be concerned for the health of its population before  everything else. The Erk Part views this question as a question  of equals importance to the economic and political questions,  and will expend all its strength to resolve it. A government  which thinks that the problem will be resolved by burdening  public organizations like the Aral Committee with it is  irresponsible.    On the work of the Erk Party on political reforms    The Erk Party considers its basic goal to be the  transformation of Uzbekistan into a democratic state.    In order to build a democratic state, passing a democratic  Constitution is not enough in itself. Uzbekistan's people have a  democratic Constitution, but this Constitution cannot improve  the lot of Uzbekistan's people. The leadership rules over the  will of the people, not the laws or the Constitution. Today they  have sat on the Constitution; a democratic state would remove  the Constitution from under these bureaucrats and would raise it  to the necessary level.    Thus, they would be able to prevent all kinds of distortions  in a democratic society. By the same token, neither leftwing  forces nor rightwing forces would be able to endanger the state.  In other words, a true structure, we think a democratic system  could come into being in the state, not a group of bloodthirsty  officials.    What do we mean by a democratic system?    Let me give an example: let us say a racist becomes the head  of government in England. This individual would be unable to  change English policy to a racist policy because the democratic  mechanism of the state would force this person to act within  certain limits. If this person opposed the system, the system  would remove him from the government. This means that in such a  system the coming into power of a fascist or a madman would be  quite improbable.    Now if Tashmat ascends to the throne in states lacking a  democratic order but only a tyranny, the entire state follows  Tashmat's policy; if Ashmat mounts to the throne, it follows  Ashmat's policy. In other words, if Tashmat and Ashmat are both  crazy, or if they are treasonous, both the state and the nation  are in terrible danger.    Thus, the Erk Party considers that a state built on the  democratic principle is the most credible state.    Let me say a few words about the Erk Party's cadre policy.    The Erk Party believes that the cadres will play an  important  role in the building of a new state. In this sector we have a  traditional sickness-- localism. Our leadership, instead of  understanding that our nation cannot be divided from its people,  has pursued a divisive policy, and has descended into localism.  This policy seriously poisons the minds of our people, and it  will demand considerable work to drive this poison out. The Erk  Party will take this selfless task on its own shoulders and root  out the divisive policy.    Cadres, primarily, will be selected according to their worth  and then their willingness to work in the interests of the state.    They will be given the opportunity to work creatively within  their duties and to take a creative approach to their jobs. In  other words, they will not have to ask the president for  permission to do everything as they do now; independent and  intelligent officials will not sidestep difficult problems, they  will just resolve them.    Every official will be evaluated at his rank within the  state  and will be compensated for his work and trustworthiness.    Officials will not be insulted by their bosses, and  shortcomings in the official's personal life will not be judged  by the administration.    They will be paid enough to lead a free and straightforward  life, and all possibilities for their retirement to normal life  will be created.    Whether one is a normal official, deputy, teacher at a  university of a physician, he will live with the feeling that "I  am necessary to the state, and the state will also reinforce  this idea.    In its turn, the state will demand definite responsibility  from the official. When the official is in the administration,  it will be a condition that he knows that the state's interest  and authority is his primary goal. Every minor complaint against  the official will be investigated in depth by the state and  appropriate measures taken.    An official who takes a bribe will be punished mercilessly  by  the state. The state has the legal and moral right to do this  because the state will have guaranteed its officials with the  salaries and privileges at a level where they will not feel the  need to break the law.    The most severe punishments will be given to officials who  betray the interests of the state.    In this way, as long as the state finds it useful to defend  its officials and guarantee their [word obliterated], it will  also be in the officials' interests to provide their services  honestly to the state.    The Erk Party's ideological statement is brief: national  awakening and an independent state.    These ideological examples are not from a brochure by Erk's  leadership, but taken from the rich history of our nation.    Starting at the beginning of our century, the Djadidist  movement brought forth a new national ideology. This movement  was not guided by the khanate or the governate, but by  politically educated groups and free-thinking enlightened  people. These societies evoked the people's ideals and  comprehended their hopes, aspirations and sorrows clearly and  precisely.    All organizations similar to this could manifest themselves  in cultural-educational, historical, language or newspaper  societies. Similar organizations began to form two years ago but  were quickly closed down.    The writers' union was such an organization but,  unfortunately, it split and quarreled over authority and divided  its prizes.    The state does not have to close these societies, on the  contrary, it should support and strengthen them. The state has  to create its own ideology on the foundations of these  societies. Thus, the new state would gain trust among the  people. Once this trust is gained, then the state has a job to  do: it must prepare the economic and political basis for the  ideology it is creating. In other words, without reforms  everything we have stated above will remain beautiful ideas or  mere embroidery.    For the state to make its people follow its ideology, it  must  grant political and economic freedoms to them. The person with a  fettered mind cannot love his nation nor can he be committed to  it. The poor man is that way.    Erk Party's views on religion    The Erk Party is for giving complete freedom to religious  organizations because faith is inherent, and those believing in  Allah can be useful to society. Even if they do not contribute  to society, they do no harm. This philosophy expresses the Erk  Party's relationship to religion completely.    Specifically, educated religious leaders can help in the  spiritual health of the new state we are building. They will  show enthusiasm in nourishing with purity and faith the  emptiness in the hearts of our nation which has undergone a  century of slavery.    As for "Islamic fundamentalism," that is something to think  about. In general, religious radicalism is foreign to the nature  of the Turkic peoples. In fact, our ancestors never promoted a  policy of ignorance in the religious sector.    The Turkic peoples were at the forefront in spreading Islam;  the conquered other nations but always distanced themselves from  religious ignorance, and propagandized their own religion by  means of education.    Today, some of our friends, calling themselves religious  believers, say mistakenly to males "if you wear a necktie, you  are an unbeliever" are to females "if you do not wear the veil,  you are an unbeliever." But faith lives in our hearts, not our  clothing. If, instead of faith in the hear there is misery, and  if such a woman puts on the veil, the veil only covers the  misery.    Islamic educators direct their training toward mankind's  inner world. Islamic elements, not the veil or turban, are in  service to Allah and this belief.    Twenty years ago there were 400 thousand Muslims in Europe.  Today, there are four million Muslims in Europe, the majority of  whom are European. These people are not under the influence of  simplistic Islamic propagandists for Islam, but have read the  blessed Koran. Otherwise, they have accepted this religion under  the influence of deep-thinking Islamic propagandists.    Simplistic propagandists have always done more harm to Islam  than good. This simplistic philosophy was the cause of the  centuries-old degraded condition of Islam in Turkestan. The  "Islamic obedience" taught by these simple mollas was a way of  extending the life of Tsarist Russian colonialism in Turkestan.  However, Islam is not a religion of obedience or subjugation.  Islam is a religion of courage and valor. Islam teaches one to  bow his head to no one but Allah. Islam teaches one to fear  nothing but Allah.    Abukadir Al Jazairi, a mujahid who fought against French  colonialism, was asked by Western reporters "Why do your  soldiers not fear death?" He answered: "Because my soldiers  believe in Allah. They know that their lives are not in the  hands of the enemy, but in the hands of Allah. Thus, why should  they fear the enemy?"    Our children should be trained with such faith.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / World Trade News: French MPs put in the Gatt balance - Balladur may have to put his political survival on the line The French government yesterday made clear its intention to use its parliament as an instrument of pressure in the Gatt talks, just as President Bill Clinton is using the time limit on his ability to get 'fast-track' congressional approval of any deal to bring negotiations to an end next month. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur wants a draft Gatt text to put before both the National Assembly and the Senate between December 10 and 15, Mr Gerard Longuet, the trade minister, said yesterday. After a subsequent cabinet crisis meeting yesterday on Gatt, it became evident the government was hesitant about putting a draft deal to a vote, because constitutionally that would probably have to be done in the form of a motion of confidence in itself. Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, said: 'We first need to know whether there will be a (Gatt) deal, because one votes on texts.' But, if such a draft Gatt text is not a law or international treaty - which it cannot be by mid-December - then under the French constitution the National Assembly can only vote on a matter of 'general policy' involving a motion of confidence in the government itself. Procedurally, the previous Socialist government had to put forward a confidence motion in itself to get the National Assembly to vote a year ago against the Blair House farm trade deal between the US and the European Commission. Given that vote a year ago, and the subsequent raging national controversy over Gatt, Mr Balladur probably has no choice but to put his political survival on the line. A confidence motion should also have the effect of forcing his own RPR Gaullist party, which has a strong rural electorate, to line up behind his position. Equally, however, there is an outside risk of Mr Balladur being toppled, if for instance, he falls out over Gatt with his party leader and presidential rival, Mr Jacques Chirac. The latter would take France on an even tougher course in trade and European policy, a risk that Mr Balladur is now effectively, through his parliamentary tactics, asking his negotiating partners to weigh. The irony is the National Assembly - the directly elected house of the French parliament which determines the fate of French governments - has never voted on any aspect of Gatt negotiations, since France's membership of Gatt in 1947. The main French farm union, FNSEA, has asked the French government to demand compensation from the US, Canada and Mexico for diversion of French and European farm exports as a result of the forming of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Both US and European Union trade negotiators spoke encouragingly yesterday of prospects for settlement of differences in the Uruguay Round of global trade liberalisation, David Dodwell, World Trade editor, adds from Geneva. They raised hopes that details of a deal might be ready for disclosure by Wednesday next week, when Mr Mickey Kantor, chief US trade negotiator, flies to Brussels for further discussions with Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart. One senior US official fresh from this week's Kantor-Brittan meetings in Washington talked of 'a close-out sort of mood' in the negotiations: 'There was a very positive sense that we are going to get there,' he said. He acknowledged agreement terms - notably over tariff cuts on semi-conductors, textiles, wood, paper, ceramics and glass - needed to be spelled out to other negotiators well before the December 15 deadline for completing the round.</p>

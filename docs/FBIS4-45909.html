			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Rongdian (1728 2837 0368)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 15 May (XINHUA) -- A decade has passed in  the development of China's nuclear undertakings and nuclear  safety supervision and administration since it started building  the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power plants in the 1980's.    During this period, China has built a very efficient nuclear  safety supervision and administration system. An international  regulatory review mission from the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA], a working visit to China recently, concluded that  China's nuclear safety supervision and administration system  conforms to the standards of usual international practice.    Huang Qitao, director general of the National Nuclear Safety  Administration [NNSA], which is an independent government  department with jurisdiction over nuclear safety supervision and  administration, said in an interview with this reporter: The  fact that China -- young is terms of nuclear energy development  -- is able to attain the level it has achieved today in nuclear  safety supervision and administration can be attributed to its  active participation in international cooperation.    He stressed: China is positive, open-minded, and unreserved  when it comes to promoting international cooperation and  exchanges in nuclear safety. NNSA has signed agreements on  cooperation in nuclear safety with the United States, France,  Italy, Spain, Pakistan, Germany, and Japan. It has also  maintained regular contacts and conducted exchanges with a  number of countries with which no such agreement has been  signed. China will also sign agreements on cooperation in  nuclear safety with a number of other countries.    Huang Qitao said: In regard to nuclear safety supervision  and  administration, China has received generous support from the  United Nations Development Program [UNDP], IAEA, EC, and other  international organizations. They have provided China with  technical training, information, computer software, and other  data relevant to the safe operations of nuclear plants. He said  China has also taken an active part in international cooperation  in nuclear safety under the auspices of the IAEA, including the  entire processing of drafting of the "International Convention  on Nuclear Safety" under IAEA sponsorship. China will fulfill  all the obligations provided in the convention when it is signed.    Huang Qitao said: China has gained a great deal of valuable  experience from its active and frequent participation in  international cooperation and exchanges. It has also made its  experience available to other countries without any  reservations. For this reason, all participants are  beneficiaries of international cooperation in nuclear safety.  He noted that China will step up its efforts in international  cooperation on nuclear safety and take an active part, as ever  before, in international cooperation sponsored by the IAEA.    Annick Carnino, head of the international regulatory review  mission, also noted in an interview with XINHUA while she was in  China: The IAEA will strengthen cooperation with China in  nuclear safety supervision and administration and provide  assistance, to the extent possible, in making preparations for  dealing with nuclear emergencies.</p>

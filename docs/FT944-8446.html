			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): No limits for Sky - Company in the news / Christopher Price examines its flotation prospects Viewers of BSkyB movie channels for the past two nights may well have found some clues to the Pounds 4bn-plus flotation announced on Monday. Top Secret] sat alongside Mr Billion, both of which could be applied to the biggest listing to come to the market this year. As with TeleWest last week, the method of valuation used by the group's advisers has fuelled the heated debate over how the market should value media companies. Much of their future worth lies in their potential roles in the so-called multi-media revolution. And BSkyB's valuation relies on matching its present subscription and advertising growth rates into the next century. With such an emphasis on what might be, BSkyB's 119-page pathfinder prospectus contains surprisingly few financial facts with which to enlighten potential investors. Instead, the report reflects the group's rise from heavy losses to moderate profitability in its four-year history. The number of subscribers to the group's nine channels, for instance, has grown from 1.7m in 1992 to 3.6m in the year to end-September. Similarly, profitability has improved enormously; operating losses of Pounds 47m last year have turned to Pounds 170.1m profits this year. Over the same period, revenues have risen from Pounds 379.5m to Pounds 550.5m. With such scant hard information, however, the flotation has come in for much criticism from commentators and analysts and put the company management and Goldman Sachs, the lead broker, on the defensive. At meetings this week, chief executive and managing director Sam Chisholm is said to have chided analysts as 'sad, middle-class misfits'. When he found only three of the 50 analysts present subscribed to the station, he reportedly accused them of being 'out of touch' with what the British people wanted. Out of touch or not, there are several questions raised by sceptical analysts over the issue. Chief among these is the contentious valuation question. Goldman Sachs and the other brokers to the issue have used a variety of methods to come up with the valuation range of Pounds 4.0bn to Pounds 4.6bn. None was willing to disclose details of its calculations but, privately, Goldman is said to be forecasting profits of Pounds 889m for 2002. Discounting back from there and assuming steady growth rates, this would put the stock on a prospective p/e of around 20 for 1996 - a hefty 25 per cent premium to the market. BSkyB points to the ratings of companies such as Vodafone, arguing that the mobile telecoms group faced questions of valuation and scepticism over its likely growth rates when it floated - coincidentally, with 20 per cent of the shares - in 1989. It came to the market eventually on a similar prospective p/e to BSkyB. Acknowledging these similarities, critics also point to significant differences. For example, the revenue per subscriber for the telecoms group is around Pounds 700, probably five times that of BSkyB. There is also the matter of different products, customer base and the very different industries the two companies exist in. All of which underline the question of whether BSkyB (in which Pearson, owner of the FT, has a 17.5 per cent stake) can maintain its present growth rates - and thus justify the proposed rating. It is only three years ago that its massive losses were making it the butt of national jokes and adding to the crippling debt burden of its biggest shareholder, News Corporation. Although the jokes have now stopped and News Corp is less geared, it would be wrong to suggest that the initial resistance of viewers to the concept of subscription TV has completely broken down. The Goldman Sachs profit forecast for 2002 implies a subscriber base of some 11m, or getting on for half of all television households - an optimistic figure given the vagaries of the British viewing public. BSkyB relies on its exclusive rights to sports events and films. Too heavily for some critics, who point out that the cable companies will begin flexing their growing muscles and bid for the same rights. Not so, says Goldman, which forecasts that the cable companies and broadcasters would be 'suicidal' to compete with each other in such a way. The pricing of the issue has also attracted attention. Borrowing heavily from government privatisations, share shops are being established and registration encouraged as part of a Pounds 3m advertising campaign to convert users (and potential users) into shareholders - a surefire way of promoting customer loyalty. But, unlike the government sales, there are no discounts for subscribers or in the price for potential shareholders. BSkyB's plans to offer a lower price to viewers were blocked by the stock exchange. Nor will investors know the price of the shares until after signing their cheques, although a price range of 233p and 268p has been set. A book-building exercise with institutional investors, now under way, will decide ultimately, with early indications pointing towards the 250-255p level. Privately, Goldman is hinting that the minimum investment will be somewhere over Pounds 500. With concerns over both the valuation and the industry's future, investors may consider the risks too high at this stage in the company's development. Aptly, Thursday night's film schedule had a dark thriller: The Man Who Knew Too Much. Investors may feel they do not yet know enough.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COUNTDOWN TO FLOTATION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Closing date for applications            10am December 6 Offer price and allocation set                December 8 Conditional dealings start             2.30pm December 8 Share certificates despatched                 December 15 Unconditional dealings start           2.30pm December 15  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Sons of Yemen League and Unionist </F> Grouping: Appeal To Stop 'Dirty War'"]    [Text] Aden, AL-HAYAH -- The Sons of Yemen League and the  Yemeni Unionist Grouping have appealed to Arab kings and  leaders, Muslim scholars and wise men, and leaders of the new  world order, urging them to "intervene by exerting pressure and  influence and using mutual ties to halt the Yemeni war." The  league called for the severing of political and economic  relations with the Yemeni leaders if they do not respond to the  appeals to stop the fighting. It said that they are "pursuing  only their personal interests."    A statement issued from Aden yesterday by the league's  leader, 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Ja'fari; its secretary general, Muhsin  Bin-Farid; and the Unionist Grouping's secretary general, 'Umar  al-Jawi, said that what is happening in Yemen now is "the result  of the way in which the country is being run. Here are the  country's leaders destroying it, its Army, and its people."  They described what is happening as a "catastrophe." It said  that the Yemeni leaders are acting "as though they are the  enemies of the country and its people."    The statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received, added:  "We know that our position could expose us and our party to  danger. But we do not care about what could afflict us. We are  interested in our country and our people, because we know we are  worth nothing without a secure homeland. We also know that what  the gangs' leaders are doing will not spare a country or a  people, because their only concern is their own interests....  They are firing their missiles and dropping their bombs  everywhere, no matter who is killed or what is destroyed."    The statement said that the Yemeni Army "is destroying  itself, while the leaders continue to destroy their country's  infrastructure. We doubt whether some of them feel they belong  to this country or to our religion, Islam, or have any human  feelings."    The statement urged "that this dirty war be stopped and  innocent citizens rescued. If the leaders refuse to stop this  war, we urge you to sever your political and economic relations  with them and help our people to surmount the catastrophe being  inflicted by these leaders who are taking the country into the  unknown."    The statement issued by the league and the grouping went on:  "In the name of God, brotherhood, and humanity, we appeal to you  to move swiftly before it is too late. Because it is in no  one's interests for our citizens to continue to be killed and  our country destroyed.... If the country's leaders lose their  mind, someone must stand by the people, who are suffering terror  and starvation."    The statement urged the Army to stop the fighting and not to  respond to any orders to launch attacks.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL'S PEACE PLAN  </P> <P> The two columns point up the tragedy inherent in the Israeli-Palestinian  crisis.  </P> <P> Aharoni mentions the Arab terrorist who murdered 16 bus passengers recently.  Certainly this is a reprehensible act and should be condemned. But he doesn't  mention the 20,000 Arab homes destroyed by the Israeli military. Violence on  both sides is reprehensible. It should be emphasized that the vast majority of  Israelis and Palestinians reject violence. He also mentions that proposals to  allow elections among Arabs in Judea, Samaria and Gaza have not brought peace.  What he doesn't mention is that these would not be truly free elections because  the Palestinians would still be subservient to the Israeli government.  </P> <P> Harkabi's main point is that neither side should allow the extremists to take  over. If they do, then catastrophe is inevitable.  </P> <P> In this crisis tolerance must become the norm and not the exception. Equality  must be available to all, not just a select few. If these points are not  recognized, then the Israelis and Palestinians will continue to march toward  mutual destruction.  </P> <P> DON RADEMACHER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / If God is the answer, what is the question?: The more science discovers about the origin of the universe, the stranger the answers become. Max Wilkinson discusses the latest theories and what they tell us about the Creator IN THE beginning God created the laws which govern the heavens and the earth. And the earth was without form and void. And the void was filled with a ferment of particles appearing and disappearing in the darkness. And God created quantum mechanics, relativity, quarks, and superstrings, each after its kind. And God said let there be light and there was a very Big Bang. . . . THIS, or something like it, is how modern cosmologists would rewrite the ancient text. And many would not delete the deity. Others, however, believe that science will soon solve the greatest of all mysteries, without the need for a Creator. The debate is beginning to catch the imagination of a much wider public, as works of popular science cascade from the presses, carrying strange messages from distant galaxies and from the atom-smashing accelerators which scientists use to investigate the smallest particles of matter. Some of these, such as Stephen Hawking's challenging book, A Brief History of Time (Bantam 1988) became best sellers. The message of this new science is contradictory. Spectacular progress in recent years suggests that the whole history of the universe might be reduced to a set of equations, subsuming the laws of nature in a Theory of Everything. This theory could not, of course, predict details such as 'the fall of a sparrow', but God would no more be needed to run such a universe, than we now think he is needed to explain storms and plagues. Yet the new physics often generates more mysteries than the mystery it seeks to explain  -for example it has time running backwards, particles in two places at once and multiple universes. This is far different from the common sense world of Newton and even Einstein. Yet some scientists believe that the complexity of the world which modern science reveals is itself an argument that God played an important part, as opposed to a completely scientific explanation. In 1935 Albert Einstein said: 'The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible'. Paul Davies in The Mind of God (Simon and Schuster, 1992) takes up this theme in the light of discoveries, which confirm even the wierdest predictions of the new physics. Davies suggests that the mind of man and the informing principles of the universe must have more than something accidental in common. How otherwise could such strange complexity be apparent to us? How else could scientists receive those flashes of inspiration which reveal an unsuspected pattern? But Davies shows that a scientifically literate believer will push God out of the driving seat. He becomes a distant designer rather than the guiding hand. Roger Penrose, the Oxford physicist, approaches the question in a rather different way. The Emperor's New Mind (Oxford 1989), is an heroic, if inconclusive, attempt to apply the new physics to the workings of the human mind. He questions the mechanistic view that conscious thought can, like all else, be explained by science. Thought may or may not show us to be us godlike, as Descartes believed; but according to Penrose, it ain't just physics. In spite of the moderating influence of such scientists as Penrose and Davies, popularisation of the grand claims of new science is provoking a strong reaction. In this week's Spectator magazine, John Patten, the education secretary, complains that science has weakened faith and thus contributed to social malaise. The idea is developed in a polemical work by Bryan Appleyard, Understanding the present - science and the soul of man (Picador 1992), published this month. He asks whether the 'hollow, mechanistic vision' of scientific writers such as Hawking 'will put us back on the treadmill of eternal progress, reducing the span of our lives to trivial, accidental interludes and removing our souls from our bodies.' This is hardly more than a cri de coeur - and silly, because in spite of his perceptive account of the development of modern science, Appleyard wilfully confuses discovery, theory and scientific method in a crude personification of science as an intellectual bully. His plea that science should somehow be demoted and 'humanised' is absurd. For science discovers only truth. Anything which is not true can be defeated by argument and experiment, and if it cannot be so tested it is not science. Yet Appleyard may have a point. As Richard Morris says in The Edge of Science (Fourth Estate 1991) 'Scientists have been turning to questions that were once asked only by philosophers'. What could be more arrogant than the attempt to penetrate the secrets of creation. However, the Bible's 'In the beginning' is now known to be about 15bn years ago, a large figure but only the number of Pounds 1 coins which Exxon would need to buy Shell. How do they know? Well, some sceptics agree with the title of Eric J. Lerner's new book, The Big Bang never happened (Simon and Schuster 1992). But most cosmologists are convinced big bangers. Edwin Hubble's discovery in 1929 that all galaxies are speeding away from each other was only suggestive. But in 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson heard the Big Bang, or at least its diminuendo, as short radio waves coming from all directions. Why does it come from everywhere and not just from the place where the Big Bang is supposed to have occurred? Simple] Because the Big Bang happened everywhere. At that time the whole of space was shrunk to an infinitesimal pinpoint. After the explosion, it inflated like a balloon, with all the stars on the surface moving away from each other. Yet despite the immense detail in which the Big Bang is now described, the theory opens some acute difficulties, particularly the so called 'flatness problem'. If the early universe had contained just the tiniest bit more matter, the extra pull of gravity between the stars would long ago have collapsed them all into a big crunch leaving not a wrack behind. On the other hand, with just the tiniest bit less matter, gravity would not have been strong enough to condense the primordial matter into stars, galaxies and our nice comfortable solar system. So it seemed, on the face of it, that the earth could have formed only as the result of a gigantic fluke - or divine intervention. The US physicist, Alan Guth found a possible solution in 1980, by the application of a Grand Unified Theory, combining three elemental forces which were hitherto considered separate, but which may have amalgamated in the primordial furnace. At 1/1035 seconds after the start (1035 is 1 followed by 35 noughts) Guth calculated, the universe would explode at an immensely accelerated rate, increasing its size a trillion trillion trillion times in a microblink of time. It did make the 'flatness' problem seem less coincidental. But the theory is imperfect and the search continues. The latest idea of 'superstrings', for example, seeks to explain matter in terms of a tiny one dimensional filaments existing in 10 dimensions, seven of which we could not possibly see. Yet as Lawrence Kraus shows in The Fifth Essence (Hutchinson Radius 1989), computers playing God with such theories and a toy Big Bang can come up with some amazingly lifelike representations of the night sky over Greenwich. Even so, as Robert Matthews points out in Unravelling the Mind of God (Virgin 1992), the question still remains: What started the Big Bang? Perhaps the question is not worth asking. Hawking and Penrose showed in the 1960s that if Einstein's relativity theory is correct, at the instant of creation the known laws of physics yield nonsensical results. More recently, however, Hawking and his colleagues at Cambridge University have been calculating what might happen if the the ordinary laws of gravity were somehow to merge at enormous temperatures with the quantum theory which governs the interaction of very small particles. Although these ideas are still tentative, Hawking predicts that in the unimaginable heat of the earliest stage of the universe, time itself would be swallowed up and become a dimension of space. It would then be impossible to go further into the past, although there would be no starting point. Hawking likens this to the North Pole: you cannot go further north, but you cannot fall off. Fantastical as this may sound, it is no more absurd than the predictions of quantum theory, which are verified in laboratories throughout the world almost daily. Quantum mechanics were developed early in the century to explain the behaviour of atomic particles which refused to obey the laws of mechanics which govern larger objects such as cricket balls and planets. This theory, explained elegantly in John Gribben's In search of Schrodinger's cat (Bantam 1984) shows that when two particles bump into each other we cannot predict in advance what will happen, only the probability of different outcomes, and these possible outcomes coexist until the observer checks the result. Thus a single photon of light presented with two slits in a piece of paper will go through both. Only afterwards, when the observer decides how to view the event, will the photon 'decide' which slit it 'really' went through. The late Richard Feynman, the Nobel laureate, warned an audience of Australian students that they would not understand this, because he did not himself. The theory is repugnant to common sense, and was deeply disliked by Einstein, but it has been verified repeatedly. Now quantum theory is deeply implicated in the modern explanations of the Big Bang. One of the things it says is that empty space is not empty at all, but seething with particles popping into and out of existence in a tiny fraction of a second. Incomprehensible? yes, but nobody doubts it to be true. So is there 'somewhere else' that they come from? The question suggests to some theorists that our universe may be just one of many running in parallel. So perhaps that photon really did go through both slits, one in our world and the other in a different universe. Be that as it may, Big Bang theorists suggest there may have been lots of bangs creating other universes, all connected by 'wormholes' through time and space. They also speculate that the Big Bang may have been seeded by just a random appearance of particles predicted by quantum theory. Physics, it may be objected, is at this point exploding into speculation. But this is partly because ordinary science has shown the world to be far stranger than used to be suspected. At the mundane levely, chaos theory, described beautifully by James Gleick in Chaos (Penguin 1991) showed that apparently simple equations of physics can produce startlingly unpredictable results, so that science cannot, even in principle, predict everything. Moreover, in pure mathematics Kurt Godell's theorem has shown that some propositions must be unprovable. Paul Davies thinks that this discovery dooms the physicists' ambition to reach the mind of God via a grand theory which would make the universe completely comprehensible. If so, Einstein may turn out to be wrong twice over.</p>

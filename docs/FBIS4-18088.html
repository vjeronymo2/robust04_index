			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Fiore, commander of the Italian UN </F> troops in Somalia, by Gianfranco Simone in Bergamo on 23 March:  "Somalia: Goodbye in Anger"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Simone] What are your most  pleasant and most painful memories of Somalia?    [Fiore] The children, in both cases, because it was nice to  meet them and very nasty to have to leave them, regretting a  good job that we were unable to finish. (And Fiore embraces  Muraja, a Somali child who has been turned over to a Bergamo  couple.)    [Simone] I see some Somalis leaving the plane. How many are  there?    [Fiore] Nineteen collaborators, to protect them from  possible  retaliation. They are mostly Abgal. Included, too, is Mrs.  Murta, Ali Mahdi's wife, who will be in Italy for 10 days.    [Simone] Are you still convinced, after having seen the  pictures of [RAI journalists] Ilaria Alpi and Miran Hrovatin,  that our colleagues were killed by Muslim fundamentalists?    [Fiore] Yes, but not because of what the pictures showed. We  had known for some days that they were planning to kill a  Westerner and we warned all journalists, because they are the  weak link in our presence in Somalia. However, our troops have  a reputation of impenetrability.    [Simone] Are there any of our troops left in Somalia?    [Fiore] There are still 16 guards at the Embassy, which is  now located in the UN Command Building.    [Simone] Why did we give up the old embassy building with  its  mascot tortoises?    [Fiore] Because to defend it would have required 200 people  and 5 billion lire a month. The Scire department was  transferred to Merca Hospital.    [Simone] Are the policemen whom we trained and armed and who  were left at the old embassy still efficient?    [Fiore] ... (silence)    [Simone] How many Italian soldiers passed through Somalia in  those 15 months?    [Fiore] Including my battalion, 5,000, including the  Lightning Battalion 8,000.    [Simone] Italy lost 12 men, soldiers of peace, charity, and  information. How many losses did we inflict upon the Somalis as  of 6 February 1993, when paratroopers and marines shot two  bandits?    [Fiore] About 100, during my stay. Those were street  bandits. As regards the Lightning and San Marco Battalions, I do  not know.    [Simone] According to Aidid, the Lightning Battalion has  killed 56 of his men alone. So, can we speak of several hundred?    [Fiore] I think so.    [Simone] Is it true that Balad, where our command and  logistical center was located, is a den of bandits?    [Fiore] At least 40 of the bandits that we killed, not only  in Balad, but also in Giohar and Itala, which is far away, were  from there.    [Simone] And did we install our command and logistical  center  especially there, because there were bandits?    [Fiore] No, it was to use the barracks and because the Uebi  checkpoint controls the road going north to Moga.    [Simone] When will the other Italian troops arrive?    [Fiore] The command paratroopers, including my deputy  commander, Colonel Cantoni, will arrive tonight in Pisa with the  C-130 that with us departed from Mombasa. Four hundred more  Army infantrymen, 120 marines of the San Marco Battalion, and 20  marine raiders will arrive by ship before 6 April. The Navy has  done an excellent job. I am very proud of them because for the  very first time the Navy has been put under the command of an  Army general. On board the Garibaldi they handed me an embossed  plate as a present, inscribed: "To the General-Admiral."    [Simone] Goodbye Somalia, or see you later Somalia?    [Fiore] Goodbye for us, see you later for Italy: Somalia is  a country that definitely needs help.</p>

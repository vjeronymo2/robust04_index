			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Radicals [Radical Civic Union, UCR] have  released a document, worked out during a meeting lasting five  hours to review the crisis in the provinces, which says that the  current economic plan "has tremendously aggravated the trend  that leaves the poor increasingly behind" and which asks the  government to implement changes to achieve growth with social  progress.    The document was the climax of the UCR leadership plenum  meeting presided over by Raul Alfonsin. The UCR president  listened to some 20 reports on the crisis in regional economies,  and said: "An economic policy cannot succeed if it does not  take the people into account."    The Radicals stressed that the economic program of the  Carlos  Menem government "has tremendously aggravated the trend that  leaves the poor increasingly behind," considering that "an  irresponsible confidence in the spontaneous workings of the free  market has turned the opening up into a experimental balancing  act conducted without a net and without any training."    The document says that the Argentine opening up has been "a  shock" without "any reconversion program designed to orient and  support productive activities." The document also says that the  decline in basic economic activities and the crisis affecting  provincial public administrations, which was aggravated by the  transfer of services, "has produced an unprecedented  deterioration in the population's health, education, and public  security."    The document, entitled "The Chain Breaks at Its Weakest  Points," recalls, and not without irony, that the year that is  ending should have been the year marking "the beginning of the  payment of the social debts," in accordance with government  announcements within the framework of the Social Plan launched  with a lot of noise at the beginning of 1993. "Instead, violent  demonstrations have been what called our attention to the  situation in the provinces," the document points out, referring  to Santiago del Estero and La Rioja social outbursts.    More than 20 UCR provincial presidents spoke during the  meeting. They progressively painted a map of the situation in  the provinces, each with different specific characteristics, but  which together described a crisis in the regional economies.    The assessment made by most speeches put the blame for the  social chaos in the provinces not only on the economic  adjustment being sponsored by the national government, but also  on Justicialist Party administrations, many of them installed in  the provinces since 1983.    Salta Province leaders Jose Napoleon Gambetta and Osvaldo  Camisar said in their report that the policies implemented  between 1983 and 1991 by two Justicialist administrations  "accentuated the deterioration of the public administration,  leaving it in a virtual state of bankruptcy."    Rio Negro Governor Horacio Massaccesi -- UCR first vice  president -- presented a detailed and harsh report. The  governor mentioned the contributions that Justicialist governors  received during the 1993 electoral year, and noted the careless  way in which many of them, who now suffer ruinous treasury  situations, spent public funds.    Alfonsin spoke at the end of the meeting to stress that the  party will not only criticize government policies, but UCR  representatives will soon visit government offices to present  alternative proposals to the economic plan in order to face the  crisis afflicting the regional economies.    Former Mendoza Governor Jose Octavio Bordon could not escape  the wave of criticism. Fernando Armeniague, UCR provincial  president, recalled that former UCR Governor Felipe Llaver  handed over a clean and ordered administration to Bordon, who is  currently a Justicialist senator, while in a short period of  time Bordon put the Bank of Mendoza in the red.    The head of the La Rioja UCR branch, Roberto Nieto Brizuela,  spent time talking about the careless way former Governor Carlos  Menem spend public funds during his administration, an attitude  that is in sharp contrast with the president's current attitude  of "adjustment policy without anesthesia." Brizuela outlined  the way La Rioja was administered in the past, which would  partly explain its present state of bankrupcy.</p>

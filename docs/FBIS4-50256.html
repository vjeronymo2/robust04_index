The fair was jointly organized by the Jiangsu Provincial  Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Commission, the Foreign  Economic Relations and Trade Commissions of Nanjing and five  other cities, various import and export companies in Jiangsu,  and Suxing International Trading Company Limited.    More than 200 people, including Jiangsu Provincial Governor  Chen Huanyou and the Jiangsu provincial economic and friendly  delegation led by him; and Zhang Weichao, Chinese consul general  in New York attended today's opening ceremony.    It has been learned that Jiangsu's foreign trade has been  developing rapidly in recent years with import/export trade  reaching $8.7 billion in 1993 -- a 39.3 percent increase over  the preceding year -- of which foreign trade export volume  accounted for $5.976 billion, an increase of 27.95 percent over  1992. On the other hand, the province has also made great  progress in attracting foreign funds with accumulated approval  of over 20,000 foreign-invested enterprises by the end of 1993,  involving contractual and actually used foreign funds amounting  to $19.7 billion and $2.847 billion, respectively.    In the evening, Governor Chen Huanyou and others attended a  welcome dinner party hosted by Overseas Chinese and Jiangsu  natives in New York.</p>

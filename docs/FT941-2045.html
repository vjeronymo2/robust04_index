			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Outlook improves for architects The outlook for architects' workloads is the best for five years according to a survey published today by the Royal Institute of British Architects. The findings confirm that a slow recovery is under way in the construction industry. The institute's survey says 40 per cent of architects expect their workload to increase over the next six months compared with 18 per cent who expect output to fall. New commissions during the final three months of last year were 5 per cent higher than in the previous three months and 30 per cent higher than in the corresponding period in 1992. The survey also showed marked changes in regional workloads with the market for architectural services in the north of England now as large as that in London.</p>

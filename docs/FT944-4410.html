			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: RM dismisses Pounds 38m proposal from Misys Research Machines, the educational computer and software supplier which is due to come to the market later this month, yesterday rejected an approach from Misys, the computing services group. Misys is offering 235p a share, subject to pre-conditions on the RM board, which would value the group at Pounds 38m. RM shares, which are due to be priced in the next few days, are likely to be valued at about 170p apiece. However, Mr John Leighfield, chairman of RM, dismissed the Misys offer. 'This proposal does not value the company at anywhere near its true worth. If we had wanted a trade sale, we would have sought out a company which fits our culture and which would maintain our leading position in our market. Misys does not fit these criteria. 'We are determined to press ahead with our strategy to improve our value as an independent company.' Following the rejection, Misys said it would be proposing an alternative offer to SG Warburg, RM's advisers, immediately. Sources at Misys indicated this would take the form of a partial offer. A company statement said: 'The RM board has chosen to rebuff our approach without any discussions with Misys, and RM's announcement omitted to disclose that the offer proposal was a minimum price, was in cash, and that the pre-conditions were waivable. 'The board of Misys believes its proposal represents a clear premium for RM shareholders, compared to what might be achieved in the placing.' Mr Leighfield said that he did not believe the Misys approach would affect trading in the shares once dealing started, nor that the company would make a hostile bid. However, Misys sources said it was an option the company would consider. Following the flotation, in which 25 per cent of the company is on offer, management and employees will speak for about 36 per cent of RM shares. Mr Strone Macpherson, deputy chairman of Misys, recently resigned as a non-executive director of RM.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / SFO has not pursued Vaduz connection BRITISH investigators probing the collapse of companies controlled by Robert Maxwell have yet to contact the Liechtenstein lawyers associated with many of the secretive companies in the group. Liechtenstein lawyers are normally reluctant to reveal information about their clients, who tend to be wealthy people seeking to hide assets from tax collectors. But the tiny alpine principality - wedged between Austria and Switzerland - does not want to be a haven for serious crime, and Mr Maxwell's Liechtenstein associates made clear as long ago as January that they were eager to co-operate on the case with British investigators. However, Mr Werner Keicher, a lawyer in the Vaduz-based trust advisory firm, Allgemeines Treuunternehmen (General Trust), said this week that he had not yet been approached by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or any other British authorities. Mr Keicher is a director of the Maxwell Foundation, which was the main Liechtenstein vehicle used by Mr Maxwell to control many of his interests. Mr Maxwell also set up through Allgemeines Treuunternehmen at least six other Liechtenstein-based foundations, at least one of which was used to conceal the source of funds for propping up the price of Maxwell Communication Corporation shares. Under Liechtenstein law, lawyers can co-operate with foreign investigations only if the beneficiaries of the foundations waive their right to secrecy or if the foreign government concerned requests co-operation in connection with a criminal inquiry. The formal procedure for making an official request for co-operation from a foreign country is quite complicated, passing through various agencies of the two countries concerned. Inquiries also have to be put in very precise terms that comply with, in this case, Liechtenstein law. Mr Keicher said he had the impression that the British authorities were well-informed about the Liechtenstein side of the Maxwell story. 'There are no assets here, no money. Perhaps they decided it was not worth it,' he said. The Serious Fraud Office yesterday refused to comment, saying the matter concerned operational details of its investigation.</p>

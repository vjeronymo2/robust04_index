			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Gennadiy </F> Kulbitskiy]    [Text] Bonn, 28 Apr--The foreign ministers of Russia and  Germany, Andrey Kozyrev and Klaus Kinkel, discussed a number of  extremely important subjects today at the German Government's  Petersberg residence on the Rhine River: Russian Federation  President Boris Yeltsin's planned official visit to the Germany  on 11-13 May of this year, ways of settling the Bosnian problem,  the situation in the Near East, and the situation in the  Republic of South Africa.    "I have had talks with Russia's foreign minister, or rather  my friend, Andrey Kozyrev...." In this unexpectedly friendly  manner, Kinkel began his statement at the closing news  conference. He stressed that people in Germany are awaiting the  arrival of President Yeltsin with interest and joy, and  preparations are on the whole complete, with only a number of  technical matters to be clarified.    The main thought expressed by the head of the German  department was that Germans considers it important for Russia to  be fully involved in the process of seeking a settlement in  Bosnia and that all decisions on this question should be adopted  only with the participation of the Russian side. This applies  not only to Bosnia but also to the Near East.    After his introductory statement, Kinkel was frankly bored,  shifting his weight from one foot to the other while the Russian  minister was given a hard time, as virtually the entire hail of  questions fell on him. The journalists learned that Russian  views on a Bosnian settlement coincided to a considerable extent  with the Kinkel-Juppe initiative that was put forward by the  foreign ministers of the FRG and France within the framework of  the European Union [EU]. "The task now is to make this  position, which is becoming consolidated, more precise--taking  into account the experience of recent months--and also to get  the United States involved in it."    "As a result of a series of meetings and conversations that  took place this week", Kozyrev said, "I feel considerable  satisfaction in connection with the fact that our Western  partners are not confining themselves to settling the problem by  military means, which are an extreme measure in extreme  circumstances. Along with Russia, the West is prepared to  double the pace and quality of work specifically on the  political approach to settling the conflict in Bosnia. The  forthcoming meeting of foreign ministers could prove to be a  decisive stage on the path to holding a summit conference."    At the same time, there were tough notes, normally not  associated with the foreign minister, to be detected in  Kozyrev's words, especially with regard to the actions of the  parties to the Bosnian conflict. "We need to see how events  develop, but the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States,  the EU, and the United Nations could also discuss the Bosnian  problem without the involvement of the conflicting parties. It  seems to me," he continued, "that the important thing now is for  Russia, the United States, the EU, and the United Nations to  work out a coordinated approach. This is necessary in order to  make the conflicting parties in Bosnia aware that there is a  reasonable alternative to war and that they will not succeed in  playing on differences between various states."    "The conflicting sides in Bosnia should get it clear: They  can no longer continue the game in which one side or the other  puts forward deliberately unacceptable demands, for example, on  territory. There will be no more of this," Kozyrev said.    ... the military part of the Cologne-Bonn airport, then by  helicopter to "Petersberg", three hours later back to the  airport. [sentence as received] The aircraft set out for  Moscow. The latest visit by Russian Federation Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev to the FRG has ended. It was a working visit.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NICARAGUA STRIKE EASED AS TALKS RESUME;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA: WORKERS SAY THEY WON SOME CONCESSIONS. THEY RESTORE PHONE SERVICE  AND RELEASE MEDICINE AND OIL SHIPMENTS.  </P> <P> Backing down from its refusal to negotiate under pressure, the government  resumed talks with Sandinista union leaders Wednesday, and both sides reported  steps toward settling Nicaragua's worst strike in 11 years.  </P> <P> President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro sent her labor minister and other top  aides to restart the talks after public employees defied a back-to-work order  Tuesday by shutting down the international airport and the telephone system,  isolating a country in which government offices, banks, schools, bus lines and  railroads were already closed.  </P> <P> After eight hours of talks, union leaders said they had won a preliminary  agreement guaranteeing at least temporary job security for public employees and  a promise of no reprisals against participants in the six-day-old protest by  50,000 workers.  </P> <P> In exchange, the unions quickly restored telephone service, allowed shipments  of crude oil to refineries on a strike-bound railroad and released a shipment  of medicine held up by striking customs agents at Managua's Augusto Sandino  Airport. The airport itself remained closed to national and international  flights.  </P> <P> "The fact that they have started a dialogue is a great success for us," said  Jesse Luis Selva, a spokesman for the strike-leading General Confederation of  Public Administration Workers. "The government can come out a winner too,  because this will tend to stabilize the country."  </P> <P> A second round of talks began in the afternoon over wages. In the morning  session, the government doubled its offer of a 60% increase and the unions  lowered their demand from a boost of 200% to one of 180%. Menial government  jobs pay the equivalent of about $15 a month, while public employees with some  technical skill earn at least $65.  </P> <P> The return of the government to the bargaining table after it declared the  strike illegal Monday and threatened to fire the strikers was an official  acknowledgement of Sandinista strength in the first major conflict of  Chamorro's three weeks in office, a dispute that goes far beyond wages.  </P> <P> Chamorro, who defeated President Daniel Ortega in the Feb. 25 elections, took  office April 25 after a decade of revolutionary rule, inheriting what she  called a bankrupt economy and a power structure built by the Sandinistas, whose  supporters retain key positions in the government bureaucracy, the army, the  police and the courts.  </P> <P> Ordered by the government to reopen strike-closed offices with minimal  violence, riot police retreated from showdowns Tuesday with aggressive  Sandinista pickets at several government buildings and have made no further  moves to clear them.  </P> <P> In another setback for the government, the Sandinista-dominated appeals court  in Managua ruled Wednesday that the strike is legal.  </P> <P> "The Sandinistas are showing very clearly that they can keep this government  from governing," said Luis Sanchez Sancho, a leader of Chamorro's 14-party  coalition in the National Assembly. "Violeta is sitting on a powder keg."  </P> <P> The strike is the most disruptive in Nicaragua since 1979 when workers, often  supported by their employers, paralyzed the country several times in a popular  uprising against dictator Anastasio Somoza. After deposing Somoza in July that  year, the Sandinista guerrillas took control of the labor movement and used  force to discourage strikes.  </P> <P> A Chamorro aide said that the 60-year-old president, who has not joined the  negotiations herself, does not yet regard the walkout as a severe crisis but is  eager to resolve it anyway. Ortega, now the opposition leader, also appeared  intent on a settlement. On Wednesday he visited Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo  and asked the Roman Catholic leader to use his influence to keep the labor  negotiations from breaking down. He also offered to open a "dialogue" between  the Sandinista leadership and the government.  </P> <P> The strike started after the new government devalued the cordoba, setting off a  burst of inflation, and offered workers a 60% wage boost to compensate. When  some workers began striking to demand more, Chamorro last Thursday suspended a  Sandinista-authored civil service law that gives public employees job security,  prompting the walkout to spread to all ministries.  </P></p>

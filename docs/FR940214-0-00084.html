			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Midland-Grau requested that the agency provide an acceptable leakage value for each brake component. It further stated that statements about ``compressor shut-off points'' and ``air flow'' should be pinned down to definitive values. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA disagrees with Midland-Grau's request to provide a specific level of leakage for each brake component. The agency's goal in this rulemaking is to establish a performance test for the entire brake system, because the agency's concern is to test for and prohibit system-wide failures that may pose safety problems. The agency therefore is not concerned with the leakage level of any particular component. Nor does the agency believe it is necessary or appropriate to specify definitive values for the compressor shut-off points. Such an action might be unnecessarily design restrictive and serve to prohibit some manufacturers from selecting a higher cut off value than would be appropriate for its system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allied and Midland-Grau expressed concern that the rate of reservoir pressure drop is influenced by valving, plumbing, and air supply capability. NHTSA acknowledges that these variables exist; however, the agency believes that they are not large enough to adversely affect the test results. Specifically, as long as testing is done at three times the leak rate, the actual numerical value of the leak rate is not overly important, because the value for the safety factor is measured in the same way, which results in factoring out most of the variability. The agency further notes that these variables are part of the manufacturing process and thus, if necessary, they can be controlled by the brake system manufacturer. Moreover, alternative methods of testing would have necessitated using expensive flow meters that would not significantly reduce the level of variability or otherwise improve the test results. NHTSA notes that while the rate of air flow through the system may be affected by slight variations in air hose lengths from vehicle to vehicle, internal size variations in the castings used in the hose fittings, and differences in valve tolerances; the leak rates at issue are not sufficiently large to be significantly affected by this type of variability from vehicle to vehicle. Internal drag on air flow does not become a factor until the flow rates become substantially higher than those being measured here. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that a vehicle would be required to meet grade holding requirements with the level of diaphragm leakage failure of three times the threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate. The agency reasoned that a safety factor was necessary to address the situation when a small diaphragm failure grows larger between parking brake applications, prior to the time the vehicle is parked (at which point the parking brakes would be unreleasable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Midland-Grau, ITI, and Allied objected to including a safety factor ``three times the threshold maximum reservoir leakage.'' Midland-Grau stated that the rationale for this test is not easily visualized and is questionable as to why it was selected as a test parameter. ITI stated that the safety factor should be eliminated to avoid additional time and cost in compliance testing. Allied stated that it was not aware of any information or data that the agency used to establish the three times reservoir pressure drop rate as being a ``worst case'' type of failure for a brake chamber diaphragm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA continues to believe that it is necessary to include a safety factor in the application and holding requirements for air-applied, mechanically held parking brake systems. The agency notes that including the provision for grade holding at ``three times the failure rate'' is essential to ensure the brake system's safety since the hole associated with a diaphragm failure grows larger during the day. In addition, including a safety factor serves to prevent marginal systems from being manufactured. The agency selected a safety factor of three based on general engineering principles and the agency's testing at VRTC. In general, a safety factor needs to be as large as possible to ensure safety, while not be too large to make it unreasonable, impracticable, and unaffordable. In agency tests at VRTC, NHTSA determined that the ITI system would still produce sufficient parking force with a diaphragm leak over ten times larger than the system would detect and still not release the parking brakes. Based on its understanding of diaphragm failures associated with air-applied, mechanically held braking systems, NHTSA determined that a safety factor of three was the most appropriate level of safety for inclusion in a FMVSS. The agency believes that this level of safety will not require manufacturers to ``over-design'' their parking brake systems, but will ensure appropriate brake system performance. NHTSA disagrees with ITI's comment that inclusion of a safety factor would add needless complexity to the requirement. Agency testing at VRTC indicates that inclusion of a safety factor will not significantly add to the time and cost of compliance testing. Essentially, as a result of the safety factor, a test evaluator needs to establish the threshold value for the maximum reservoir leakage rate and then triple it. Based on its experience at VRTC, the agency believes that this will add only five to ten minutes to the compliance testing (at only nominal additional cost.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

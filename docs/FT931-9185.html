			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / UK may ease Nigeria debt terms MR JOHN Major, the British prime minister, yesterday promised a sympathetic response to Nigeria's plea for early debt rescheduling, provided economic reforms set out in last month's budget were speedily implemented. The encouragement was given during a 30-minute meeting with Mr Ernest Shonekan, chairman of Nigeria's transitional council, who outlined the budget measures and a three-year development plan. Nigerian officials, who described the talks as friendly and constructive, said that Mr Major made clear that rescheduling of the country's Dollars 27.6bn external debt would be conditional on renewal of a lapsed agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But the officials were heartened by the prime minister's apparent willingness to implement Trinidad terms for Britain's share of the country's official debt. Mr Shonekan is understood to have stressed Nigeria's determination to strengthen the private sector and improve the investment climate, while making clear that the success of the new reform programme is dependent on a reduced debt servicing burden. Nigeria owes the Paris Club group of official creditors Dollars 16.5bn, and Britain is the largest single creditor. Trinidad terms, a product of a British initiative in 1991, allow 50 per cent write-off of official debt, and long term rescheduling of the balance. But British officials are understood to have warned yesterday that some governments, including the US and Japan, remained reluctant to implement the Trinidad proposals. Creditors have been cautiously encouraged by Mr Shonekan's budget statement, delivered at the end of January. It was designed to bolster economic reforms first introduced in 1986, but later undermined by weak management, rapid money supply growth and extra-budgetary spend-ing. Mr Shonekan, a leading businessman co-opted in December to head the interim council which runs Nigeria under military supervision, plans to seek backing for the country's medium-term plan at an international conference scheduled for London in April. The three-year plan aims to cut annual inflation from 46 per cent in 1992 to 5 per cent by 1995, reduce the fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP from about 12.4 per cent in 1991 to 3.3 per cent in 1995 and achieve 5.3 per cent real annual growth. Last week a report issued by Morgan Grenfell, which noted that Nigerian par bonds had risen to 40 per cent of face value 'on the back of the responsible budget', warned of continuing strains in the Nigerian economy. Reserves had 'plummeted' from Dollars 3.7bn in August 1992 and 'could be as low as Dollars 1bn', partly because of the cost of Nigeria's military involvement in Liberia. The report said that the gap between the official and parallel Naira, narrow for much of 1992, now stands at about 28 per cent.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Observer: Top knob With Peter Morgan, the fiery, Welsh-born director-general of the Institute of Directors, stepping down from his Pounds 146,000-a-year post next year, attention shifts to the question of his successor. Amid some suggestions that Morgan would not have been entirely unhappy to consider another term at the top, headhunters are seeking a man or woman with 'vision, energy, drive and commitment' to occupy the spacious office suite at the top of the IoD's gracious Pall Mall headquarters. Morgan, who has managed to raise the profile of the IoD in his battles to promote the forces of free enterprise, will be a hard act to follow. The organisation, which is said to be engaged in a fairly heated debate over its future strategic role, will certainly need someone else capable of making a public impact like Howard Davies over at the CBI. Word is that redundant politicians need not apply and that someone who has already made a mark on industry would go down well. But if the IoD really wants to break new ground and raise a few members' eyebrows it might consider Mrs Ann Robinson, its own director of policy.</p>

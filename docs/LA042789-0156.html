			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BURNING OF CROSSES IN COUNTY JAIL CONFIRMED  </P> <P> Sheriff Sherman Block said Wednesday that an internal investigation has  confirmed reports that two crosses were burned in the Los Angeles County's  Men's Central Jail during the last two years.  </P> <P> ". . . Now it's a matter of establishing culpability and taking appropriate  action," Block said. "I would say within 30 days we should have everything  finalized."  </P> <P> Block limited his remarks at a monthly meeting with reporters to official  confirmation that crosses had been burned. He avoided comment on possible  motives and the identification of those thought to be responsible. Any deputy  found responsible faces discipline ranging from an oral reprimand to discharge  and possible criminal charges, he said.  </P> <P> Jailers who asked to remain anonymous told The Times months ago that white  deputies had twice set crosses afire. The first cross, the sources said, was  burned in a corridor as members of the Bloods street gang were filing out for  breakfast one morning in 1987. The second was burned in January, 1988, in an  area housing Crip gang members, they said.  </P> <P> Two black inmates, Roosevelt Tellis and Daryl Ransom, said in a jail interview  that they thought they had been "invaded by the Ku Klux Klan or some sort of  white supremacy party" when a cross was burned in their module. "We filed  complaints but they were ignored, and we were threatened and told to leave it  alone," they said.  </P> <P> Charges that crosses had been burned in quarters housing black street gang  members first surfaced at a county Civil Service Commission hearing in early  January.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the sheriff said the investigation took months because of the  need to interview inmates who are spread throughout the state prison system, or  back on the street.  </P> <P> Block insisted that the cross-burnings were not the work of Ku Klux Klan  sympathizers, as charged in a federal lawsuit filed by a former probationary  sheriff's deputy.  </P> <P> Those allegations were contained in the suit brought by Eugene A. Harris, 22,  in March.  </P> <P> Harris charged that the Sheriff's Department had failed to properly investigate  the cross-burnings and had allowed supervisors to press "trumped-up" charges  that led to his resignation. He was accused of taking a candy bar and hairbrush  from jail inmates. Harris is seeking reinstatement.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> GOLDBLUM: SAVING GRACE IN 'TWISTED OBSESSION'  </P> <P> In the murky psychological drama "Twisted Obsession" (at the Century City  Cineplex Odeon) it's easier to understand why Jeff Goldblum accepted its  starring role than why the screenwriter he plays so well succumbs to an  amorphous project seemingly fraught with disaster.  </P> <P> Adapted from British writer-director Christopher Frank's novel "The Mad Monkey"  by Spanish director Fernando Trueba (in his English-language debut), the  shadowy set-in-Paris film affords the versatile Goldblum a splendid opportunity  to play a witty, charming man left vulnerable by his wife's unexpected  departure and thrust into an emotional crisis which provides him with the  opportunity to grow up at last.  </P> <P> Under Trueba's subtle, stylish direction Goldblum gives us an engaging, fully  rounded, finely graded portrayal. The trouble is that the context in which this  man's maturing process takes place is not nearly so well-developed.  </P> <P> In essence "Twisted Obsession" is a "Lolita" tale, and a very furtive one at  that, with hints of incest, glimpses of drug-taking and heavy allusions to  "Peter Pan." Indeed, it is a bit of dialogue from the James Barrie play, in  which Peter confides to Wendy his fear of growing up, that is the inspiration  for the film that a British rock video wunderkind (Dexter Fletcher) wants  Goldblum to write. Goldblum is less than enthused -- until he watches a Cannes  prize-winning short that Fletcher made featuring his sister (Liza Walker). (We  only get a quick look, showing Walker's face registering ecstasy.) And when  Goldblum meets Walker, who plays a girl of 16 who looks closer to 12, he is  transfixed.  </P> <P> No doubt about it, Walker, making her film debut, is a diminutive beauty, but  she's been asked to play a sullen type who seems to be in the habit of offering  sex to every man she meets. She may look like an adolescent but comes on like a  world-weary streetwalker.  </P> <P> Goldblum may persuade us that his screenwriter becomes swiftly obsessed with  her, but even though we know little about her and her brother (who also looks  like an adolescent), she exudes no aura of mystery. It would seem that Prueba  himself doesn't have that much confidence in Walker's femme fatale aura  because, although the prime mover, her screen time is kept to a minimum.  </P> <P> Yet it is Miranda Richardson, well-remembered as the Marilyn Monroe lookalike  heroine of "Dance with a Stranger," who has the truly thankless role as  Goldblum's Paris-based British agent, a gallant, elegant wheelchair-bound woman  whose presence is intended to be pivotal but who is reduced to a gamy plot  contrivance. "Twisted Obsession" is sleek and sophisticated but is finally too  elusive to be either convincing or satisfying.  </P> <P> 'TWISTED OBSESSION'  </P> <P> An IVE release.

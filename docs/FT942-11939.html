			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (11): Daewoo leads drive - Foreign Investment Romania hopes a planned half-billion dollar investment in its car industry by South Korean industrial giant Daewoo will soon put its foreign investment drive on the map, after four years of lagging well-behind central European countries in the race to attract western capital. Under the deal, which is close to completion, Daewoo would take a 51 per cent stake in Oltcit, Romania's second car manufacturer, for Dollars 156m. It aims to invest a further Dollars 370m to lift production capacity to 200,000 cars a year by 1998. The proposed deal, by far the largest single post-communist investment in Romania, comes after a disappointing year in 1993 in which the rate of foreign investment slowed compared with the paltry levels of 1992. Only a further Dollars 227.4m was committed during 1993, bringing the total to Dollars 760.5m since 1990, according to the Romanian Development Agency (RDA), the country's inward investment body. The adoption of a liberal foreign investment law in April 1991 led to a spate of landmark deals that year and in 1992. These included investments in industry by companies such as Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, Colgate-Palmolive, the consumer products manufacturer, and Siemens, the German telecommunications and engineering group. Bouygues, the French construction company, began work on a Dollars 120m World Trade centre due to open this week while oil companies Shell, Amoco, Canadian Occidental and Enterprise Oil were awarded on-shore and Black Sea exploration contracts. Investor confidence was, however, shaken by the victory of former communists in the September 1992 general election and the new government's failure, in 1993, to achieve macro-economic stability or to implement the privatisation scheme it inherited. The hope is that agreements this spring with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank will create a better investment climate after last autumn's near descent into hyperinflation. Maintaining internal convertibility of the Leu, recently achieved for the first time since the summer of 1992, is one of the government's goals this year and remains a critical issue for foreign investors. Although foreign companies are allowed to repatriate 100 per cent of profits, acute shortages of hard currency last year made this almost impossible. It also restricted companies' ability to import raw materials and other goods needed for local production. The privatisation scheme was slow to get off the ground, making joint ventures with state firms the main vehicle for foreign investment in Romania. Even these were held up last year when the RDA had to clear deals through the newly-established State Ownership Fund, the main engine of privatisation, which was plagued with start-up problems and saw four general managers in its first 15 months. However, under Mr Constantin Dumitru, general manager, the SOF has begun to tackle its mandate more seriously. It has asked the development agency to find foreign partners for some 100 priority companies after making just two sales to foreign companies before Mr Dumitru's arrival in February. The SOF is also co-operating in a series of public offers this summer, to be followed by the much-delayed opening of a stock market later in the year. The hope is that the Bucharest exchange will suck in significant foreign investment. External financing for projects has also eased. Most Western European countries have extended investment and credit guarantees which remained limited owing to the political and social instability of 1990 and 1991. International financial institutions such as the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have also started to open credit lines at Romanian banks for local projects. The largest of these is Dollars 170m for agriculture and agro-business which, with other consumer goods industries, are among the top areas of foreign interest. Romanians, who were starved of food and western goods in the 1980s, have a huge appetite for consumer products. The country, with a population of 23m, is eastern Europe's second largest market after Poland. Infrastructure projects, often financed from abroad, are also attracting foreign investors. Siemens, for example, formed a local joint venture to manufacture digital switchboards for the Romanian telecommunications company which has embarked on a multi-billion dollar, 10-year modernisation programme. Similarly, Italian firms are teaming up with local partners to upgrade border crossings and 1,000km of roads as part of a Dollars 400m project co-financed by the World Bank, EBRD and European Investment Bank.</p>

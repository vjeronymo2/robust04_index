			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F> Udo van Kampen in Brussels -- live]    [Text] [Van Kampen] Mr. Woerner, thank you very much for  coming to this live cast. My first question to you: Why did  these attacks take place just now?    [Woerner] That is quite simple: This was the first  violation of the no-fly zone by area planes [Flaechenflugzeuge],  which we have noticed throughout the year that have been  carrying out this operation. We announced that we would act, or  rather had to act, after we had issued warnings because we want  this no-fly zone to be respected. In addition, our pilots were  able to notice that these combat planes were in the process of  dropping bombs -- that is, fighting against targets on the  ground.    [Van Kampen] Is there not the danger that the conflict will  escalate now?    [Woerner] I think the opposite will happen. One will learn  to take NATO seriously, and one will learn to respect the no-fly  zone and also to take other UN resolutions seriously, too. That  means, I rather suspect, that the entire matter will lead to a  calming down of the situation than to the opposite.    [Van Kampen] What happens if the Serbs retaliate? There are  already reports that towns like Tuzla, for instance, are being  attacked more intensively now.    [Woerner] I think there is no connection between the two  events. Tuzla has been attacked repeatedly in the past few  days. In addition, so far none of the three parties has claimed  the planes. It would be very strange behavior if they were to  retaliate. I do not think that this is going to happen because  the entire matter is an operation that is fully covered by the  United Nations. As I have heard, even the Russians have rather  supported this action.    [Van Kampen] Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary General.</p>

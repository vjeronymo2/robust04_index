			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Angelo Lupoli: "16 Trillion Lire Gap in the </F> Accounts"]    [Text] Rome -- The accounts are now ready, but it will be  up to Prime Minister Ciampi to decide when to publish the  quarterly budget report. Between today and tomorrow, once the  examination of the general state accountant's work is completed,  the prime minister will release the "prognoses," making known,  almost certainly prior to Sunday's [27 March] vote, the state of  health of the government budget. Figures for the first three  months are good, but the results will once again be weighed down  by the recession, which will contribute decisively to the almost  15 trillion lire deviation from forecasts already ascertained  following the past few days' indiscrete leaks. This means that  the deficit, by the end of the year, should amount to around 160  trillion lire.    The document put together by General State Accountant Andrea  Monorchio's men can be summarized in a few figures: receipts  will be 10 trillion lire below forecast, more than half of this  due to lower tax receipts (personal income tax, VAT [value-added  tax], municipal real estate tax). Additionally, the state will  be spending some 6 trillion lire more than originally estimated.  This figure is made up of greater expenditures, mainly  transfers for social security and assistance. Included in the  expenditures, however, are both a reduction in interest paid to  holders of government securities (approximately 3 trillion lire)  and a drop in investments, which by the end of the year will be  less than initially calculated by the government. Personnel  expenditure, on the other hand, should be in line with forecasts.    The expenditure savings to be achieved during 1994 include  those relating to supplies to public authorities. The "Cassese  package," that is the measures devised by the civil service  minister aimed in particular at rationalizing the public  procurement of goods and services, makes provision for a savings  of 2.9 trillion lire. The first data available on the  government budget contradict the indiscretions which labeled  these measures to be ineffective. In fact, in the first two and  a half months of 1994, despite a larger budget allocation,  procurement expenditure fell 6.5 percent compared with the same  period in 1993. Payments too have reduced by 4.7 percent. In  substance, the Cassese package is beginning to produce the  expected effects.    The ending of the pubic auditor's work provides  clarification  on the public accounts, about which all sorts of rumors and  figures have been whirling round in recent days.    It was a genuine war in which the most disparate suggestions  have been made. Initially it was rumored that Cassese's  measures had not provided the expected results. This  indiscretion, however, proved to be unfounded.    Following this, a table was circulated, purported to come  from the general state accountant, which while confirming the 16  trillion lire deficit, announced a heavy fall in tax receipts.  It even suggested a figure of 13 trillion lire below forecast,  with a substantial VAT shortfall, a figure which immediately  brought down a storm of fury on the head of Finance Minister  Franco Gallo. At the ministry they quickly pointed out that  this figure was unfounded, and that the Finance Ministry's  estimates were much lower: 4-5 trillion lire less revenue, 6  trillion lire on a worst-case basis.    The same mysterious table "gave the figures" on other  headings. For example, it mentioned 10 trillion lire lower  receipts from the sale of goods and services (including those  planned with the restructuring of the postal system and the sale  of real estate by the social security agencies), while the  economic transactions expect to make a net 1,800 billion from  this income item.    There was then forecast an incredible savings of 11 trillion  lire in personnel expenditure, contrary to the government's  plans and the accountant's own estimates.    This ballet of figures has now been going on for several  weeks, and is so bizarre that someone has begun to suspect that  this has to a certain extent been intentional; that there has  been a desire to dramatize the situation of public finances and  to place the blame on first one, then another minister. The  publication of the quarterly budget report should therefore put  an end to these polemics and more or less guided indiscretions.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Aid blocked as Croats turn on Moslems FIERCE fighting between Croat and Moslem-led Bosnian forces in central Bosnia paralysed key aid routes yesterday, and further undermined the prospects of the hard-pressed Moslem forces, already reeling from the virtual loss of Srebrenica in the east. Relief officials said the fighting had nearly depleted stocks of food in Tuzla, in north-eastern Bosnia, which is preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of starving refugees from Srebrenica. Diplomats say Croat forces are now trying to establish unchallenged control over parts of central Bosnia and Hercegovina. The clashes between the former allies forced British United Nations soldiers based in Croat-held Vitez, 60 miles northwest of Sarajevo, to seek shelter from shells exploding near their camp. Amid conflicting reports which could not be independently confirmed, each side blamed the other for the outbreak of fighting. Bosnian radio said the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), the military wing of the self-styled Croat state of Herceg-Bosna, had fired on surrounding Moslem villages. Croatian radio said Moslems detonated a car bomb in Vitez that killed many civilians. UN officials in Vitez say the fighting over the past four days has left some 150-200 people dead and scores wounded. A car bomb did explode near a mosque in Vitez on Sunday, killing three civilians and seriously wounding eight people, officials said. Six others were slightly injured. Many houses in the old part of Vitez were badly damaged by the blast. Fighting between Bosnian Croats and Moslems broke out around Vitez and surrounding villages on Friday. According to Mr Laurens Jolles, a senior official of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees: 'It can threaten the survival of people in Zenica. It has become extremely difficult to deliver food because of the clashes.' Bosnian radio said 13 people had been killed and 30 wounded yesterday when Bosnian Croat forces launched an artillery attack on Zenica. Hina, the Croatian news agency, claimed six soldiers had been killed and a number of civilians hurt in a Moslem attack on Croat-held Kiseljak just outside Sarajevo. The renewed fighting shattered a strained alliance patched up in January by Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, the international mediators. Its eruption did not surprise members of the mainly Moslem Bosnian forces, following as it did a Croat ultimatum. The HVO order demanded Moslem soldiers withdraw by April 15 from provinces designated as 'Croat' under the Vance-Owen plan. That plan divides Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 provinces roughly along ethnic lines. Diplomats say Croat forces have taken advantage of international outrage about the Serb onslaught on eastern Bosnia. They moved last week to cement their control over parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina. While Serb forces have expelled or killed hundreds of thousands of Moslems in eastern Bosnian, their Croat counterparts have done the same on a smaller scale further west. Supported by the armies of their neighbouring patron states, they are pitted against the Moslems in an intention to divide up Bosnia-Hercegovina.</p>

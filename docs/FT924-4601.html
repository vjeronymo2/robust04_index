			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Survey of Chicago - A Centre For Finance and Industry (4): Brawn underpins services - Investment: diversity provided stability during the volatile 1980s CHICAGO WAS founded on the brawn of meatpackers and steelmakers at the conjunction of the nation's biggest rail and water corridors. The meatpackers have gone and the steel mills are struggling, but good transport and proximity to the raw materials of agriculture and basic industry remain the mainstay of corporate activity. The commodity and stock exchanges, early outgrowths of midwest agriculture, have made Chicago the financial centre of the region, and given it an unique international flavour. Deals linking trade with London, Sydney and Tokyo are frequent front-page news. Economists say the diversity of the city's economy is what saved it from the dramatic ups and downs seen elsewhere during the boom and bust of the 1980s. Despite its heavy industry, the area avoided rustbelt rot. That's not to say there hasn't been a slowdown. Many leading company's have seen their growth stalled, and others, already lean, are downscaling further. Values in Chicago's residential real estate market dipped only slightly in the past two years, in part because they never really experienced a speculative buying frenzy. As with the rest of the US, Chicago's commercial real estate market is overbuilt, and financing for some of the city's downtown showplaces is now quietly under renegotiation. Chicago was one of the last cities in the US to stop building skyscrapers, and so, analysts say, will be among the last to digest the excess. The city's agriculture and heavy industry base saw a regional recession very early in the 1980s, suffering from international competition and a strong dollar. The experience forced serious cost restructuring, and the companies that survived, according to Mr Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust, are competitively positioned for the expected global economic recovery. These companies include the state's metal-benders like its biggest exporter Caterpillar, Navistar (formerly International Harvester), Deere (which makes agricultural machinery), and an array of small businesses that process steel and manufacture parts for the auto and trucking industries. Stock gurus think the companies read like a shopping list for president-elect Bill Clinton, who has promised to revive the flagging economy by rebuilding the country's infrastructure. At the south end of the city, a small revival is occuring as companies employ the cheap property and skilled labour left by the cutbacks in manufacturing there. Australian-owned Welded Tube Company of America is undergoing a Dollars 40m expansion in the Lake Calumet area, and other companies are also retooling. However, the area's recovery was dealt a blow when a plan to site Chicago's third airport near Lake Calumet failed this summer. Favourable exchange rates supported exports and revived moribund companies like Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker and the area's largest exporter. Illinois, including the Chicago area, had Dollars 16.5bn in exports in 1991, the bulk of it heavy equipment, chemicals, and agricultural goods. Had they been included in the export accountings, Chicago would have ranked near the top of the country in the export of financial services and trading technology. Canada, Japan and Mexico are the state's biggest trading partners. Goods shipped to Mexico jumped 23 per cent in 1991, reaching Dollars 1bn, and offsetting small export declines to the UK and Japan. While Illinois exports hundreds of thousands of tonnes of crops annually, the city gains most of its agricultural profits from processing. Downstate giant Archer Daniels Midland and its competitors have plants in the Chicago area that produce high-fructose corn syrup, ethanol, starches, animal feed and vegetable oils. The processed materials supply Chicago's big food companies like Quaker Oats, Sara Lee and United Biscuits' subsidiary Keebler. ADM alone exports about Dollars 3bn in farm products annually. Foreign direct investment in Chicago and its surrounding counties levelled off in 1992, after growing dramatically in the previous decade. KPMG Peat Marwick's 1992 survey of inbound investment in Illinois counts 617 foreign-owned companies headquartered in the state, up from 173 a decade ago. Most are located in the Chicago area. Of the 312 companies that responded to the survey, 132 were Japanese, followed by Britain with 47, and Germany with 41. They represent combined employment of 30,417, and capital investment of Dollars 1.9bn. Fourth-five per cent of those surveyed said they planned to expand. Brawny industry is just the underpinning to a strong service-based economy. The city boasts the greatest number of Fortune 500 corporate headquarters outside New York. Drug and high-technology companies dot Chicago's suburbs. Multinational giants like McDonald's, Waste Management, United Airlines and Motorola are based there, though their operations and workforces are scattered around the globe. Although the November issue of Fortune magazine named Chicago as one of the nation's top 10 cities for business, not all of the city's corporate citizens would agree. Chicago's bad public school system and the pull of a better-prepared suburban workforce has begun to drain corporate interest from the downtown area. Sears, the financial and merchandising giant, is relocating its 36,000-plus Chicago workforce from its trophy mid-town office tower to a new campus in suburban Hoffman Estates. The decision was made in advance of this summer's news that Sears plans to break up and spin off many of its operations in order to concentrate on its retailing core. High taxes, heavily organised labour, and limited availability of suitable land parcels for expansion are forcing some companies out of the area entirely. Spiegel, the retail and catalogue giant, will pull its 127-year-old operation out of Chicago in early 1994, and relocate the 2,200 jobs to Columbus, Ohio. It already has a non-unionised facility there, where there is an adequate site for expansion. In an effort to stem the outflow, the city last summer floated a Dollars 160m bond issue to finance infrastructure improvements. One of the first projects to benefit will be a planned relocation of the city's vital South Water Street produce market to a 62-acre facility on the west side. City planners say the site offers more viable truck routes as well as modern facilities. Improvements are also under way at O'Hare, which is in a tough battle with Houston to keep its place as the country's premier airport. A plush new international terminal is scheduled to open next summer. The new construction, first priced at Dollars 470m, has experienced cost overruns, and may leave the city holding a bill for Dollars 600m. Air France recently opened an Dollars 18m cargo-handling facility at O'Hare, a nod to the fastest growing segment of the airport's business.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMPLOYMENT BY SECTOR: MAY 1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sector                               Employees         %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Services                               905,300      28.2 Retail/wholesale trade                 762,000      23.7 Manufacturing                          555,100      17.3 Government                             382,200      11.9 Finance/insurance/real estate          266,700       8.3 Transporation/public utilities         208,900       6.5 Construction                           128,700       4.0 Mining                                   2,100       0.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Employment &amp; Earnings, Bureau of Labor Statistics (America's Top Rated Cities, a statistical handbook: Universal Reference Publications)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

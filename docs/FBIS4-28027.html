			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the 7 June PASASON: "Hail Success of the </F> Visit to Our Country by Premier of the DPRK Administrative  Council"]    [Text] At the invitation of Comrade Khamtai Siphandon,  prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR],  Comrade Kang Song-san, premier of the DPRK Administrative  Council, led a high-level delegation from the DPRK to pay an  official, friendship visit to the LPDR from 3 to 6 June.  Comrade Kang Song-san and his delegation were accorded a warm  welcome of comradeship and fraternity by Comrade Prime Minister  Khamtai Siphandon and Lao people in all places the delegation  visited.    During the visit, Comrade Kang Song-san and his delegation  paid a courtesy call on Comrade Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of  the LPDR. The call proceeded in an atmosphere of profound  cordiality and friendship. The DPRK delegation also visited  various places of economic and cultural significance in the  capital and Vientiane Province. Official talks between a  high-level LPDR delegation of led by Comrade Khamtai Siphandon  and the high-level DPRK delegation led by Comrade Kang Song-san  were held at the Prime Minister's Office in Vientiane. In the  talks which proceeded in an atmosphere of close friendship and  profound mutual understanding, the two sides informed each other  of the outstanding situations in their respective countries.  They also expressed their definite intention to further  promote, expand, and strengthen, ever more fruitfully, the  friendly relations and cooperation in the economic and other  fields. Noteworthy is that during the visit, the two sides  signed an agreement on the economic, scientific, and technical  cooperation between the Lao and Korean Governments. The  agreement was signed in furtherance of the implementation of the  protocol on economic, scientific, and technical cooperation  between the two countries. The protocol was signed in Pyongyang  on 10 December 1993 on the occasion of the visit to the DPRK by  our Lao high-level party and state delegation led by Comrade  Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon. Stipulated in the said  agreement are various DPRK cooperation projects of various  fields in the LPDR, such as the cooperation projects in the  areas of agriculture, mining industry, wood processing industry,  and the construction of hydroelectric works which will begin in  certain provinces in the northern region and in the plain of the  central region in the subsequent years.    The success of this visit to the LPDR by the premier of the  DPRK Administrative Council has brought about new steps of  development in the long-standing, good relations and  cooperation, in particular in the economic field and between the  parties, states, and peoples of Laos and Korea. The Lao people  would like to wholeheartedly hail the glorious success of the  high-level DPRK delegation in this visit to the LPDR. The Lao  people pledge to do their utmost to, together with the fraternal  Korean people, contribute to fruitfully promoting and expanding  and increasingly developing the existing good, friendly  relations and cooperation between the parties, states, and  peoples of Laos and Korea as well as to translating into reality  the agreement on the economic, scientific, and technical  cooperation. This will bring about benefits to the two peoples  of Laos and Korea and contribute to promoting and establishing  peace, stability, friendship, and cooperation among various  countries in the Asia- Pacific region and the rest of the world.</p>

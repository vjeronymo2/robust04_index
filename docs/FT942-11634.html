			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Iran sharply devalues rial Iran, its currency sliding on the open market, yesterday in effect devalued the rial and reintroduced a multi-tier exchange rate system, Reuter reports from Tehran. The central bank governor, Mr Mohammad Hossein Adeli, said state banks would offer dollars at 50 rials below the open market rate for certain imports. This would mean banks selling dollars at about 2,700 rials, compared with the official selling rate of 1,750. The decision officially puts an end to a single-rate exchange system introduced in March last year as a main element of the government's economic liberalisation. Money dealers said the announcement did not significantly affect open market rates. Iranian money dealers in London quoted the dollar at 2,880 rials, 50 higher than Tuesday, the D-Mark at 1,750 rials and the pound at 4,350 rials  -all record highs.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Opposition grows in France to Maastricht OPPOSITION to the Maastricht treaty on European economic and political union continues to grow in France ahead of next month's referendum, with latest opinion polls showing that the 'no' vote has risen to 46-47 per cent. After Denmark voted against the treaty in June, the French vote on September 20 is seen as critical for the plans to deepen European union. A poll conducted by the CSA research institute for today's L'Evenement du Jeudi magazine marks a new low in French support for European union. It indicated that 53 per cent of voters would approve Maastricht, while 47 per cent would reject it. Another poll for Japanese broker Daiwa Securities showed a 54-46 per cent majority for the treaty. French support for Maastricht was around 70 per cent in early June before the referendum campaign began, according to most opinion polls, but had fallen to 56-57 per cent by early this month. The socialist government, which has led the pro-Maastricht lobby and would be seriously embarrassed by a negative result, yesterday appointed Mr Jack Lang, the flamboyant arts and education minister, and Ms Elizabeth Guigou, the glamorous minister of European affairs, to co-ordinate its campaign. Their appointment was seen as an attempt to liven up the hitherto lacklustre debate. Paris financial markets were depressed during the day by rumours about the CSA poll, which was announced on TV after the markets closed. The CAC 40 Index fell again yesterday, having fallen most of last week, to close 0.14 per cent down at 1,734. The growth of opposition to Maastricht in France is undoubtedly linked to dissatisfaction with President Mitterrand and the socialists. This mood has been fuelled by the latest economic data which has underlined the sluggish state of the French economy. Until now the referendum campaign has been relatively low-profile and, unusually for France, there has been little analysis of the intellectual issues behind the debate. One reason is that August is traditionally the month for long summer holidays in France. Another is that the political agenda has been dominated by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The appointment of Mr Lang and Ms Guigou to orchestrate the government's campaign is clearly designed to liven things up. Mr Lang, a tireless self-publicist and a firm favourite of President Francois Mitterrand, orchestrated the socialists' campaigns for the 1979 European elections and the 1988 presidential elections. He has already assembled a committee of 'celebrities' to campaign in favour of Maastricht, including actors Gerard Depardieu, Jeanne Moreau and Catherine Deneuve. French industrial production fell by 0.4 per cent in June, according to official figures. The main reason was the poor performance of the energy and construction sectors, where output fell by 1.37 per cent and 4.76 per cent respectively. The June fall followed one of 1.6 per cent in May.</p>

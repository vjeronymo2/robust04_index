			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wm Jacks cuts deficit to Pounds 0.4m William Jacks, the motor dealer, cut losses from Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 417,000 pre-tax for the year to end-January. Turnover of Pounds 38.9m compared with Pounds 42m previously. The results took account of exceptional provisions of Pounds 114,000 following management reorganisations and interest charges of Pounds 789,000 (Pounds 1.11m). An extraordinary charge of Pounds 97,000 arose on the closure of the Caxton bodyshop operations. Losses per share were reduced to 5.48p (6.64p). Jacks is ultimately owned by Johan Holdings, incorporated in Malaysia.</p>

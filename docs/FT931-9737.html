			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mixed outlook for Australian exports AUSTRALIA'S COMMODITY exports face mixed prospects in the next five years, with mineral and energy resources providing the main boost to the sagging economy. The official forecasting agency, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, says the minerals sector will see a reasonable improvement in prices in the medium term while prices of agricultural commodities will stay relatively flat, then start to drift down again after 1995. Mr Brian Fisher, executive director of Abare, told an annual forecasting conference last week that Australia's commodity exports in 1992-93 would rise 8 per cent to ADollars 47.4bn, thanks mainly to the weaker Australian dollar. Minerals would hold their ground in the 1990s, he said, with several major new projects planned or being put into operation this year. These included the world class Yandi and Marandoo iron ore mines, Mt Keith and Yackabindie nickel mines, and Century and McArthur River lead and zinc mines. Mr Jerry Ellis, executive general manager of BHP Minerals, said that during the last two years, the mineral and energy sector grew 4.2 per cent annually, compared with the average growth of 0.9 per cent of the Australian economy. Abare expects gold production to fall slightly to 238 tonnes in 1992-93, followed by similar declines in the following two years. However, output should grow strongly to 255 tonnes in 1995. Expenditure in gold exploration in the next three years is expected to remain at the current level of just over ADollars 300m. Abare also forecasts strong growth in Australian coal exports despite falling prices. Exports of black coal are forecast to reach 188m tonnes in 2004 from the current rate of 126m tonnes a year, while Thermal coal exports are expected to double in that period to 124m tonnes a year. Asian demand for thermal coal is expected to double from about 96m tonnes in 1996-97 to about 187m tonnes by 2004. Japanese thermal coal imports are also forecast to rise strongly, from 49m tonnes to about 86m tonnes in 2004. Wheat also has a good outlook despite weaker prices. A few days after Australia was forced to import wheat for the first time in more than 40 years, Abare predicted a 20 per cent increase in planting, expecting to result in a significant increase on this year's harvest of 15.3m tonnes. It said there were several factors causing world demand for wheat to outstrip production. On the downtrend is wool, of which Australia has an oversupply despite falling production. Abare forecasts that 1992-93 shorn wool production will fall to 837,000 tonnes in 1992-93 from 875,000 tonnes last year. But Mr Mac Drysdale, chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, told the Abare conference that if wool was a manufactured product the factory would now be closed. 'We have 3.98m bales in the official stockpile. We have a growing unofficial stockpile where growers are holding wool back in stores on farms. We have a semi-processed stockpile and at the same time we have relatively high production figures in Australia,' Mr Drysdale said.</p>

Official and media reactions have been very strong since as  many as more than 60 Palestinians were killed and a lot more  wounded in a single day, the worst bloodshed since Israel seized  the Arab lands in 1967.    Arab governments and public opinion, Palestinians in  particular, have held the Israeli Government responsible for the  massacre. They demanded effective measures be taken to protect  the Palestinians under Israeli occupation, disarming of Jewish  settlers and Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories.    In downtown Amman, a huge rally was held today to protest  against the massacre. Jordanian parliamentarians expressed  their indignation, saying the appalling crime posed a serious  challenge to peace in the region.    Jordan has also announced a three-day mourning for the  victims as of today upon the directive of King Husayn.    The Palestinian leadership has decided to recall all its  negotiators in Cairo and Paris for consultations on future  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in the wake of the massacre.    In Lebanon, Palestinians closed their refugee camps and  burnt  tires today in protest against the massacre.    In Beirut's Shatila and al-Burayj refugee camps, Palestinian  demonstrators carried a coffin draped in the Palestinian flag in  a symbolic funeral for the victims.    In Saudi Arabia, a government spokesman denounced the  "regrettable incident, which is characterized by extremism,  fanaticism and non-respect of human rights."    Oil-rich gulf newspapers today condemned "the horrible  massacre."    An article in "AL-KHALEEJ," a daily of the United Arab  Emirates, said the conscience of the world must not skip over  "the direct responsibility" of the United States for "this  horrible massacre" since the United States is "the cherisher of  Israel."    In their editorials today, Qatari newspapers called on the  international community to "inflict on Israel a due punishment  appropriate to the size of the aforesaid crime," urging  Palestinian leadership to "suspend negotiations with Israel."    The English-language Qatari newspaper "GULF TIMES" said that  the declaration of principles signed by the Rabin government  with the Palestine Liberation Organization has not changed  "Israel's policy of protecting Jewish terrorist settlers."    A Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Israeli  Government should be responsible for the killing since it  sponsored Jewish settlements inside the occupied Arab  territories.    The spokesman said sheer denunciation is not enough.  Decisive measures are needed more than ever before to protect  the Palestinian people.    He also said that Kuwait, while offering condolences to the  Palestinian people, calls for international efforts to ensure  the rights of the Palestinian people to statehood on their own  land.</p>

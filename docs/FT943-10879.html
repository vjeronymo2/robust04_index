			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Expansion of services sector slows in the east Eastern Germany's services sector, which expanded rapidly after unification, is slowing because the industrial base is too small and not competitive enough to allow the services sector to expand further, according to a report issued by three economic institutes, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. The report also warns that unless the high level of investments is maintained and the federal government extends further sub-sidies to the privatised sector, there is little chance that the east will 'catch up' with west Germany. The DIW in Berlin, the Institute for Economic Research in Halle and the Institute for World Economy in Kiel show that compared to the last quarter of 1993, the gross value of the services sector, at 1991 prices, declined in the first quarter of this year - by DM0.7bn to DM13.3bn. Over the same period, eastern Germany's gross domestic product fell from DM56.1bn to DM52.2bn. The value of manu-facturing output fell to DM10.3bn during the first quarter of this year compared with DM11.9bn over the last three months of 1993. It adds that high labour unit costs and an under-capitalised privatised sector are hindering competitiveness. One area of consistent growth is construction, which increased to DM8.9bn from DM8.6bn in the first three months of 1994.</p>

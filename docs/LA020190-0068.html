			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PROGRESS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN IS MIXED BAG  </P> <P> A progress report on Inglewood's affirmative action program this week said  minority- and women-owned businesses are well represented in some types of city  contracts but are disappointingly low in others.  </P> <P> "I can't give us an A but I can't give us a failing grade, either," Shirley  Williams, the city's employee relations and personnel director, said in an  interview.  </P> <P> "I feel the city is making an effort, and we're succeeding in many areas."  </P> <P> The progress report presented to the City Council on Tuesday said 63.7% of  large city-funded construction contracts totaling more than $1 million went to  minority- and women-owned firms. About 14% of the construction contracts of  less than $25,000 went to such firms, for a total of about $92,000. The report  covered an 18-month period from April, 1988, to October, 1989.  </P> <P> Participation in service contracts was 19%, or $901,000. But participation in  procurement contracts was less than 1% and confined primarily to purchases of  less than $5,000.  </P> <P> Williams said participation by minority groups and women in procurement  contracts is the primary area that is lagging behind.  </P> <P> She said the city sent notification of upcoming bids to minority- and  women-owned firms but very few businesses applied. In an attempt to encourage  participation, city officials have sent letters to find out why the response  rate was so low.  </P> <P> The city's affirmative action policy does not specify any percentage targets  for participation by minority groups and women. It states that the city should  encourage participation by minority- and women-owned businesses in all city  contracts.  </P> <P> "There is always room for improvement, but we are on track," Councilman Jose  Fernandez said. "We want all members of the community to participate in city  contracts."  </P></p>

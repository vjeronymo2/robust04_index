			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / How to Spend It: Small company, big following Cobra &amp; Bellamy has always been one of those small London shops that had a reputation and an influence out of all proportion to its size. Its two partners and owners, Veronica Manussis and Tania Hunter, have had a way of sensing the mood of a moment almost before it arrived and offering a growing band of aficionados the jewellery they did not know they wanted until they saw it. On Monday there is a big milestone in the development of the company - it opens a large and lavish new branch in the newly glamorised Dickins &amp; Jones store in London's Regent Street and it launches its first ever mail order brochure. For those unfamiliar with Cobra &amp; Bellamy, it started by selling period costume jewellery, then moved on to popularising Art Deco pieces. Today it still sells Art Deco inspired pieces but it is better known for an interesting partnership with the Italian jewellery designer Barbara Bertagnolli, who designs intricately interesting pieces for them in 24-carat gold with richly coloured gemstones. Their glass-based strings of pearls, using original 1920s and 1930s clasps, are always a huge success with those who cannot afford the real thing. Now, with the new shop to supply and mail order customers to keep happy, Manussis and Hunter have introduced a special Cobra &amp; Bellamy line of their own, mostly very well-priced, very strong and simple pieces in either hallmarked silver or 22-carat gold-plated silver. Amber is a big new development, too. For chaps there are some elegant cufflinks and retro watches sell between a very reasonably-priced Pounds 26 and Pounds 37 (but hurry, each Friday's consignment sells out before the following Friday). For a mail-order brochure ring 071-730 9993. It costs Pounds 5 which is refundable on the first Pounds 50 order. Otherwise visit the shops either in Dickins &amp; Jones or the original branch at 149 Sloane Street, London, SW1X 9BZ.</p>

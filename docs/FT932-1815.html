			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Zeneca rights likely to be seen as a success THE Pounds 1.3bn rights issue from Zeneca, which closed at midnight, is likely to be seen as a success. With the shares standing at 618p yesterday, down 4p, compared to the 600p rights price, institutional investors are expected to have taken up their rights. The stock market was apparently unworried by the issue, with the FT-SE 100 index rising 24 points to close at 2903.4 yesterday. However, Zeneca, the bioscience business demerged this month from ICI, has a larger proportion of private shareholders than many companies, estimated at near 25 per cent of the capital. Such investors are usually less likely to exercise their rights than institutions. As a result the take up could be less than the 90 per cent plus figure often regarded as a good result for a rights issue. However, SG Warburg, the lead underwriter to the issue, would hope to place any rump in the market rather than make a call on sub-underwriters to fulfil their obligations. With such a large issue, even a small percentage left would represent a sizeable placing in money terms. Investors may be encouraged to buy extra shares because of the high yield Zeneca offers, and the feeling that healthcare stocks have been oversold because of fears regarding the impending healthcare reforms in the US.</p>

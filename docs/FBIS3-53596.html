Mr. Brown conveyed to the regent a message from President Bill  Clinton addressed to his majesty the king. The U.S. secretary  met other officials for economic talks and the negative economic  effects of the blockade on the port of al-'Aqabah. He said that  the removal of trade barriers and the lifting of the Arab  boycott of Israel would help speed the economic growth in the  region.    At the Royal Court meeting His Royal Highness Crown Prince  Hasan told the American Secretary of Commerce that international  trade should not be limited to the sole purpose of trade but  also take into consideration human needs. The regent said that  a humanitarian criteria in trade should be introduced to  guarantee the rights of states and the individual, particularly  with regard to the Middle East. His royal highness said a lot  has to be done towards regional economic cooperation. [passage  omitted]    Commenting on calls for lifting the Arab boycott of Israel,  the regent said:    [Begin Hasan recording] This is a question that has to be  discussed within the context of peace making clearly. But, I  was very happy during the MEED [Middle East Economic Digest]  conference in London last week to emphasize the importance of  the Middle East as free trade area. This is a goal to which we  all have to work with (?conscience) and a great deal of  understanding. And I think that this understanding is  developing as a result of these personal contacts. [end  recording]    Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali also discussed with  the American official economic ties and the inspection of  shipping into the port of al-'Aqabah and the need to lift the  blockade.    [Begin Brown recording] I now am increasingly sensitive  about the impact that it's having on the Jordanian economy and I  intend to pursue those discussions when I get back to  Washington. There certainly ought to be ways so as to be in  compliance with United Nations resolutions but in ways that do  not debilitate the economy of Jordan. [end recording]</p>

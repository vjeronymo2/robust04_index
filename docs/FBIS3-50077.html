			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] Dr. Mate Granic, the deputy prime  minister and foreign minister, and Dr. Zarko Domljan, the deputy  chairman of the [Croatian] Assembly, have left for Strasbourg,  where they are to have talks with Council of Europe officials.  Before he left, Minister Granic held a brief news conference,  that was also attended by our reporter Branko [word indistinct].    Setting out the aim of his visit to Strasbourg, Dr. Mate  Granic said:    [Granic] "Croatia has special guest status in the Council of  Europe, while at this moment the process of it becoming a full  member has been frozen. The basic aims of my stay in Strasbourg  will be to explain Croatian positions in the talks in Geneva,  especially the joint declaration between the Republic of Croatia  and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the talks with the  Bosnian Muslim side, and there will also be a discussion of all  open questions during a meeting with the most senior officials  in the Council of Europe. A news conference will also be  organized."    [Announcer] After he was asked to do so by journalist,  Minister Granic also set out the standpoints and plans of the  Republic of Croatia regarding the Partnership for Peace [PFP]  initiative.    [Granic] "Croatia welcomes this initiative. President  Tudjman, even during the peace talks in Bonn welcomed the NATO  decisions, and also welcomed the initiative during his talks  with Mrs. Madeleine Albright. Our ambassador in the Council of  Europe did the same during a meeting of CSCE senior officials.  Croatia will carefully study all the documents and in a very  short time send its offer to NATO. It should be stressed that  Croatia is conscious of specific realities -- namely that 25  percent of our territory is under UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] supervision. At the same time, Croatia will do  everything to develop and strengthen democratic institutions,  especially the Croatian Army, which has no roots in the Warsaw  Treaty [Organization], but developed out of a defensive war the  system of which has the same basis as in all democratic  countries of Europe; it makes use of all the best expert and  scientific knowledge and also democratic (?rules). We will very  rapidly get in touch with the North Atlantic Alliance and after  this we will send it our offer. This will be Croatia's offer to  the PFP initiative."    [Announcer] On his return from Strasbourg on Tuesday [25  January] Dr. Mate Granic will be present at talks in Ljubljana  between the Croatian and Slovenian prime ministers. Asked what  he expects from this meeting, Dr. Granic said:    [Granic] "I believe that over these last 10 days or so an  important step has been taken in the preparation of this  meeting. I will be joined by Croatian Prime Minister Nikica  Valentic because this will be a meeting between prime ministers  and foreign ministers, and I think that an important step will  be taken to resolve our problems, and of course prepare for the  signing of very important agreements. We believe that all the  conditions exist for an agreement to be reached on all economic  questions -- the questions of Krsko [nuclear plant] and  Ljubljanska Banka [Ljubljana Bank] and also agreements on  property and legal issues, as well as an economic agreement and  numerous other important agreements."    [Announcer] According to Minister Granic there will also be  talks on the Bay of Piran, the question of borders, highways,  and other questions important to Croatia and Slovenia.</p>

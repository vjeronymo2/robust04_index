			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Government offers telecoms groups wider superhighway role The government has challenged British Telecommunications and the UK's growing band of public telecoms operators to play a full part in developing the country's information superhighway. In a Command Paper* published yesterday, it urged the operators to gain experience by applying for local franchises to deliver a full range of services, including broadcast entertainment, to homes within the franchise area. The paper confirmed, however, that the government does not plan to let BT broadcast entertainment to homes nationally before 2001 at the earliest. The issue is bitterly contested by BT, which has been banned from offering broadcast entertainment over its network so that cable television can establish itself. Cable television companies are, however, not barred from offering telecoms services. The Independent Television Commission, regulatory body for commercial television, has advertised nine new local delivery licences - as cable franchises are called - the latest in the past few days. They are for four separate franchises in the Midlands, covering 248,000 homes. The commission emphasised yesterday that BT could have applied for cable television franchises like any other company. BT said that the government decision meant 'the great leap in broadband communication we were hoping to provide has been postponed for several years'. It is clear that BT does not intend to apply for large cable franchises, such as that currently on offer which covers Northern Ireland. Instead it wants the freedom to spend Pounds 15bn to create its own modern network to compete against the cable companies. Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, said he had appointed a group of senior industrialists to advise him on multimedia and the information superhighway. They includes Mr Don Cruickshank, director-general of Oftel, the industry watchdog, and Mr Peter Job, chief executive of Reuters. BT is permitted to offer services including video-on-demand and home shopping over its national network, contrary to an FT report earlier this week.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 25 TASS -- The Committee for Defence  and Security and the Committee for International Affairs of the  Council of the Federation, the upper chamber of the Russian  parliament, have recommended the latter to agree to send an  additional 300-man military contingent to reinforce the U.N.  peace-keeping forces in the Sarajevo zone, as requested by the  Russian president.    This decision was adopted today during a joint meeting of  the  foregoing committees, which discussed Boris Yeltsin's  corresponding request to the Council of the Federation, made in  reply to an appeal of the U.N. secretary-general, ITAR-TASS was  told by Petr Premyak, vice-chairman of the Committee for Defence.    This item was included in today's agenda of the upper  chamber's work. The committees also want the parliament to  recommend the Foreign Ministry "to find political ways for  normalising relations in that region, instead of steadily  drawing Russia into the conflict," the deputy said. He also  stated that Russian troops were being deployed in the most  difficult spots of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In his opinion, this  is because representatives of the Russian Defence Ministry had  not been included in the command of the U.S. joint forces. "This  omission must be corrected," the Russian MPs believe.    The meeting also discussed cash allowances to Russian  servicemen. They now receive from the United Nations wages,  money for the upkeep of hardware, and food allowances in amounts  equalling to those received by units deployed at home. However,  in accordance with traditional rules, these payments should be  100-200 per cent higher in combat conditions. Premyak said that  this point should be included in the State Duma's bill on the  Russian U.N. peacekeeping contingent, which is now being drawn  up.    Russian airborne troops commander Colonel-General Yevgeniy  Podkolzin, who attended the meeting of the two committees, told  ITAR-TASS that there were now twelve hundred Russian servicemen  in the conflict zone. If the Council of the Federation decides  to send there an additional contingent, it will apparently be  flown there in his planes this April.</p>

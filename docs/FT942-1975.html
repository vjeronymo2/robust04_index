			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Swedes may oust PM before EU entry: Prime minister Carl Bildt is set to pay a high price for his reform programme Ornately-decorated maypoles are sprouting in villages and parks all over Sweden as the country prepares for the traditional midsummer dancing and parties to mark the start of the July summer holiday. After that the nation will fall almost silent, for almost a month. But this year the long-cherished summer break will be little more than a lull in a political storm. A general election on September 18 will be followed by a referendum on November 13 on whether Sweden should join the European Union. Coming after a period of deep recession, during which some of the most basic tenets of Swedish society have been challenged, either poll on its own would have been a watershed: together, they represent a fateful and complex double choice. The election pits the incumbent right-centre coalition of the prime minister, Mr Carl Bildt, comprising his conservative Moderate party, the Folk (or Liberal) party, the Centre party and the Christian Democrat party, against the Social Democrats, led by Mr Ingvar Carlsson, a former prime minister. Boosted by opinion poll ratings of around 50 per cent, the Social Democrats are confident of returning to power, ending three years in which Mr Bildt set out to transform Sweden from a country dominated by its famous welfare state into a full-blown, open market economy. It is a battle about the fundamental nature of Swedish society. But so, too, is the campaign on EU membership. For the Swedes, joining the Union involves abandoning a deeply entrenched aversion to big power blocs that has led them throughout this century to maintain their neutrality. The Social Democrats have plenty of election ammunition. Pointing to record unemployment - the real jobless rate stands at an unprecedented 14 per cent of the workforce - a large budget deficit and the fastest-rising national debt among OECD countries, they argue that Mr Bildt's reformist mission has exacted too high a social price. 'Their policy of fighting an inflation that wasn't there any more deepened the recession and postponed the upturn,' Mr Carlsson says. He insists the 'Swedish model' requires refinement, not wholesale reform, in which the target is to preserve the main structure of the welfare state. 'It was not the cost of the Swedish model that caused the crisis, it was an enormous boom in private borrowing. It was not the public sector that suddenly exploded.' Mr Bildt's response is that three years of reform, in which there has been privatisation, deregulation (in areas such as energy, telecommunications, transport and broadcasting) and trimming of welfare provision, has made the Swedish economy significantly more competitive. But with state spending still close to 70 per cent of gross domestic product, he argues that more reform is needed to consolidate this year's return to growth. 'If you go back 70-80 years in this country the Social Democrats were the modernisers and the traditionalists were the right. Now it is the other way around. The Social Democrats are the feudal barons trying to retard the advent of a modern society. They are appealing to people who fear the future, people who fear change.' Opinion polls suggest, however, that the electorate has tired of the government's reformist zeal, making the Social Democrats clear favourites to win in September. But the question of EU membership presents an awkward problem for both Mr Carlsson and Mr Bildt. Despite a decision by the Social Democrats' party congress last weekend to support Swedish membership, polls show that more than 50 per cent of the party's supporters oppose joining the Union. Mr Carlsson has thus adopted a cautious approach to the EU question, insisting that the emphasis must be on winning the election, and only then should the party throw its full weight into the campaign for a Yes vote in the EU referendum. This has infuriated Mr Bildt, for whom EU membership is an overriding political goal. Faced with polls showing a solid lead for the well-organised and united No to the EU campaign, the prime minister has called on Mr Carlsson to take a more active role in winning over opinion within Social Democratic ranks. Only yesterday, in a letter to Mr Carlsson, he repeated his appeal and suggested the two men meet in August to discuss a joint approach to Swedish membership. 'It is their silence that is the problem,' declares Mr Bildt. To which Mr Carlsson replies: 'Every time he speaks, we (the pro-EU lobby) lose more votes to the No side.' Mr Bildt stresses the importance of participating in Europe's political and security structures and of building open markets; Mr Carlsson speaks of how co-operation within the EU will strengthen left-of-centre policies against unemployment and attacks on the welfare state. Mr Bildt faces a dilemma. The painful - and ironic - reality may be that Swedes will accept the historical step of joining the EU that he so passionately advocates only if it is taken under the guidance of the Social Democrats, guardians of the 'Swedish model'.</p>

According to the FALA Northern Command, the reports are not true  and it is part of the Luanda government's dirty politics.    The Northern Command agreed however that UNITA was involved  in nonoffensive military maneuvers in sea and river waters, with  a view to protecting the strategic city of Soyo. It said the  maneuvers will continue until the threat against the city from  Cabinda disappears. It also said the maneuvers do not  constitute a threat to public security. On 2 March, FALA forces  captured a ship carrying war materiel, military uniforms, and  fuel destined for government troops in (Chissanga). The ship,  its cargo, and the crew continue to be detained by UNITA.</p>

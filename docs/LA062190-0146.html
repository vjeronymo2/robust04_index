			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: CHANNEL THREE BACK IN PICTURE;  </P> <P> BAND THAT WENT BLANK AFTER PUNK ROCK BEGINNINGS IS SWITCHING ON WITH A REUNION  IN LONG BEACH  </P> <P> In most places without cable, Channel 3 on the television dial leaves you in a  video void of white noise and static.  </P> <P> That image had its appeal a decade ago for Mike Magrann and Kimm Gardener, two  young punk rockers who grew up together in Cerritos. They dubbed their band  Channel Three and began playing songs full of noisy commentary about some of  the pictures in society, in the punk rock scene and in themselves that they  thought needed adjusting.  </P> <P> After a seven-year career that saw the release of three albums and two EPs,  several national tours and considerable musical maturation beyond those dark,  hollering hard-core punk beginnings, Channel Three went blank in 1987. But  recent developments have prompted Magrann and Gardener to switch the picture  back on, at least temporarily. Channel Three will stage a reunion show Friday  night at Bogart's in Long Beach. They also will make a live television  appearance Friday at 4:30 p.m. on the "Request Video" show on Anaheim-based  KDOC Channel 56.  </P> <P> The occasion for the reunion concert is the recent release of "Rejected," a  wryly titled collection of demo recordings that Channel Three made from 1985 to  1987 in a foiled bid to land a major-label contract. Released on Lone Wolf  Records, a custom label owned by a Canadian fan of the band, "Rejected" is a  welcome addition to the Channel Three file, full of boisterous, Rolling  Stones-style rock and well-wrought lyrics by Magrann, one of the best musical  storytellers to come out of the early '80s Southern California punk boom.  </P> <P> In an interview this week in Magrann's apartment in Seal Beach -- a spacious,  airy place with a skylight and contemporary, pastel decor upstairs; a shrine to  Elvis Presley and assorted punk rockers in a small den downstairs -- the two  Channel Three founders said they are not trying to jump back into the rock 'n'  roll success sweepstakes.  </P> <P> Magrann, who fronted the band as its singer, and Gardener, who played guitar,  think it's fun that Channel Three has found a cult audience in Europe, where  its early, hard-core recordings were released last year on a CD called "The  Skinhead Years." They also are happy that two of their old punk anthems turned  up recently on an episode of the television show "21 Jump Street."  </P> <P> But Magrann, 29, and Gardener, 28, aren't keen about renewing their pursuit of  a full-time rock 'n' roll career. Weariness with the careerist aspects of rock  music caused Channel Three to break up the first time around.  </P> <P> "It got so business-oriented that it just wasn't fun anymore," recalled the  tall, deep-voiced Magrann, whose black hair sweeps upward in a modified version  of a Presley pompadour. "That's part of the reason we drifted apart. When it  got to the point where the band was a deal to be offered to people and argued  over the phone, it wasn't the band anymore."  </P> <P> Channel Three had no trouble building a following in its early days on the punk  scene, where it first emerged with shows at Orange County's early-'80s punk  breeding ground, the Cuckoo's Nest in Costa Mesa. Channel Three's blazing-fast  music and rebellious themes fit right in with what slam-dancing, stage-diving  young audiences were looking for. But as time went on, Channel Three found  itself in a dilemma faced by many of the early punk bands: should it keep  playing hard and fast, thereby guaranteeing it a solid following, or should it  follow the inner voices that said there must be more to musical life than  hollered vocals and racing tempos?  </P> <P> Channel Three's break with hard-core came when it shifted from Posh Boy  Records, the label that first recorded such bands as T.S.O.L., Agent Orange,  the Adolescents and Social Distortion, to Enigma Records. A 1984 EP,  "Airborne," and the 1985 album "Last Time I Drank" were melodic hard-rock  albums, not punk records.  </P> <P> "They're both deleted," Magrann said. "We were more or less in confrontation  with Enigma before ('Last Time I Drank') even came out, which does wonders for  your marketing. They were expecting to take over a punk band which was a proven  seller. We wanted to experiment."  </P> <P> The experimentation continued with the tapes now collected on "Rejected."  Originally inspired by the Ramones' breakneck pop, the members of Channel Three  became interested in exploring such influences as the Rolling Stones, the Band,  and country music. Magrann's creative writing studies at Cal State Long Beach  came in handy as he crafted literate but unpretentious lyrics such as the  half-funny, half-pathetic relationship crackup ballad "Gone Drinkin'." Several  other songs honed in on a recurring theme that runs through all of Channel  Three's releases -- the fear that life is going to grow stale and soggy as time  goes on, making it hard to keep a youthful spark lit.  </P> <P> Channel Three's shift in style made it a hard band to sell, said Steve Rennie,  the former Avalon Attractions vice president who took over as the band's  manager in the mid-'80s and tried unsuccessfully to sign it to a new recording  deal.  </P> <P> "I think they alienated some of the punk fans, and they weren't quite  mainstream enough" for major labels, Rennie said. Maybe if Channel Three could  have kept playing and recording for a few more years, Rennie suggested, it  could have caught the same wave that has elevated Social Distortion from a  former cult band for hard-core punks to mainstream-contender status.  </P> <P> "People were saying, 'Is it a punk band, or is it a rock 'n' roll band?'  recalled Gardener, who still wears punkish spikes in his long, reddish-blond  hair. "If we had waited three years down the line, the timing would have been  better."  </P> <P> The two Channel Three founders, friends since second grade, don't see their  reunion as the start of another all-out attempt to land a recording deal and  revitalize their rock careers.  </P> <P> Gardener and Magrann both said they are happy with less ambition-driven forms  of music making. Besides working a daytime job in a metal shop, Magrann knocks  out blues and rockabilly sets with a band called Blue Diamonds, which sometimes  appears at the cozy Sunset Pub in Sunset Beach.  </P> <P> Gardener, a manager for a La Palma computer company, played in a band called  Bulldog until a year ago. Now that he is out of the rock scene and no longer  has to devote time to booking shows and paying attention to band business  affairs (a role he played in Channel Three), Gardener said he has the time to  polish his guitar technique by taking lessons. Both former punkers are engaged  to be married.  </P> <P> Besides Magrann and Gardener, the Channel Three lineup for the show at Bogart's  features Ron Wood (the last of the band's 11 drummers), guitarist Mike Dimkich,  who played bass in the final incarnation of Channel Three, and bassist Alan  Bloch, late of Concrete Blonde, who is filling in for longtime member James  Lansford, who last year moved to West Germany to work for a record company.  </P> <P> Magrann and Gardener said that Lansford, who co-wrote the songs on "Rejected,"  has suggested doing a new album for his German label, and perhaps staging a  Channel Three tour of Europe.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of talk," said Magrann. "The possibility of recording in the  future seems real attractive, because we all have tons of songs ready to go.  Promoters are calling. It's apparently a valuable commodity now. But if  anything comes, it has to be on our terms."  </P> <P> "I just don't see that the end of the rainbow is driving around in a van for 10  months of the year," Gardener said. "We did that."  </P> <P> Channel Three, Rhythm &amp; Booze and the Cause play Friday at 9 p.m. at  Bogart's in the Marina Pacifica Mall, 6288 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Long  Beach. Tickets: $10. Information: (213) 594-8975.  </P> <P>  PUNK FLASHBACK: Frontier Records will finally issue a CD version of "The  Adolescents," the bracing debut album by one of the key bands of the Orange  County punk-rock boom. The release is scheduled for next month, according to  label head Lisa Fancher. It is part of a CD-reissue program for Frontier, with  distribution through its major-label partner, RCA/BMG. Regrettably, the late,  lamented Pontiac Brothers won't be part of the CD reissue effort, because their  first two Frontier albums, "Doll Hut" and "Fiesta en la Biblioteca," never sold  more than a pittance when they first appeared, Fancher said.  </P> <P> GOSPEL OF THE BLUES: Borrowing a chapter from the Cowboy Junkies, who recorded  their acclaimed album "The Trinity Sessions" in a church, Huntington Beach  bluesman Robert Lucas is going to record his first full-length album live in a  cathedral in Montecito, near Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Lucas, who sings and plays guitar and harmonica, will be accompanied by bass,  mandolin and violin in the sessions, which are scheduled for July 1 through 3.  The album will be released this fall by AudioQuest, a new label that is an  offshoot of a San Clemente-based maker of high-tech sound components geared for  the audiophile market. Lucas will be playing solo shows every Tuesday night  through July and August at Takao in San Clemente, and every Thursday at  Cagney's in Huntington Beach.  </P></p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Woolwich cuts rates Woolwich building society this week became the latest to make overdraft rate cuts, although it had already reduced them in July to 0.78 per cent a month. The trend was started by Halifax two months ago and has been followed by most societies. Not only has Woolwich now lowered its rates to 0.76 per cent, matching the lowest available (from the Alliance &amp; Leicester), but it has raised credit interest rates to the same as those it pays on its ordinary instant access account, Prime Gold. Interest is tiered and pays 1.15 per cent from Pounds 1, 3.50 per cent from Pounds 500, 4.5 per cent from Pounds 10,000, 5 per cent from Pounds 25,000 and 5.1 per cent from Pounds 50,000. With no monthly or arrangement fee for overdrafts, this makes the Woolwich current account the market's leading cheque account for everyday use. On the downside, selected tiers of Woolwich's Premier 90 and Prime have been reduced, and its Tessa also is reduced by 0.1 per cent on the lowest tier and 0.25 per cent from Pounds 6,000. The fixed-rate market remains volatile. Five-year flat fixed rates from the societies have continued to be withdrawn and the only one left is the fixed-rate bond from Britannia, offering 8.25 per cent from Pounds 2,000. Newcastle this week launched a competitive bond, maturing on September 30 1998. It pays 8.5 per cent from Pounds 2,000 with a monthly option available, paying 8.25 per cent from Pounds 5,000. Five-year escalator bonds remain popular. The best now available is from West Bromwich. A minimum investment of Pounds 1,000 pays 7.5 per cent in the first year, rising to 11.5 per cent in the fifth.

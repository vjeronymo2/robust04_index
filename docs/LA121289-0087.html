			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Garage Sale Soon: When a Minnesota newspaper published a purported inventory of  the governor's mansion -- including 156 chairs, six television sets and 26  sofas -- a miffed Gov. Rudy Perpich and his wife, Lola, responded by proposing  the state sell off the place. In a huff at what she called criticism of her  family's life style, Lola Perpich said that she and the governor will ask the  1990 Legislature to sell the mansion and its contents and donate the proceeds  to help the homeless. The state attorney general's office will determine if a  sale of the 1910 mansion is possible.  </P> <P> Queen of the Bile: Today's the big day for hotel queen Leona Helmsley. U.S.  Dist. Judge John M. Walker Jr. will decide whether the dust-busting innkeeper  will exchange her designer clothes for a prison uniform. Convicted Aug. 30 of  evading $1.2 million in federal taxes, the 69-year-old Helmsley could get up to  127 years in prison.  </P> <P> Helmets On: Gary Busey, recovering from the head injury he suffered in a  motorcycle accident, has changed his mind and now advocates the use of helmets.  "Next time you're doing 45 miles per hour, look at the curb and think about  slam-dancing with it once, and you'll start thinking about helmets," Busey said  on the "Arsenio Hall Show." He was not wearing a helmet when his motorcycle  struck a Culver City curb, and in the months after the accident, he insisted on  his right not to wear head protection.  </P> <P> Animal Cracker: "Santa Paws" Bill Stovall wore flea-and-tick powder in his red  outfit last weekend in Pensacola, Fla., when he played Santa for about 100  animals in a fund-raiser for the Pensacola Humane Society. For $5, pets could  climb into Santa's lap and ask for a Christmas bone. "I've never had a pet that  is obnoxious, but every once in a while you get a kid that is," Stovall said.  </P></p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Border crossing plots on either side of the frontier between Spain and Portugal. The land borders the Minho river, which separates northern Portugal and Galicia. To go on the plots, the agent also is offering a range of Norwegian-style chalets built of Madeira pine with broad ornamental balconies. The agent is Babet, based in Merriott, Somerset (tel. 0460-76213). It claims that this type of building is particularly suitable for holiday homes because there is almost no humidity inside. When a property is left empty for a while, it does not become damp. On the Portuguese side, the price of a one-bedroom chalet on an average plot would, depending on foundations and site, be about Pounds 38,000, rising to Pounds 57,000 for three bedrooms. The cost could be a little more on the Spanish side. The chalets are best suited to a rural setting, and Babet suggests that anyone with guilt feelings about introducing a new building to such an environment could grow grass and wild flowers on the roof, as they do in Norway, after which the property would become near-invisible.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / International Company News in Brief Cummins Engine, the Indiana-based diesel engine and heavy-duty truck manufacturer, unveiled a small turnround to first-quarter net profits of Dollars 8.6m from losses of Dollars 34.3m a year earlier, AP-DJ reports from New York. The company benefited from cost-cutting, while demand for its mid-range engines remained strong. Sales were roughly unchanged at Dollars 881.3m and earnings per share came to 45 cents compared with losses of Dollars 2.44. ***** Capital Cities/ABC, the US media group, reported a fall in first-quarter earnings to Dollars 41.7m, or Dollars 2.51 a share, on revenues of Dollars 1.1bn, down from Dollars 58.6m, or Dollars 3.50 a share, on revenues of Dollars 1.26bn in the year-earlier quarter, Reuter reports from New York. The company said advertising demand had started to improve in the current second quarter, despite the continuing sluggish economy. ***** LSI Logic, the leading US maker of application-specific semiconductor devices, showed a sharp drop in first-quarter figures, Louise Kehoe reports from San Francisco.

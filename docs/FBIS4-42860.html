			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has sent a letter to UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali stating that the Turkish  Cypriot side has the will to conclude an agreement on the  confidence-building measures issue. Denktas also requested  including developments that occurred after 30 May.    According to information obtained by the ANATOLIA AGENCY,  Denktas pointed out in his letter that he has shown flexibility  on the issues concerning access to Maras [Varosha] as well as  the map submitted by the United Nations; he added, however, that  these positive developments were not conveyed in Butrus-Ghali's  Cyprus report.    In his letter Denktas noted: I have inspected the report  regarding your mission of goodwill and I will communicate to you  my assessment on this subject at a suitable time. Despite the  items in the report which are unacceptable and detrimental to  the Turkish Cypriot side, however, we are not in favor of  stopping the negotiation process on the confidence-building  measures.    Stating that these views were already conveyed to Gustave  Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special  representative to Cyprus, Denktas pointed out that the Turkish  Cypriot side had made its position on access to Maras quite  clear.    Recalling that the UN secretary general's report does not  reflect developments which occurred after 30 May, Denktas  requested that an addition to the report to include these  developments.</p>

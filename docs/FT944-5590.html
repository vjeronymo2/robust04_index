			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Telecoms study Amadeus Some of the world's leading telecommunications companies are vying to take a 25 per cent stake in Amadeus, the European computerised airline reservation service. Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK-based telecoms company, confirmed yesterday it was in talks with the Madrid-based organisation. Amadeus said yesterday it had been looking for a new shareholder since 1991 when Scandinavian Airlines System, a founder member, pulled out of the organisation to cut costs. It confirmed C&amp;W was a potential bidder, but declined to identify the other telecoms companies. It said an early decision was unlikely, and suggested it might be three to six months before terms could be agreed with a successful bidder. Amadeus was established by a group of airlines including Air France, Iberia and Lufthansa to create and manage a European airline reservation system in competition with Sabre of the US. The service is now breaking even at an operating level, although it says it would not be 'interesting to our investors until 1995-96'. It has, however, become interesting to the large telecommunications operators because it offers the possibility of a direct entry into the global travel industry. The big telecoms carriers are battling each other for business from multinational corporations, and services tailored to specific industries would give them a competitive edge. C&amp;W, for example, is in talks with Schlumberger about a possible alliance in the oil business, and to Digital Equipment, the US computer manufacturer, about custom packages for a number of industries.</p>

The military and geographical interest is very  clear. The Kashmir region joins three countries  geographically--Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China [as published].  The only surface route between China and Pakistan is the  Karakoram highway which passes through the Northern Areas. This  highway was inaugurated in 1978. This is the only route for  China to access the Arabian Sea. China has built another road  which joins Xinkiang with the western part of Tibet. This road  passes the uninhabited region of Aksai Chin which is in the  northeast of Ladakh. Although India still claims ownership of  Aksai Chin, this has become a part of China and is very  important for it from a military perspective because this is the  only route between two Chinese provinces.    This rough but unbelievably beautiful region is very  important for China and Pakistan for military reasons. China and  Pakistan will have to depend on the Karakoram highway if there  is a war with India to keep lines of communications and  transportation between the two countries open. God forbid, but  if the whole state of Jammu-Kashmir (which according to the  United Nations includes the Northern Areas) is put under UN  administration, this very important connection between China and  Pakistan will be lost. Neither country would tolerate such a  situation.    Historically, Gilgit, Nanada, and the Northern Areas  including Jammu and Kashmir were considered very important areas  between British India and China. The Nanda mountains is  especially important for several reasons. In the 18th century,  Nihatra had recognized Xinkiang as a tax-collecting power. They  paid 15 ounces of gold dust annually to Xinkiang. In exchange  they were permitted to use the grazing grounds in the Pamirs and  Sikkim. There was no clear and permanent border with Xinkiang.  This had become a tributary of Kashmir in the 19th century.  Later, the maps of the British era show it as part of the Indian  Subcontinent.    China is very interested in the Kashmir issue both from  geographic and military viewpoints. It appears to be very active  in at least two areas--Pakistan-China border issue and the Aksai  Chin issue. The first situation was created by the 1963  Pakistan-China border agreement. The document of the agreement  was ready by February 1963 and it was formally signed in Beijing  on 2 March 1963. At that time, China's borders around Gilgit and  Balistan were not settled. One year before May 1962 when the  Chinese government started serious discussions over the border  with Pakistan, the tension between China and the Soviet Union  had already increased. At that time it seemed that Gilgit was a  point of contention between China and the Soviet Union. One  Indian journalist had written about it in 1964.    Control of the whole area from Gilgit to the Pamirs could  have proved dangerous to the Soviet Central Asia. Therefore,  military interests forced the Soviet Union to support India on  the Kashmir issue in order to keep its control on Gilgit. That  way the United States could not establish a base against the  Soviet Union there.    When discussions to determine the border between China and  Pakistan started, an area covering 3400 square miles was  undecided. China, however, showed unusual flexibility and  generosity and Pakistan got 1350 square miles in the final  decision which included 750 square miles of area under Chinese  control. This agreement gave China 2050 square miles area which  was already under its control. In addition, three-fourths of the  Godon and Sainka hills area known as K-2 came under Pakistan's  control. India was extremely furious at this agreement. It said  that Pakistan has no right to such an agreement as this area is  part of Jammu and Kashmir state and Jammu and Kashmir is an  integral part of India. India also accused Pakistan of illegally  occupying the Northern Areas. However, it has been made clear in  Article 6 of the Pakistan-China agreement that the disputed  character of Jammu and Kashmir should be kept in mind. This is  the most important article of the agreement because this means  that China must be involved in any future discussions about  Jammu and Kashmir. China cannot be kept out. Article 6 of the  agreement states: "Both countries agree that after the dispute  between India and Pakistan is settled over Kashmir, the ruler of  this region will hold talks all over again with the government  of China and a new agreement will replace this agreement."  China's direct interest in what is happening in Jammu and  Kashmir is natural. The great interest of the United States  (from behind the UN facade) in Jammu and Kashmir region is  enough to make the Beijing government become alert and cautious.  The Western power thinks that China is moving very cunningly  when asking for new talks over the borders. Similarly, India and  China's dispute over Aksai Chin is also the cause of a great  interest for China in the Kashmir issue. Aksai Chin is a desert  and an unpopulated region in the northeast region of Ladakh. At  present it is under China's control. Its importance has  increased because China has built a road in this area which  unites its two border provinces--Xinkiang and Tibet. India still  is adamant that Aksai Chin is a part of Jammu and Kashmir state.  The British government in India had sent a proposal to Peking on  14 November 1899. In this note of 1899, the British Prime  Minister Sir Claude McDonald had said that the British  government of India suggests that keeping in mind the  forthcoming problems and uncertainties about the future, the  British government desires decisions about the border between  China and the British India. Thus, the 1899 note means that  Aksai Chin region was accepted as part of China. Some changes  occurred in 1905, however. The Aksai Chin region remained within  China's Xinkiang province. In 1914, the British government  included Aksai Chin in Tibetan maps very quietly. A conference  was held in October 1913 between British India and China in  Shimla. In this conference, the British government very cleverly  expanded the western border of Tibet to prove that Aksai Chin  was a part of Tibet. This was done to include Aksai Chin into  British India at the right time. However, the Shimla conference  failed and the map that was included in this conference does not  now have any official status. Independent India all of a sudden  showed Aksai Chin region part of India in its maps in 1954. Thus  this record was prepared to prove that Aksai Chin was also an  integral part of India. Then prime minister of India, the late  Nehru, wrote to the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to claim India's  ownership of Aksai Chin while erroneously referring to the 1899  agreement.    China, however, had completed a road between Xinkiang and  Tibet in 1950. This road passed through Aksai Chin. India could  not do anything about it except to make the whole affair more  complicated. The Survey of India agency published maps of  Jammu-Kashmir in 1952 to present them in the United Nations as  the Kashmir issue was introduced in the United Nations at that  time. These maps showed the Aksai Chin region as part of  Jammu-Kashmir so that this become a part of the UN proceedings.  This affair is still going on and the Aksai Chin affair is still  there. Whenever the Kashmir issue is discussed in the United  Nations, the important issue of Aksai Chin will also emerge  because it is there on the Indian maps. At that time, China had  to oppose it and become a party to this debate. India now claims  that China is occupying 12000 square miles of its territory.  This includes Aksai Chin and the areas that were given to  Pakistan in the 1961 Pakistan-China agreement.    This situation is very interesting to our American friends,  and unfortunately this is giving them plenty of material to  start mischief. However, Pakistan is not unaware of this  situation. China and Pakistan have a great responsibility for  the people of Kashmir. Both countries have always supported the  right of Kashmiri people for self-determination. The Security  Council resolutions are for resolving the Kashmir issue.  However, India is not moving even an inch, and had adopted an  aggressive and belligerent attitude. This has endangered peace  in this region. India and Pakistan have almost started a war in  Siachen glacier region. India is spending billions of rupees  daily in that place. That is why India wants to resolve the  Siachen glacier issue separately in order to reduce its expenses  there. This issue is related to Kashmir. India had crossed the  Line of Control in 1984 and had thus torn the Shimla Agreement  to shreds. Therefore, this issue cannot be discussed separately  with India. As for the border dispute between China and India,  we have already given details about it. The truth is that any  region around Jammu and Kashmir cannot be given to any country  until the Kashmir issue is resolved. The government of Pakistan  should take China into confidence and and tell the international  community that this state cannot be divided since it is waiting  for a resolution in the Security Council. In our opinion, this  is a very important point and deserves immediate  attention.</p>

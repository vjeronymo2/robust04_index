			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Frolov under the rubric "Drama": "The </F> Disappearance of the State Committee on Chernobyl Will Be a  Shock Not Only to Its Supporters. 70 Percent of the Residents of  `Contaminated' Areas Need Social Protection"]    [Text] It seems that in the near future the State Committee  of the Russian Federation on Social Protection of Civilians and  Rehabilitation of Territories Suffering from Chernobyl and Other  Radiation Catastrophes, called simply Goskomchernobyl, will  cease to exist. Along with other committees of a similar rank,  it is a part of the GKChS [State Committee of the Russian  Federation on Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Recovery  from Natural Disasters]. Quite understandably, this disturbs the  workers, although not all of them, of course. Not the workers  but interested individuals, of whom there are many times more,  are disturbed by one extremely significant aspect of this  departmental cataclysm. The GKChS does not intend to take the  administration of social protection under its "mantle." Thus  the main function of Goskomchernobyl will atrophy to a  significant degree--it will have to be performed by the Ministry  of Social Protection, which has enough problems of its own  without orphan children and the elderly.    Plenty has been said about the "Chernobyl" benefits and  payment increments. It is clear that they are very costly and  will continue to be costly. Experts of the Ministry of Finance  think that in 1994 alone payments will exceed 1 trillion rubles  [R]. Many are eager to raise a dispute over this material and  financial aspect. Many fewer are willing to discuss the social,  not to mention the psychological aspects. But workers of the  Department for Studying the Medical and Psychological  Consequences of the Disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power  Plant of the State Scientific Center for Social and Judicial  Psychiatry imeni Serbskiy think that as of the present moment  these aspects are the main ones. The newspaper SEGODNYA has  already written about the higher level of neurotic symptoms  discovered by these researchers among the population of the  contaminated areas, caused primarily by the extremely  contradictory information about the scale of the danger. The  masters Freud and Bekhterev back in their day noted that  increased receptivity to suggestion and the preference of rumors  over official information are typical of mass psychology. Under  Soviet conditions it was quite predictable that these features  would be hypertrophied and become a way of directing perception.  Another thing was surprising: Despite expectations, in time the  consequences of stress did not disappear, although none of the  people residing in the affected territories could experience any  apparent results from the action of small doses of radiation.  Actually, it was the latter circumstance that contributed to a  situation where stress became chronic. In this case the "Soviet  consciousness" does not come into play. The same thing happened  with Americans after the disaster at the Three Mile Island (TMI)  power plant in 1979. One can understand why it was that six  years later when a reactor in good repair was started up at  Three Mile Island the indicators of alarm and depressive  disorders there increased.    It is not so obvious but nonetheless a fact that the most  diverse stress loads which have nothing to do with the radiation  danger can just as successfully aggravate nervous disorders and  all the quite physical ailments that go with them. In the  opinion of the leader of the Department for Studying the Medical  and Psychological Consequences, Galina Rumyantseva, social and  economic factors are undoubtedly included among these  "starters." It goes without saying, of course, that  macroeconomics does not rank high among them. For example, it  was discovered that mass deterioration of the psychological and,  correspondingly, physical condition was brought about by delays  in payment of wages, which are now commonplace. But one need be  neither a medical expert nor a psychic to imagine the dynamic  evoked by the abolition of compensatory payments. Incidentally,  this has already begun. Benefits for people living on areas with  background indicators of radioactivity of from 1 to 5 curies per  square kilometer have been eliminated. The rest, whose future  became uncertain, immediately started to feel worse.    There would hardly be any point to thinking about all that  was said above outside the environment of psychologists and  psychiatrists. Unfortunately, the consequences can (and this is  precisely what happens most of the time) be outside their  professional competence. There are 2.6 million Russians living  in zones of radioactive contamination from the disaster at the  Chernobyl nuclear power plant alone, and 2.2 million of them are  receiving benefits and additional payments. Incidentally, the  average level of wages in these regions was deliberately lowered  since it was assumed that the additional payments, which now  come to about four times the minimum wage, would serve as an  additional source of income. And the level of health of the  population cannot even be compared with that in the so-called  "clean areas": Control studies showed that the incidence of  vegeto-vascular dystonia and functional disorders are 10 times  greater in Novozybkovskiy Rayon than in Tver, where out of every  10,000 studied, only three were affected.    And so medical experts warn that abolishing the benefits  will  lead to a clear negative reaction. When it follows from this  that millions of people will actually be "excluded" from life  and more than 10 oblasts along with them, there is something to  think about. Actually, there will be nothing unexpected in their  behavior--almost from the very beginning of the Chernobyl saga  these people were bearers of so-called rent psychology which, to  be truthful, was imposed upon them. Its main feature is social  passivity and a desire to place responsibility for their  well-being on others. There is no need to go into detail about  the possible consequences of such a world view: Practically  every post-Soveticus manifests it to one degree or  another or else has been fortunate enough to rid himself of it  only in the recent past. Among the sufferers, access to benefits  was a measure of success in life even irrespective of their  actual value. For example, it would never occur to anyone that  to send children to vacation in Australia--at the expense of  their hosts, of course--would mean to give them at least another  annual dose which they would receive during the flight.  Incidentally, it would be naive to think that transoceanic  voyages and foreign diagnosis are available to all residents of  the contaminated territories. Near the rayon center of  Novozybkovo there is a village called Zlynka. It is a rayon  center too, although, according to testimony from people who  have visited there, one gets the impression that the distance  between it and Novozybkovo, which is visited by foreigners, is  not 20 km but at least a half century. And our achievements if  not at cleaning up then, as the physicians express it, in coping  with the consequences of the disaster suffer from such contrasts  as well. On the one hand there is our fairly successful policy  of resettlement which, in the opinion of specialists in any  case, surpasses similar actions taken in Belarus and Ukraine in  terms of many parameters, and on the other--there is the absence  for seven years in a row of reliable information on the doses  received by the population. We still have not conducted an  individual study of the residents. Of course, this is difficult  work, but the majority of medical experts have no doubt about  the need for it: It has repeatedly happened that on fairly clean  territories there have been random people who have received a  considerable dose of radiation. The prospects look fairly grim.  It seems that only psychiatrists and psychologists have clearly  formulated their ideas about them and, being specialists, in  spite of the well-known Prutkov aphorism, they do not want to be  one-sided like a gumboil and are hoping for cooperation from  their colleagues. For example, endocrinologists, since increased  pathology in this area is inevitable. It is too soon to close  the question of the effects of small doses of radiation as  well--thus for a long time allopathists have closed their eyes  to the homeopathy but it still has not ceased to exist.    So far medical experts have been engaged in organizing a  kind  of assistance for which there was an obvious need. Some 70  percent of the residents of the contaminated territories were in  favor of organizing a sociopsychological service there. The  first and, from all appearances, last center will begin to  operate in the next three months. Funds have been allotted by  Goskomchernobyl for a year--the center's subsequent destiny is  unknown. But it is known that the network of such institutions  for children has remained, as it were, in the planning stage.  Incidentally, they, along with their mothers, are in the risk  group. Also included are educators and local medical personnel.  The latter, true, might be, as they like to put it,  "compensated." But this can hardly be said about the majority of  residents of "contaminated" rayons, who have perceived the  disappearance of Goskomchernobyl as a loss of a protector. It  seems that this time the supporters of shock therapy have  allowed an overload.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUINS DRAW A TEAM THEY CAN BEAT  </P> <P> Washington, already devoured twice by UCLA this season, will be served up to  the Bruins again at 9 tonight in the quarterfinals of the Pacific 10 Conference  basketball tournament at the Forum.  </P> <P> That's bad news for Washington Coach Andy Russo, whose job is thought to be in  jeopardy.  </P> <P> UCLA (19-8) isn't the only team that has carved up the Huskies. Washington  (12-15) has lost nine games by 14 or more points, among them a 55-point rout by  Arizona, a 40-point defeat by Oregon State and 19- and 23-point beatings by  UCLA.  </P> <P> UCLA guard Pooh Richardson has been especially effective against Washington,  averaging 20 points and 11.5 assists a game while making 62.5% of his shots.  JERRY CROWE  </P></p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / International Company News: CEA-Industrie to issue shares to private sector CEA-INDUSTRIE, the industrial arm of France's atomic energy commission, plans to issue shares to private investors this year and is preparing a strategic development plan to encourage more coherence between its disparate businesses. The move, by Mr Jean-Claude Hirel, the former chemicals industry executive who was appointed chairman last September, is the remnant of an abortive industrial policy initiative by the previous government of Mrs Edith Cresson to build a diversified nuclear energy to electronics group from various public sector assets. Mr Hirel said his plan, to be tabled in the next two months, would seek 'to bring into play the synergies' between CEA Industrie's different units. It had the means to become one of France's leading industrial groups in five years, he maintained. Fully owned by the CEA state atomic energy commission, CEA-Industrie is a holding group for diverse businesses to have grown out of CEA research projects or inherited from other parts of the public sector, with a combined turnover of FFr46bn (Dollars 8.51bn) and 56,000 employees. It includes an indirect stake in SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor maker, Framatome, France's monopoly supplier of nuclear reactors, full ownership of Cogema, a nuclear fuels group, and control of a series of medical equipment, engineering and computer services businesses. Mr Hirel aimed to open CEA-Industrie's capital to institutional investors or industrial groups, although the French state would keep a majority stake in line with current law. The group's FFr21bn of money market funds should also be put to industrial use, he said in a newspaper interview. Mr Hirel also plans to relaunch efforts by SGS-Thomson, in which CEA-Industrie was given part ownership operating responsibility late last year, to seek a research alliance with Siemens, the German engineering to electronics group. Siemens last year spurned an approach from SGS-Thomson, despite European Commission encouragement for European microchip companies to join forces against US and Japanese competition. Since then, the cash hungry SGS-Thomson has won agreement for Dollars 2bn of fresh investment from its state shareholders over the next five years, potentially improving its partnership prospects. Mr Hirel said he was seeking an accord of the same type as an agreement between SGS-Thomson and Philips, the Dutch electronics group, last year to co-operate on the development of dedicated logic circuits, a kind of advanced integrated circuit.</p>

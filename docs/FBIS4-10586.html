			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Costa Rican President-elect Jose </F> Figueres by reporter Roberto Reyes at Toncontin International  Airport; from "The Morning Paper" newscast; date not given --  recorded]    [Text] Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria Figueres and  his entourage are en route to El Salvador. Members of his  cabinet are also accompanying Figueres, who will take office on  8 May. We have Figueres' remarks while he was at the country's  largest airport, Toncontin International Airport.    [Begin recording, in progress] [Figueres] ....the meetings I  will hold during the coming months, such as the Ibero American  meeting, which will be held in Cartagena in June. (?My meeting  here) was very advantageous. I want to have the best of  relations with Honduras. I want to have constant, permanent,  and very fluid relations that will allow us to deal with our  problems.    [Reyes] Mr. President-elect, will Central America's  integration be strengthened now that Costa Rica will be  participating directly and firmly, and did you discuss Central  America's drug-trafficking problem with President Reina?    [Figueres] President Reina told me of his concern and firm  decision to combat every manifestation of drug trafficking. We  have that same idea in Costa Rica. I believe this is an area in  which we can cooperate and truly strengthen both countries'  efforts to be more effective. Drug trafficking is one of modern  society's everyday problems today, and we must do everything  within our capability so that the problem will not affect  Honduras, Costa Rica and, of course, other countries. I believe  this is an area in which we can make great progress with our  other Central American neighbors.    [Reyes] Will you continue to visit Honduras after you are  president?    [Figueres] Of course, quite frequently. [Words indistinct]  of seeing me here.    [Reyes] Was Central American integration the main topic you  discussed with the Honduran president?    [Figueres] Yes. Costa Rica is keenly interested in making a  significant contribution to a more effective and beneficial  integration by all of our countries.    [Reyes] What effect will the North American Free Trade  Agreement between Mexico, Canada, and the United States have on  Central American unity?    [Figueres] That must be decided by all the presidents and  countries. It is, of course, a topic we must study, and I am  sure it will take up a considerable portion of agendas for  future meetings we will hold.    [Reyes] Has your assembly made any arrangements for Costa  Rica to finally become a member of all the Central American  organizations?    [Figueres] We are going to have a new assembly, and we will  have to see what the deputies think. Meanwhile, we can make  progress in many other areas. There is much to be done  concerning the economy and trade, and we want to do all we can  to emulate Honduras, which is engaged in a permanent struggle  for Central American integration.    [Reyes] Are your views on this issue essential to a decision  by the assembly?    [Figueres] I do not think so. Our legislative branch is  independent of the executive branch. I can contribute my grain  of sand so that things in Central America will go as well as  possible within the legislative sphere. Certain sectors in  Costa Rica oppose joining the Central American Parliament,  however, and I hope that as time passes we will gradually defeat  that position. I will not engage in that debate for now; we  must progress in other issues, an attitude which is much more  positive and constructive.    [Reyes] In conclusion, Mr. Figueres, did the Honduran  president confirm to you and your entourage he will attend your  inauguration on 8 May?    [Figueres] He did, and I am very pleased and satisfied over  that.    [Reyes] A final word for the Honduran people?    [Figueres] A strong embrace, a warm greeting, and wishes of  success for the four years that lie ahead. Costa Rica will  always be at your service to help as much as it can, be it a  little or much.

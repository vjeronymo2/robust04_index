			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> L-7 SERVES UP A MOIST, INTENSE SET AT THE ROXY  </P> <P> The longer Hollywood grunge masters L-7 stay together, the sloppier they get --  but in a good way. At the Roxy on Wednesday night, the guitars howled, the  riffs were idiot-simple, the vocals approached the wolverine intensity of  Stooges-era Iggy, and young woman after young woman climbed up on the stage and  dove into the moiling crowd.  </P> <P> The newest thrash-group star on the Sub Pop Records roster, L-7 is not only the  wildest live all-female band anybody can think of, but one of the  hardest-rocking groups, period. This was the quartet's biggest Los Angeles show  in months, and the packed club reigned sweat.  </P> <P> In comparison, the headlining Lemonheads -- best-known for their punky version  of Suzanne Vega's "Luka" -- play precise, Husker Du-flavored power pop, spare,  unpretentious and just a little too jangly for their own good. The Boston trio  seems to have bad luck with opening acts: last year it headlined over Mudhoney,  another Sub Pop band that blew them off the stage.  </P> <P> Lemonheads, dominated by school-boy cute singer-guitarist-songwriter Evan  Dando, isn't bad exactly, even if the new countrified material isn't quite up  to the chunky college radio stuff the band is best known for. It's just a tad  too earnest and dull. JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

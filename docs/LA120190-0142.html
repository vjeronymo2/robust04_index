			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;  </P> <P> CONTROVERSIES ASIDE, CITY IS ONE YEAR OLD  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel is celebrating its first year of cityhood today, and listening to  residents of this hilly community is like hearing the parents of a colicky  child. Sure, it's been tough -- certainly not what they expected -- but they  don't want to give the baby back.  </P> <P> And they're not about to say bad things about this new town on its birthday.  </P> <P> Even people who fought incorporation, or who were cool to the idea, said they  have warmed up to their toddling city, which has suffered growing pains in 12  tumultuous months.  </P> <P> While residents complained that divisive issues such as ridgeline protection  have splintered the community, others insisted that the city is more united as  a result of the shared, arduous journey.  </P> <P> Besides, said Dennis Head, who fought cityhood until the last minute, when you  pay property taxes of $9,000 a year for a "starter mansion," you're likely to  go to bat for your city, once you get one.  </P> <P> "We just pay dearly for this," Head said. "And all we're asking for is the  'Leave It to Beaver' tranquility we all grew up watching on TV. And I think we  can have it in Laguna Niguel."  </P> <P> The word "tranquility," however, is not likely to come from the lips of most  officials in Laguna Niguel, where controversies abound.  </P> <P> A grand jury investigation is continuing regarding a land transaction that  occurred before incorporation. In the transaction, the public's right to 96  acres of open space was relinquished to a developer.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, all five council members are targeted for recall because of  positions they have taken on a ridgeline-protection initiative. And property  owners have said the city could be sued to the brink of bankruptcy if the  initiative becomes law and they are prohibited from building on their land.  </P> <P> The city also suffered a blow this year when it lost a court battle with Dana  Point over a pricey parcel known as Monarch Beach, which would have given  landlocked Laguna Niguel a pathway to the sea.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel has had controversies that some established cities don't  experience until they are more than five years old, City Clerk Juanita Zarilla  said. "As far as handling it," she added, "I think everybody's really pulling  together."  </P> <P> Mayor Patricia Bates said a local government that is immediately responsive to  residents' concerns is in place and an "exceedingly competent staff" has been  hired.  </P> <P> Achievements some residents point to are the creation of a gang-suppression  team and a program to educate children about community safety and drug abuse.  </P> <P> "I can see changes in all levels of service," added Joe Davis, police chief and  longtime resident. "We've almost doubled the number of cops on the streets."  </P> <P> "It seems to me the things like street repairing and repainting are occurring,"  he added. "I see better long-range planning -- more responsiveness (to)  inquiries.'  </P> <P> Some residents say it is worth the disruptions of the first year to bring local  control to their community. "Whether people like the ultimate decisions or not,  I think what we have gained are decision makers who do listen to us," said  cityhood proponent Cindy O'Neal.  </P> <P> Donna Meehan, who was undecided about incorporation a year ago, said she has  been won over. "I wasn't sure of it when we first decided to go ahead with it,  and I'm real happy now that we did," Meehan said. "Of course, it saddens me,  too, with all the turmoil we've gone through in the past year."  </P> <P> While some admit projects have been stalled while city officials grapple with  unexpected problems, others say Laguna Niguel may be tougher because of  withstanding its first-year tribulations.  </P> <P> "Most of us came down here with a little bit of a dream, and I don't think  we're losing it,' Head said. "You tend to grow as a result of some pain. We  tend to appreciate our prosperity as a result of the struggle. And I think  there's a wonderful sense of community here."  </P> <P> O'Neal, whose life was once "consumed" with the fight for cityhood, said it was  worth the effort.  </P> <P> "We may be off to a rocky beginning," she said, 'but I still think we have a  bright future."LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

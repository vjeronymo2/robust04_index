			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OILER FUHR USED COCAINE 7 YEARS  </P> <P> Edmonton Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr used cocaine for about seven years, but  says has been drug free since spending two weeks in a substance-abuse center  last summer, according to a published report.  </P> <P> The Edmonton Journal reported in a copyrighted story today that Fuhr at first  had lied to Oilers General Manager Glen Sather, who had confronted him several  times about possible substance abuse, because "it's not something you tell your  boss."  </P> <P> The newspaper said Sather confirmed that Fuhr, 28, was treated for cocaine  abuse at the Straight Center in St. Petersburg, Fla., and that he tested  positive in a private test that his former agent, Rich Winter, pressed him to  take.  </P> <P> Fuhr said he expected to be suspended for his admissions. Sather said he had  already contacted National Hockey League President John Ziegler.  </P> <P> Ziegler, in a statement this morning, said the league had begun an  investigation after receiving information indicating that Fuhr "had admitted  using an illegal drug."  </P> <P> A hearing was set for Sept. 26 in Toronto, site of the NHL Board of Governors'  meeting.  </P></p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Conflicting opinions on equity investment THERE was some danger, yesterday, of a two-way market in investment opinion, writes Our Markets Staff. In Germany, there seemed serious concern that the 1,500 level on the DAX index would not prove an effective support level; but Mr David Roche, now global strategist at Morgan Stanley, said that current pessimism is now priced into markets: 'My guess', he said in a report to be published this week, 'is that the next move in global equities will be upwards and that the current correction in world markets is no more than that.' FRANKFURT slowed its decline, the DAX index closing 11.59 lower at 1,553.01 after a loss of 0.47 to 613.60 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover fell from DM6.1bn to DM5.1bn. Germans are now pessimistic about the economy, in spite of the expiry last month of the tax surcharge to finance German unity. Mr Matthias Welticke of Merck, Finck in Dusseldorf said that he was also worried about the continued slide in Tokyo, the vulnerability of Wall Street at its present level, the disappointing interim results season and the analysts' earnings downgrades which could follow this. The result was that where results brought out a buy recommendation, investors ignored it. Degussa fell DM1 to DM320 after a 15 per cent increase in interim profits for 1991-92, and a forecast of further gains in 1992-93. PARIS saw dull trading with oil stocks lifted by activity in the futures market. The CAC-40 index lost 7.75 to 1,730.05 in low turnover of FFr1.06bn. Rumours that Iraqi troops had massed at the Iraq-Kuwait border, denied by a Kuwaiti official just as the market was closing, was partly responsible for a stronger oil sector. Elf closed up FFr1.40 at FFr316.00 while Total put on FFr1.00 at FFr225.70. Elsewhere a negative note on banks by one broker left Suez and Paribas down FFr2.50 and FFr4.50 respectively to FFr239.00 and FFr302.00. Sanofi lost FFr8 to FFr987. Mr Mark Tracey of Goldman Sachs has downgraded his 1992 EPS forecast for the stock and expects the pharmaceutical company to report disappointing US sales for one of its leading products. AMSTERDAM saw Daf fall to a historic low, down 30 cents to Fl 17.20 ahead of interim results on August 27. The truck maker is still suffering from poor UK sales, although it has forecast a second half profit. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.8 lower at 112.2. KLM fell Fl 1.10, or 3.6 per cent to Fl 29.00 ahead of today's first quarter results. Some analysts are estimating a net profit of between Fl 90m to Fl 120m compared with Fl 136m. MADRID's general index closed at its lowest level since December 1987 with a fall of 3.81 to 205.76. Turnover was about Pta6.5bn. With July CPI figures due for release today Mr Stephen Hughes of Nikko Europe is forecasting a month-on-month increase of 1.1 per cent, although some other analysts are more pessimistic. BRUSSELS lost 2 per cent to its lowest level of the year. The Bel-20 index shed 22.29 to 1,092.47 in turnover of BFr1.14bn. Petrofina declined for the fourth consecutive day, losing BFr430 or 4.3 per cent to BFr9,500. Along with COPENHAGEN and OSLO, STOCKHOLM recorded another year's low with Ericsson B down SKr9 to SKr107 following a downgrade by a US analyst and Volvo B SKr9 lower at SKr311. The Affarsvarlden index shed 11.9 to 815.9 in turnover of SKr394m. James Capel in London rated Volvo a long-term buy yesterday although the broker revised its 1992 EPS forecast to SKr15 from SKr28 to reflect higher interest rates, the decline in the value of the dollar and the delayed economic recovery in the US and Europe. VIENNA closed slightly higher in nervous trading. The ATX index put on 3.47 to 686.92. Leykam, the paper manufacturer, improved Sch17 to Sch290. ISTANBUL rose for the third consecutive day. The index advanced 49.49 to 4,062.00 in turnover estimated at TL251.8bn. Eregli, the steel maker, rose TL50 to TL3,950.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am   11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1043.95  1042.33   1041.05  1040.33  1039.99  1037.81  1037.14  1037.76  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High  1044.18    Day's Low  1036.46  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        Aug 11    Aug 10     Aug 7     Aug 6     Aug 5       1044.92   1049.68   1067.01   1078.71   1081.21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

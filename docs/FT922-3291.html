			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gould insists his goal is for deputy leadership MR BRYAN GOULD yesterday made clear that he was focusing his efforts on the post of deputy Labour leader rather than leader, as he made his case to be the Labour party's 'Essex man'. Mr Gould insisted that he was the unity candidate who could work with Mr John Smith while representing a different strand of opinion within the party. His leadership campaign had, he said, shown an openness to ideas and set the agenda on issues such as the role of unions and realignment within the exchange rate mechanism. He added that his victory in ballots in the engineering and clerical sections of the National Communications Union on the party's deputy leadership had given his campaign 'the momentum it needs'.</p>

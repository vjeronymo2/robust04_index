			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Record payout for RSI injury A former Inland Revenue typist has been awarded a record Pounds 79,000 in compensation after losing her job because of repetitive strain injury. The out-of-court settlement agreed with lawyers acting for the Inland Revenue Staff Federation comes after a High Court judge ruled last year that RSI was 'meaningless'. Mrs Kathleen Harris, 47, from west London, was forced to leave her Pounds 11,000-a-year job in July after suffering for two years from tennis elbow, which she claimed was brought on by using an electric typewriter. She is now registered as disabled and is unable to do housework such as ironing, vacuuming and cleaning. 'She can't even pick up a 1lb bag of sugar,' said Mr Simon Allen, a solicitor acting for the union. He said the case had established that RSI genuinely existed as a term for a number of work-related injuries. The union has 150 more Revenue cases in the pipeline. In an October ruling, rejecting a claim for damages by a Reuters journalist, Judge John Prosser suggested the term RSI had 'no place in the medical books'. IRSF general secretary Mr Clive Brooke, announcing the compensation award yesterday, said the settlement was a 'strong rebuttal of the mistaken view that RSI is just something in the mind'. He added: 'The judge is out of touch with the pain and reality of life that many workers are suffering.' Mrs Harris said: 'I just hope it helps other people with the same problem.' Her case, said Mr Allen, was related to posture, a lack of breaks from typing between 13,000 and 16,000 key strokes an hour and the general inadequacy of her furniture. Mr Brooke blamed the injuries on a tendency in typing pools for managers to 'crack whips'. He said: 'We believe much of this stems from increasing drives by employers for more and more output and higher and higher productivity. There is a role for trade unions to ensure that those who seek profitability regardless of the consequences on their employees should be constrained.' The previous highest settlement for an RSI case was an award of Pounds 59,000 in 1992 to a former Vauxhall machine operator. A TUC analysis last month showed that unions had won Pounds 118,000 for RSI sufferers in November and December. The Revenue said it had been making efforts to improve furniture and had begun educating staff about ergonomics. Dr Peter Buckle, head of ergonomics at the University of Surrey, said the settlement highlighted the fact that the Reuters case was a 'bad judgment'. The settlement would relight some of the cases that had been 'doused' after Judge Prosser's remarks, he said.</p>

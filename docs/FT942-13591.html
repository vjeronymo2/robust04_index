			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / We kept the home fires burning: Frank Ledger and Howard Sallis, instrumental in the defeat of Britain's miners 10 years ago, tell how they kept the power stations supplied - and managed to keep it quiet. All the skill in the world could not save the CEGB from failure if was seen to be fighting the miners Frank Ledger was the CEGB's director of operations during the 1984-85 coal strike. Howard Sallis was central director for industrial relations at the Electricity Council. This is their account of events. Ten years ago today, the officials who controlled Britain's electricity supply met to assess the first phase of a huge emergency operation upon which the fate of Margaret Thatcher's UK government depended - and much more beside. A month earlier, on March 26, Sir Walter Marshall, chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board, and his fellow board members had to decide whether to commit themselves to an all-out effort to prevent striking miners from causing power cuts throughout the land. It was a question of the greatest delicacy. The board was determined to keep the lights burning and knew that if the CEGB was successful the miners would probably be defeated. But it dared not be seen publicly to take a political position. The first important question was whether to increase output from the big oil-fired power stations to maximum to conserve coal stocks. Oil was then twice as expensive as coal, so the potential cost was hundreds of millions of pounds. But at that time no one knew how many pits would join the strike nor how long they would stay out. With coal stocks at an all-time high for the time of year (24m tonnes), it might have seemed an odd time to start spending money on oil. But we knew that maintaining electricity supplies would be a close-run thing, much closer than was generally believed at the time. If the strike were to consolidate and run through to the autumn, when cold weather increased power consumption, the lights would start to go out after about three months. The miners would then have a good chance of repeating the victory they achieved over Edward Heath's government in 1974. He called an election and lost after a period of extensive power cuts, a state of emergency and a three-day week for industry. The board had to keep quiet about its difficulties. It knew that all the skill in the world could not save it from failure if its actions were seen as part of the fight against the miners. Many power station workers in mining areas had fathers, sons and brothers who were striking miners. The slightest provocation could have brought them out on strike too. Yet while appearing neutral on the political issues, the board knew that in order to maintain supplies, it must make huge changes, of which the shift to oil was only a start. Even before the strike, the board had been laying its plans. Stocking facilities were increased and suppliers were only given contracts if they were prepared to supply through picket lines. Arrangements were made to fly in materials by helicopter: moving sulphuric acid by helicopter had its difficulties. These preparations led to some anxious debates within the board. Were they a political act to defeat the miners or were they undertaken to enable the board to do its statutory duty during a dispute in which it was not directly involved? The latter view prevailed. Then, when the strike was underway, switching to oil brought new complications. It was done in a phased programme, ending on April 23, from the normal 30,000 tonnes a week up to what was then thought to be the maximum of 360,000 tonnes, saving 600,000 tonnes of coal burn. One obvious danger was that such a big shift would drive up prices on the international oil market. Less obvious was the possibility that the whole national grid system could crash because of the huge flows of power from oil-fired stations in the south for which the grid was not designed. Complex computer studies were needed to find out whether the system could cope. Then extremely delicate negotiations with our staff were needed to persuade them to run the oil-fired stations full out instead of just at peak periods as would have been normal for the time of year. At the Isle of Grain, for example, the newest and largest of the oil stations, staff were asked to work about 70 hours per week, almost twice their normal hours. How could they be persuaded to take on extra work which might easily be seen as strike-breaking? First there was the money: for some, about twice their normal rates; but more important for many men may have been a strong moral sense of duty to consumers - including old people and hospitals. They may also have feared that after the strike their jobs might have been in danger if high oil prices led to the mothballing of their station. As the pattern of the strike became clearer, new problems emerged. The rail unions were giving strong support to the striking miners and little coal from working pits, particularly those in Nottinghamshire, was being transported to the power stations. British Rail was prepared to discipline staff but not to risk passenger services. No one wanted a national rail strike. The answer was to turn to road transport, but this was far easier said than done. Hundreds of contractors were engaged. With the help of local authorities and police, routes were arranged through quiet country lanes and villages. It was a huge enterprise. At each of the large power stations 5,000 lorry loads of coal a week were needed to replace 100 trains. It took time to build up the fleets, and lorries and their drivers had to be given protection against assault, both overnight and on journeys through picket lines. Through the summer, the combination of high oil-fired generation and road-borne coal supply gave us some feeling of security. About 250,000 tonnes of coal a week was then being transported by road with over 600,000 tonnes a week of coal being saved by the oil burn. This compared with a normal requirement of the equivalent of just under 1m tonnes of coal burn a week. The coal stocks had fallen by 6m tonnes to 18m by the time the new operational regimes were in place, but were falling only moderately by the summer and in mid-summer hardly at all. However concern over winter electricity supplies was deepening. The strike was going on longer than we had expected and looked as though it would last into winter. If we could not improve our supply position we would not be able to get through the period of high electricity demand without power cuts. A national dock strike had been called. This related to events in steel but concerned us because much of our oil supply was dependent on tankers. We could be affected if tug crews and berthing staff became involved. This made us all the more determined to improve our supply position. We were getting on with this when, towards the end of July, a group of government ministers, receiving monitoring reports, expressed their anxieties to Thatcher, suggesting that stronger measures were necessary, including the possible use of troops and the forcing of coal flows from stocks at striking pits into stations not receiving supplies. Sir Walter Marshall promised Thatcher that we would get through the winter without power cuts. He believed we could do better than we were predicting. Gil Blackman, the board member for operations, who had been directing the CEGB's response to the crisis, then had to make sure Sir Walter's promise could be kept. But it would be difficult. Prodigious efforts were made to conserve coal. We had thought we were burning as much oil as the system could bear. But could we perhaps do better? At every coal-fired power station where it was possible to burn more oil with the coal, we did so. This required a further massive road tanker operation. Four medium-sized oil-fired stations which had been closed were repaired and brought back into service. Five large coal-fired stations not receiving coal supplies were modified to burn oil. They could not do anything like full load, but their help was substantial. Some elderly components from closed oil-fired stations were hurriedly adapted. And the large oil-fired stations managed to thunder away with some of them at an output well beyond the normal design limit for continuous working. The two newest stations, Grain and Littlebrook in south east England, went to high levels of overload. We crossed our fingers that they would be able to maintain this over the winter. Gas turbine generators, normally used only for short bursts of power at times of peak demand, were used for prolonged periods at as high an output that their road-borne oil supplies allowed. This meant more road tankers and also special repair lines for servicing the gas generators, which were really aircraft jet engines similar to those used in Concorde or Vulcan bombers. The Ministry of Defence helped us by providing one of those lines. The CEGB Regions showed great inventiveness in finding new ways to burn oil. So by mid-winter, the oil burn had increased to 600,000 tonnes a week with oil-fired generation capacity doubled. About 1m tonnes of coal a week were then being saved. About a third of this oil was being supplied by pipeline from refineries next to some of the power stations, the remainder being supplied by a mixture of term contracts and spot purchases. The board's staff made every effort to control the price by refusing offers at high prices, even if that meant stopping purchases from time to time. It was a gamble but it worked. The aim was to limit the price to Dollars 190 a tonne. We were purchasing oil from all over Europe and the east coast of America. There were many problems, including an arrested ship, unhelpful interventions by Customs and Excise which threatened to surcharge oil being imported from the Dutch Antilles, and embarrassing publicity over the use of Soviet ships. We were buying more oil than some smaller members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were producing. We further increased the transport of coal by road. The volume was doubled by the early winter. Some 500,000 tonnes a week were being moved using 2,000 lorries with more than 1,000 loads a day arriving at some stations. Every available lorry was used. But this was not enough. Some power stations which supported the striking miners were still not receiving coal supplies. We judged that it was unwise to risk a full-scale conflict by forcing the delivery of coal to these stations or by building up their oil burn. These stations were therefore reserved for use during the winter peaks. At the start of the winter they needed a total of 3.5m tonnes of coal to play that role. But they were more than 400,000 tonnes short of this figure. If this problem were not solved we would still have power cuts in cold winter periods. That would improve the strikers' morale. It was decided to try to force coal into Didcot power station. This was ultimately achieved by prolonged persuasion and pressure after power station staff refused to use the coal and then to maintain the equipment for handling it. The coal flow began on November 8 but it was not until January 20 that it was possible to class Didcot as a normal coal-receiving station. Aberthaw and Uskmouth in south Wales and also Brighton were turned by the same means into stations operating normally. By Christmas, Sir Walter was able to tell the government that we could get through the winter and maintain supplies to the end of 1985. We were not certain about this, but confidence was growing. And when very cold weather occurred over two weeks in January, record levels of electricity demand were met in full. On January 17 the highest demand of the winter occurred. The success of the CEGB in meeting these peaks seemed to take the stuffing out of the striking miners and marked the begining of the end of the strike. By March 5 it was over. The board, had kept the lights on, at a cost to the taxpayer of more than Pounds 2bn, most from the oil burn. The oil had saved 40m tonnes of coal. At the end of the strike, power station coal stocks were 11m tonnes. Had it not been for all of the initiatives, the outcome could have been different. The margin between Thatcher's famous victory and ignominious failure had been extremely narrow. Frank Ledger and Howard Sallis are joint authors of Managing the Power Supply, an inside story of crisis management, to be published by Routledge in October. A television documentary, The Men Who Kept the Lights On, which is based on the book, will be broadcast tonight on BBC2 at 7.10pm.</p>

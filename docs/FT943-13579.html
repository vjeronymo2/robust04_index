			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Arts: Tricks or memory treats - Theatre The more I watch Harold Pinter's plays, the more I love the way he plants images in the air and lets them grow there. A simple example in his 1978 play Betrayal is Jerry's recollection of picking up young Charlotte one Christmastime, of lifting her high and down and up, of how she laughed, of how everyone present laughed. Charlotte (never seen in the play) is the daughter of Robert (Jerry's best friend) and Emma (who was/is, for some years, Jerry's mistress). 'Everyone' present at that Christmastime includes Jerry's own wife and children. The first irony about this memory is that Jerry and Emma evoke it when they are alone together. Thus they make it an image of the innocence that existed around and between them once, before their affair began; before they betrayed it. The second irony is that Jerry twice remembers the event as having occurred in Emma's kitchen; and that she twice corrects him - his kitchen. The deceptiveness of his (or her) memory has an ah-yes-I-remember-it-well charm, and yet also becomes poignant. Memory matters, but plays tricks. And it is this image that Matthew Warchus makes luminous in his new production of Betrayal at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. Between each of the nine scenes, different clips of a film of a child - like a home movie - are projected on to the ceiling above the stage. (The audience, seated on four sides of the stage, can all see.) The child's radiant smile, tumbling hair, constant motion all make an impression. At first, we watch her objectively; later, when she looks directly at the camera, we are touched; gradually, as we see - like the close-ups in Antonioni's film Blowup - increasingly near but blurry views of areas of her hair and face, we are confused. Which works brilliantly. For one thing, it reminds us that Jerry and Emma have betrayed not only Robert but also their children. For another, it shows us the paradise of that bygone innocence: a paradise that is not a fact but an idea. And, further, it catches the method of Pinter's play, which moves to and fro in time but basically backward, from 1977 to 1968, from the time when the affair is wholly over to the point when it began. The production reveals that, in its small-scale way, Betrayal operates as a Proustian effort to rediscover lost time. But lost time is lost. We never actually see Jerry lift Charlotte. We merely return to thinking about it, from changing distances and perspectives. Warchus is strong on such poetic use of visual imagery: as in his 1991 National Youth Theatre Coriolanus and his current RSC Henry V. In the matter of shaping individual performances, his touch is not so sure. In Betrayal, Leslee Udwin is a surprisingly unenigmatic Emma, Richard Hope is an amiably unquestioning Jerry, and Timothy Walker is a Karenin-like Robert. Intelligent interpretations, with fresh touches that reveal new facets in the play. And Laura Hopkins' designs help them effectively to shed years as they move back in time. But all three performances need more fine-tuning. There are actorly effects of pacing and dynamic contrast that do not convince, strokes of characterisation that should be developed. Surely all three characters, moving in artistic circles, should be more sophisticated? At the Courtyard Theatre, West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds.</p>

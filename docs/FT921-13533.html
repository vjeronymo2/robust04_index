			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Nestle bid for Perrier may spark fight SOME of the most formidable forces in European industry have squared up to fight for ownership of Perrier, the French mineral water. Nestle, the Swiss food group, yesterday joined forces with Indosuez, the French bank, to mount a FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.38bn) bid for Source Perrier, in a move which could bring them into conflict with the Agnellis, the Italian industrial dynasty. The bid for Perrier takes place against a labyrinthine background of deals, counter-deals and cross-shareholdings. Analysts in Paris yesterday were furiously speculating about the chances of a counter-bid for Perrier by the Agnellis and about their interest in BSN, the giant French food group which is an old ally of Nestle. Indosuez and Nestle pounced on Perrier only months after Ifint, one of the Agnelli holding companies, launched a FFr5.6bn offer for Exor, the French wine and property group which controls 35 per cent of Perrier. The Agnellis have already crossed swords with Suez, the parent company of Indosuez. The French group led a lobby of Exor's minority shareholders who successfully insisted that the Italians convert their partial bid into a full offer. The prospect of a battle for Perrier is complicated by speculation over the Agnellis' intentions towards BSN, whose Evian and Badoit brands make it a major force in the mineral water market. BSN has joined the Nestle camp by agreeing to buy Volvic, one of the Perrier waters, if the bid succeeds. The Agnellis already indirectly hold 5.8 per cent of BSN. They have an interest in another 3 per cent through their investment in Saint-Louis, the French paper group which recently bought 13.8 per cent of Perrier for FFr1.5bn. BSN's shares yesterday rose by FFr14 to FFr1,154 on speculation that the Agnellis might increase their stake. Nestle, which already owns Vittel mineral water, is funding its Perrier bid jointly with Indosuez through Demilac, a specially created holding company. They are offering FFr1,475 a share for Perrier against the suspended market price of FFr1,396. Indosuez's involvement has been interpreted by analysts as an attempt to add a French flavour to Nestle's offer following the chauvinistic uproar that greeted the Agnellis' bid for Exor. 'It is obvious that the French establishment would rather Perrier went to Indosuez and Nestle than to the Italians,' said Mr Adam Dickens, an analyst in Paris for James Capel, the stockbroker. So far the strategy seems to be working. Credit Agricole, the French bank which owns 2.5 per cent of Perrier and 25 per cent of Roquefort, its famous cheese company, yesterday waded into the battlezone by throwing its weight behind the forces of Nestle and Indosuez.

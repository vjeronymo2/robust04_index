			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / BSI chief resigns in 'disagreement' MR MICHAEL SANDERSON, first chief executive of the British Standards Institution, has resigned unexpectedly after 18 months. The BSI co-ordinates the writing of standards for industry. Mr Sanderson's resignation, which took effect on June 1 but has only now emerged, followed what the BSI called 'a deep disagreement with the board on important matters of policy and management'. He joined BSI from AWD Bedford Trucks, where he had been managing director. 'I am very sad,' he said. 'It was a wonderful job. I think we were making significant progress.' A metallurgist by training, Mr Sanderson, who is now 49, was appointed in November 1991 to spearhead the modernisation of the organisation. The BSI said at the time that his task would be to 'lead a major programme of cultural change'. His departure leaves the organisation without a chief executive at a time of growing interest in the issue of standards. BS5750, a quality systems standard, has become the focus of growing controversy with criticism from small businesses that it is unduly bureaucratic while the creation of the single European market has increased the need for a strong British voice in the writing of European and international standards. Neither the BSI nor Mr Sanderson would comment further on the reasons for his departure. Mr Sanderson was on a renewable 12-month contract. Day-to-day management of BSI has been taken over by a three-man board committee headed by Mr Vivian Thomas, non-executive chairman. He said: 'There is no question of any change of strategic emphasis and we will pursue our objectives with the utmost vigour.'</p>

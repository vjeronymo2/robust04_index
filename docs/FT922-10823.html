			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Property bonds fail to share election euphoria ONE sector of the sterling bond market has not shared the positive mood which has prevailed since the Conservative election victory: bonds issued by property companies have slumped. The problems facing high-profile companies such as Olympia &amp; York, Rosehaugh and Speyhawk have cast a pall over a sector already embattled by the worst property slump since the 1970s. Even before the latest round of bad news, bonds issued by property companies were already trading at wide yield spreads over government paper. This has increased the cost of funds to property companies requiring funds. For example, Land Securities paid a yield spread of 110 basis points over gilts in September last year, having borrowed at a spread of just 40 basis points in 1985. The spate of bad news over the past two months has pushed yield spreads wider still in many cases - although Land Securities bonds are an exception to the rule. Analysts point to two areas which are causing concern: Bond market investors are concerned that property companies are being pressured to issue long-dated bonds to replace short-term borrowings. Yet it is not clear that institutional investors will be willing buyers of this new supply of paper. A recent analysis of the sector from Baring Securities said: 'All property-related stocks have under-performed as the clearing banks have stepped up pressure on these companies to replace their reliance on bank debt with fixed longer term funding.' Corporate financiers argue that the most likely issuers of sterling bonds this year are medium-sized property companies keen to extend the maturity of their debt, especially if gilt yields continue to fall. Many of the bigger groups - such as Land Securities and MEPC - made substantial bond issues in the second half of last year. Property companies also face pressure from shareholders to maintain high levels of dividend payouts, even where cash flow has been squeezed by the slump. For example, Hammerson recently held its dividend at 20.5p, despite a 23 per cent fall in net asset values. Earlier this year, MEPC faced criticism for increasing its full-year dividend from 19p to 20p despite a similar 23 per cent fall in the value of its property portfolio. Analysts are concerned that a decision to channel cash to equity holders may not always be in the interest of bond holders. Hammerson this week had its long-term credit rating cut from A2 to A3 by Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency. Explaining the downgrading, the rating agency said that Hammerson's 'retained cash flow is severely curtailed due to a high dividend payout at a time when earnings are decreasing'. A number of other big property companies, such as British Land, Land Securities and Great Portland Estates, are due to report full-year results in May and June. It remains to be seen whether these companies will maintain or increase dividend payments. However, the combination of negative factors means that property companies needing to borrow from the bond market will probably have to pay a premium to get new issues away. For example, Hammerson recently doubled the size of its outstanding Pounds 100m bond issue maturing 2013. The new bonds were offered to investors at a 20 basis point premium to the outstanding debt, but still received a lukewarm reception. The bonds fell further yesterday following the announcement of the downgrading. Yet even smaller property companies have been able to borrow, by pricing in line with market expectations and offering security. In the past month, Tops Estates and A&amp;J Mucklow, both of which have a market capitalisation less than Pounds 100m, have raised long-dated secured funding. Some investors clearly believe that bonds issued by property companies represent good value at current yield spreads.</p>

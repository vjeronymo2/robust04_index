The principle calls for no remunerations for workers when  they do not work during the period of labor disputes.    Minister Nam said another principle his ministry will uphold  will be the policy that "essential matters related to rights to  personnel and management cannot be subject to labor disputes."    In an exclusive interview with the YONHAP news agency, Nam  said his ministry will abide by these principles if only to  dispel confusion in labor-management negotiations this year.    "No work, no wage" policy is a general principle that has  been broadly recognized around the world, he said.    As for disputes over personnel and management rights, the  labor minister said that though the labor rights are guaranteed  under the Constitution, they cannot infringe on the essential  elements of other basic rights.    "Since the right to management is based on the right to  properties guaranteed under the basic law, labor disputes aimed  at interfering in management cannot be justified," Nam said.    He added, however, that in case matters falling under the  realm of personnel or management rights have a serious effect  directly on working conditions or the standing of workers,  disputes could be justified only to such an extent.</p>

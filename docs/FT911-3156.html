			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Unification lifts hopes in German crane market: The big construction build-up FRESHLY-PAINTED in the black, red and yellow of Germany's national flag, a small piece of history on wheels adorns the rooftop of a car showroom in Wilhelmshaven, a windswept refinery town on Germany's north-west coast. The squat-featured Trabant, one of thousands that chugged into action during the exodus of east Germans from their country in 1989, might seem an odd trophy in a town much closer to the Netherlands than the former East Germany. But even here the effects of unification are rippling through the local economy - and nowhere more so than at the town's biggest industrial employer, Krupp Industrietechnik (KI), part of the Krupp industrial conglomerate. In a wartime submarine plant on the shoreline, Germany's second-biggest mobile crane producer is spearheading an assault on an eastern German market recast by unification. The German crane-makers and their customers - rental companies from east and west, 'cross-border' joint venturers, former east German kombinats that have become limited companies, and east German entrepreneurs - are being carried along by a wave of speculative buying ahead of an expected construction boom. Nobody can be sure how and when this will happen, although independent observers of the world construction industry such as the Corporate Intelligence Group say east Germany will be the major European growth market in the 1990s. 'The east is so far behind that the construction and reconstruction task has a size beyond imagination,' said a study by the London-based analyst late last year. On top of this, the east's machines are 'old, technically very backward, either too large or too small, too noisy, too polluting and have very low output levels'. With the world construction equipment industry's more mature western markets in varying depths of recession, it is not surprising that producers are making tracks to east Germany in a big way. It could be 10 or 20 years before some of the prospects bear fruit, observers believe. But the crane market is one of the first where words have been matched by orders, as a result of the happy proximity - and shared nationality - of the target market and the best-placed suppliers. The west German producers have a stranglehold on the old domestic market, which over the past decade has been increasingly concentrated around the two big domestic producers, KI and Liebherr. Liebherr is technically Swiss-owned but unmistakably German in its background. The catalyst for this change has been the heavy spending required to develop the multi-axle 'all-terrain' crane, with extra large tyres, a shorter chassis, and all wheels independently driven. Now German producers have about 90 per cent of the worldwide all-terrain market which they pioneered. 'We German crane fellows give each other a tough time at home, and that's the engine for export growth,' says Dr Frithjof Timm, KI's sales director. Over the past year the all-terrain cranes have proved to be ideal for east German conditions - especially its roads, which could more accurately be described as 'off-roads', Dr Timm quips. A new Corporate Intelligence report estimates that 150 cranes were sold for use in east Germany last year. The enthusiastic Dr Timm puts the figure at 180, and says KI sold two thirds of them. By comparison, annual sales in the former West Germany stuck doggedly at 400-450 units between 1984 and 1988, before picking up in 1989 because of a housing boom prompted by the flood of refugees from the east. The 'east German effect' has been a godsend for KI, which has long played second fiddle to Liebherr. In the mid-1980s the Wilhelmshaven company adopted a high-volume production policy, investing heavily in new products and facilities, but it is understood the crane business did not make a profit until last year. Already unification has created a domestic market with sales of 1,073 mobile crane units last year, compared with 1989 sales of 584 in the west and an estimated 200 in the east. But this big increase in capacity, spurred more by confidence and tax incentives than hard evidence of construction activity in the east, may be too much for the work immediately available. For the customers operating in the east, the crucial factor in determining the success of their gamble will be funding for construction work in the next few years, and how quickly it is organised. Corporate Intelligence says that, so long as work can reach a satisfactory starting level by next year, the cranes bought between 1988 and 1992 should not amount to a great excess of capacity. It warns, however, that there must be a cyclical downturn at some point after 1992, and forecasts a steady decline in the new unified market to 705 units by 1995. One forecast is rather easier: the two east German producers Babelsberg and Zemag will be hard pushed to sell any of their puny, antiquated truck-mounted cranes in the uplifting environment of the unified German market.</p>

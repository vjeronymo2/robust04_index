			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Labour price falls offshore - A north Italian clothing and footwear company has closed its factory and shifted production to Asia: 'The only chance of survival.' / Case Study / Fila Fila, the fast-growing sportswear and shoe maker based in the north Italian textile town of Biella, has found one way of coping with a fundamental problem of European manufacturing. It is trying not to have any. The company started in 1926 as a family-owned knitwear manufacturer. After widespread changes over the past two decades, Fila's production is now carried out by about 50 independent low-cost subcontractors around the world. Roughly 85 per cent of output came from the Far East last year, with just under 10 per cent of its goods made in Italy. Fila has switched to Asian production as part of 'globalisation of sales, sourcing and creativity', according to Mr Enrico Frachey, the 59-year-old managing director. This has also involved an intense attack on the booming US market, which accounted for 63 per cent of sales last year. In his office in front of a wall map of China - 'more and more important for our future' - Mr Frachey says: 'We are a kind of textbook. The only chance for US and European companies to survive in this field is to do what we did.' Mr Frachey worked for Fila during the 1970s, presiding over its diversification into sportswear, helped by promotional deals with stars like Bjorn Borg, the Swedish tennis champion. He left in early 1980. After rejoining in 1987, he pushed Fila's US expansion and built up subcontracting. Fila's basketball shoes, tennis gear and ski outfits compete for retail supremacy around the world with leading brands such as Reebok, Nike and Adidas. Now 70 per cent owned by the holding company Gemina, Fila closed its last production line in Biella in 1983. The old factory floor has been refurbished into a lavish auditorium for displaying its outfits to the sportswear trade. Staff in Italy, which totalled 2,500 in the 1950s and 1,800 in the 1960s, has now declined to 270, with a further 670 employed abroad - mainly in quality control, design, distribution and marketing. Turnover has rocketed 10-fold since the late 1980s. Overall sales increased last year to L741bn (Dollars 441m) from L515bn in 1992. Fila hopes to achieve turnover of L1,000bn by 1995. Of its shoe production, roughly 40 per cent is made in Indonesia, and 30 per cent in China. In sportswear, the two countries each account for 20 to 25 per cent. Mr Frachey says making up a track suit in an Indonesian or Chinese garment factory costs L5,000, against L35,000 to L40,000 in Italy. Even South Korea is now a relatively high-cost site, with production about 40 per cent more expensive than in China. Saving manufacturing costs releases funds for the company's huge budget for promotion and marketing - last year, L60bn or 8 per cent of sales. With 70 per cent of its costs and revenues in dollars, Fila has become progressively less Italian. Reflecting US dominance in leisure wear, even Italian design is now becoming less important. 'Fila is losing the Italian look. There is more feeling for American brands,' says Mr Frachey. He does not exclude the possibility that, one day, the company may sever its Italian ties altogether. 'The European market is a small project. We are beyond this. Our market is the world.' This ten-part series began yesterday. It will continue on Monday with a look at the labour market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vera Romanova: "Review of Ecological Situation </F> in 1993; No Reason for Optimism"]    [Text] Around 33,000 specialists and academics are working  for the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural  Resources (Minprirody), including the 630 members of the central  staff. These seemingly high figures are not that impressive,  because ecologists are responsible for drafting legislative  instruments and administrative ordinances and for monitoring and  evaluating environmental conditions in various parts of the  country.    The conclusions everyone has drawn from the results for 1993  are not optimistic. Ecological conditions are still growing  worse. In addition to the decline of technological discipline at  many enterprises, there is the low rate of retooling, the  reduced allocations for environmental construction and  renovation projects, and the use of substandard types of fuel.  Ecological conditions are still at the critical point in 44  cities in the country (Moscow, Novokuznetsk, Nizhniy Tagil,  Bratsk, and others). In just the first half of 1993, 207 cases  of pollution levels 10 or more times in excess of allowable  limits were recorded here. There has been no decrease in the  total number of accidents or in the ecologically harmful  emissions of industrial and agricultural facilities and public  utilities. The operations of more than 120 enterprises, shops,  units, and facilities were halted (temporarily) for violations  of water conservation laws.    Specialists are still particularly concerned about the  radiological conditions throughout the country, and especially  in the areas surrounding facilities of the nuclear complex.  Mobile sources of pollution are creating additional problems:  The total quantity of harmful vehicle emissions has increased  dramatically, and this is certainly connected with the increase  in the number of vehicle owners who will not stop driving even  in winter. Some species of animals and fish have been reduced to  the critical point as a result of the deterioration of their  habitats and the higher number of poachers.    One of the problems inhibiting effective Minprirody  operations, according to Minister Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, is  the flawed legal base. Many necessary laws simply do not exist,  and those which have been passed are frequently contradictory.  The failure to draw clear distinctions between the functions of  central and regional agencies has led to the proverbial  situation in which "too many cooks are spoiling the soup."    As Danilov-Danilyan said at the final collegial meeting of  Minprirody, departmental specialists drafted 44 presidential  edicts last year and coordinated 42 draft legal instruments  received from other organizations. Subdivisions of the state  Board of Environmental Impact Appraisals reviewed 64,000  pre-planning and planning documents of various types and  standardizing documents. These impressive figures include the  fundamentals of Russian Federation water, land, and forest  legislation, draft laws "On Lake Baykal," "On Ecological  Security," and "On Oil and Gas," and the "Fundamentals of RF  Legislation on Flora." Their future, however, now depends on the  new parliament, which is unlikely to consider these bills until  it has "scrutinized" some political matters and has scored  additional privileges for its members.    Finances are another of the ecologists' concerns. According  to Danilov-Danilyan, ecological policy should be coordinated  with economic reforms. The amount allocated to finance all of  the operations of Minprirody organizations in 1993 was 22.6  billion rubles, which was equivalent to 83.2 percent of the  amount agreed upon with the Ministry of Finance and just over  half of the estimated cost of these operations.    The 30 programs of environmental recovery and several dozen  programs of regional, oblast, territorial, and municipal  socioeconomic development are based on the scientific and  technical program called "Russia's Ecological Security." The  implementation of this plan, however, might be disrupted because  the financing has been cut to just about one-third of the  original amount. Only 2.6 billion of the 6.87 billion rubles was  allocated in 1993.    The required amounts are minimal on the national scale and  are within the limits of the error built into the state budget.  "Ecological allocations are not this low in any other country in  the world. That is why the unsatisfactory state of our  environment is not surprising. Under these conditions, there is  no hope of improvement," the minister has repeatedly pointed out.    In spite of this, six natural preserves (with a total area  of  8 million hectares) were established last year, and the plans  were drawn up for seven more, which should be established this  year. Ecologists have calculated that around 40 percent of  Russia's territory (7-8 million square kilometers) is unaffected  by economic activity, except for the planes flying overhead.  This "ecological gold mine" must be protected from industrial  inroads. As a result of the work on the plans for the sound  network of state natural preserves and national parks, these  territories (along with the 77 existing preserves, with an area  of 27 million hectares) will cover 53.6 million hectares, or  3.12 percent of the area of the Russian Federation, by 2005.    Six new maritime inspection boards were also created for the  protection of the resources of the Russian Federation's  territorial waters, continental shelf, and maritime economic  zone, which are under unequivocal federal jurisdiction. Because  of the inadequate equipment of these inspection boards, however,  the state of Russia's maritime resources and their ecologically  acceptable use are being monitored on an area of only 900,000  square kilometers, or only 13 percent of the total. It is  possible that the Minprirody treasury will be supplemented  slightly by unpaid fines and pending claims amounting to 7  million rubles and just over 500 million rubles respectively.    Figures of this size are unlikely to intimidate large  enterprises. It is often simpler and more convenient for them to  pay the fines than to change their technology, install sewage  treatment equipment, etc. Money and the profit motive are the  deciding factors in a market economy. This is why Minprirody  plans to continue developing environmental and conservation tax  benefits, instituting preferential customs duties for operations  connected with environmental activity, and developing market  mechanisms promoting the prudent use of resources on different  levels (the federation, the region, and the enterprise). It will  also finish setting standards to regulate environmental impact  studies in privatization projects and in the collection of  environmental damages caused by industrial accidents. Standard  fees will be set for radioactive pollution. Experiments will be  conducted with regional ecological insurance and with improved  economic mechanisms in territories under special protection.    Viktor Danilov-Danilyan is determined to take action. It is  possible that he now has a partner in Aleksandr Zaveryukha, the  government curator of the ecological establishment, who already  attended a Minprirody collegial meeting. In any case, he is  certain to take a special interest in the group of "land"  problems.</p>

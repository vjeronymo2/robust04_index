			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Debut for ethical trust FRIENDS Provident is set to launch the first ethical investment trust, which will have a split capital structure and will be available in personal equity plan form. Investments will go through two screening processes, one by the Ethical Investment Research Service (EIRIS) and the other by a committee of reference which includes such celebrities as Joanna Lumley. Companies will be chosen on such positive criteria as benefiting the local community, and rejected on negative grounds such as making arms or gambling. Friends Provident already runs Pounds 300m of money on an ethical basis, including three unit trusts and a managed pension fund. Do ethics prevent investors from making profits? Not necessarily. The Friends Provident Stewardship fund is 25th out of 77 in the UK equity growth sector over the seven years to October 1, recording growth of 106 per cent (offer-to-bid with income re-invested: source Hardwick Stafford Wright). The other two funds are not quite as successful: Stewardship Income is 80th out of 92 in the UK equity sector over the five years to October 1, with growth of 36 per cent; Stewardship North American is 64th out of 98 in its sector over the same period (with growth of 82 per cent). The new trust will offer a mixture of ordinary and zero dividend preference shares, and will have a limited life. Full details of the issue will not be available until November. Broker Greig Middleton is looking to raise over Pounds 30m. Edinburgh Investment Trust, the second largest in the industry, this week reported a 7.2 per cent rise in its net asset value per share over the six months to September 30 and a 3.5 per cent rise in its interim dividend.</p>

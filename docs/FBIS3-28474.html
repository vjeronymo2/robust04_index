The election was announced by Deputy Prime Minister Datuk  Sri  Anwar Ibrahim in a statement issued by the Prime Minister's  Department this evening.    Tuanku Ja'afar, who is the Deputy Yang DiPertuan Agung, will  succeed the present king, Sultan Azlan Shah, the sultan [state  ruler] of Perak. The statement said Tuanku Ja'afar's five-year  term as king will take effect from April 26.    The Conference of Rulers also elected Selangor's Sultan  Tunku  Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin  Alam Shah as the Deputy Yang Di-Pertuan Agung for a similar  term. Tuanku Ja'afar, son of the first Yang DiPertuan Agung, is  the only ruler in office, who began his career as a diplomat.  Born in July 1922 in Kelang, Selangor, Tuanku Ja'afar began his  diplomatic career in 1957 as the Malaysian Charge d'affaires in  Washington.</p>

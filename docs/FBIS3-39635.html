			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rolf Gustavsson: "Spain Rejects Phasing-In"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- Without beating about, the bush Spain  is rejecting Sweden's wish to be granted a phasing-in period for  contributions to the EU [European Union] budget.    "Spain's position is very clear. We are opposed to a system  under which Sweden's contribution to the EU's budget is phased  in," Spanish Finance Minister Pedro Solbes told SVENSKA  DAGBLADET.    "We have had such transitional arrangements in the past, but  at that time there was also gradual integration into the EU  system. Sweden will be a full member from day one and from this  it follows that Sweden will have all the rights and all the  duties of a member country from day one.    "I also understand that this is a very sensitive issue for  Sweden and this is why I think that it will not be resolved  until the final moments in the negotiations," said Spain's  finance minister, who was formerly European affairs minister and  one of those responsible for Spain's membership negotiations  with the EU in the eighties.    Pedro Solbes also denied the reports published in THE  FINANCIAL TIMES on Monday [14 February] that claimed that Spain  had proposed that the new EU members' contributions to the EU's  budget should go in their entirety to the four poorest member  countries -- Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland.    "I have never seen such a proposal, and I think that the  idea  is totally idiotic," Pedro Solbes said.    Finance Minister Anne Wibble and Under Secretary of State  Carl B. Hamilton are making a round-trip through the EU capitals  to win sympathy for Sweden's budget demands. The first positive  development in the finance minister's diplomatic mission could  come today when she meets with Peter Schmidhuber, who is the EC  commissioner responsible for the budget. The Commission has  calculated the flow of money between Sweden and the EU in a way  that is much more favorable for Sweden than the results the  Swedish Finance Ministry has arrived at.    The Commission's calculations, which SVENSKA DAGBLADET  reported on Saturday, predict that Sweden's contribution to the  EU budget will be around 17 billion kronor -- around 5 million  kronor less than Sweden's calculations. The Commission  estimates the flow of money back to Sweden at around 12 billion  kronor, while the Finance Ministry calculations are somewhere  between 7 and 12 billion. According to the Commission, the net  contribution from Sweden would therefore amount to 5 billion  kronor per year -- something that looks like a happy calculation  for Sweden.    The Swedish side is distrustful of the Commission's  estimates, but if they do turn out to be correct the budget  issue would suddenly become a relatively easy point in the  negotiations. Perhaps Sweden would even drop its demand?</p>

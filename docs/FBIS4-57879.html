			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fabioli Vechionacce from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] The value of the bolivar fell more than 29 percent  on Tuesday in response to changes implemented by the Central  Bank of Venezuela in the mechanism for allocating dollars for  commercial banks.    As of Tuesday, the official average exchange rate at the  Central Bank of Venezuela was 156.31 bolivares to the dollar,  which means dollars were sold by [words indistinct] at a minimum  price of 151.50 and a maximum of 175 bolivares. There was a  36-bolivar increase over the official closing price the previous  day, which was 139 bolivares. As for the unofficial market,  there was a 3-bolivar drop compared to the closing price on  Monday. At six banks, the dollar was sold for as much as 180  bolivares, which broke the previous highest rate by 15  bolivares. The devaluation of our currency could be described  as historic if we bear in mind that in 1993 the total  devaluation was 33.2 percent. That is the response to the new  system [words indistinct] dollars by the Central Bank of  Venezuela, which has its pros and cons because at least the  Venezuelan Petroleum Chamber believes it is a positive step  toward strengthening the country's economy.    [Words indistinct] from the Venezuelan Petroleum Chamber  said:    [Begin recording][Venezuelan Petroleum Chamber official, in  progress] ...to return to the country's exchange rate, and we  hope to return to this reality. We must not return to an  artificial, controlled exchange rate. We hope to adapt to a  progressive devaluation.    [Unidentified reporter] Today, how much was [words  indistinct]?    [Petroleum Chamber official] In the case of several  companies  affiliated with the Petroleum Chamber, the rate is 170 or 172  bolivares per dollar.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Petroleum Chamber official] That is correct. That is what I  just said. The accelerated devaluation rate is unfortunate, but  if we must choose between having a dollar at a single exchange  rate of 160 bolivares, which we had before, and what we have  now, we prefer what we have now. [end recording]    According to Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of  Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry] President  Edgardo Romero Nava, the foreign exchange allocation system  implemented by the Central Bank of Venezuela will fail if a  macroeconomic stabilization program is not implemented.    [Begin Romero Nava recording] [Words indistinct] includes  all  factors linked to the economy. [passage indistinct]. [end  recording]    It is important to note that according to the (?Dutch)  method  implemented by the Central Bank of Venezuela, the issuing bank  sells the currency [words indistinct] at the highest price so it  is subject to the forces of supply and demand on the free market.    Finally, the Fedecamaras president said he believes that if  the exchange rate situation continues on it is present course,  inflation will reach 50 percent by the end of the year.</p>

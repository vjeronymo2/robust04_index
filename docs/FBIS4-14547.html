			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia has no legal and historical grounds to return  to Lithuania archives, which are at present in the Russian  Federation, and sees no grounds to form a negotiating commission  to solve this problem, maintains Nikolay Obertyshev, the  ambassador of the Russian Federation to Lithuania.    Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas Januska, who met  with the Russian diplomat, regards this step by Russia as a  political ploy and maintains that such stance of the neighboring  state is completely unacceptable to Lithuania, as it is contrary  to the agreement between the governments of Lithuania and Russia  and to the international archival principle that archives must  be kept where they are compiled. According to Albinas Januska,  Lithuania reserves the right to raise the issue of the return of  the archives in negotiations with Russia.</p>

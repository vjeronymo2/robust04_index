			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / IRI plans telecoms sector merger IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, yesterday revealed plans to rationalise the telecommunications sector, starting with the merger of Sip and Italcable by the end of this year. Sip is Italy's main telecoms utility, while Italcable handles intercontinental traffic. Both companies are quoted. The union will be the first step towards grouping Italy's public sector telecoms activities, split between seven main companies, into a single concern. The new organisation, expected to be called Telecom Italia, should be operational by 1995-96, by which time the entire sector could be largely privatisated. Pressure for rationalisation and privatisation has come from the government and IRI itself. IRI's new management, facing a cash crisis, has identified telecoms, controlled by the Stet holding company, obvious privatisation candidate. Last night, Stet announced it was issuing a L565bn Eurolira bond, convertible into Sip savings shares, in a further step in the slow privatisation process. The deal could cut Stet's stake in Sip savings shares from 32 to 18 per cent. The government has set IRI a June 30 deadline to prepare rationalisation plans. IRI intends to start by merging the main providers of services, while keeping manufacturing and mobile telecoms apart. About 40 per cent of Sip's ordinary shares and 47 per cent of those in Italcable are floating. Telecom Italia will subsequently absorb Telespazio and Sirm, Stet's satellite and maritime communications subsidiaries. Telecom Italia will also comprise Iritel, formerly ASST, the unit responsible for domestic trunk communications and short-distance international calls. The future of Stet's equipment manufacturing (Italtel) and network service (Sirti) businesses is less clear. Stet has been looking for foreign investors in Italtel, in which AT&amp;T has a 20 per cent stake. Talks with leading telecoms groups, including the US company, are under way. The highly profitable mobile telecoms business, run by Sip, will be hived off into a separate company, in which Telecom Italia will retain a minority stake. The rest is likely to be floated. Shares in Stet have risen sharply in recent weeks ahead of bullish forecasts about tariff deregulation and restructuring. The Italian government hopes to float about 20 per cent of the IMI financial services group and 30-35 per cent of the big Ina state insurance company this year. Investors will be able to swap medium and long-term government bonds for shares in the two companies.</p>

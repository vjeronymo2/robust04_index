			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Cruz, 16 Dec -- The Special Antinarcotics  Force (FELCN) has confirmed the arrest of Rene Gandarillas  Soriano, who is currently considered to be the number one drug  trafficker in Bolivia, although FELCN Commander Lieutenant  Colonel Gonzalo Butron stated that Gandarillas Soriano is just  ``one of the many fugitive drug traffickers.''    It was learned that Gandarillas Soriano had been pursued for  several months by the antinarcotics organizations, until he was  located while having dinner with friends in the El Jacuu steak  house.    The drug trafficker was sent to La Paz, but was returned to  this city to face trial under the precepts of Law No. 1008.    According to antinarcotics authorities Gandarillas Soriano  is  linked to the case for which Juan Carlos Velez is being tried,  and presumably has links with Nando Gutierrez Mansilla, who is  currently jailed in Chonchocoro.    FELCN sources indicated that Gandarillas Soriano is a much  more important trafficker than Logio Yoyo Nunez Vaca and  Hernando Nando Gutierrez, who were arrested in the ``Without  End'' and ``Gigantic White'' operations respectively.</p>

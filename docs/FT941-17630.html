			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Elevation of everyday objects - Lynn MacRitchie explains what 'modern art' means in 1994 'I do not like art today. I think it has gone to hell, as a result of the financial attitude,' wrote Peggy Guggenheim in her autobiography in 1960. So trenchant a judgment may give us pause, especially as 1993 ended with the art 'market,' as defined by the international sales figures from Sotheby's and Christie's, 'significantly improved' on the previous year. Ms Guggenheim's position was not entirely innocent, however. She had been used to getting work from the artists she discovered for comparatively small sums, and was especially cross when she could no longer afford to pay the prices which the American art market achieved for the work of her former proteges. While it is easy to feel sympathy with her horror at discovering buyers of art who purchase merely for investment, the conclusions she is tempted to draw are more dubious. She went on to write that the 20th century, having produced Cubism and Abstract Expressionism, could be expected to produce no more great art. 'A field must lie fallow now and again,' she concluded, adding 'Artists try too hard to be original. That is why we have all this painting that isn't painting any more.' Oh but Peggy, that is just where you were wrong. Painting is painting now, some of it good, some of it bad, just like it always was. The only difference is that painting now has to take its place along with a whole lot of other ways artists have developed over the last 40 or so years of expressing what it is that they want to say. Some would argue that the agenda for this, and indeed for the art of the end of the 20th century, was set by Ms Guggenheim's first adviser on contemporary art, Marcel Duchamp, who abandoned painting in favour of experiments with the mechanics of visualisation, the elevation of everyday objects into the realm of art simply by the artist's declaring them so to be. 'I don't know what I would have done without him. He had to educate me completely. I could not distinguish one modern work from another,' Ms Guggenheim admitted of Duchamp with her customary candour, at the same time acknowledging that art is not just something which can be known to be good or bad at first glance. It is something about which it is possible, indeed necessary, to learn. This truth has been lost sight of these last few years when the politics of the marketplace and the pressure for success have skewed our view of what it is, exactly, that artists do. The fact that some people pay enormous amounts of money is not relevant to the work which is done. For whatever artists may create, it is not the art market. What I think they do, and what Peggy Guggenheim thought too when she was forced to admit it, is make us think about the world we have made. 'Art mirrors its age,' she wrote of Cubism, 'therefore it had to change completely as the world changed so vastly.' Artists offer us an image of our times, which we may accept or reject as we choose. Our only duty is to try to understand. If artists are presenting us with concrete houses or piles of bricks or paint dripped from the end of a stick over tarpaulins on the floor we must ask not how much, but why. Why this? Why now? For artists do not create in a vacuum; their work has a source and that source, fundamentally, is their life, their experience of the world we all live in. If we do not like what they make us see, it is only because, as our truest mirrors, they are showing us something of ourselves. Is it possible, for instance, to look at the work of Francis Bacon, accorded a magnificent exhibition in Venice last summer, and not recoil in horror? But his images of human suffering and degradation are valued, highly valued, in both monetary and artistic terms. We look at them and know that something of us is up there too, something which could also be twisted and dark and terrible. It just takes a little getting used too. I for one am delighted when the moment of breakthrough comes, and the struggle in the studio begins to see the light of day, whatever form it takes. I, unlike Ms Guggenheim and so many since, am willing to look at anything. And I know, as I look at an installation in a derelict factory or a performance in a desolate warehouse that, if the quality is there, the market will, eventually, follow. The artist leads, the money comes behind.</p>

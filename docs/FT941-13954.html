			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Hangover for Germany after the party in 1993 - Prospects for Frankfurt equities Last year's 46.7 per cent rise in Germany's DAX index was driven by hopes of lower interest rates and the sheer weight of money looking for a home. These hopes ensured that the market delivered its best performance since 1985. The climb was steeper than in 1989, when reunification euphoria triggered a 35 per cent gain - and better in international terms than any major market other than Hong Kong. After the party comes the hangover, and the the cardinal question for 1994, posed by Commerzbank in its review of investment opportunities for the current year, is whether the German market will make a smooth transition into a new phase of growth driven by earnings fundamentals. On the basis of what has happened so far this year, such a smooth transition is unlikely. The DAX has lost its momentum: having reached 2,266.68 on the last trading day of 1993 it has sunk 8.4 per cent to close yesterday at 2,075.61 Underpinning the new mood of caution are at least three disappointments. The first is that the Bundesbank is proving tiresomely slow in resuming its interest cuts. Once again this week the Bundesbank failed to grasp the opportunity to cut the discount and Lombard rates from the 5.75 and 6.75 per cent levels established on October 22 last year. This compares to expectations of a discount rate of 3.75 per cent by the end of the year - expectations which are well discounted in current bund and equity prices. The second is the fall-out from the Metallgesellschaft affair. The near collapse of Germany's 14th largest industrial company has focused investors' minds on the inadequacies of the German system of corporate control. Foreign investors have placed their trust in the past in the German two-tier board system, which reposes responsibility for monitoring management with the supervisory board. In Metallgesellschaft's case, an especially distinguished collection of bankers and industrialists sitting on the group's supervisory board failed to stop the oil-futures trading which helped lead to restated current and potential losses of DM3.3bn, or around ten times the reported loss for 1992-93. For international investors the affair poses disconcerting questions about the level of control in place at other large German companies, many of which are large conglomerates with myriad subsidiaries like Metallgesellschaft. Also, given the scale of the accounting adjustment (which reflects operational losses as well as the impact of the futures trading), it casts further doubt on the reliability of German accounts. The Metallgesellschaft example lends weight to the argument that German accounting overstates a company's underlying operating performance during economic downturn even if, when times are better, German accounts understate what US or UK investors would understand as profits. When Daimler-Benz published its accounts under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in conjunction with the listing of its shares in New York, it reported a substantially higher loss than under German rules. The third disappointment is that induced by Siemens' warning last week that earnings for the current year will fall by between 10 and 15 per cent in the current year, in spite of a rise in orders. This was unexpected and has raised doubts about the soundness of earnings forecasts for the many companies which will be reporting interim figures in the second quarter of the year. Add in the political uncertainty generated by the prospect of a multitude of elections in Germany this year, and the three factors combine to make German share prices look expensive, even after this month's correction. According to Hoare Govett, the historic price earnings multiple for 1993 has reached close to 40 times earnings whilst the prospective p/e for the current year is at a record high of more than 25 times earnings. The London broker predicts that total earnings for the German market will rise by 47 per cent this year, while the increase in some industrial sectors may be as much as 76 per cent. These increases reflect the consensus that the low-point of the German downturn has been reached and that companies will this year start to reap the benefits of their cost-cutting programmes. Hoare Govett does acknowledge misgivings about a near 50 per cent rise in earnings against a backdrop of modest economic growth - say an increase of 0.5 per cent in GDP this year - misgivings that are likely to have been accentuated by the Siemens' warning. Prospects are modest. A senior German fund manager says that investors can look forward to a DAX level of 2,300-2,400 but refuses to commit himself to say when. Accordingly, individual stock performance will play more of a role this year than last. Deutsche Bank Research likes car makers, capital goods and chemicals, whilst underweighting banks and maintaining only a neutral commitment to the insurance sector. Hoare Govett, by contrast, underweights the automotive and metals sectors and takes a neutral position in chemicals, consumer goods, utilities and engineering.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPUBLICANS TOSS A GRAND OLD CONVENTION;  </P> <P> POLITICS: DELEGATES PLAY DOWN THEIR DIFFERENCES AND PLAY UP WHAT UNITES THEM --  THE BATTLE TO GAIN CONTROL OVER THE LEGISLATURE.  </P> <P> If you are a loyal Republican, walked your precincts, licked all those  envelopes, slaved at the phone banks on Election Day -- this is your reward. A  weekend of politics at the state Republican Party convention. The harvest of  the grass roots.  </P> <P> Delegates began arriving Friday and by Saturday numbered 900 for this ritual  held twice a year. Reporters, consultants, operatives and politicians pushed  the total participation to perhaps 1,200 or more -- to hear the ballyhoos of a  party with growing hopes of attaining majorityhood, but still uneasy with  anything that alters its old-fashioned conservative principles.  </P> <P> Most Californians know of state political conventions as simple platforms at  some remote hotel where office and publicity seekers speak over the heads of  the delegates, through the news media, to voters at large. In other words, a  hot air show.  </P> <P> But for delegates, this is Democracy in full flourish -- for better or worse,  and sometimes both. This is what Democracy looks like 200-plus years after a  revolution.  </P> <P> "You know how you got started in politics. You go to a meeting. Your reward is  you get invited back to another meeting. . . . Pretty soon, you're in charge,"  state Sen. Marian Bergeson said by way of tribute to the delegates. Many of  whom said it took up to five years of work to get this far.  </P> <P> From the vantage point of the rank and file, the convention is part social,  part personal -- but always political.  </P> <P> "Without these gatherings, you get the blahs," said longtime Laguna Niguel  activist Dorothy Hughes.  </P> <P> Friday was the day when the leaders of the state GOP, chiefly Chairman Frank  Visco, a good-natured Lancaster insurance man, tried to establish the tone for  the weekend.  </P> <P> This time, the effort was to try and channel the energy of the delegates away  from internal squabbles about those issues that divide Republicans -- and  toward a matter that unites them: reapportionment.  </P> <P> Visco and the party announced that they had budgeted $400,000 for television  commercials to support a pair of June ballot initiatives -- Propositions 118  and 119 -- to stop Democratic control over the drawing of legislative and  congressional districts. One initiative would establish a commission to draw  districts, the other would require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature instead  of a simple majority.  </P> <P> The GOP argues that majority Democrats have gerrymandered lines unfairly to  concentrate Republicans in the fewest number of districts. This results in  Democrats "unfairly" having 60% of the congressional seats. Visco said if  either Proposition 118 or 119 passed and resulted in the "fair" drawing of  district lines, the Republicans would have up to 60% of the seats.  </P> <P> One of the highlights of the convention occurred later Friday night -- a forum  for 16 of the party's candidates for statewide office, from lieutenant governor  down. It was an unusual mix of the obscure, the serious, the odd and  unexpected, as candidates scrambled to say something compelling about  themselves in a brief allotment of time.  </P> <P> John Harden is one of those little-known candidates unbothered by having to  pander for votes. A La Habra claims adjuster, he is running for insurance  commissioner under the terms of the 1988 insurance revolt initiative,  Proposition 103. Harden will take the office, all right, but as for Proposition  103: "It's a hysterical group of people getting together about something of  which they know nothing!" he huffed.  </P> <P> For those who say politicians never have any new ideas there was insurance  commissioner candidate John Parise, a soft-spoken insurance lawyer. He proposed  a 20-cent increase of the gasoline tax to provide basic insurance for all  motorists -- a low paper work fee directly tied to the amount of driving a  person does.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores figured everyone in California would  like to spend more of their lives involved with politics, just like the  delegates. She said that if elected California's secretary of state, she would  lead the way to televise proceedings of the Legislature.  </P> <P> "Even in Moscow, debates of the government get No. 1 ratings. Where is the  leadership here?" she demanded.  </P> <P> Her rival, conservative Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Gordon Levy, tried the  politics of confrontation. Not with her, but with the delegates. He listed all  the lawyers running for office, and added with a snarl, "And I'm a lawyer."  </P> <P> The crowd booed enthusiastically.  </P> <P> The party's two lieutenant governor candidates were given a chance to debate  face to face. Although both scored points with supporters as they recounted  their views, Sen. Bergeson bested Sen. John Seymour on the matter of memorable  one-liners, or sound bites.  </P> <P> On the question of drugs, Bergeson won when she emphasized that she is against  legalization. Period. "Read my lipstick!"  </P> <P> Seymour lost with his explanation of political leadership. "Leadership is the  ability to stand up and be counted when it counts."  </P> <P> Delegates then broke for a giant lobby party at the Santa Clara Marriott, which  lasted long into Saturday morning. There was no allowance for hangovers at this  convention, however.  </P> <P> At 7:30 a.m. delegates were threading past hawkers selling buttons and  conservative books, past an anti-abortion booth with graphic displays of  fetuses, past all kinds of pamphleteers, to hear a 40-minute wake-up speech  from U.S. Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Jack Kemp.  </P> <P> A favorite of conservatives, Kemp was invited to attend the convention in an  effort to generate some excitement on the party's right flank for its moderate  nominee-apparent for governor, Pete Wilson.  </P> <P> For his part, Wilson acknowledged that not just conservatives but some  important agribusiness leaders are expressing early discontent with his  campaign. Agricultural interests worry that he is trying too hard to please  environmentalists on state regulation of pesticides. They are trying to nudge  him back into their corner.  </P> <P> Wilson, a two-term U.S. senator, said farmers would come to see that he is  acting in their long-term interest by proposing the creation of a state  environmental protection agency.  </P> <P> The most ubiquitous figure at the convention was former Rep. Dan Lungren. He  officially announced his candidacy for attorney general with a record four  speeches in less than 18 hours at the hotel.  </P> <P> Delegates had to look harder, to peer behind the scenes, to watch some of the  politics that party leaders wanted to de-emphasize at this convention. Abortion  is a case in point.  </P> <P> Unlike the national Republican Party, the California GOP is officially silent  on the touchy question. Its candidates are deeply divided -- from Pete Wilson,  who is strongly in favor of a woman's right to choose an abortion, to Lungren,  who is just as strongly opposed.  </P> <P> This is just the kind of fight some delegates like to stir up, but Visco and  other party officials strived to defuse it. "We're leaning more toward becoming  an umbrella party rather than one of single issues," he said.  </P> <P> He said party leaders are seeking a compromise abortion plank in the 1990  platform that "everyone is happy with."  </P> <P> But wouldn't such a statement have to be bland and meaningless? Visco was  asked.  </P> <P> "That," he said cheerfully, "is exactly what we're hoping for."  </P> <P> Contributing to this story were Times staff writers Daniel M. Weintraub and  David Lesher.  </P> <P> * DEUKMEJIAN LOBBIES FOR GAS TAX  </P> <P> Republican governor tells GOP faithful it's OK to support a tax hike. A30  </P></p>

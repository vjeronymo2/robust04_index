			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: BP seeks buyer for Texas subsidiary BP IS seeking a buyer for Tex/Con Oil and Gas, a wholly-owned Texas-based subsidiary which holds all the British company's onshore natural gas interests in the US, excluding Alaska. BP Exploration declined to comment on its plans for Tex/Con. However, energy industry sources said the sale would be in keeping with BP's shift of emphasis in its exploration activities from the lower 48 US states to 'frontier' areas, such as Alaska and Central and South America. An analyst in London said Tex/Con is likely to fetch between Dollars 650m and Dollars 1bn. According to US reports, BP has appointed investment bank JP Morgan to handle the sale. Prospective buyers will soon be invited to inspect details of Tex/Con's financial and operating condition in New York and Houston. Tex/Con's business, which includes exploration, production and pipelines, is centred in Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. It has interests in 3,000 wells and operates 1,500 miles of gas-gathering pipelines. Tex/Con produces about 11,800 barrels of oil and 121m cu ft of gas a day. BP does not disclose revenue or profit figures for Tex/Con. But low natural gas prices, an inability to fully replace reserves, and falling oil production appear to have contributed to BP's disillusion with Tex/Con, which was set up as an autonomous, entrepreneurial venture. Staff has been sharply cut back as part of an effort to reduce overheads. The company's problems emerged last week when BP announced Tex/Con's chief executive Mr Bill Johnson was taking early retirement. Mr Johnson has been replaced by Mr Bill Sears, formerly vice-president for offshore exploration.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (5): Only a little bang DEREGULATION of Nigeria's capital market, which has been on the agenda for years now, got as far as the launch pad in February with the publication of a set of guidelines for the new issue market. The package came as something of a disappointment falling a long way short of a little bang, let alone a big one. The most important advance is the decision to shift the responsibility for pricing new issues from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the issuing houses, the risk takers themselves. But this is hedged around with qualifications, requiring the issuing house to state the method of valuation used in fixing the price - market forces, it seems, will not suffice - making underwriting mandatory, setting the maximum underwriting commission at 1.5 per cent, and insisting that total issue costs are less than 10 per cent of the issue value. The SEC must vet prospectuses and will also have to approve the basis of allotment where issues are oversubscribed. That such a package qualifies as deregulation is itself a commentary on how controlled the market is. The guidelines are a modest step forward to the extent that shares are now priced by the issuing house but the failure to deregulate the secondary market - on the Nigerian Stock Exchange share prices may not fluctuate by more than a ceiling margin of 10 kobo (less than half a US cent) - has been criticised by brokers and banks. For all its shortcomings, the Nigerian market has grown rapidly and is playing an increasingly important role in financing the private sector, though not government which has not issued any gilts for seven years. The number of listed companies which stagnated for much of the 1980s, increasing from 93 in 1982 to 102 by 1988, has since risen rapidly. There has been a 50 per cent increase since 1988 with 156 companies now listed on the NSE's six floors around the country. A seventh floor is planned for the capital, Abuja. The new issue market, which was dormant in the mid-80s, when only N335m of new capital was raised in 1987/88, has since come to life. In 1991, N1.5bn was raised in 52 issues and this increased 170 per cent last year to a record N4.1bn from 67 offers. On the secondary market, capitalization rose 44 per cent last year to N32.5bn and has since increased further to N33bn at the end of February. The share price index jumped more than 40 per cent during 1992 to 1108 and by mid-March had edged ahead to 1123. Deregulation, the advent of discount houses and the plan to fund government deficits through the market rather than by printing money at the Central Bank, will give the market a boost over the next 18 months. If the government is serious about maintaining high interest rates - forcing firms to go to the market for new equity - and the issue of tradeable securities to fund the fiscal deficit, then both the new issue market and the stock exchange are set to grow even more rapidly.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / NZ premier plays down rebel's win MR JIM Bolger, New Zealand prime minister, yesterday played down a landslide win by Mr Winston Peters, a dissident in the ruling National party, in a weekend parliamentary by-election despite claims that Mr Peters may be about to launch a new centre-right party ahead of a general election due in November. Political commentators say if Mr Peters chose he could put together an opposition grouping that could split conservative support and thus open the way to a Labour party victory. Mr Peters rejected suggestions he would form a new party. He won the by-election by a record 11,000 votes, confirming his position as the country's most popular politician, with a rating of around 22 per cent, compared with 7 per cent for Mr Bolger. Mr Peters, who is a Maori, was fired by Mr Bolger as minister of Maori affairs for 'disloyalty' last year after he constantly accused the government of not honouring its election promises. Mr Peters also angered Mr Bolger by continuing to claim in parliament that there were irregularities in Bank of New Zealand's finances following its near-collapse in 1988. Mr Peters was pressured by government members who forced him to resign from the ruling National Party's parliamentary caucus. This led him to quit his seat and stand for re-election as an independent. Two smaller opposition parties, the Liberals and the Alliance, made overtures to him.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The most important event featured today in Mexico  City's newspapers is the following: An armed group, mostly  Indians, the self-styled Zapata National Liberation Army [EZLN]  -- linked with the Procup [Revolutionary Workers Clandestine  People's Union Party] and the Poor People's Party, according to  state officials -- violently seized on the morning of 1 January  the municipal offices in San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo,  Altamirano, Chanal, and Las Margaritas, with a toll of at least  11 dead and dozens of injured -- three in clashes sustained with  public forces -- according to unofficial sources.    According reports from state officials, the Indians --  according to witnesses, there were about 2,200 of them -- were  armed with AR-15 rifles, .22 caliber rifles, and shotguns, and  they simultaneously stormed the five municipalities. Given the  situation, the government secretariat warned it cannot justify  the fact that fair social demands, for which there exists a  willingness to provide a solution, be used as a pretext to  violate legal order.    A Government Ministry communique said the government is  urging these groups to act wisely, recant, and establish  negotiations within a legal framework. Meanwhile, state  officials called these actions a violent provocation. They also  ordered public security forces to dissuade the armed groups,  making it possible to seek a solution to their demands, which  have yet to be stated, through dialogue and legal means.    Given the situation, the bishops of Chiapas State issued an  appeal to the EZLN forces to accept the bishops' mediation in an  effort to restore harmony and social tranquility in the  municipalities involved in the conflict. Furthermore, it is  appropriate to mention that contacts are being maintained  between federal government officials and state officials in an  effort to quickly resolve the situation.    The declaration of war issued by the Sandinist National  Liberation Army, excuse me, the EZLN, to the Mexican Federal  Army asks the nation's legislative and judicial branches to  strive to restore the nation's legality and stability. The EZLN  is asking international organizations and the International Red  Cross to supervise and regulate the clashes that its forces are  waging to protect the civilian population.    The declaration of war rejects any links to drug  traffickers,  narcoguerrillas, or any other groups when referring to the  struggle waged by the EZLN, which has ordered its military  forces to advance toward the country's capital, defeat the  Mexican Federal Army, and allow the liberated people to  democratically elect their own administrative authorities.    This is, in short, what is currently taking place in five  municipalities in Chiapas State -- San Cristobal de las Casas,  Ocosingo, Altamirano, Chanal, and Las Margaritas -- where the  self- proclaimed EZLN violently seized the municipal offices and  where there is a toll of 11 dead and dozens wounded.    A report issued early this morning by NOTIMEX reports that,  after stating the need to contribute their efforts to prevent a  possible confrontation involving the people of Chiapas, the  bishops of Chiapas agreed to take part as mediators to restore  harmony and peace in the municipalities involved in the conflict.    A communique issued by the diocese of Tuxtla Gutierrez and  Tapachula, Chiapas State, stated that, in an effort to create  conditions that will allow a fruitful dialogue, we issue an  appeal to the so-called EZLN, urging it to accept four points.  The bishops request an end to violence, respect for people's  lives, the release of kidnapped people, and they urge them to  put down their weapons, respect the law and human rights, and to  take part in a dialogue to resolve social problems.    The bishops' document mentions that, in the event that their  proposal is accepted, within the next 48 hours the bishops  promise to ask the government to establish an office to handle  social problems in the region. The bishops said they have been  trying to contact the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas,  Samuel Ruiz Garcia, since early this morning. Their efforts  have failed so far, but they add they can count on the  solidarity of this diocese's pastor.    The bishops of Chiapas note that their agreement to serve as  mediators was prompted by requests they received from different  social groups in Chiapas to search for a solution to the  problems that have arisen in San Cristobal de las Casas,  Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, and Altamirano.</p>

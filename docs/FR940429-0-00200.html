			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Past performance of an institution or persons affiliated with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters were concerned about the proposal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expand the requirements whereby an institution is not considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be financially responsible if an individual, who exercises  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial control over any other existing institutions or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defunct institution or third-party servicer, owes a liability for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a violation of a Title IV requirement, and is not making payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> according to an agreement established with the Secretary to repay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the liability. Several commenters wanted all references to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> member or members of a person's family deleted from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations citing that people should not be held financially or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legally responsible for the actions of members of their family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who have reached their majority. Another commenter was concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the inclusion of a member of the person's family without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard to whether there is any partnership between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals and felt that this requirement unnecessarily broadens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the scope of the requirement. Several commenters suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the percentage of ownership interest used to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial control over an institution or third-party servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be set at 50 percent rather than 25 percent stating that a 25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent ownership interest does not mean that the person has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control of the business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 498(e)(4)(B) refers to audit findings of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than 5 percent of an institution's Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds for any award year. The Secretary considers this statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision to be designed to require the consideration of the loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of that amount of Title IV, HEA program funds, regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether that loss was identified from an audit or as the result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a program review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary considers the criteria in the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.15(c)(2) to be indicative of serious problems with financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility. An institution in one of these categories has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already failed to comply properly with the Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements and has had the opportunity, during its appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process or other negotiations with the Department's officials, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate any mitigating circumstances that might have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justified reducing or eliminating the sanction or finding. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary agrees with the commenters who suggested that one of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the categories of past performance problems should be revised to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect a failure of an institution to resolve satisfactorily any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant compliance problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is satisfied that citing an institution for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure to submit acceptable required audit reports in a timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fashion is a better standard of past performance problems than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final determination. A final determination is issued only after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an acceptable audit report has been submitted and the findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been formally issued to the institution. An institution can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be cited for failure to submit an audit report in a timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fashion, and an institution can have its audit report returned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the report is unacceptable. These actions do not imply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the institution has committed any other violations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program requirements, but it is essential for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary to have acceptable audit reports on time so that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary can evaluate whether the institution is appropriately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administering its participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The criterion in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been revised to provide that the failure to resolve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfactorily any significant problem identified in a program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review or audit report causes an institution not to be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters suggested that performance bonds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be accepted to meet the standard for surety amounting to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least 50 percent of total Title IV HEA program funding under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute. The commenters contended that performance bonds may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide equal, if not better, protection to the Secretary than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letters of credit because it is often possible to collect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance bonds even after the expiration date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary has determined that the level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection afforded by performance bonds is not sufficient due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the relative difficulty in collecting against such instruments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared to recoveries under a letter of credit. In some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances involving school closures where a performance bond was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in place, the Secretary might be required to submit and document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims on a student-by-student basis before a third party before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collecting the full amount of institutional liabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Collection under an irrevocable letter of credit has proven to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reliable and effective in protecting the federal interests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of commenters responded to the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request in the February 28, 1994 NPRM for specific standards that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might be employed to measure the acceptability of a State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition recovery fund. Several commenters recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department only require states to certify that the fund can pay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all required refunds on behalf of schools that close  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precipitously. Some of the commenters recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary take into consideration the success of various teach-out measures which exist in the various states. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended removal of the exemption because many charges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with attending an institution that are properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in refunds are not considered part of tuition, and would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be recoverable by the student in the event an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closes. The commenter went on to recommend that the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require an actuarial analysis and certification of full funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before considering a fund acceptable. Some of the commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that a State's tuition recovery fund should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable if the State has taxing authority to require schools  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to contribute to the fund. One commenter provided the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a number of suggestions including: assessing the extent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund obligation that the fund would cover, the current funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level, maximum fund balance, amounts of annual assessments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of annual claims, the authority of the fund's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrator and the historical experience of the fund. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter believed that the Department would not effectively be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to evaluate the State's tuition recovery fund. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that the acceptability of the state's tuition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery fund should be determined by comparing a State fund's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established maximum payout to an individual institution's annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan volume.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In general, the Secretary believes that a State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition recovery fund will be found to be acceptable where it has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the backing of the full faith and credit of the State and agrees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to administer such refund payments in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the HEA programs. Based upon historical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience, State tuition recovery funds have been poorly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capitalized and fund administrators have little authority to levy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments. Many of the funds will pay refunds only for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students currently enrolled, and not to students that were owed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refunds when the institution closed. Other State tuition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery funds have only provided protection to in-state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents and, in general, have capped payments at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predetermined maximum level without regard to the refund owed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the HEA programs. Some problems have also arisen where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refunds were being made directly to students on a first-come,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first-served basis that exhausted the available funds without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apportioning them ratably to the funding sources that should have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received the refunds for the benefit of those students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given these concerns regarding the acceptability of State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition recovery funds, the Secretary does not believe it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to address these criteria through regulation at this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time. The Secretary will continue to review this issue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine what standards, if any, may be set out through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter supported the requirement that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution maintain a minimum cash reserve equal to 10 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of deferred tuition revenue but believed that an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributions to a State's tuition recovery fund should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in calculating the reserve requirement. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted that the North Carolina General Statute 115D&hyph;90 requires an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to maintain a guaranty bond in an amount equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an institution's deferred tuition revenue at peak enrollment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter believed that students were already afforded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable protection under the bond requirement and suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the cash reserve be required when no other form of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection exists. Another commenter believed that the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should fully exempt institutions which retain deferred tuition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts through independently administered escrow arrangements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Veniamin Goltsov: "Iran-Azerbaijan: New </F> Contracts"]    [Text] The negotiations in Tehran between  representatives of the oil companies of the Islamic Republic of  Iran and the Azerbaijani Republic have culminated in the signing  of two contracts. In accordance with these, Azerbaijan's oilmen  are to perform engineering-survey and seismo-exploratory  operations in the Southeast Caspian that total more than $3  million.    As Khoshbakht Yusuf-zade, doctor of geological and  mineralogical sciences and vice president of the State Oil  Company of Azerbaijan, announced, business relations with the  National Oil Company of the neighboring state began to take  shape by the end of the 1960's, when Azerbaijani geophysicists  conducted research on a study of the geological structure of the  mineral resources in the Southern Caspian that the Iranian side  needed.    Our specialists presented Iran with even fuller information  on the geological section of the shelf in accordance with  contracts for 1987 and 1991. It made possible the adoption of a  decision on the need for the drilling of the first offshore well  off the southern shores of the Caspian.    The sinking of a parametric well in the geologically complex  structure was accomplished successfully by our Khazar-2 drilling  ship. The presence of hydrocarbon raw material in the said area  was confirmed.    The specialized ships Zokhrab Veliyev and Rezonans equipped  with everything necessary for the performance of a whole set of  operations ensuing from the new contracts between the oil  companies of the two neighboring Caspian states will be setting  off shortly for the southern shores of the Caspian.</p>

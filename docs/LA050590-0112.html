			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICARAGUA'S 'FAMILY' STYLE BRIDGES POLITICAL CHASMS  </P> <P> The Bush Administration lost its first test of wills with Violeta Barrios de  Chamorro when an assistant secretary of state, Bernard Aronson, came here to  warn her against keeping Sandinista Defense Minister Humberto Ortega as head of  the army.  </P> <P> "But Senor Aronson," replied the opposition publisher who had defeated the  Sandinista revolutionaries in national elections. "Nicaragua is a family. We  have to find peace among ourselves."  </P> <P> That exchange, a week before her April 25 inauguration as Nicaragua's  president, is repeated by Chamorro's aides to portray her as more than a  matriarchal figurehead. The 60-year-old widow may be a political novice, they  say, but she is tough-minded in defense of a few guiding principles.  </P> <P> More significantly, the "family" analogy used by Chamorro served to remind her  American visitor of the web of blood ties, personal loyalties and business  partnerships that spread across the Nicaraguan political divide like so many  bridges, even after eight years of war and 30,000 dead.  </P> <P> In a country of 3.5 million people, such networks have as much to do with  politics as the polarized labels -- Sandinistas, UNO, Contras -- that they  belie. They help explain the delicate arrangements that eased the first  peaceful turnover of power from one political force to another in Nicaragua's  history.  </P> <P> "Sure, people voted to get rid of the Sandinistas, but in the Nicaraguan family  the Sandinistas are all mixed up with the others," said a lawyer who worked  first for the Sandinistas, then for the Contras and now for Chamorro. "We are  not as uncomfortable with each other as you might think."  </P> <P> In challenging President Daniel Ortega in the Feb. 25 election, Chamorro ran as  the candidate of the National Opposition Union (UNO), a 14-party alliance  embracing everyone from Communists to former Contras. Many politicians and the  rebels who remain armed see her margin of victory -- 56% to 41% -- as a mandate  to sweep the Sandinistas off the stage.  </P> <P> But in the Nicaraguan tradition of presidential supremacy, Chamorro quickly  spurned the coalition. Like the Somozas and the Ortegas who preceded her, she  rules with a team of family advisers.  </P> <P> Foremost among them is Antonio Lacayo, 43, her son-in-law and chief of staff,  who shunned revolutionary politics while thriving in agribusiness with  Sandinista partners. Her political strategist is Alfredo Cesar, 38, who is  married to Lacayo's sister. A master of shifting allegiances, Cesar fought with  the Sandinistas against Somoza, then directed Contra strategy against the  Ortegas.  </P> <P> More intent on reviving the war-battered economy than bashing the Sandinistas,  the two men, both U.S.-trained civil engineers, quietly negotiated a pact with  the outgoing government to minimize abrupt changes and conflict.  </P> <P> In the new order, the Ortega brothers keep temporary control of a reduced army  while a more radical Sandinista faction gives up the police. Chamorro's forces  dominate the elected National Assembly but Sandinistas share its leadership  posts and are ready to make alliances. Most Sandinistas retain their civil  service jobs and confiscated homes. After flexing its muscles with strikes just  before Chamorro's inauguration, the Sandinista labor movement is restraining  itself.  </P> <P> Chamorro aides involved in the pact are, like the Sandinista comandantes, men  in their 30s and 40s. They supported the 1979 Sandinista guerrilla takeover,  then turned against the revolution's leaders but remain on good terms with many  who stayed loyal.  </P> <P> "Our generation are the moderates of this country, the ones who told our  parents, 'Calm down, don't be such thieves,' " said one aide. "We made the  previous revolution and now we are making this one."  </P> <P> Carlos Hurtado, Chamorro's minister in charge of the police, "is not going to  put us all on planes to Cuba," said Vanesa Castro, a comandante's wife who  recruited him into the Sandinista movement in the 1970s.  </P> <P> Luis Sanchez Sancho, a Chamorro power-broker in the new Assembly, is the son of  prominent Sandinista lawmaker Luis Sanchez Salgado. A photo of father and son  embracing on the assembly floor last week was published by newspapers here as a  symbol of cooperation.  </P> <P> When Daniel Ortega went to Chamorro's house to concede the election, he found  one of his ministers, Alejandro Martinez Cuenca, already there and chatting  amiably with Lacayo, a high school classmate.  </P> <P> "We have a clandestine coalition, a secret understanding to keep the country  going," said Dionisio Marenco, a Sandinista from the same class.  </P> <P> Lacayo is a cousin of Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra and Col. Osvaldo Lacayo,  Sandinistas who are second and third in the army chain of command behind  Humberto Ortega -- a relationship that helped Ortega win Chamorro's trust.  </P> <P> Family ties help explain another controversial Chamorro decision -- to let the  leftist guerrillas of El Salvador keep an office here for political activity.  Two of the president's four children are Sandinistas and are close to the  Salvadoran guerrillas.  </P> <P> "In Nicaragua, families continue to be more important than ideologies," said a  commentary in La Cronica, a weekly newspaper. "The close family relations  between the parties in conflict at least make it possible for them to be  cordial and lower their voices in private discussions."  </P> <P> The loudest conflict in Nicaragua today is between Vice President Virgilio  Godoy and the Chamorro camp. Chamorro ignored objections by UNO's political  council, which Godoy leads, to keeping the army in Sandinista hands. After he  sniped at the decision, she barred him from setting up offices alongside hers  in the Casa Presidencial.  </P> <P> The feud has split the UNO coalition into two factions, with eight of the 14  parties supporting Godoy, and threatened to undo the Contras' agreement to  disarm their forces, now observing a truce, by June 10.  </P> <P> "The National Opposition Union will continue being the opposition, because this  is not a new government but simply a new facade," Godoy declared. "They don't  realize that to leave Gen. Ortega in place is to leave a spider that will trap  them in its web."  </P> <P> In a country that traditionally changes governments by force, Chamorro's aides  acknowledge the risks of such a pact. But they repeat an old Nicaraguan dictum  that has defused potential civil wars before: Better a bad deal than a good  fight.  </P> <P> "This is a transition government," one aide said. "The first fully democratic  government will be in 1996 (when Chamorro's term ends). This is just a bridge."  </P> <P> Chamorro's 13-man Cabinet is dominated by businessmen and technocrats with few  ties to organized politics. Just one minister is an UNO party leader, while  four are former Sandinistas. Health Minister Ernesto Salmeron is a pediatrician  who treats the children of Sandinista comandantes and Chamorro's grandchildren.  </P> <P> Not represented at all is the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, a  traditional business group, led by militant anti-Sandinistas. Businessmen in  the new Cabinet come from newer, more conciliatory power centers -- the  Commission on the Recovery and Development of Nicaragua and the  Harvard-affiliated Central American Management Institute.  </P> <P> "This sector of the bourgeoisie, rather than reject everything that smells of  Sandinismo, sees many of the revolutionary transformations as the basis for a  new kind of capitalism for the year 2000," said a serious analysis in the humor  magazine Semana Comica that was headlined, "All Power to the Yuppies."  </P></p>

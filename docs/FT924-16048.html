			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Metropolitan to omit final dividend SCOTTISH Metropolitan Property, the property investment company, yesterday said it would not be able to pay a final dividend in spite of its earlier stated intention to maintain last year's total of 4.4p. The shares fell 8p before recovering to close 2p lower at 24p. The board, which met on Tuesday, decided it was not prudent to pay a final dividend in light of what one of its advisers described as 'extraordinary economic circumstances'. Although the company incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 840,000 for the half year to February 15 and cut its interim dividend to 1.5p (2.53p) it said at the time that it intended to maintain the total dividend at 4.4p. A statement from the company said: 'Confidence following the General Election result was short-lived and in recent months property investment and letting markets have shown marked deterioration, resulting in a further decline in values.' Net asset value per share is expected to have fallen from 145p per share to 114p as at August 15, when the company publishes its full year results at the end of October. The company said it remained ahead of target with property sales and debt reduction and would show an improved revenue performance in the second half.</p>

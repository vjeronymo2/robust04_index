			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> PASSIONATE KITCHELL VIEW OF 'BERKELEY IN SIXTIES';  </P> <P> DOCUMENTARY: THE FILM CHALLENGES THE NOTION THAT THE ACTIVISTS WERE MOSTLY  ADVENTURERS ON A SHALLOW QUEST FOR KICKS.  </P> <P> Violence was such an omnipresent fact on some major university campuses in the  1960s that, for some of us, it's difficult to recall student life without  getting instant chaotic flashes: mass marches, demonstrations with bullhorns,  bloody confrontations, students scattering as canisters explode, the acrid  teary stink of the gas, distant gunshots or fires raging ominously in the  night.  </P> <P> Did all this happen? Did once placid groves of academe explode into street  fights and tumult? Mark Kitchell's superb, heartfelt documentary, "Berkeley in  the Sixties" (Ken Cinema, through Saturday only), reminds us that indeed they  did.  </P> <P> Kitchell's subject is Berkeley, the campus widely regarded as flash point for  all radical student activity in the decade. And, in the course of his densely  packed and continuously absorbing two hours, he shows every major event: from  the early civil rights and free-speech protests through the inferno of the  Vietnam War clashes, to the increasingly mock-apocalyptic, theatrical and  half-crazy escapades of the years after the Kennedy and King assassinations.  </P> <P> The movie is both coherent and inclusive. It distills the '60s expertly, both  evoking and commenting on the era. It brings back the major players:  free-speech dynamo Mario Savio, stuttering with anger; glum California  president Clark Kerr; poet Allen Ginsberg; and Black Panther Huey Newton. It  fills the sound track with the Grateful Dead and Country Joe and the Fish. We  are continuously swung back and forth between the violent immediacy of events  and reflections on riots past.  </P> <P> Kitchell's form is conventional: 15 main interviews cut into a wealth of  archival material. His tone is celebratory and reflective, just like his main  interviewees, who project pride at their youthful fire and idealism, twinges of  regret at opportunities lost, naivete exposed.  </P> <P> There is one important perception in "Berkeley." It attacks the idea --  popularly held among their opponents -- that '60s activists were mostly  irresponsible adventurers, pursuing allegedly idealistic goals out of a shallow  quest for kicks. ("Civil rights panty raids" one nabob sneeringly describes  their efforts.)  </P> <P> No doubt Vietnam's violence fueled violence on some campuses. It's possible  some young male protesters were driven to demonstrate physical courage to  deflect the argument that they opposed a war to save their hides. But, over and  over, one is struck by how seriously these activists took their actions, how  they weighed -- even years after the fact -- their consequences.  </P> <P> Contrastingly, one is struck by how unserious their establishment foes often  seem: Lyndon Johnson, who seems to be trying to stare down the camera as he  unleashes each new prevarication; Kerr, who seems somehow dead behind the eyes;  and Ronald Reagan, who emerges here as a somewhat comical figure, reading with  purse-lipped outrage a report from Ed Meese on the "sensual gyrations" taking  place at a student dance, or erupting into schoolmarmish petulance at a news  conference, scolding his questioners for coddling ruffians. The hipper Reagan  media image came a decade later, when he ran for President.  </P> <P> Is "Berkeley in the Sixties" (Times-rated: family, despite mature themes and  discussion) objective? Of course not. No one could make a film like this,  independently, without immense passion for the subject, and the political  passions of Kitchell and his co-workers (editor Veronica Selver,  cinematographer Stephen Lighthill) show through clearly.  </P></p>

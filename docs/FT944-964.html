			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: St Lucia's strike-breaking banana growers to get police protection The St Lucian government is to provide police protection for banana farmers whose storage sheds are being burnt and some of their fruit indiscriminately cut because they are refusing to join a farmers' strike. Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia, the leading banana exporter in the Windward Islands, which provide most of Britain's bananas, said the strikers wanted to destroy the island's banana industry. The three-week stoppage was called by the Banana Salvation Committee, which has been calling in vain for an extra-ordinary meeting of the St Lucia Banana Growers' Association to discuss the restructuring of the industry. The fruit and sheds of many farmers refusing to join the strike have been vandalised. 'This will be stopped,' said Mr Compton. The police have been investigating several cases of arson on banana farms. 'This definitely cannot continue,' the prime minister said. 'Farmers who sweat and slave in the heat of the day to promote the fuel that drives our economy, cannot have their efforts destroyed by criminal gangs who work in the dead of night, under the cover of darkness.' The prime minister said that the attacks on the farmers not joining the strike were not hampering the export of bananas from St Lucia. Despite the destruction of the storage sheds, almost all the fruit that was ready was harvested last week, when exports reached 1,900 tonnes, the highest weekly total since a tropical storm devastated most of the island's farms earlier this year. St Lucia's banana industry was hit hardest when the storm struck the Windwards in early September, losing an estimated 70,000 tonnes, or 68 per cent of the expected crop. The island's banana growers would be involved in the management of the industry, but not until the growers' association's finances were 'restored to good health,' the prime minister said. The relative lack of involvement of growers in the management of the industry is troubling farmers in the other Windward islands of Dominica, Grenada and St Vincent. The Windward Islands Farmers' Association is discussing a series of proposals to change this, according to industry officials. They say, however, that some of the proposals for changes have implications for the Windward Island governments' access to funds from Stabex, the European Union's compensatory finance mechanism for African, Caribbean and Pacific states which suffer crop losses from natural disasters.</p>

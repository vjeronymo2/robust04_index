			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / AT&amp;T in CDollars 150m cross-border service alliance with Unitel AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, angered by an alliance between rival MCI Communications and Canada's dominant telephone consortium, has forged an alliance of its own with the newest company in the Canadian long-distance market. AT&amp;T said the deal will allow it to offer seamless cross-border services to US subsidiaries in Canada, which accounts for about 15 per cent of its international telephone calls. The US group said yesterday it was acquiring a 20 per cent stake in Unitel Communications of Toronto, in exchange for access to AT&amp;T's intelligent network software and its marketing, operations and research expertise. The deal is valued at about CDollars 150m (Pounds 76m). AT&amp;T and Unitel's shareholders, Canadian Pacific and Rogers Communications, also plan to inject CDollars 200m of new equity into Unitel. Canadian Pacific will end up with 48 per cent of Unitel and Rogers 32 per cent. Final terms have yet to be negotiated and approved by the boards of the participants. Unitel gained regulatory clearance last year to set up a long-distance telephone network in competition with the long-standing monopoly held by Stentor, a consortium comprising Bell Canada, the country's biggest telephone operator, and various provincial telephone utilities. Ms Bette Ann Massick, analyst at SG Warburg in New York, said AT&amp;T's move was largely a response to the exclusive cross-border marketing and technology agreement forged last year between MCI and Stentor. AT&amp;T has launched legal proceedings against MCI, alleging that technology which MCI is providing to Sentor infringes AT&amp;T's patents. MCI has applied to have the patents nullified. Ms Massick said that by teaming with Unitel, AT&amp;T has served notice that it planned to use its marketing and financial clout to attack the MCI/Stentor alliance. The forays by AT&amp;T and MCI into Canada are likely to lead to a further integration of services across the world's busiest international telephone network. Mr George Harvey, Unitel president, said the alliance with AT&amp;T 'will accelerate Unitel's aggressive expansion' in Canada. Bell Canada said the Unitel deal proved the real competition in Canada's telecommunications market would come from global players such as AT&amp;T. Other large telecommunications groups are expected to join the fray.</p>

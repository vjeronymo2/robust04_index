			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE AUTHORITIES HOPE TO SNUFF OUT FLEDGLING GANG ACTIVITY;  </P> <P> CRIME: POLICE EFFORT IS AIMED AT PREVENTING THE CITY FROM BECOMING A HOME TO  PERMANENT GANGS.  </P> <P> Think of gang activity in Orange County and a picture might come to mind of a  carload of Santa Ana youths opening fire at a rival gang member's house.  </P> <P> But a recent report by Irvine police found that, although this planned  community of mostly upper-middle-class residents is no mecca for street gangs,  the city has gang-related problems.  </P> <P> During the past two years, police have encountered a growing number of Irvine  teen-agers involved in fights, stabbings and beatings. Police also estimate  that gang members from surrounding cities are responsible for half of the  city's burglaries and vehicle thefts.  </P> <P> This rise in gang activity prompted police investigators to spend two months  last summer examining gang-related crimes and taking a hard look at Irvine's  fledgling gangs. The resulting 32-page report and recommendations show that  while gang problems are small, they are growing noticeably.  </P> <P> "We're at a crossroads," said Sgt. Philip F. Povey of the Irvine Police  Department. "It's time for us to formulate some policy on (gangs). This will  affect what Irvine looks like five, 10 years from now."  </P> <P> Irvine police are recommending a coordinated anti-gang approach that would add  seven new officers to handle anti-gang activities and involve the school  district and community groups. The effort is aimed at preventing Irvine from  becoming a home to permanent gangs, Povey said.  </P> <P> The city does not now have any officers assigned to gang crimes. The extra  officers would concentrate on keeping track of outside gangs and watching the  growth of the city's ganglike youth groups, Povey said. They would also be  available for stakeouts and other specialized crime work.  </P> <P> Other police recommendations include:  </P> <P> * Adding a Drug Awareness Resistance Education officer to teach anti-drug and  anti-gang classes at Irvine's four high schools. The district now offers the  courses only for sixth graders.  </P> <P> * Notifying parents when police believe their children are involved in gangs,  and establishing a gang-diversion and counseling program for gang members and  their families.  </P> <P> * Working with schools to develop a peer counseling program for teen-agers and  training teachers and administrators to identify actual and potential gang  members.  </P> <P> * Encouraging Irvine service clubs to sponsor youth programs that would give  teen-agers more constructive after-school activities.  </P> <P> Police would not reveal the cost of their anti-gang plan, but based on current  police department costs, the increased staff and programs would total at least  $500,000 a year. Due to uncertain economic times ahead for the city, the Police  Department might not immediately ask for money from the City Council, said Lt.  Vic Thies.  </P> <P> "With the recession coming, it doesn't look too bright," Thies said. "If the  money's not there, we'll come up with alternative recommendations and start the  ones that don't require as much money."  </P> <P> Despite the far-reaching recommendations, Povey said Irvine's gang problem  should not be seen as major.  </P> <P> "Our problem is very, very small, and we're not trying to say the sky is  falling, because it's not," he said. "I'm sure other Southern California cities  would trade with us in a heartbeat, their gang situation to ours."  </P> <P> Lt. Robert Sayne, head of the Santa Ana Police Department's gang unit, said  Irvine might have troubles with delinquent teen-agers but he doubted it would  ever have a true gang problem because it lacks the poverty and the long history  of gangs facing cities such as Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "It's more of a trendy thing to do," Sayne said of Irvine's problems. "These  kids are bored to death in a community where every home has 2.5 kids and a BMW.  I don't feel gangs will establish themselves in Irvine and continue to thrive."  </P> <P> While police say none of the 16 potential gangs identified in Irvine has  reached a "hard core" stage, several of the groups have engaged in violent or  criminal behavior -- the key definition of a gang.  </P> <P> "As far as them being highly organized like gangs in Santa Ana or some of the  Asian gangs, no, they're not even close to that," Thies said. "And hopefully  they never will be."  </P> <P> Still, groups resembling gangs are emerging among Irvine teens, often spurred  by a student who has moved into the city from an area where gangs are a way of  life, the report said. Most prominent among these formative gangs is the  2-year-old Los Suicycos Locos, a multiracial group of 20 to 60 Irvine and  Tustin-area teen-agers whose members have been linked to several recent,  violent confrontations, police said.  </P> <P> Los Suicycos came to the Police Department's attention in March, 1989, after  members got into a fight with athletes from Woodbridge High School at a Del  Taco restaurant. Three youths were arrested after two students were hit by a  car and two others suffered cuts and stab wounds.  </P> <P> At first, police dismissed it as a fight between students from rival high  schools.  </P> <P> But later that year, an 18-year-old Los Suicycos member was arrested as a  suspect in the shooting of a 19-year-old alleged rival gang member in a Tustin  park, and another member was arrested in Newport Beach after allegedly beating  up a student with a baseball bat during a high school basketball game. And  early this year, police suspected a Los Suicycos member of stabbing a teen-ager  at a Costa Mesa dance club.  </P> <P> "They went from drinking and occasional graffiti to the big time . . . with  guns and weapons," said Tustin Police Sgt. Steve Lewis, who helped investigate  the Tustin shooting.  </P> <P> Even more ganglike, police said, were the attitudes of two victims of a July  fight between a splinter group of older Los Suicycos members and a group of  Mission Viejo youths. The two injured youths refused to cooperate with police,  saying they would take care of their assailants themselves, a response more  like those of hard-core gang members, police said.  </P> <P> "They're acting like, they're talking like, and they want to be like (a gang),"  said Thies, who called Los Suicycos "our in-house gang."  </P> <P> In addition, recent overtures from two outside street gangs have Irvine police  worried that the Suicycos might form an alliance with a bigger, tougher gang.  </P> <P> The Rolling 60s Crips in Pomona and the Lopers in Santa Ana have offered to  link with the Suicycos for drug sales, promising the protection and reputation  of a bigger gang, Povey said. So far, Los Suicycos have rejected the alliance  offers, but the deal might seem attractive because they have been on the losing  end of several fights with other non-gang youths, such as student athletes,  Povey said.  </P> <P> Because of occasional intrusions by gang members from other cities onto Irvine  high school campuses, Irvine Unified School District officials have been  working with police on the potential growth of gangs, said Paul Mills, director  of alternative and adult education and chairman of the district's Operation  Safe Campus Committee.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the district's board of trustees adopted a formal policy stating  that the district will not tolerate gang activity on campus. The policy says  that schools should work with police and community organizations to prevent  gang activity.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPPOSITION MOUNTING TO CIVIL RIGHTS CHOICE;  </P> <P> LUCAS' SELECTION BY THORNBURGH AS CHIEF ENFORCER IS VOTED DOWN BY HOMETOWN  CHAPTER OF NAACP  </P> <P> William Lucas, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's choice to be the nation's top civil  rights enforcer, is being opposed by his hometown chapter of the National Assn.  for the Advancement of Colored People -- signaling possible trouble for his  controversial nomination.  </P> <P> Tyrone Tillery, executive secretary of the Detroit chapter, said Tuesday that  its board voted, 68 to 2, Monday night to oppose Lucas, a black, citing concern  over his "competence" and sensitivity to civil rights. Tillery said that the  appointment of Lucas as assistant attorney general and head of the Justice  Department's civil rights division represents too great "a risk" after eight  years of Ronald Reagan Administration cutbacks on civil rights.  </P> <P> A history professor at Wayne State University, Tillery said that the Detroit  board expressed its view in response to a request from the NAACP's national  office in Baltimore.  </P> <P> Benjamin L. Hooks, NAACP executive director, said that he was "not in a  position" to say whether the national organization would follow suit, but that  a decision could come today.  </P> <P> Althea T. L. Simmons, chief Washington lobbyist for the civil rights  organization, said that Lucas' "background does not fit the job. It fits law  enforcement, and that's a different kettle of fish."  </P> <P> Thornburgh was speaking in Pittsburgh Tuesday and could not be reached for  comment but he has not wavered in his support for Lucas, contending that the  opposition is largely "partisan."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gubernatorial Candidate  </P> <P> Lucas, 61, is a former sheriff and county executive of Wayne County, Mich. He  ran unsuccessfully in 1986 as the Republican candidate for governor of  Michigan. He switched from the Democratic to the Republican Party in 1985.  </P> <P> Deborah Burstion-Wade, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said that the Detroit  chapter's action was "a disappointment, but it doesn't change anything." She  said that Lucas' nomination is expected to be made formally by President Bush  "in a week or so."  </P> <P> A senior White House official said that the NAACP opposition did not come as a  surprise because of what he said was the organization's liberal Democratic  leanings.  </P> <P> Lucas has come under fire for inflated job descriptions that have appeared on  some of his resumes. He also has been criticized in a jail overcrowding case  and for his acceptance, while sheriff, of free air transportation and a Las  Vegas hotel room in the mid-1970s from a Detroit man indicted but not convicted  on federal gambling conspiracy charges.  </P> <P> An aide to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will review the nomination,  said that the opposition by the Detroit NAACP chapter "to the extent that it  represents broad opposition in the black community in Detroit would be  troubling." A similar move by the national office "would have a strong adverse  effect," the aide said.  </P> <P> Another committee staff source said that the panel "will begin its  investigation when it gets the nomination," indicating that members have not  yet focused on Lucas' selection, beyond reading press accounts.  </P> <P> Lucas, who would not talk to a reporter directly, said through Burstion-Wade  that he had not been invited to the Detroit chapter's board meeting but that he  would have appeared if asked. He is a longtime NAACP member.  </P> <P> "We've had discussions with Mr. Lucas," Tillery said. "He has a lot of friends  in the NAACP but there was not sentiment (expressed at the meeting) in favor of  him."  </P> <P> Tillery said that there was the feeling at the meeting that Lucas would not  have been opposed for other Administration jobs.  </P></p>

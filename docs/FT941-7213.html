			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (7): Victim of success - Malaysia In the first half of 1993 sales of mobile phones in Malaysia were averaging about 8,000 per month. But after a surge in the Kuala Lumpur stock market, brokers started giving mobile phones to their bigger clients. The result? Mobile phone sales leapt to more than 15,000 a month and, along the way, the shares of companies involved in mobile phones soared. However, business growth has created problems. Many mobile phone users now complain that they are finding it increasingly difficult to find lines. The companies concerned and the government insist that the problems in the system will soon be rectified. Malaysia's gross domestic product has expanded by more than 8 per cent in each of the last six years. Similar growth is expected this year. The difficulties in the mobile communications sector are common to many areas in Malaysia. The country is having difficulty managing its success. Congestion and bottlenecks threaten growth. The critics say that the problems are most serious in the telecommunications sector. There is an urgent need for the government to formulate an overall telecommunications policy: if not, development could be hampered. Malaysia has been one of the first countries in Asia to privatise its telecommunications industry. In the mid-80s Telekom Malaysia, the telecommunications utility, became a corporation. In late 1990, 25 per cent of the company was floated on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. At the end of 1993, Telekom had a market capitalisation of MDollars 43.8bn (Dollars 16.3bn) and was ranked as the second biggest listed company in Malaysia. In the year to December 31, 1992, Telekom had pre-tax profits of MDollars 1.275bn - an 18 per cent rise over the previous year's figure. While Telekom still has a monopoly on many services, the government has made it clear that it wants more competition to be introduced into the sector. The cellular market has been opened to three companies besides Telekom. The biggest, Celcom, now has an estimated 60 per cent of the cellular phone market. Over the next 12 months Celcom says it aims to increase its number of subscribers from 200,000 to more than 500,000. But Celcom has to sort out congestion problems on its network. If not, two new competitors, Mobikom and Binariang, are likely to steal market share. The government has also suggested that a second carrier network will be allowed to start operating. Already Celcom has been granted so-called second international gateway rights - allowing it to set up an international service to rival Telekom's. Other companies - such as Sapura, a manufacturer of a wide variety of telecommunications equipment - are expanding aggressively overseas. The government is unlikely to allow Telekom's position as network carrier within the country to be challenged, at least not in the medium term. Officials have sought to assure Telekom investors that massive investments made in upgrading the domestic network will not be jeopardised.</p>

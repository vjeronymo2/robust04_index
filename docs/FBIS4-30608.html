			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 24 KYODO -- Michel Camdessus,  managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF),  expressed support Friday [24 June] for concerted international  effort to support the dollar and said rapid appreciation of the  yen would harm the Japanese economy.    "There are good reasons for the key central banks ... to  give  clear signals to the market that this instability is nonsense  and must be stopped," he said in an interview with KYODO NEWS  SERVICE.    The IMF chief said big swings in currency markets are bad  for  the economies involved. "Too rapid rise of the yen would be bad  for the recovery timidly starting in Japan."    For the United States, he said, further depreciation of the  dollar does not make sense because the U.S. economic  fundamentals "are certainly at the best levels during the last  20 years."    Camdessus also dismissed arguments that the dollar-buying  operation launched by the monetary authorities in the U.S. and  other industrial powers has little effect on the market.    "This kind of thing cannot be (measured) on a daily basis,  or  on an hour-to-hour basis," he said.    "These interventions are effective not so much by the  equilibrium of the market at a given moment but by the signal  they give to the market players," he said.    Camdessus said that over time the currency market does serve  as a barometer of economic health.    If intervention fails to produce a positive effect over  time,  "this could signal that further measures such as strengthening  the macroeconomic picture could be needed, be it stimulating a  little bit more the recovery in Japan, be it in the U.S. to make  efforts to cut the deficit," he said.    "But," Camdessus added, "this is not the problem of today."    Camdessus also argued for the establishment of a so-called  target zone for currencies, saying such a monetary system would  yield more benefit than cost.    In the short term, he said, countries participating in a  currency target system may have to pay higher prices in terms of  economic growth or employment.    Over the long term, Camdessus said, the economic benefits of  a target-zone system would be bigger because of stable  currencies.    "It is my conviction that target zones, target ranges,  target  techniques, could be an important instrument to get a  strengthened stability of exchange markets," he said.</p>

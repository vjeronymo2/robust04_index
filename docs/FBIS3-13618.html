			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 16 Mar (INA)--Zuhdi al-Qidrah, PLO Executive  Committee member, has described U.S. President Bill Clinton's  recent statements on Jerusalem as blatant and unfair U.S. bias  toward the Zionist entity, and an attempt to strike at the  Palestine question and confiscate the Palestinian people's  historic rights.    In a statement to an INA correspondent in Cairo, al-Qidrah  said the PLO and the Arab people have received with extreme  dissatisfaction Clinton's statements, which do not at all help  the establishment of a just peace in the region.    He added that the Palestinian people do not trust the United  States at all. He stressed that negotiations with the Zionist  entity cannot resume under the absolute U.S. bias toward the  Zionist entity and the UN Security Council's glaring and full  submissiveness to the United States.    He stressed that the PLO cannot resume these negotiations  unless a clear UN Security Council resolution condemning the  Zionist massacre in Hebron is issued.    Meanwhile, in statements published here today, Mahmud  'Abbas,  also known as Abu-Mazin [PLO Executive Committee member],  criticized Clinton's statements. He said the United States  should have unhesitatingly condemned the Zionist massacre and  forced the Zionist entity to abide by international law.    Abu-Mazin rejected the U.S. President's statements on  Jerusalem. He said these statements clearly show that as it  provides the Zionist entity with support and protection,  Washington obstructs international efforts to secure the  issuance of an international resolution through the UN Security  Council condemning the Hebron massacre.    In similar statements, Mrs. Hanan 'Ashrawi, former  spokeswoman for the Palestinian negotiating delegation, said  Washington has completely lost its credibility in the eyes of  the Palestinian and Arab people in general. She stressed that  Washington seeks to appease the Zionist entity through  irresponsible statements or through the obstruction of any  resolution condemning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    In her statements, Hanan 'Ashrawi indicated that a feeling  of  violent and regrettable shock is prevailing in the occupied Arab  territories as a result of the recent U.S. statements, which are  absolutely unacceptable.    She said she believes the U.S. Administration is employing  every means of pressure against the PLO and the Palestinian  negotiators to push them to offer unilateral concessions. She  called for reconsidering calculations and positions and avoiding  contributing to the loss of the Palestine question, which is now  experiencing its most delicate stages.</p>

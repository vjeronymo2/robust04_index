			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> B. F. Goodrich Co.: Third-quarter net income was $50.6 million, up 26% from the  same quarter of 1989. Sales increased 6% to $634.5 million. The Akron,  Ohio-based vinyl resins and specialty chemicals company said its increased  earnings reflected the favorable net effect of several one-time items,  including the resolution of a tax issue with the Internal Revenue Service,  which reduced tax expense and benefited net income by $30.8 million.  </P></p>

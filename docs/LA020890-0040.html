			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW REUNION TOO MUCH FOR EDISON  </P> <P> The starting five that some predicted would carry Ocean View High School to the  Sunset League title was finally intact Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The reunion came too late for a league title bid -- Marina clinched a tie for  the championship last week -- but Ocean View showed it will be a force in the  5-A Division playoffs with a 67-56 victory over Edison.  </P> <P> Center Marcel TenBerge played his best game since breaking a knuckle on his  right hand prior to the opening of league play, scoring 14 points and grabbing  nine rebounds. TenBerge had been ineffective since the injury but showed signs  of a full recovery.  </P> <P> Ocean View (14-9, 6-3) had lost three of its past four games but made 11 of 14  free throw attempts in the last quarter to hold off an Edison rally. Ocean View  guard Greg Evans led all scorers with 20 points.  </P> <P> "This game was a revisitation to the lineup that we haven't seen since the  beginning of the year," said Jim Harris, Ocean View coach. "I was very  encouraged the last two days in practice and again tonight.  </P> <P> "Marina deserves the plaudits . . . they've done the job. But I think we could  have been right there challenging for the title if Marcel hadn't gotten hurt.  The playoffs will hopefully show what we could have been or should have been."  </P> <P> Edison (16-8, 5-4) has been another disappointment in the six-team league  despite an imposing front line that features center Bill Martineau, who has  signed with UC Santa Barbara for next season.  </P> <P> Martineau had 19 points and sophomore Brandon Jessie added 15 points, but point  guard Tom Tyler fouled out without scoring and killed Edison's comeback bid  when he received a technical foul following his fifth personal foul with 5:31  remaining that turned the game around.  </P> <P> Westminster 70, Huntington Beach 65 -- Westminster snapped a 17-game league  losing streak with a good start and a strong finish. Guard Duy Nguyen scored  all 11 of his points in the first quarter and teammate Mark Murphy scored all  eight of his points in the last quarter to give the Lions (7-15, 1-8) the  victory. Mustapha Abdi scored 17 to lead Huntington Beach, which fell to 9-14,  2-7.  </P> <P> Marina 65, Fountain Valley 63 -- Center Cherokee Parks scored 31 points and had  12 rebounds as Marina (16-8, 8-1) clinched the league title. Parks made 10 of  20 field goal attempts and 11 of 12 free throws. Mike Merli scored 23 points  for Fountain Valley (11-12), which fell into a tie for third place with Edison  at 5-4.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After the registration process is completed and the registrant population and extent of activities necessary to protect the integrity of the system has been determined, DEA will revise its fee schedule to recover the full costs of its chemical control program, as required by Circular A&hyph;25. DEA will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  its revised fee schedule and invite comment by interested parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the above, the initial registration fee will be based upon the cost of processing the individual application, the associated investigation of the qualifications and suitability for registration, and the creation and dissemination of information regarding the responsibilities under the DCDCA. Reregistration fees under this proposal will include enforcement and compliance costs associated with maintenance of the integrity of the registration and control system. These fees will not include enforcement costs of reviews of records and reports of fully complaint registrants exclusively to identify leads to possible illicit drug laboratories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Initial Registration Investigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fundamental purpose of the pre-registration investigation is to determine the fitness and suitability of the applicant to engage in the activities for which registration is requested and to ensure that the applicant is familiar with its responsibilities to prevent the diversion of regulated products or chemicals. This will be accomplished through an on-site visit to the applicant (following receipt and processing of the application for registration by clerical personnel) by DEA Diversion Investigators. During this on-site visit, the applicant's responsibilities with respect to security, record-keeping and reporting will be discussed; the applicant's existing provisions for security, record-keeping and reporting, if any, will be reviewed, along with previous sales and customers; and the applicant will be provided with material, such as the Chemical Handlers Manual, regarding chemical trafficking and controls. In addition, the investigator will perform background checks on the applicant, owner and employees, and prepare the necessary reports summarizing the results of the registration review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Retail distributors engage in a limited activity as regulated by the DCDCA. By contrast, non-retail chemical firms may deal in a range of List I chemicals, in bulk lots or, pursuant to orders received by mail, telephone, facsimile or other electronic means. Consequently, the average pre-registration investigation for a retail distributor will entail less DEA investigative time than for a non-retail chemical firm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Method for Collection of Fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the initial registration fee, DEA has established separate costs for processing the application, and for conducting the pre-registrant investigation. Both costs will be incurred by the applicant prior to their initial registration under the DCDCA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, DEA anticipates receiving 1500 applications from non-retail chemical firms and approximately 10,000 applications from retail distributors. DEA will place priority on the completion of the pre-registration investigations of non-retail chemical firms. All non-retail applications will be processed and reviewed within the first year of the effective date of this regulation. Therefore, the full fee (application and pre-registration investigation costs) must be submitted with the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the demands for resources to conduct registration reviews of non-retail applications and for other chemical control activities, DEA will be unable to process and review all of the applications submitted by retail distributors within the first year following the effective date of the final rule. As a consequence, retail distributors will be subject to a split fee schedule for their initial registration. Each retail distributor will include with their application the established fee to cover the costs of processing the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on available resources, DEA will identify and notify approximately 1500&hyph;2000 of the retail applicants that they are scheduled for pre-registration review in the first year. Each applicant so identified will be required to pay the additional established cost for the registration investigation prior to commencement of the review. Based upon the volume of applications received, DEA may conduct additional retail registration investigations in the first year. In the second year, DEA will redirect resources spent conducting non-retail pre-registration investigations to the retail level. DEA anticipates an additional 6,000 to 8,000 pre-registrant investigations to be conducted in the second year. These retail distributors will similarly be notified of the investigation fee to be paid. They will  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  be required to submit another application fee. However, if a retail distributor fails to submit the required investigation fee within 30 days after notification by DEA, that retail distributor's application will be withdrawn. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

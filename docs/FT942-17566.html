			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Italy piles on the post-election euphoria Apart from extremes, reflecting immense enthusiasm in Italy and dejection in Poland, bourses ended the first quarter of 1994 with a whimper, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN continued on its euphoric, post-election course, the BCI index adding 27.45 or 4 per cent to a 44 month high of 722.99 and adding another 1.68 per cent to reach 735.11 yesterday, taking the rise over the week to nearly 10 per cent. The market was hit by a flood of orders from domestic and foreign buyers, encouraged by the speed with which differences were apparently being ironed out by Mr Silvio Berlusconi and the right-wing alliance, committed to free market principles. Trading was extended on both days to cope with turnover which surged on Thursday to an estimated record L2,000bn compared with the previous L1,400bn peak set on January 31. In London, Robert Fleming Securities commented that the strong surge in support for the right wing has left the post-election scene much clearer than had seemed likely. Mr Marcus Grubb at Salomon Brothers, who has increased his end of year target for the Comit index from 750 to 775, recommended that investors increase their weightings. He accepted that volatility would increase if the newly-elected right-wing alliance experienced difficulties in forming a coalition government, but said this would be a buying opportunity. The insurance sector, an underperformer before this week, continued to power ahead on Thursday, on hopes that the new government would encourage private pension schemes and reports that motor premiums will rise by 7-13 per cent when Rome lifts controls in July. RAS rose L1,754 or 6.5 per cent to L28,879, Fondiaria L776 or 6.2 per cent to L13,214, Toro L2,453 or 8.5 per cent to L31,233 and SAI L1,257 or 6.6 per cent to L20,395. The sector extended its strength yesterday. FRANKFURT blamed Wall Street again as the Dax index fell 14.42 to 2,133.11, a fraction up on the week but down 5.9 per cent on the first three months of this year. Turnover fell from DM7.5bn to DM6.6bn. There was a suggestion of profit taking in cyclicals. In chemicals, Bayer announced a costly fire and fell DM5.80 to DM373.20, but Hoechst also dropped, by DM5.40 to DM323.70. BMW escaped a general automotive downturn with a rise of DM4.50 to DM828.50. RWE, which has had problems in nuclear power generation, fell another DM8.50 to DM438. Metallgesellschaft stretched its recovery to a third day, rising DM11.50 to DM208, but it was still the worst Dax performer of the first quarter with a fall of over 25 per cent, said Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf. Mr Frahm noted that cyclicals had produced most of the good share price performances in the first quarter, and financials, or defensive stocks the worst. The exception was the top performing stock, Lufthansa, up by more than 25 per cent on the quarter and by over 80 per cent over the past twelve months. The airline's shares, he said, were a speculation on privatisation on attractive terms before the German general election next October. PARIS was given a slight lift just before midday by a 10 basis point cut in the Bank of France's intervention rate, bringing it down to 5.90 per cent. But this was not sufficient to provide momentum for the rest of the session, and the CAC-40 index ended the day off 1.93 at 2,081.94. The index has slipped 2.5 per cent over the week, mainly due to a sharp loss on Wednesday. Turnover was FFr4.8bn. With activity restrained ahead of the long weekend holiday, investors concentrated on a number of companies reporting results. Canal Plus gained FFr9 to FFr985 after announcing a gain in 1993 group profits. Eurotunnel, which said that its 1993 results would be available on April 21, slipped 45 centimes to FFr43.85. Saint-Louis, the food group, which announced after the close that it expected 'significant' growth in 1994, ended the day up FFr7 at FFr1,715. AMSTERDAM regained the 400 level in the AEX index, having dipped below it during early trading. The index closed off 0.86 at 403.85, a fall on the week of 0.7 per cent. There were some exceptions to the generally easier mood. Aegon, the insurance group, gained Fl 1.30 to Fl 94.60 after announcing better than expected 1993 results, and prospects for improvement in 1994. BolsWessanen , the food and drinks group, added 70 cents to Fl 41.40 as it announced details of its 1993 dividend. ZURICH finished a quiet, shortened pre-holiday session easier but above the day's lows after some buying emerged at the lower levels. The SMI index ended 19.7 down at 2,794.8 after a day's low of 2,769.6, for a fall on the week of 1.3 per cent. Ciba continued to move against the trend in response to positive comment after this week's results and presentations to analysts. The registered shares rose SFr5 to SFr882. Banks were weak on continuing worries about the outlook for US interest rates: UBS fell SFr14 to SFr1,183, SBC lost SFr3 to SFr406 and CS Holding dipped SFr5 to SFr625. ISTANBUL picked up more than 3 per cent on Thursday, and another 6.7 per cent yesterday as investors reacted to the sharp fall in overnight borrowing rates from 400 per cent to 200 per cent in two days. The composite index closed at 15,027.77, up 940.61 and by 11 per cent on the week. ATHENS fell 1.6 per cent on Thursday, the general index testing the 1000-point support level for nearly two hours, but it recovered 1.3 per cent yesterday to close 13.04 higher at 1,016.54.1.

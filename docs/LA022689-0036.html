			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON AGING: A FEW TIPS FOR PLAYING GOLF LONGER  </P> <P> Question: I play golf in my Northeast hometown during the milder months and in  Florida during the winter. Any tips for maximizing my enjoyment of the game?  </P> <P> Answer: To prolong your golfing life expectancy regardless of age, experts  recommend giving yourself enough time to fully complete your backswing. And to  help maintain agility in your legs, walk when you play rather than riding in a  cart.  </P> <P> Teacher and senior-tour pro Bob Toski offers the following pointers for a  longer, more successful golf life:  </P> <P>  -- Keep your grip pressure light.  </P> <P>  -- Relax your arms at address so they can rotate freely in a full swing.  </P> <P>  -- Set your weight predominantly on the right side to give you more time to  shift to the left for maximum power (opposite for a left-hander).  </P> <P>  -- Stay light on your feet.  </P> <P> Q: A while back there was a lot of hoopla about "notch babies" not getting  their full Social Security entitlements. Since I'm an individual in this  category, I'm wondering whether a solution was found to resolve the inequity.  </P> <P> A: At this time, the "solution" is to maintain the status quo. A recent study  by the National Academy of Social Insurance recommended that Congress neither  reduce benefits to those getting the unintended windfall nor raise them for  everyone else.  </P> <P> The report focused on a category of Social Security recipients known as "notch  babies," born between 1917 and 1921. Their benefits in some cases were $200 a  month less than those of people born earlier. The inequity lies in the fact  that those born before 1917 are getting higher benefits than Congress intended,  not that others are receiving too little. An estimated 1 million people  affected by the benefits notch feel a "substantial impact" from the situation.  </P> <P> The discrepancy in benefits arose when Congress adopted a new formula meant to  keep Social Security benefits at a constant percentage of a person's average  pre-retirement earnings. People born before 1917 were allowed to use the old  method of calculation. The result was a benefit rate that peaked in 1981 at 56%  of average earnings, about 15 percentage points higher than Congress had  intended.  </P> <P> Why not fix the inequity? The study panel estimated that it would cost up to  $300 billion to equalize everyone's benefits, and that would create new notches  affecting those born in later years. Also, it would be difficult and expensive  to find those who got windfalls and politically difficult to cut their  benefits.  </P> <P> The heartening news for those born between 1917 and 1921: The report concluded  they are at an advantage compared with people born after them.  </P></p>

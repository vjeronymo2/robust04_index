			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Court gives BHP time to defend ADollars 4bn lawsuit The Victoria Supreme Court yesterday set aside an interlocutory judgment for damages against Broken Hill Proprietary, in respect of the ADollars 4bn (USDollars 2.9bn) environmental lawsuit brought against the large Australian resources company by villagers living around the Ok Tedi copper mine in western Papua New Guinea. BHP had been found guilty by default earlier this month because it failed to lodge a defence to the writ within a 30-day period - although lawyers quibbled over the precise deadline. The Australian company, which manages the mine, has since submitted its defence documents and said it will contest the action. The biggest of Australia's natural resource groups, BHP is due to report its full-year results on Friday.</p>

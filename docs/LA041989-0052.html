			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS ADD A PLAY TO S.D. ARTS FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Leningrad's Maly Drama Theatre will present the U.S. premiere of a seven-hour  play, "Brothers and Sisters," here during the "Treasures of the Soviet Union"  arts festival this fall, festival officials announced at a press conference  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Festival administrators in San Diego also announced that the number of Faberge  Imperial Eggs committed for exhibition at the San Diego Museum of Art during  the festival, which will run from Oct. 21 to Nov. 11, has grown from 17 to 22.  The gold and gem-encrusted ornamental eggs come from the collections of the  Kremlin Armory Museum, the Forbes Magazine Galleries and five museum and  private collections, festival officials said. The egg exhibition will extend  beyond the festival to Jan. 7.  </P> <P> "Brothers and Sisters," a dramatization of a trilogy of novels by Fyodor  Abramov, depicts the realities of rural life in the Soviet Union following  World War II. It will be performed by a cast of 40 in two parts that will  normally be seen on consecutive evenings at the Old Globe Theatre from Oct. 22  to Nov. 12. Thirteen complete cycles will be performed.  </P> <P> The play, budgeted at $750,000, will be performed in Russian. Audience members  will be given a device that will allow them to hear an English translation.  </P> <P> The $6-million festival will feature, in addition, folk art, dancing and music,  and film and culinary exhibitions.  </P> <P> Apparently, the organizers have lowered their expectations as to the festival's  potential economic impact. When Mayor Maureen O'Connor announced the festival  early last year, she compared the event's prospects with the 1987 Super Bowl,  which generated an estimated $136 million. The estimated economic impact now is  placed at $35 million.  </P> <P> Other new festival attractions announced Monday: an exhibit of Faberge mineral  and gemstone carvings at the San Diego Museum of Natural History, a display of  Russian lacquer miniatures at the San Diego Museum of Man and a Soviet/American  space art exhibition presented by the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater and the San  Diego Historical Society.  </P> <P> About a dozen of San Diego's 90 cultural and arts institutions are involved  with putting on 19 different festival events, organizers said.  </P> <P> Festival highlights previously announced include:  </P> <P> * Three performances of Sergei Eisenstein's 1938 film epic, "Alexander Nevsky,"  accompanied by the San Diego Symphony and the San Diego Master Chorale under  Soviet guest conductor Evgeny Kolobov. The symphony will play three weeks of  programs featuring Russian music and Russian musicians, including the Soloists  of Leningrad, a chamber orchestra.  </P> <P> * The San Diego Opera production of Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov," with Soviet  bass Alexander Morozov and soprano Irina Bogacheva, conducted by Jansoug  Kakhidze of the Tbilisi State Theatre of Opera and Ballet.  </P> <P> * A film festival and symposium featuring four renowned Georgian directors and  a Georgian film critic.  </P> <P> * "Masterworks in Metal," an exhibit of 30 elaborately decorated icons and  religious objects from the State Art Museum of Georgia, organized by the Timken  Art Gallery, and displayed at the B Street Pier.  </P></p>

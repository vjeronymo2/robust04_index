			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Forth Ports higher at Pounds 10.9m FORTH PORTS, the Scottish port operator which was privatised and floated last year, yesterday announced its first annual results and said trading was expected to be more difficult this year. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 8.23m to Pounds 10.9m in the year to December 31. However, most of the rise stemmed from a Pounds 1.23m exceptional gain through the early repayment of government loans. This had previously been treated as extraordinary, but has been restated following the decision to adopt FRS 3. Turnover was unchanged at Pounds 32.4m. Tonnage from British Pipe Coaters, one of the company's largest customers, fell by 30 per cent as North Sea orders for BPC's services declined. However, tonnage from containers and piped cargoes increased slightly and the company said grain and animal feed tonnage also increased. Mr Hugh Thompson, chief executive, said BPC tonnage was likely to fall again this year, perhaps more sharply. He said Forth had been winning new business, but profits from new and enlarged contracts would not be reflected in this year's profits. Operating profits increased from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 9.98m. Forth also reported adjusted figures to exclude the exceptional profit and certain cash balances which reverted to the government following privatisation. On this adjusted basis, pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 8.7m. Earnings were 23.8p or, on an adjusted basis, 17.5p. The final dividend is 4.25p to make 6.25p. COMMENT Forth's share price of 235p has doubled in a year since the 110p flotation. This stems more from an undervalued offer price than enthusiasm about the company's trading conditions. Yesterday's results would have been flat without the accounting changes, and the outlook will remain lacklustre for at least another 12 months. As well as BPC, Forth reported little upturn in construction materials throughput, even against a poor 1991, and a Russian coal contract is likely to fall below forecast. However, the company should start to benefit from falling overheads - another 47 employees departed last year - and there could be good news on the Scottish Office property soon. Forecast profits of Pounds 7.5m put the shares on just under 15 times. Although Forth is an interesting smaller operator, it looks fully valued unless economic recovery is quicker than expected or the company pulls off a tidy acquisition.</p>

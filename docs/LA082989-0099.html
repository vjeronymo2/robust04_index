			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BALLET REVIEW;  </P> <P> KIROV DANCES ITS FAREWELL BILL IN O.C. WITH CAST, PROGRAM JUGGLED  </P> <P> Expect consistent inconsistency from the Kirov Ballet.  </P> <P> Several announced casting decisions were rescinded at the company's final  performance of the season, Sunday afternoon at the Orange County Performing  Arts Center. Some previously danced variations in "Paquita" were also dropped,  reportedly on last-minute orders from artistic director Oleg Vinogradov.  </P> <P> Clearly, this company and its audience had no reason to grow complacent, even  on the closing program of the 1989 U.S. tour. And if one of the surprises  proved devastating -- Igor Petrov certainly represented no substitute at all  for Farukh Ruzimatov in the "Don Quixote" pas de deux -- there were also  undeniable compensations.  </P> <P> Start with Zhanna Ayupova in the Pavlova role of "Chopiniana," a performance  treasurable for its exquisite refinement and deep sense of personal  involvement. Dance historians often summarize this ballet as the Youth's dream,  but Ayupova danced it with a sweet, secret smile as if it were her own.  Replacing the announced Kiril Melnikov as the Youth, Yuri Zhukov returned to  the cast in his last performance with the Kirov before joining San Francisco  Ballet.  </P> <P> In the abridged "Paquita" festivities, Tatiana Terekhova danced the prima role  with her usual majestic radiance. She looked unusually forced, perhaps, in  supported bravura (partnered by Eldar Aliev), but typically precise and at ease  in her solos.  </P> <P> Irina Chistiakova lost her "Paquita" solo but pertly danced the "Fairy Doll"  trio (opposite Andrei Garbuz and Andrei Bosov), capitalizing on her very steady  balances.  </P> <P> In the "Don Quixote" duet, Elena Pankova not only danced the familiar fan  variation instead of the alternate solo seen Friday (with Terekhova), she also  carried the fan through her fouette marathon -- and cooled herself with it.  This wasn't exactly polished classical dancing, but the emphasis on sheer speed  and bravado yielded great excitement.  </P> <P> Familiar principals in the White Swan pas de deux and "The Dying Swan"  completed the program. Victor Fedotov conducted.  </P> <P> No farewells, no encores.  </P></p>

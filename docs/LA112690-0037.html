Stephen Lebeau had two goals and Guy  Carbonneau had the other for the Canadiens, who had 14 shots in the first  period and scored on Lebeau's power-play shot.  </P> <P> The loss dropped the Jets 14 points behind the Kings in the Smythe Division.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 4, New York Islanders 1 -- The Islanders were playing tough  defense at Philadelphia, holding the Flyers to two shots on goal in the first  11 minutes.  </P> <P> But there was a catch. The shots, by Gord Murphy at 1:28 and rookie Mike Ricci  at 10:40, eluded goaltender Jeff Hackett and the Flyers had a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Flyer goalie Pete Peeters stopped 25 shots and improved to 6-3-1.

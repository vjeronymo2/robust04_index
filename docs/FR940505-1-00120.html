			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dr. Shoup's analysis of Los Angeles predicted these impacts in a location where parking costs approximately $5.00 per day. Once EPA has more specific information on the three nonattainment areas, EPA proposes to assume for emission reduction crediting purposes a linear relationship between the value of parking in a given area and the employee response to a cash out program, based on Dr. Shoup's work. EPA invites comment on this assumption. EPA also asks for information on the employer composition and parking lease practices in the three non-attainment areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that for this proposal EPA has assigned credit to the ECO program in the Sacramento FIP area assuming a 20-percent reduction in affected employers' employees who drive alone to work. The universe of employers who are subject to ECO and to the cash out provisions do overlap and in the final FIP rule EPA will ensure that emission reductions taken for the two programs do not include any double counting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that this provision is similar to the cash out legislation recently enacted in California. Since the Administration will soon offer legislative language to enact parking cash out nationally EPA is proposing a cash out program in keeping with the federal proposal. The most obvious difference between the two proposals is in the definition of affected employers. California's legislation applies to employers with 50 or greater employees, while the Climate Change Action Plan calls for parking cash out for employers with 25 or more employees. The EPA proposal simply makes mandatory an option many employers have had as a way of achieving the South Coast and Ventura goals. As with the President's plan, this proposal requires cash out in such a way to ensure that no employer will have a net loss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> h. Importation of Vehicles Into California_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Little data are available on the population and characterization of 49-state vehicles in California and nationwide. However, it is estimated that out-of-state passenger vehicles (49-state vehicles) currently make up about 10 percent of the VMT in California. As a result of the California's LEV program and the proposed enhanced in-use compliance program, the difference in the emissions level between California certified vehicles and federally certified 49-state vehicles is expected to increase, and 49-state vehicles will therefore have increasing negative impact on air quality. Moreover, if California and 49-state vehicles further diverge in design there may be an increased incentive for California residents to purchase vehicles designed to meet only 49-state standards. Currently, 49-state vehicles with less than 7500 miles of operation (classified as new) may not be brought into California, but older vehicles can be upon payment of a California DMV fee, which is not prohibitive in comparison to many vehicle's market value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's FIP therefore proposes to impose a restriction, starting in 1999, on California residents importing 49-state vehicles. Specifically, EPA proposes to prohibit (with an exception noted below) the State of California from allowing California residents to register for the first time in California any vehicle that was previously registered in another state, unless that vehicle was originally certified to the vehicle requirements set forth in this proposal for its class. In addition, EPA proposes to prohibit California residents from owning and keeping a car in California that is currently registered in another state. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As an exception to this prohibition, EPA proposes that the State of California may allow recent immigrants to California (defined as residents of California for less than three months) to register a car, over 7500 miles, that they had previously registered for at least three months in another state while a resident of that state. EPA's attainment demonstrations are based on migration patterns for out-of-state vehicles that match the restrictions described above. EPA solicits comments on these rules and restrictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also inclined to provide exemptions for historic and collector vehicles, and requests comment on methods for providing these exemptions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Programs for Onroad Heavy Duty Vehicles and Engines <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Overview_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Heavy-duty mobile sources (trucks and HDVs) are large contributors, especially for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , to the emissions inventories in the three FIP areas. Existing standards for heavy-duty engines in California are, for the most part, the same as the Federal standards. Further control of these engines is necessary to meet the attainment targets. For these reasons, EPA will propose an enhanced in-use compliance program for heavy-duty vehicles, similar to the one proposed for light duty vehicles, which includes not only tighter standards but also selected controls on higher emitting interstate trucks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Larger heavy-duty engines see substantially heavier use than smaller engines. These engines are built to very high durability standards and are designed to be cost effectively rebuilt one or more times within their total lifetime. To provide assurance of emissions control over this extended actual life, this proposal includes certification and liability requirements for rebuilt engines as well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Kewill Systems falls to Pounds 2.42m KEWILL SYSTEMS, the USM-quoted computing services company, yesterday reported reduced full-year profits and announced plans to raise some Pounds 2.7m via a subscription for shares by a Guernsey-based unit trust. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-March fell from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 2.42m, on increased turnover of Pounds 41.8m (Pounds 31.3m). Profits were struck after higher administrative expenses of Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 16.8m) and a net interest charge up from Pounds 358,000 to Pounds 700,000. Mr Kevin Overstall, chairman, said that trading losses of Weigang had forced the company to make full provision in the balance sheet against the carrying value of its investment, leaving a negative balance on distributable reserves and meaning a dividend could not be paid. Last year there was a 5p pay-out. The board intends to apply to the courts for a reduction of capital to help eliminate this deficit, enabling a distribution in the current year. To strengthen the balance sheet and reduce gearing Kewill plans to raise a net Pounds 2.7m through a subscription for 2.42m shares by The Causeway Smaller Quoted Companies Fund, at 125p a share. Following completion of the subscription a representative of Causeway will join the Kewill board as a non-executive director. Earnings per share fell from 31.2p to 19.91p. Mr Overstall said The results for the first six months of the current year would be adversely affected by the continuing losses at Weigang.</p>

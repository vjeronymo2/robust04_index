			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bunzl Bunzl is selling its 51 per cent interest in the US and Swiss paper and pulp trading operations to Mr George Edwards, their president and minority shareholder. In 1991 the companies - Intercontinental Cellulose Sales of New York and ICS Intercontinental Cellulose Sales of Berne - produced sales of Dollars 186m but a loss of Dollars 888,000 pre-tax. Mr Anthony Habgood, chief executive of Bunzl, said ICS had always been a low-margin business and did not fit with Bunzl's core activities. The disposal follows the sale of the loss-making West Coast food distribution centres in the US, announced in January.</p>

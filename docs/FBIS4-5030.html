			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First installment of the "basic content" of the Hanoi 20-25 </F> January Mid-Term Party National Conference Resolution]    [Text] The political report of the party Central Committee  presented at the Mid-Term Party National Conference reviews the  implementation of the Seventh National Party Congress [SNPC]  resolution and the practical steps of the renovation in our  country. In order to successfully implement the SNPC resolution  and the renovation, the political report reviews prominent  achievements, weaknesses, and shortcomings; presents general  conclusions on opportunities and dangers; provides guidance on  the directions for national construction in the new developing  period; outlines some major lines and measures; and further  concretizes the socialist direction.    I. Achievements and Weaknesses, Opportunities and Dangers    1. The political report presents three prominent  achievements:    -- The great achievement of primary significance is the fact  that we have succeeded in overcoming the socioeconomic crisis to  a very important extent.    The following are its major manifestations:    Many stagnant and degrading fields have been overcome. The  economic development rates have been fairly good and stable in  the last three years. Inflation was limited to 5.2 percent in  1993. Economic relations have been broadened in a diversified  and multilateral manner and annual export volume has increased  about 20 percent.    The economy began to have some internal savings. The  multisectoral economic structure has been forming. The market-  oriented mechanism under the state management in the socialist  direction has become an operational structure for the national  economy.    The settlement of social issues and the implementation of  social policies have been given more attention. People's lives  in many cities and rural areas have been improved.    -- The second important achievement is that political  stability has been maintained and consolidated.    The party role has been strengthened. State management  efficiency has been further upgraded. Democracy has broadened  and it has scored significant developing steps in line with the  construction of the law-governed state of the people, by the  people, and for the people. National defense and security have  been safeguarded. The people's confidence in the party, the  state, and renovation has been increased. The public movements  in the economic and social fields have obtained some developing  steps.    -- The third achievement is that foreign relations have been  broadened and our national reputation and position were  enhanced, thus creating favorable international conditions for  national construction and protection.    All three aforementioned achievements are very important and  inter-related. The mention of economic achievement first is  reasonable and suitable to our renovation line, which places  economic renovation first and considers it a central task. The  great economic achievements contributed to overcome the  socioeconomic crisis in a very important step, stabilized our  politics, broadened our external relations, and safeguarded our  national defense and security.    2. Shortcomings and newly arising problems:    -- The economy still carries the characteristics of a  backward agricultural economy with low productivity, quality,  and efficiency. The industry is small with poor infrastructure.  The ability to control inflation is not strong. The state-run  economy and collective economy are slow in renovating and  consolidating. And the market mechanism is in its preliminary  stage and carrying many spontaneous elements.    -- The fields of culture and society have recorded some  achievements, but there are a lot of pressing problems which  remain unsolved: unemployment, social injustice, education,  culture, arts, health care, and corruption and smuggling.    -- Political stability has been maintained, but complicated  factors which must not be overlooked still exist. Many party  and state organs have not been clean and strong. Some party  members have become depraved politically and morally and  loosened their vigilance and commitment in our chosen path.  They remain unconcerned in the face of wrong viewpoints and  sabotage activities by our enemies. Many party cadres and party  members are still sluggish when it comes to self-education.  They do not try to improve their character and understanding.  Political stability is not totally stable, social order and  safety are not safeguarded.    3. What are the opportunities and advantages?    The national conference unanimously agreed on fundamental  advantages:    -- Our party has a correct line. The party is united and  unanimous. Our people are industrious, intelligent, and  patriotic. They are bravery, resolute, and confident in the  party leadership. Our armed forces are absolutely loyal to the  people's revolutionary undertaking.    -- The achievements of the renovation mainly shown in the  three aforementioned achievements are creating new stature and  strength for us.    -- The development of the science technology revolution and  the trend to broaden cooperation and development relations in  the world and in the region are providing us with more important  resources.    The current opportunities are from advantages, internal  achievements, and external conditions but they are mainly  created by our people. They do not come by themselves. We have  to grasp opportunities to move the country forward.</p>

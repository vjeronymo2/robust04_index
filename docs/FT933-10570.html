			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market Report The ALUMINIUM market broke out of its recent narrow range yesterday, with the London Metal Exchange's three months delivery position closing Dollars 11.75 higher at Dollars 1,230.50 a tonne, and moving on to Dollars 1,236 a tonne in after-hours trading. Dealers said the resistance band between Dollars 1,220 and Dollars 1,230 that had prevailed over the past two weeks was overcome by influential European buying and investment fund interest, which triggered stop-loss buying orders during the late kerb. The NICKEL market was steadier, as prices were 'corrected' on technical grounds, having become oversold recently. Three months metal closed on the LME at Dollars 4,975 a tonne, recovering Dollars 35 of Friday's Dollars 87.50 fall. At the London Commodity Exchange COCOA futures emulated the buoyant coffee market (see story above) with the September position ending Pounds 9 up on the day at Pounds 773 a tonne. Dealers said the market continued to monitor developments in West Africa, where many analysts are predicting poor crops, but otherwise felt prices were building towards a potential move higher. PRECIOUS METALS eased back from early, foreign exchange-inspired highs. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Ex-chairman of Imperial: Obituary of Geoffrey Kent GEOFFREY KENT, former chairman and chief executive of Imperial Group, who led the tobacco conglomerate's unsuccessful defence against Hanson's takeover bid in 1985-86, has died at the age of 70. Mr Kent, who with a deceptively diffident public manner had brought a disciplined, hands-on management style to Imperial in the four years of his leadership, resigned from the group after the takeover. He became chairman of Mansfield Brewery in 1989 and remained a director of Lloyds Bank, joining its board in 1981. Educated at Blackpool Grammar School, which he left for wartime service in RAF Coastal Command, Mr Kent began his career in advertising. He worked for Coleman, Prentice &amp; Varley, then one of London's leading agencies, and Johnson &amp; Johnson before joining Imperial as marketing manager for John Player in 1958. Mr Kent quickly established his reputation in the competitive cigarette market. He was responsible for the long-running slogan 'People love Players' and created a number of popular cigarette brands. They included Player's No 6, for a time the country's best-selling cigarette, and perhaps most notably John Player Special, with its distinctive black packet and successful motor racing sponsorship. Mr Kent became joint managing director of John Player in 1969, and six years later chairman and managing director. He moved to Courage, then Imperial's brewing subsidiary, in 1978 as chairman and chief executive, and brought his marketing skills to bear on its fortunes. His 'Cockney pub' advertising campaign helped to change the face of beer advertising. Three years later, after a boardroom coup, he took over leadership of Imperial. After the Hanson takeover, which overturned plans for a merger of Imperial and United Biscuits, he remained unattached to any company for two years until Mansfield invited him to become its chairman. His marketing talents were again employed there, and he led the company out of a series of diversified activities back to its core beer business.</p>

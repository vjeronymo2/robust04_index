			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Observer: Fresh wallpaper It helps if aspiring Tory grandees can win at the ballot box, but it is not a prerequisite. Take Sir Michael Hirst, a 47-year-old accountant, who is taking over from Lord Sanderson of Bowden as chairman of the Scottish Conservative party. Hirst was elected in 1983 as MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden on the prosperous outskirts of Glasgow. But a ministerial career was denied him when he lost his seat in the 1987 massacre of the Scottish Tories. However, he was rewarded with the vice-chair-manship of the Scottish party, and in 1989 he was elected president of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association, one of the two wings of the party in Scotland. Last year he failed to get back into parliament but did manage to pick up his knighthood. Hirst, a former partner in Glasgow with KPMG Peat Marwick, has a soothing manner on television. But he doesn't have the same sort of business clout as Lord Sanderson, a shrewd political organiser who is given much of the credit for the Tories' recent revival in Scotland.</p>

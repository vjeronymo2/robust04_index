			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  and the South Korean puppets staged a war game against the North  on April 17 and 18 in the sky above an area near the northern  half of Korea with the mobilisation of more than 500 warplanes  after creating electronic jamming, according to military sources.    Synchronising with this, an RC-135 strategic reconnaissance  plane, a U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane and an  RV-1 tactical reconnaissance plane committed aerial espionage on  the whole area of the northern half of Korea, making flights  above areas adjacent to the demilitarized zone along the  military demarcation line.    On April 17, the South Korean puppet army fired more than  250  shells into spots opposite the River Imjin and near the  demilitarized zone. On April 18, the puppet army who took  combat positions in Yangju and Yonchon Counties fired more than  1,000 large-calibre machine-gun bullets.</p>

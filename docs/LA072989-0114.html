			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: EL TORO;  </P> <P> BOY KILLED, 3 HURT IN INTERSECTION CRASH  </P> <P> A 6-year-old Fountain Valley boy was killed Friday afternoon in a two-car  collision in El Toro when the car in which he was riding drove in front of a  pickup truck, police said.  </P> <P> Anh (Andrew) Tien Dao died at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in  Mission Viejo, at 1:15 p.m., about 90 minutes after he was ejected from a car  at El Toro Road and Normandale Drive, police said.  </P> <P> Like the other two young passengers and the 16-year-old driver of the car, he  was not wearing a seat belt, police said. The two passengers also were  seriously injured in the accident, while the driver sustained minor scrapes.  </P> <P> Police said the driver, Phung Nguyen, 16, of El Toro, appears to have stopped  at a stop sign at the intersection but then drove into the path of a Toyota  pickup that had the right of way, police said. Nguyen's car was hit broadside,  ejecting its four passengers, police said.  </P> <P> "(Nguyen) appears to have been at fault, no question about it," said Officer  Ken Daily of the California Highway Patrol. As is standard procedure in such  fatalities, Daily said CHP officers will conduct an investigation.  </P> <P> Nguyen suffered bruises to her face and shoulders and was treated at Mission  Hospital, a nursing supervisor there said. The passengers, both sisters of  Nguyen, remained in the hospital Friday night after undergoing surgery. Hanh  Nguyen, 9, suffered head injuries and was in critical condition, while Cristina  Nguyen, 11, sustained abdominal injuries and was in serious condition, hospital  officials said. Dao apparently was not related to them, police said.  </P> <P> The driver of the pickup truck was not injured, police said.  </P></p>

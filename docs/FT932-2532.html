			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Treasury to suffer in silence no more THE TREASURY's traditional pre-Budget purdah is to end, the government announced yesterday as it accepted that Mr Kenneth Clarke's prowess as a politician would inevitably outshine any attachment he has to monastic ritual. Unlike his predecessors, the chancellor will not be expected to refrain from public appearances in the months approaching the Budget. However, the prime minister's office expressed the hope that Mr Clarke would still be 'reticent' about tax issues until decisions were announced. The move was unsurprising given the gradual erosion of purdah. Over recent years Treasury ministers have been frustrated at not being able to hail good economic news - and at allowing opposition politicians to set the political agenda. But Mr Clarke was also perhaps the most unlikely chancellor to observe Treasury rules of purdah - named after an Indian tradition of keeping women in seclusion. He broke convention on Tuesday by trailing his Mansion House speech to the City on Channel Four news and discussed the scope for spending cuts on BBC television on Wednesday night, ahead of yesterday's cabinet meeting on public expenditure. 'The idea of Kenneth Clarke and purdah is like Kelvin MacKenzie (editor of The Sun) and the Church Times,' admitted one Downing Street official. Like the best government conventions, purdah was never formally defined. But the principle was that any comment from the chancellor, his junior ministers or officials at cocktail parties, could give clues about the Treasury's pre-Budget thinking. When the Budget was in March, purdah supposedly ran from the Chevening weekend summit of Treasury ministers in January. But over the years it started at an ever later date. This year the first unified tax and spending Budget is in November. A truncated period of purdah was due to start from the October Tory party conference. Mr Clarke has decided he cannot contain himself even that long.</p>

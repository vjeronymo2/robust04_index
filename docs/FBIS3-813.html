"I  will fight them on the beaches. I will fight them on the  plains," he said, adding that the main reason he had registered  his Freedom Front for the April elections was to prevent an  ANC-NP monopoly in a constitution-making government of national  unity.    He blamed the NP and ANC for last week's Bophuthatswana  violence, flaws in the constitution and unrest.    Speaking in Kimberley after Freedom Alliance leaders met to  discuss their circumstances after recent developments, Gen  Viljoen said the Freedom Front might apply for membership of the  alliance.    Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said  the  alliance was outraged at the "unchristian, double-crossing  betrayal" by the government of Bophuthatswana President Lucas  Mangope.    Mr Mangope said he still considered himself president of the  territory and was considering legal action againt the  government. "They had no right whatsoever to oust me. I am  constitutionally and legally still the president of  Bophuthatswana."    Gen Viljoen said his participation in the elections would  still depend on certain guarantees from the ANC and NP. Although  worried he could cause a split in the Afrikaner right wing, he  said his departure from the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner  National Front, AVF] would more likely benefit Afrikaner unity  in the long term because there were now two groups on different  paths but with the same objective -- self-determination and a  "volkstaat" [homeland].    Gen Viljoen said his new Freedom Front did not intend to  draw  support away from the Afrikaner Volksfront or the Conservative  Party [CP], but to recruit other Afrikaners and ex-NP members.  This would reinforce support for the volkstaat ideal, he  said."What is important is that we must fight the NP and fight  the ANC with everything available...on all possible fields we  must attack."    He said his decision to leave the AVF was prompted partly by  differences in opinion and political thinking with its  controlling bodies.    But the last straw was the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging  [Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB] and its refusal to obey  instructions during last weeks' military intervention in  Bophuthatswana.    "To me it is very clear that a military option with the AWB  would be a most dangerous thing to do. I am afraid I have had  enough proof that I can not trust them to obey orders."    Gen Viljoen did not, however, rule out a military solution  without the AWB. Asked about reported looming splits in the CP,  its leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said although there were  "differences of opinion on a small scale" talks were under way  in a bid to stave off divisions.    He was confident of a volkstaat being achieved. "We will  have  our self-determination and freedom in our territory. It is not  possible to stop us achieving our ideals."</p>

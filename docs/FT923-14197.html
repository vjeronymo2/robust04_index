			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Letter: British Rail should concentrate on improving track utilisation Sir, There may be many good reasons for subsidising British Rail but Richard Tomkins' suggestion ('A long haul to privatisation', July 1) that it should be done in order to level the playing field between rail and road is not the strongest. For the past 16 years I have commuted between Oxford and London. Most of this has been done by train. Occasionally I have used the bus. British Rail's most significant cost problem is exemplified by the view from the window of the Oxford-London bus at Hanger Lane in the morning rush-hour. As the bus crawls nose-to-tail on a jam-packed, three-lane road one has several minutes to observe acres of empty railway track. Only occasionally does one see a train making use of this expensive facility. Similarly, one can stand on Reading or Didcot stations for many minutes at a time without seeing a moving train. Meanwhile the M4, a few miles away, carries a constant stream of traffic. Railway officials have defended to me this low track utilisation with talk of congested nodes and signalling constraints. Heathrow airport, by contrast, dealing with even faster moving traffic, sends aircraft down runways only seconds apart. I am sure we should continue to support, and subsidise, British Rail. But one effective way of reducing expensive track costs must surely be to increase the utilisation of that track. I have a dream that I shall one day return to Oxford to find short, comfortable trains leaving for Paddington six times an hour (the present level of provision by the bus services) and costing me substantially less than five times the bus fare (the present price differential at peak times).

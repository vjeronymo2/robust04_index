			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Applicability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The rules being approved into the California SIP include: SCAQMD Rule 1162, Polyester Resin Operations; Rule 1173, Fugitive Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds; Rule 1175, Control of Emissions from the Manufacture of Polymeric Cellular (Foam) Products; and Rule 1176, Sumps and Wastewater Separators. These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on May 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act or pre-amended Act), that included the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin Area (LA-Basin). 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because this area was unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. (40 CFR 52.222). On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2) of the 1977 Act, that the above district's portion of the California SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rule for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the neccessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The LA Basin is classified as extreme; <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  therefore, this area was subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed post-1987 azone and carbon monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating toe VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice'' (Blue Book) (notice of availability was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> on May 25, 1988); and the existing control technique guidelines (CTGs). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The LA Basin retained its designation of nonattainment and was classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 55 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on May 24, 1994, including the rules being act on in this notice. This notice addresses EPA's direct-final action for SCAQMD Rule 1162, Polyester Resin Operations; Rule 1173, Fugitive Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds; Rule 1175, Control of Emissions from the Manufacture of Polymeric Cellular (Foam) Products; and Rule 1176, Sumps and Wastewater Separators. South Coast Air Quality Management District adopted these rules on May 13, 1994. These submitted rules were found to be complete on July 14, 1994 pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51 Appendix V <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  and are being finalized for approval into the SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 1162 controls VOC emissions from all polyester resin operations that fabricate, rework, repair, or touch-up products for commercial, military, or industrial use; Rule 1173 controls VOC leaks from valves, fittings, pumps, compressors and other device at refineries, chemical plants, oil and gas production fields, natural gas processing plants, and pipeline transfer stations; Rule 1175 controls emissions of VOCs from polymeric cellular products manufacturing operations including but not limited to expandable polystyrene, polystyrene foam extrusion, polyurethane, isocyanurate and phenolic foam operations; Rule 1176 limits VOC emissions from sumps, wastewater separators, separator forebays, process drains, sewer lines and junction boxes located at oil production fields, refineries, chemical plants, and industrial facilities handling petroleum liquids. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. These rules were originally adopted as part of SCAQMD's effort to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and final action for this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Evaluation and Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents, as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The CTG applicable to Rule 1173 is entitled ``Control of Volatile Organic Equipment Leaks from Natural Gas/Gasoline Processing Plants'', EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;83&hyph;007; the CTG applicable to Rule 1176 is entitled ``Control of Refinery Vacuum Producing Systems, Wastewater Separators and Process Turnarounds'', EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;025. Rules 1162 and 1175 control emissions from source categories for which EPA has not developed a CTG. These rules were evaluated against the general RACT requirements of the CAA (section 110 and part D, 40 CFR part 51), ``Issues relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies and Deviations_Clarifications to Appendix D of November 24, 1987  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' May 25, 1988 (EPA's Blue Book), and other EPA policies including the EPA Region IX/CARB document entitled: ``Guidance Document for Correcting VOC Rule Deficiencies,'' April 1991. Further interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred to in footnote 1. In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SCAQM's submitted rules include the following significant changes from the current SIP: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

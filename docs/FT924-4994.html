			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Christmas Food and Drink: Andre Simon shortlist - Appetisers THE Andre Simon Awards are made every year to the best book on food and wine. The books shortlisted for this year's award are: Food: In Search of Plenty by Oded Schwartz (Kyle Cathie, Pounds 17.99); Real Fast Food by Nigel Slater (Michael Joseph Pounds 14.99); The Curious Cook by Harold McGee (HarperCollins Pounds 15.99), La Tante Claire by Pierre Koffman &amp; Timothy Shaw, (Headline, Pounds 19.99), Vegetable Pleasures by Colin Spencer (4th Estate, Pounds 9.99) and Dr William Kitchiner, Regency Eccentric by Tom Bridge &amp; Colin Cooper English (Southover, Pounds 14.95). Wine: Port Wine Quintas by Alex Liddell &amp; Janet Price (Sotheby's, Pounds 25), Puligny Montrachet by Simon Loftus (Ebury Press, Pounds 19.99), Portugal's Wines and Winemakers by Richard Mayson (Ebury Press, Pounds 19.99) and The Great Domaines of Burgundy by Remington Norman (Kyle Cathie, Pounds 30). One book that will never win any literary prizes but should be in the glove compartment of anyone planning a trip to France is Richard Binns's French Leave Encore (Chiltern House Pounds 9.99). This is Binns's first book for five years because of ill health but it is worth waiting for. He and his wife, Ann, have acted as researchers, designers, editors, indexers and proof-readers. The guide includes autoroute hotels, hotels for those planning longer stays but excluding French provincial three-star restaurants which, Binns argues, no longer provide the right kind of value. One mail order service which could certainly prevent backache this Christmas is the Elite Beer Company's, ofJubilee Estate, Foundry Lane Horsham, West Sussex. Tel: 0403-261554, fax: 0403-217632. It has produced a range of beers for the aficionado - from Europe, Australia, the US, Russia, Peru and Venezuela. Mixed cases include a sample taster case (20 beers from 20 countries, Pounds 24.95), a world case (30 beers from 25 countries, Pounds 39.95) and a connoisseur's case (40 of the world's most special beers Pounds 64.95) and mixed selections from Europe or North America (Pounds 29.95 each).</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / People: Central looks outside Central Independent Television has brought in Kazia Kantor from Grand Metropolitan to fill the group finance director slot that has been empty since Kevin Betts left in February. Leslie Hill, chief executive, says he was looking for a candidate outside the industry, and that Kantor's experience at 'interesting companies' ranging from GrandMet to an advertising agency would provide a useful fresh perspective. Closely involved in the license renewal process last year, in which Central placed its winning bid of just Pounds 2,000, Betts had subsequently wanted to become more involved in strategy and management, according to Hill. ' That was not something that was available in the next few years. It was no longer exciting enough for him.' Kantor, 42, who qualified as a chartered accountant with Price Waterhouse, spent 8 years at Inchcape, rising to the position of group financial controller. Since she left in 1987, she has had a series of jobs in quick succession; a spell at HMV; finance director of advertising agency Davidson Pearce around the time it was merged into Boase Massimi Pollitt; and director of corporate finance at Aegis. In mid-1990 she then moved to Grand Metropolitan as finance and business development director of the retail and property sector, and was latterly group business development director. Kantor, who has said she is particularly pleased to be returning to the Midlands where she grew up, was not available for comment yesterday.</p>

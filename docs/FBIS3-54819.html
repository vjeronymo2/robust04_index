			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Giorgi Chanturia, chairman of </F> the National-Democratic Party, NDP, by Murman Jguburia; place  and date not given: "Why Are Everyone's Hopes Pinned On the  Arrival of Spring"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Jguburia] Could you say a  few words about the Geneva memorandum [signed between Georgia  and Abkhazia on 1 December]?    [Chanturia] It was our wish that a Georgian delegation  should go to Geneva. Of course, we are not naive and did not  expect that, as a result of these negotiations, Abkhazia would  be returned to us and that those who were forcibly displaced  would return to their own land.    Diplomatic work is also necessary. Some radically-minded  people say that they do not want any negotiations, which, of  course, is wrong. However, we should not go to the other  extreme. Unfortunately, in reality, the return of Abkhazia is  probably only possible by military force; nevertheless,  diplomacy should contribute to the victory of Georgian weapons  and to the subsequent consolidation of this victory. In this  way, the meeting in Geneva would have been more significant had  Georgia been better prepared. Unfortunately, in my view, this  memorandum is not serious; it does not correspond to our  interests and is unacceptable to our state. What is the sense of  holding a meeting just for the sake of it?    [Jguburia] You probably know what happened during your  absence concerning the bread situation; it has become more  acute; people are joking that those behind the acts of sabotage  must be magicians as it has been impossible to find them....    [Chanturia] We really cannot blame Russia for this  situation. This is our fault. It is an institute of state  violence. When reason and morality have no effect upon a part  of society or specific individuals, the state is obliged to use  force to put a halt to illegal actions.    What is happening in our country...? Members of the mafia  appear on television and speak about the mafia; bread thieves  appear on television and speak about bread thieves; robbers  speak about the evils of robbery. That is to say, these people  have installed themselves in fairly high echelons of the state  structures. I doubt that we will achieve any serious measure of  success in the struggle against the mafia unless new people come  to power. Believe me, it is possible to resolve this problem  within a month. We simply have to catch certain people. Those  giving protection to the Tatishvilis [bandit gang] must be  caught first. The "big fish" have to be caught before the small  ones. In Georgia, the "small fish" are being caught while the  "big fish" wander about free.    Everything here is done unsystematically, including the  struggle against crime. I repeat, it is possible to establish  order in Georgia but this can only be done by new people who are  not connected with the mafia and who do not take money from  criminals. When one's conscience is clear, one can arrest  someone and punish him if need be. There is great support for  the truth.    [Jguburia] Batono [Georgian polite form of address] Giorgi,  people believe that the current Parliament is not the one that  Georgia needs and are thinking about new elections....    [Chanturia] Parliament is, to put it mildly, far removed  from international standards. This "is not a new one but an old  one." However, does the government look any better?! Is there,  in general, any structure in Georgia that is more or less  civilized? Unfortunately, there is not. It is the fault of the  electorate for chosing such a parliament. Blocs are formed and  called "Mshvidoba," [Peace], "Siqvaruli," [Love], "Aqvaveba,"  [Well-Being], and "Gapurchkvna," [Prosperity], one or two  popular composers or "violinists" are made their leaders, and  people vote for these blocs, which have been formed artificially  and soon disappear. These people may be prominent cultural  figures but many of them understand nothing when it comes to  politics. Parliament is a place for politicians. [passage  omitted]    As regards early elections, of course, they are necessary.  The elections should be held according to party lists. We  should introduce strict barriers: 5 percent for parties and 10  percent for blocs. Whoever fails to overcome these barriers  will not be able to have any representatives in Parliament.  Parliament will be composed of [the members of] three or four  parties, which will be a step forward. We also have to learn  that the government is not an economic mechanism. Ministers  should be politicians and, moreover, party members as, in this  case, there will be greater responsibility. When the government  is formed on the basis of party principles, then it is already a  united team. [passage omitted]    [Jguburia] If it is not inappropriate..., speaking of  professionalism, was the sudden formation of the "Union of  [Georgia's] Citizens" not premature? It must take a lot of time  and work to form a party. A union of like-minded persons is  formed slowly and gradually, according to what the party's  concept, orientation, point of view, and aims are.... As soon  as the "Union of Citizens" was formed, people flocked to it.  They probably blindly trust the head of state and have faith in  him, and that is the reason for joining it in a hurry. People  can probably be forgiven this. However, was such haste on the  part of the head of state not a little inappropriate?    If we take a look at the path pursued by the NDP, we can see  what a difficult one it had to follow. The NDP needed almost 70  years to become a strong party.    [Chanturia] What is formed quickly disappears just as  quickly. We can mention the Rustaveli Society, to which  collective membership was possible. Unfortunately, the society  has become a fiction, something that awaits the "Union of  Citizens" and others such as the Party of Reformers, the  Progressive-Democratic Party, and groupings that were formed  ostentatiously and artificially, all with different interests.  [passage omitted]    Of course, Shevardnadze should have a party and he himself  should be a party member since he is the head of state. I have  often said that it is nonsense that the head of state should  stand apart from his own political force. There is nothing  incomprehensible about the desire of Shevardnadze himself to  form a party. What is incomprehensible are the means and style  in which all this was done and the hullabaloo surrounding it.  This is neither a political force nor a movement. The election  of a 200-strong presidium is, to put it mildly, a wholly  apolitical step. I fear that the same fate awaits this  organization that befell the Democratic Union (formed by  Shevardnadze) and later the "Mshvidoba" bloc. This will place  the head of state himself in an unenviable position. We are  interested in having strong and firmly established rule in  Georgia. The defeat of the "Union of Citizens" could lead to a  more serious political defeat and this, naturally, does not  correspond to our aims.    [Jguburia] It has not been possible to start a period of  construction in our country. Gamsakhurdia destroyed and divided  everything. The forum [as published] was split, families were  split, and brother was set against sister. There was an attempt  to set regions against one another but this, thank God, did not  succeed.    Today, when people take a nostalgic look at the recent past,  they see Shevardnadze also more as a destroyer than a builder.  In their view, Shevardnadze and Gamsakhurdia are both  destroyers. The first destroyed the empire, which was vitally  necessary, and also made German unification possible through the  destruction of the famous "wall." The second destroyed his own  motherland, which led us to civil war. One can say that neither  is the very image of Aghmashenebeli [king of Georgia 1089-1125].  Davit Aghmashenebeli was devoted, first and foremost, to  domestic affairs. He made Georgians love work and religion. He  created a powerful army and, when it became necessary to launch  an offensive against the enemy, he blocked off their roads of  retreat and, naturally, won a great victory. Incidentally,  probably the time has finally come to create a united army in  Georgia, do you not think?    [Chanturia] How can a united army be created when certain  criminals in military uniform are being awarded medals and  decorations? The impunity syndrome reigns not only in the army  but everywhere in society. A person can be a traitor or in  alliance with the enemy and he will still be decorated, offered  a post, and not be short of respect and glory.    That atmosphere that prevails in the higher echelons of  power  and also at a relatively lower level stimulates this immorality,  irresponsibility, and non-state activity.    Let us return to the subject of the CIS. A wholly non-state  attitude also exists toward such an important question as  Georgia's membership of the CIS. Let us recall what Russian  historians themselves have said. [passage omitted]    Russians write that a Russian will not abandon the empire  and, at the same time, an equal alliance between the people of  the empire and its former or current satellite states is  impossible.    [Jguburia] You often quote from Mazzini in your speeches. I  recall one phrase: It is impossible to think about harmony,  understanding, and Christianity in a country where one person is  very poor and one is very rich (let us take our coupon and the  Russian ruble).    People here think that we apparently need Russia very much.  When they need to justify joining the CIS, they say that, just  as we cannot do without Russia, so it cannot do without us.    [Chanturia] In general, it would be better if Georgia and  Georgian politicians did not view matters from the point of view  of having to justify themselves. I am grieved that certain  people do not intend to acknowledge that joining the CIS  represents a defeat. If, only a short while ago, it meant a  defeat and a humiliation, how did it become a great political  step following the loss, destruction, division, and ruin of  Abkhazia? Why are we deceiving ourselves?    [Jguburia] Such a view exists: Why should we not join the  CIS when such and such a state belongs to it...? When I  overhear such a statement, it immediately brings to mind one of  our sayings: "He is not stupid who has put the unripe corn in  the attic but he who has befriended him." Joking apart, they  also say that Batoni Shevardnadze apparently joined the CIS so  that he could take on a different mission, which will benefit  not only us but also others.... As regards the attitude of  members of our government to the CIS, their hesitancy was  exposed in a masterly way by Kalbatoni [Georgian polite form of  address] Irina Sarishvili [Chanturia's wife, former vice premier  who resigned in protest against Shevardnadze's decision to join  the CIS] during two sessions of Parliament.    [Chanturia] There are people in the government who not  only hold the CIS close to their hearts but also would gladly  welcome the restoration of the Soviet Union in any form. I am  convinced that Shevardnadze did not want this but, as a result  of mistakes made and proceeding from objective or subjective  reality and what took shape in our country, it became necessary  to take this step. However, we should be frank and say that  this is a defeat. The very fact that, following our being  dragged into the CIS, we lost Abkhazia and Gamsakhurdia returned  to Georgia and inflicted a civil war [upon the country] shows  that this is a defeat. We nevertheless have to say this so that  we can leave something for posterity.    Our moderate position regarding relations with Russia is  known to you. We are categorically opposed to anti-Russian  hysteria but this does not mean that we would conduct a  pro-Russian and antistate policy and leave the flag, emblem, and  anthem as vestiges of our independence. When we speak of an  antistate approach, this characterizes a certain section of our  society, people who are collaborators by nature. Consumed with  revanchist feelings and hiding behind anti-Gamsakhurdia  sentiments, they are now bent on wrecking the ideals of the  national movement (that date from the time of Ilia  Chavchavadze). Nevertheless, I believe that Shevardnadze has  sufficient forces and will free himself of this entourage; this  is essential for him, as a politician, so that he can get a  realistic view of the existing situation in Georgia. I have  witnessed how people have been feeding him with disinformation  and painting a picture that does not exist in reality. When one  is given incorrect information, this causes one to take  incorrect steps. Naturally, we have to be very wary and correct  in our relations with Russia but we should not compromise our  state interests. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Books: Very Peter Hall MAKING AN EXHIBITION OF MYSELF: by Peter Hall Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 419 pages THERE HAS been a decline in the art of autobiography or perhaps one should say, more accurately, in the standards of editing. The memoirs of Sir Peter Hall, the theatre director, turn out to be quite as dismal as those of Kenneth Baker, the politician, published a few weeks earlier. And they are dismal for the same reasons. There is an excessive use of the first person singular and a not entirely convincing parade of self-justification. Above all, there is a failure to reflect, to stand back and put matters into perspective. Hall's Diaries were published in 1983 and were interesting raw material for a studied work later that also took in subsequent years. The opportunity has been neglected. Here is a man who directed the Arts Theatre at the age of 24, gave London its first production of Waiting for Godot, went on to lead the Royal Shakespeare Company, then the National Theatre, and intermittently produced operas around the world. It would be instructive to read his considered thoughts on theatre and the art of directing, coupled with a view of how a life in the arts has compared with developments in society as a whole. Hall has no such discipline. So far as he is concerned, nothing has changed except for the worse, defined as an unwillingness on the part of the British government to go on increasing subsidies to the theatre. Hall is a reactionary posing as a radical. He writes that he 'never felt part of Imperial Britain because I belonged to the wrong class and went the wrong schools'. In fact, he went to perfectly decent schools and on to Cambridge University. His father was a station master, presided over a staff of three and had a house to go with the job, although only five trains a day passed through the station. One cannot help thinking that Hall believes the modern theatre should be run much like the old railways: regardless of costs, regardless of customers. At least the trains ran on time. Hall has been through a lot of adventures, sometimes marriages, sometimes affairs. His obsession is sexual. When he went to see an amateur production of Robinson Crusoe at the age of five, he found it a 'very erotic experience'. Even now, the most complimentary adjective he can apply to an artistic performance is 'sexy'. For a theatre director rooted in Shakespeare his vocabulary is limited. He says he learned from FR Leavis that 'sloppy writing is the result of sloppy thinking'. On the evidence of this book, he did not learn well. In the lines 'with a feeling of enormous relief, I gave up religion. It has worried me ever since.' the reader is left to guess what the word 'it' refers to. Hall writes that he has never been affluent. Yet on his 30th birthday his first wife, Leslie Caron, gave him a vintage Rolls-Royce. That was to go with the open Jaguar XK150 'in British racing green with tan upholstery' which he already owned. When he took over at the National Theatre, he appeared in an advertisement for Sanderson's wallpaper. Sanderson's completely redecorated a room in his house for the occasion. The ad appeared with the words 'Very Peter Hall, Very Sanderson's' True, Hall now admits that the wallpaper episode was a foolish mistake, but it is not surprising that the press should have begun to send him up. There was also the suspicion that in the many productions he undertook simultaneously he was beginning to look like an absentee landlord. This is not the place to comment on his abilities as a director because the art of theatre is not essentially what Making an Exhibition of Myself is about. Yet one wonders how a man who claims to be punctilious with detail can write such a sloppy book. One wonders even more about the publisher's lack of an editor. Possibly no-one can direct Peter Hall.</p>

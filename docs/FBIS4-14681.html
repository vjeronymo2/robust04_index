			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, special representative of </F> the president on the settlement in former Yugoslavia, by  correspondent Mikhail Kozhukhov; in the "Panorama" program;  place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Kozhukhov] Vitaliy Churkin, special representative  of the president on the settlement in former Yugoslavia, has  once again become a man of the week. With his participation in  the Russian Embassy, representatives of Croatia and the  self-declared Serb Krajina have agreed that as of 0900, 5 April  they will stop killing each other. Vitaliy Ivanovich, the  agreement between Serb Krajina and Croatia was signed when yiu  were recently in Zagreb. We saw your happy face on our TV sets.  But was this happiness not premature? The truce is not the  peace as yet, you know.    [Churkin] Well, I really was very happy because two rounds,  which lasted for 30 hours -- and the last round of negotiations  lasted for 17 hours, ending at 0300 on 30 March -- led to the  signing of one of the most important agreements, I believe.  This is the agreement on a cease-fire between Serbs and Croats.  It is very important that this is not only a declaration that  they do not want to fight each other, but this is also a complex  military and technical document which includes, for example, 35  maps with a detailed picture along the whole length of the line  of contact between Serbs and Croats. It could be around 1,000  kilometers. That is to say that the implementation of this  agreement will ensure that even if the sides want to shoot each  other they will not be able to do so. There is a serious  control procedure over this agreement on the part of the UN  troops. That is to say that we are really talking, at last,  about a line being drawn under the war between Serbs and Croats  which has lasted for over two years. There have been constant  fighting and shelling, the peaceful population has been killed  -- both Serbs and Croats -- and one of the most volatile areas  of conflict threatened to erupt. And if this happened it would  for sure bury any hopes of resolving the conflict in the former  Yugoslavia. So, this is a very serious step.    [Kozhukhov] But at the moment, the embers are still burning  because, as far as I know, Serb Krajina will not agree to the  status of even a large autonomy within Croatia.    [Churkin] Yes, you are right. But in conditions when it is  impossible to start a war we believe that we can move to the  second stage -- to arrange economic relations between Serbs and  Croats in this region. The sides will meet again in two weeks  on our initiative and under our mediation to discuss the  economic issues. Then we will move to the third stage, and there  is wide understanding between the main members of the world  community as far as this question is concern. This stage will  be the most difficult, as you mentioned -- to determine the  political status of the regions where Serbs are living now under  the protection of the United Nations.    [Kozhukhov] Diplomats would rather not make wild guesses.  Nevertheless, what will happen to Bosnia?    [Churkin] We expect to resume the negotiating process in  Bosnia in the next few weeks. Strictly speaking, it has never  died away completely. An exchange of opinions continues, in  particular, between the Americans and us. It is we and the  Americans who are going to play the leading role now in the  settlement efforts.    I think the sides will have to get in touch again and try to  resolve, above all, the most difficult territorial issue, how to  separate territorially the authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina  between the three peoples who form the state -- Serbs, Croats  and Muslims -- and to finally define the position regarding the  state structure of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whether it will be the  union of Bosnia- Herzegovina, a federation, or something else.  A lot has been done already in this respect. One thing is  necessary though. It is necessary for the sides finally to  decide that it is time to stop the war and switch to peace.  Without such resoluteness of the sides, certainly, no efforts  by international mediators can be successful.    [Kozhukhov] You know, I was in Belgrade at the end of last  year and it seemed to me that, as far as the situation as a  whole on the territory of former Yugoslavia is concerned, there  could be no good solutions. The sides hate each other so much  and they are so unprepared for a compromise that the incredible  -- Yugoslavia's return within its former borders -- might be the  best solution.    [Churkin] You were absolutely correct to mention this moral  dilemma which the peoples of former Yugoslavia have to face.  After the war which has taken place, especially on the  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, any solutions which might be  evolving now will be morally detrimental. But unfortunately,  the clocks cannot be turned back and one cannot return  everything to a state of affairs as it was at the beginning of  1991.    [Kozhukhov] Many people in Russia think that Russia does not  in reality have interests in Serbia, and that this topic is only  a card in a domestic political game. What do you think about  that?    [Churkin] I think that we do have interests in the Balkans,  and we do have interests in former Yugoslavia -- political,  economic and others; and just as important, is the fact that it  is impossible to settle this conflict without us. We all became  convinced of this fact in recent months when we were not  participating so actively, and a settlement was constantly  slipping out of reach. But again, you rightly perceive that  sometimes this question does become the subject of a certain  domestic political game, and passions are artificially whipped  up over it.    In addition, it seems to me that some of our Serbian  partners  who have sensed this are trying artificially to inflate the  question of Russian-Serbian brotherhood in order to push us into  positions which would contravene Russia's own interests, and  which, in the final analysis, would mean unconditional support  for Serbian extremism. We have never allowed this in our  position in our diplomatic and political work, and we will never  allow it. We will implement a balanced and objective policy.  We will have contact with all three sides, and only in this way  can we promote a Yugoslav settlement.    [Kozhukhov] Do you think personally that the Ames affair was  indeed revenge for the breakthrough in the Balkans?    [Churkin] No, I do not think everything is that simple. This  is my personal view: I do not deal directly with  Russian-American relations. But I think there has of course  been some dissatisfaction among the opposition in the United  States with the energetic way in which the Clinton  administration has acted in developing relations with Russia;  with the fact that the United States has established such good  relations with the Russian Federation; and with the fact that  the development of relations with Russia occupies such a major  place in the policy of the Clinton administration.    Maybe Yugoslavia and Bosnia played a certain part here as  well, but that is probably only one feature in the general  picture of Russo-American relations.</p>

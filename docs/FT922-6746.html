			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Warring Sudanese factions to hold talks in Nigeria TALKS are due to begin on Sunday in the Nigerian capital Abuja between the Sudanese government and southern rebels who have been fighting a particularly bloody civil war since May 1983. The talks are being organised by Nigeria, which is current chairman of the Organisation of African Unity and was given a mandate by the organisation last year to bring the two sides together. The Sudanese government delegation is due to meet Mr Lam Akol, who is one of the leaders of the Nasir faction that has recently broken away from the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. Whether the SPLA leader, the dictatorial Mr John Garang, will himself be present is not yet clear. On previous occasions in the last two years, when the two sides established contact in Nairobi and Addis Ababa, Mr Garang was known to be in town but would not meet the other side. What might give hope for the present talks is that both sides have good reasons for bringing the war to an end. In the latest dry season of November to May the northern army has captured a number of important southern towns. The SPLA was also weakened by the collapse in Ethiopia last year of the hardline communist regime of Colonel Mengistu, who had been its main outside backer. On the northerners' side the main reasons for wanting peace now are economic. Military spending has been consuming a large part of the government's budget and a lack of progress towards peace in recent years has been a main reason why Sudan has not received development aid from western countries. The army also has suffered heavy casualties in recent fighting. A military hospital area near Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, has been closed to civilians so that they cannot see the large numbers who have been coming back from the south badly wounded. Before the recent campaign began there were mutinies in some of the northern army garrisons. But if the military and economic logic point to peace, the political signs are less encouraging. The reasons go back to the breakdown of the Addis Ababa agreement, which ended the earlier civil war of 1955 to 1972. The agreement established a federal system of government which gave the south autonomy and recognised its distinct cultural identity. But later the central government began amending the boundaries of the south so that it could transfer to the north a small oil discovery in the Upper Nile province, some uranium deposits and the fertile Renk area bordering the White Nile. Then there were attempts to introduce the north's Arab and Islamic culture into the south. If there is to be an agreement at Abuja one possibility is that the southerners will have to accept that, even if they get regional autonomy they will be disadvantaged second-class citizens in an Islamic state, excluded from any important jobs in the north, which has 20m out of Sudan's total population of 26m. Alternatively the northern regime, if it is not prepared to weaken its commitment to Islamic law Arabism, might think of allowing the south complete independence. This is now discussed quite widely in Khartoum, where it is suggested that some members of the government might like to be rid of their Christian and pagan minority, but officials of the regime reject the idea.</p>

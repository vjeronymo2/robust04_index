			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / WPP and banks near deal on plan to reduce Dollars 1bn debt WPP, the London-based inter-national marketing services group, yesterday appeared to be close to an agreement with its 28-bank syndicate on an equity-for-debt swap of some Dollars 200m (Pounds 111.7m), to reduce its Dollars 1bn debt. WPP anticipated that a formal proposal for recapitalisation could be concluded by the end of next week, ready for presentation to WPP's shareholders and perhaps finally in place by mid-June. The co-ordinating committee - JP Morgan, Bankers' Trust, Citibank and Barclays - last week presented options to WPP's 28-bank syndicate, but it is understood that the banks and WPP favour the equity-for-debt swap. Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive, announced in March his wish to dispose of a US advertising agency, Scali McCabe Sloves, along with market research subsidiaries and the flotation of WPP's minority share in its Asian advertising businesses. He had wanted to raise Dollars 200m from such moves, but no deals have yet been concluded. The difficulty of making disposals for the price Mr Sorrell seeks, especially during economic recession, has exacerbated uncertainty over the group's financial health. Disposals would reduce overall group revenues. Although in March WPP reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 56.1m for 1991 (compared with Pounds 90m), analysts suggested at the time that without the release of Pounds 17.8m of exceptional items to boost 1991's figure, the group would have breached its banking covenants. At the end of 1991, WPP - which owns the Ogilvy &amp; Mather and J Walter Thompson advertising agencies - had net debt of Dollars 334m on its balance sheet and negative shareholders' funds of Dollars 268m. These factors have contributed to some of WPP's banks wishing to reduce their exposure. With the apparent determination of ABN, the Dutch bank, and Fuji, its Japanese counterpart, not to renew an Dollars 85m discounting receivables facility when it runs out in June, WPP is approaching serious cash-flow difficulties. Analysts expect that any recapitalisation will involve three items: conversion of the 213m convertible preference shares to ordinary shares (of which there are 60m); a rights issue to existing shareholders; and the banking syndicate taking equity in WPP for a portion of debt.</p>

Answering an Interfax question he said that he had discussed  the consequences of the Ames' scandal with American  intellectuals in the Russian embassy in Washington.    He had suggested that the Americans should agree to  discussing the call made earlier by Yevgeniy Primakov, chief of  the Russian Foreign Intelligence who wanted Moscow and  Washington to "make each other's intelligences transparent to  the other side."    Rybkin said that the Americans did not see much harm in the  amnesty. "They share President Boris Yeltsin's and my view that  if those who were released make trouble again they can be sent  back to jail and the public opinion would say `That's where they  belong'," he explained.    Rybkin told the journalists who accompanied him that he had  agreed with the House of Representatives Speaker Thomas Foley  that direct contacts would be established between the two  parliaments. In particular, cooperation within the CSCE  framework had been discussed. "A joint military organization  could become a CSCE tool so that Russia should not be  sidelined," he said.    Rybkin added that he and his U.S. counterpart had discussed  ratification of START-2 and other international agreements by  the Russian parliament and the situation in former Yugoslavia.  He said that the crisis there could not be resolved unless  Russia and the U.S.A. joined their efforts.    The House of Representatives speaker accepted the invitation  to come to Russia on an official visit, Rybkin said.    On Monday Rybkin also met with Lee Hamilton, chairman of the  foreign relations committee of the US Congress.    On the conclusion of this meeting he declared that it is  necessary to implement several "non-popular measures" in Russia  to pursue tough anti-inflation policy, civil peace and accord  are necessary for this.    Rybkin referred to Gaydar who declared last September that  as  many as $20-25 Bn "leak" abroad annually. "One should  undertake appropriate measures to return these funds and grant  guarantees in order to draw foreign investments into the Russian  economy. There is an appropriate majority to solve these issues  in the State Duma," he said.    Rybkin criticized actions of the Central Bank for "wasteful  allocation of technical credits" to Ukraine, Chechnya, Georgia,  Belarus, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. "In absolute numbers the  allocated sums exceeded credits being granted by the United  States," he noted.    For his part, Lee Hamilton welcomed Rybkin's reassurances  "about irreversibility of economic reforms in Russia."    At the same time he pointed out that there can appear "great  difficulties" during the voting in the US Congress on allocation  of an economic aid to Russia. "Officials in the United States  are attentively following the Central Bank of Russia's activity  and believe that it rouses hyperinflation," said Lee Hamilton.</p>

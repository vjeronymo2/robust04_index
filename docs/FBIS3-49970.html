			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Szilveszter Varga from Belgrade] </F>   [Text] Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky will be  received by his Yugoslav counterpart, Vladislav Jovanovic, who  said in an interview with MTI that they had been able to  preserve minimal mutual trust between Yugoslavia and Hungary.  Jovanovic stressed that Hungary had shown a flexible attitude  in connection with the application of the sanctions, in spite of  the fact that Hungarian representatives at international forums  were still objecting to Yugoslavia's participation in the work  of these bodies.    Belgrade would like Hungary to change this position.  Jovanovic especially held as a grievance the fact that a few  weeks ago the Hungarian representative to the UN General  Assembly voted in favor of lifting the Bosnian arms embargo.    Talking about the intimidation of the [ethnic] Hungarians in  Vojvodina, the Yugoslav foreign minister said that this was  suggested to them from beyond the border. Jovanovic added:  Fears that are voiced in Hungary from time to time concerning  the fate of the Vojvodina Hungarians are absolutely unfounded  and unjustified. As a matter of fact, many people from Vojvodina  fled because they were influenced by the propaganda that is  disseminated in Hungary as well.    Jovanovich said that Yugoslav citizens could return home  except those, of course, who had deserted because until they are  granted amnesty, the latter are responsible for what they have  done in the eye of the law.    The Yugoslav foreign minister said about the Democratic  Community of Hungarians of Vojvodina that it was a recognized  organization and the Yugoslav leaders would assess its operation  positively as long as it functioned within a constitutional and  legal framework.</p>

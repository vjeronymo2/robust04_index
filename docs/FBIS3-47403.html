John  Rockefeller, a Democrat from West Virginia, on Tuesday [11  January] urged Japan to take concrete steps to ensure that  Japan's chronic trade surpus with the United States is whittled  down in coming years.    Foreign Ministry officials said Rockefeller, a veteran  member  of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee,  made the request in a meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata.    Rockefeller pointed to the importance of the upcoming summit  between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa slated for February 11 for alleviating any irritants  between the two countries, they said.    In reply, Hata said Japan recognized the "need to bolster  the  transparency" of bidding procedures for the construction market,  to which the Clinton administration has been demanding greater  access for American contractors, they said.    The minister also pointed out that Japan's plan to proceed  with deregulation, loosening various curbs binding the hands of  Japanese businesses and society will help improve the relations  with the United States.    Rockefeller, a Harvard graduate who studied at International  Christian University in Tokyo from 1957 to 1960, is noted for  his familiarity with Japanese political affairs.</p>

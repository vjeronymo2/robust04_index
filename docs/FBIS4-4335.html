			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 31 (YONHAP) -- The opposition  Democratic Party [DP] demanded Thursday that the Seoul  Government immediately recall Ambassador to China Hwang  Pyong-tae and reshuffle its entire diplomatic and national  security team.    The DP made the demand on the ground that the team has  created fear and anxiety among the people by pushing an  inconsistent foreign and national security policy with regard to  the North Korean nuclear dispute.    As far as the nuclear issue is concerned, President Kim was  at the receiving end of persuasion during his visits to Japan  and China, the DP said.    Moreover, the Kim administration's North Korea policy has  performed another sudden about-face, from a hard-line position  to a moderate stance.    The opposition party, however, acknowledged that it was  proper for Seoul to have reaffirmed its position on resolving  the North Korean issue through dialogue.    For its part, the DP again made clear it was against  imposing  any sanctions on North Korea through the UN Security Council.    DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek said, "The president has to carry out  a clear policy so that the people don't become confused."    "It was a very serious matter when the ambassador to China  and the senior presidential secretary for foreign and national  security affairs fought in Beijing, causing confusion," Yi said.    "If all members of the government's foreign and national  security policy team are not changed, similar problems will  continue to occur."    DP Spokesman Pak Chi-won said, "Our country was subjected to  international shame in China when the ambassador and the  presidential aide publicly squabbled to grab the policy  initiative."    "The government ought to straighten out its wavering policy  on the North Korean nuclear issue," Pak said. "And it has to  recall Ambassador Hwang immediately."    Hwang, after attending a summit between Presidents Kim and  Jiang Zemin of China, briefing reporters, said, among other  things, that Seoul would henceforth consult with Beijing closely  on the North Korean issue, placing emphasis on China's role in  the affair.    Hwang said China would actively intervene to end the nuclear  standoff and North Korea would allow additional International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections.    His remarks were refuted by Chong Chong-uk, senior  presidential secretary for foreign and national security  affairs. The Seoul Government has not changed its policy of  closely coordinating and cooperating with the United States and  Japan, Chong said.    Meanwhile, some members of the ruling Democratic Liberal  Party also criticized the administration for lacking consistency  in its policy on North Korea.    Rep. Chong Che-mun, chairman of the Foreign Affairs and  National Unification Committee, said Ambassador Hwang's comments  were uncalled for, especially while the senior presidential  secretary was in the Chinese capital.    "It is all very well and important to cooperate with China,  but we have not reached the stage where we should shift the base  of our foreign policy away from the cooperative arrangments  among Japan, the United States and South Korea," said Rep. Pak  Chong-su.</p>

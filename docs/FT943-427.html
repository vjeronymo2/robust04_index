			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Observer: Daily dose The state-owned BBC continues to do its bit for the development of commercial radio. A recent triumph has been the moving of The Financial World Tonight from Radio 4 to Radio Five Live at a later 11.45pm time slot. The programme, which used to be required bed-time listening for City types, had already lost fans when its slot was moved from 11.15pm to 9.45pm. Since its latest move, the programme's weekly audience in the important London market has dropped from 120,000 to about 26,000. All of this has opened up an opportunity for London News, the successor to LBC. It has poached BBC presenter Richard Shackleton to launch a nightly The Business World Tonight. Tune in next Wednesday at 10.30pm.</p>

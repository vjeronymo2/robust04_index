			<p>BFN     [Text] In view of the UN declaration of its inability to  defend the people of Gorazde, the president of the Islamic  Republic of Iran has expressed Iran's readiness to send forces  to the area for defense against the Serbs.    Following the intensification of the Serbs' attacks on  cities  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and especially on Gorazde, and in reply to  a written message from Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to  our president on the painful predicament of the people in  Bosnia, Hashemi-Rafsanjani held a telephone conversation with  the Bosnian president last night and discussed the latest  situation in the war- stricken areas in Bosnia, especially in  the occupied city of Gorazde.    In this telephone conversation, the president pointed out  that the people and the government of the Islamic Republic of  Iran fully understand and are concerned about the painful and,  at the same time, sensitive situation of the defenseless and  Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially Gorazde, and  stated that all the officials and people--from the esteemed  leader of the Islamic revolution down to the Government and  people of Iran--are sorrowfully following the bitter and painful  events in Bosnia, which are taking place before the indifferent  eyes of the world.    He stated that when the United Nations refused the offer by  the Islamic Republic of Iran to dispatch forces to defend the  people of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the areas that the UN had  declared safe havens, the Iranian nation realized that the  international organizations and countries are not serious in  their claims to defend the defenseless people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The president added: Now again, since the  United Nations has overtly declared its inability to defend the  oppressed Bosnian nation, the Islamic Republic of Iran is ready  to send forces to the areas under UN supervision to defend the  rights of the Muslim Bosnians. Iran also welcomes the  assistance of other countries.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to the Serbs' chemical attacks  on  Gorazde and expressed the Islamic Republic's readiness to send  them defensive equipment, namely masks and antichemical uniforms.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani asked the Bosnian president to convey the  greetings and sympathies of the Iranian people to the oppressed  Bosnian people and to consider the Islamic Republic of Iran a  partner in their affliction and to rest assured that the Iranian  government and nation will do their best not to desert the  Bosnian people in their struggle for the vindication of their  definite rights.    Alija Izetbegovic expressed the gratitude of the Bosnian  Government and people for Iran's humanitarian assistance and  briefed the president on the latest situation in Gorazde and  added: Gorazde is still resisting the aggressors. But it is  under heavy shelling, and the situation in the city is extremely  difficult and disturbing. He expressed his confidence that the  people and government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will  support the oppressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as in the  past.</p>

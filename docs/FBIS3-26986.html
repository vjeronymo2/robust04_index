According to the IAA spokesman, the DPRK informed the IAA that  it is willing to let the IAA inspect its nuclear installations.  If there is no abrupt change or turnaround, it will ease the  situation on the Korean peninsula and will have a good impact on  the DPRK's economic development.    The DPRK made public its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty last March. Suddenly, the international  community put more stake in the widely circulating rumor that  the DPRK was secretly and intensively developing nuclear  weapons. In particular, the anxiety of the ROK, the United  States, and Japan was expressed repeatedly by their officials  and their media. Not long ago, the United States said that  economic sanctions would be applied against Pyongyang and that  U.S. "Patriot" missiles would be deployed in the ROK. Japan  also suggested indirectly that it had the capability to rapidly  develop nuclear bombs. The ROK was particularly on alert.    For a long time, the DPRK has seldom made contact with the  outside world, and the international community does not have an  appropriate and normal understanding of its political, economic,  and military situations. Moreover, the annual U.S.-ROK joint  military exercises cause the authorities in Pyongyang to lose  their trust in the outside world and make them more nervous.  Not long ago, there was a rumor that the DPRK had deployed many  more troops in areas north of the 38th parallel. The DPRK has  strong military strength, but its domestic economic situation is  extremely difficult. In particular, with the disintegration of  the Soviet Union, regular economic aid has been cut off,  gasoline and energy are in short supply, foreign exchange has  been exhausted, and its people are living in privation.  Moreover, President Kim Il-song is getting old, and it is still  not known whether his son Kim Chong-il will be able to succeed  him. The outside world has expressed different views on the  question of whether Kim Chong-il can assume the great task of  leading the DPRK, but most are pessimistic.  <H3>  China Is Concerned About the Situation on the Korean  Peninsula </H3>   The DPRK should, however, pay closest attention to its  economic problems. The DPRK has still failed to break away from  its impoverished state. Naturally, China, as a close neighbor  of the DPRK, is very concerned about the situation. From the  Korean war to the post-war construction period, China paid a  high price for selflessly aiding the DPRK. However, with the  changes in the global situation, particularly after China  started implementing the policy of opening up to the outside  world in the 1980's, tremendous new changes have taken place in  China's economy. China very much hopes that the DPRK can draw  on its experience and adopt flexible domestic and foreign  policies to attract foreign investment, to develop the domestic  economy, and to ease relations with the ROK first before  discussing economic exchanges between the North and the South.    To our disappointment, however, the two Koreas have not been  able to get beyond their feelings of mutual distrust, even  though they have repeatedly held contacts with one other.  Consequently, financial groups in the south still cannot invest  in the north. The two sides of the strait are engaged in  massive economic dealings with one another, which brings many  advantages to compatriots on both sides. Hence, the DPRK should  draw on China's example to adopt its own flexible policies.  <H3>  The Improvement of U.S.-Vietnamese Relations Does Have an  Impact </H3>   Pyongyang's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty has damaged its international image. If it really  develops nuclear weapons, it will not have the national strength  to bear the burden of the consequences, which may even slow down  economic development. Today, the DPRK has come to the stage in  which it must change course and strike out on a new path.    Ronald Dellums, chairman of the U.S. House of  Representatives  Armed Services Committee, will visit Pyongyang in the next few  days to try to break the deadlock over U.S.-DPRK relations.  This kind of high-level direct contact helps promote mutual  understanding. The fact that agreement has been reached on the  issue of nuclear inspections will be more advantageous to  improving bilateral relations between the United States and the  DPRK. It was reported that Kim Il-song had asked Billy Graham,  a U.S. religious figure who had earlier visited Pyongyang, to  convey to Clinton his suggestion of holding a U.S.-DPRK summit.  Viewed from this angle, it seems that Pyongyang is ready to  change its U.S. policy.    The United States and Vietnam fought a bloody war for a  decade, but their relations have greatly improved recently, and  this should help awaken Pyongyang.</p>

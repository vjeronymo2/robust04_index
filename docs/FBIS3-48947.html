			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Dec 28 (CTK) -- The independent daily  SME today turns its attention to Slovak Premier Vladimir  Meciar's proposal, made at an extraordinary cabinet meeting last  Wednesday, to discuss the compatibility of the 1991 lustration,  or screening, law with the Slovak Constitution.    (The screening law passed by the now-defunct Czechoslovak  Federal Parliament in 1991 bars former Communist Party  officials, and members of the former State Secret Police (StB)  and the People's Militia, from high economic and political posts  until 1996.)    Meciar has asked the Constitutional Court to rule that the  law runs contrary to the Slovak Constitution.    SME carries an interview with chairman of the opposition  Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan Carnogursky, who points  out that the law has already been dealt with by the  Constitutional Court of the former Czechoslovakia, which ruled  that only two of its provisions contradicted the Constitution,  primarily the Charter of Fundamental Freedoms and Human Rights,  which was adopted into the former Czechoslovak Constitution.    The Slovak Republic included the Charter into its own  Constitution without changes, Carnogursky recalls, which means  that if the Constitutional Court has ruled once on the law's  compatibility with the Constitution, it should now ignore any  reservations raised by the Government.    Eva Poganyova, a spokesperson for Egyutteles, a Hungarian  minority movement in Slovakia, says on the same topic that  Meciar's stance on the lustration issue has been "unclear" since  1990. She questions the sincerity of Meciar's efforts to  cleanse Slovak civic and political life of StB agents.  Poganyova describes the screening law as "imperfect" and  stresses that it has been a political weapon in the hands of  those in power from the very beginning.    Democratic Left Party (SDL) Deputy Chairman Dusan Dorotin  says in the daily that SDL reservations against the lustration  law as a legal norm contradicting the Slovak Constitution are  generally known. Dorotin says the SDL will support all moves  aimed at putting the end to the psychosis of collective  suspicion and at creating an atmosphere of decent respect  towards the principles of a law-abiding state.

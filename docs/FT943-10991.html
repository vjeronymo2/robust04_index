			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / 'Twere well it were done quickly: What chance have western-backed market reforms of succeeding in Ukraine? With US Vice-President Al Gore arriving in Kiev today, Ukraine's newly-elected president is spending his second week in office just as he spent his first: talking to western leaders about launching a programme of market reforms to rescue one of eastern Europe's most unstable economies. Mr Leonid Kuchma's courting of the west is a remarkable reversal of his campaign theme of integration with Russia. Instead of the widely-expected post-victory trip to Moscow to smooth relations with Russia's President Boris Yeltsin, Mr Kuchma last week entertained the head of the International Monetary Fund. He agreed to draw up an economic reform programme in conjunction with the IMF by October. 'We'll always have time for Russia,' said one senior Kuchma official as he came out of a meeting with Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Mr Rudiger Dornbusch who may become an adviser to the president. 'We need to use the opportunity we have now to meet with the west.' Mr Kuchma's only tilt in Russia's direction since he took office has been a vague joint statement with Mr Yeltsin on the importance of resolving soon Ukraine's dispute with Russia over the future of the Black Sea fleet. In appeasing Russia but making deals with the west, 'Kuchma is playing a smart game - he's continuing the ambiguity over Ukraine's geo-political orientation but pursuing economic reform to get western assistance,' says Mr Ian Brzezinski of Ukraine's parliamentary advisory council, which acts as an independent think tank. In balancing his actions, he is motivatived in part by political pressures: 'He realises taking the Russian path creates too much tension with Ukraine's nationalists,' says Mr Brzezinski. But Mr Kuchma also seems to be following the footsteps of the Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, the ex-Soviet industrialist who, in spite of a reputation as a conservative, has been pragmatic in his relations with the west. Mr Chernomyrdin eventually succeeded in carrying out a programme more austere than that of his radical predecessor, Mr Yegor Gaidar. To buttress the links he is making with the west, Mr Kuchma, a former missile factory boss, has brought into his administration a younger generation of Ukrainians eager for the country to embrace western-style market reforms. At stake is Dollars 4bn of World Bank and IMF loans for economic restructuring promised at the Naples summit last month of the group of seven main industrial nations (G7). One recruit is 34-year-old Mr Volodymyr Kuznetsov, recently named as head of Mr Kuchma's Economic Service, which is responsible for drawing up policy proposals. Mr Kuznetsov, was trained at Moscow State University by the Gorbachev-era radical economist, Mr Stanislav Shatalin, author of the 1990 '500-day plan' to introduce market forces into the Soviet Union which was watered down by the then Soviet leader. The initial signs are that Mr Kuznetsov will have few difficulties working with the two ministers responsible for economic policy - even though both were appointed by Mr Kuchma's predecessor, Mr Leonid Kravchuk. Economics minister Mr Roman Shpek is keen to see an IMF programme adopted, while western observers saw Mr Petro Hermanchuk, the finance minister, as a welcome replacement for his predecessor, Mr Hrihory Pyatachenko, regarded as a typical old-school, Soviet minister. But if Mr Kuchma is to lay the foundations of an economic programme that would meet IMF approval he has only a short time to act. Ukraine's communist-dominated parliament adjourned last Friday for a one-and-a-half month summer recess. 'We're going to use this window to the maximum,' said Mr Kuznetsov. He has on his desk draft decrees awaiting the president's signature in the next few weeks which propose action in four main areas: The clarification of the debt position of state enterprises and the launching of bankruptcy proceedings against those judged to be deepest in the red. The introduction of a single exchange rate by late autumn to replace the current complex system of market and various official exchange rates. A switch to issuing government bonds to cover new debt incurred by the government, instead of printing money. Lowering official interest rates to spur investment. Western economists say these measures are a good first step - in particular because of the impact they will have on government finances. A western backed programme, however, would almost certainly involve far more extensive changes to the structure of Ukraine's overwhelmingly state-dominated economy (less than 10 per cent of enterprises have been privatised). 'My sense is they're (the administration) ready to start now to see what it means to stop the deficit,' said Mr Dornbusch. 'The wind is blowing strongly for change. But it won't be easy.' Mr Kuchma has yet to prove that any decrees he signs will actually be implemented - given the cumbersome state of Ukraine's bureaucracy. But a still bigger obstacle may be the parliament, which could overturn even the limited steps proposed so far by Mr Kuchma. The largest parliamentary faction - from the revived Communist Party of Ukraine - pushed through a temporary freeze on privatisation shortly before the summer recess. The president appears to be gambling that he can cower the parliament into endorsing his economic plans. This will not be easy. An apparently fickle electorate voted for a parliament hostile to economic reform three months before it elected Mr Kuchma president after a campaign in which he had promised just such changes. Adding to the task Mr Kuchma faces are Ukraine's mounting economic problems, which threaten to make reform harder than elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. For instance, the economy, left with the steel mills and heavy industrial plant set up to equip the old Soviet military machine, was developed at a time when oil was supplied virtually free from Russia. 'It's much easier to turn around a small country like Estonia. Ukraine is one of the largest countries in Europe,' says Harvard economist Professor Jeffrey Sachs. 'You're talking about a very large number of people. So much industry is in the wrong place.' Ironically, Ukraine's economic decline since independence in 1991 has, in some respects, made reform easier. One factor is psychological: falling living standards for the country's 52m citizens have convinced an increasing number radical reform is needed. Steep falls in production also mean 'much downward adjustment associated with structural reform has already taken place', according to Prof Sachs. But the deterioration has encouraged the black market. To some extent that is also a good sign, suggesting a nascent market economy is emerging. But evading the law has become so commonplace that it will be hard to encourage people to pay taxes even if administrative regulations are relaxed to free up trade. That adds to the pressure on Mr Kuchma to act sooner rather than later. Just as the parliamentary recess offers him an opportunity, it is also an opening for the west to assist and promote a genuine stabilisation programme in an economically backward country which could become politically unstable if its economic decline spirals out of control. 'When you come in and say we're ready to help from the start, there's a greater chance of things of working,' said Prof Sachs. For the west, a stable Ukrainian economy would put in a less threatening light the problems of the Chernobyl nuclear power station and Ukraine's ageing nuclear weapons. With the new administration there is a chance to put relations on new footing. 'Kuchma's the new man. It's a chance to see if there's a new opening to do something different,' says one western diplomat. More basically, the prospect of western money flowing into Ukraine's distressed economy, may help the president overcome the considerable domestic obstacles to reform.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: UK unlikely to drop toy challenge The British government is set to reject a request by Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, that it drop a legal challenge to an EU quota on toy imports from China. Sir Leon said in Brussels yesterday that he hoped the UK would withdraw its action following a Commission proposal to raise the value of the quota by Ecu150m (Pounds 115.5m) to Ecu780m this year. However, the Department of Trade and Industry said in London that the case, before the European Court of Justice, was a 'distinct and separate issue of principle.' The department said it was questioning the ability of the EU council of ministers, which approved the quota in February, to take 'unjustified and disproportionate trade measures' which were opposed by the majority of the EU toy industry. The quota, imposed as part of a package deal designed to win EU countries' agreement to scrap about 6,500 national trade restrictions, is intended chiefly to protect toy manufacturers in Spain. However, other European toy companies said that, at its original level of Ecu630m, it would halve expected imports from China and was causing problems for importers who had paid for goods which had not yet been delivered. The quota has also been criticised by China.</p>

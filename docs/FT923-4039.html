			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Pressure on Labour over Maastricht: Calls for devaluation LABOUR policy on Europe came under double pressure yesterday when several union leaders at the TUC congress in Blackpool called for devaluation of the pound and Mr Bryan Gould, shadow heritage secretary, described the Maastricht treaty as 'not the right blueprint for Europe'. The call for devaluation was led by Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, one of the largest Labour-affiliated unions. He said: 'The pound is over-valued. An early realignment is essential if we are to live without further agony in the ERM.' Mr Edmonds, who was supported by several other large unions including the general union TGWU, the public service union Nalgo and white collar union MSF, added: 'Most people in industry know that the pound is over-valued. Realignment is now inevitable.' He said he believed that Britain should remain in the European exchange rate mechanism. Earlier yesterday he strongly endorsed the TUC's support for the Maastricht treaty without a referendum, a position backed by a large majority of congress delegates. But Mr Edmonds argued that high interest rates were strangling the economy. 'The best way to deal with the problem is through a revaluation of the D-Mark but both the French and British governments are against that,' he said. The union call for devaluation will ensure a rough ride on the issue for the Labour leadership at the party conference in three weeks. Labour has been reluctant to call for any tampering with the pound's position in the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, in Blackpool for dinner with the TUC general council last night, said he was 'not in favour of a devaluation of sterling because that would not assist in reducing interest rates'. But he added that the EC 'should not rule out a revaluation of the D-Mark'. Disarray over Europe on the Labour front bench intensified with Mr Gould's call to use the failure of the Maastricht agreement to set out a new agenda for Europe. Mr Gould said: 'Britain should now take the lead in acknowledging that the Maastricht treaty is deeply flawed and has failed as a consequence to secure the endorsement of the people of Europe. This is as much an opportunity as a problem.' While the Labour leadership says the party will not decide what line to take until the bill to ratify Maastricht returns to the House of Commons, Mr Gould's remarks strike a very different tone from the conditional support for the treaty expressed by Mr Smith and Mr John Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary. Mr Gould, who challenged Mr Smith for the Labour leadership in the summer, launched a particular attack on the European exchange rate mechanism. He said: 'A European economy wrecked by recession simply cannot afford to hand economic policy over to unelected bankers who will enforce treaty provisions requiring massive cuts in pubic spending and giving an overriding priority to price stability at the expense of jobs and living standards.' In Blackpool yesterday Mr Smith indicated that he did not propose to discipline Mr Gould for his statement. 'I think he was speculating, as I think we are all entitled to do, on the effect of the Danish negative response to their referendum,' he said.</p>

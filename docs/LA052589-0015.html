			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANTING TREES  </P> <P> The Eastern Sierra Environmental and Water Conservation Assn. would like to  have Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley plant his 5 million trees in the Owens  Valley where the city of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has denuded  an entire valley so that Los Angeles can grow out of all reasoning.  </P> <P> It is only right that these trees be planted in the Owens Valley where the rain  cycle once again would be allowed to fulfill nature's need. It should be  considered criminal to destroy one part of California so that another part can  grow.  </P> <P> Southern California depends on water stored in the Eastern Sierra Mountains.  Destroy this environment by denuding its valleys and killing its trees and  nature's cycle is changed. So we ask that the Los Angeles DWP replace the trees  and vegetation that have been systematically destroyed.  </P> <P> Planting more trees in Los Angeles will bring about more destruction to our  environment in the Eastern High Sierra watershed, because more water will be  taken for these 5 million trees and you gain nothing. Killing one area and  planting another is a waste of taxpayers' money and the precious environment.  </P> <P> M.J. USHMAN  </P> <P> Keeler  </P></p>

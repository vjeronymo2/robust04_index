			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / The end of bossy bosses foreseen The manager who persists in thinking that he or she is the boss will be extinct by the year 2001, says a report by the Institute of Management. The study says that to avoid becoming a dinosaur the manager will have to become a team leader, earning people's respect rather than giving them orders. Managers are just as likely to be women, because female attributes such as teamworking, consensus management, negotiating, the ability to handle several projects at a time and interpersonal skills will be more appropriate by the next century. The report was based on interviews with senior and middle managers. The authors said that, contrary to some opinions, individuals in the UK had recognised the need for life-long training. Nearly 90 per cent of those surveyed believed that there would be an increased need to acquire new skills between now and 2001. They believed that to improve their prospects they needed transferable skills. Management Development in the Millennium.

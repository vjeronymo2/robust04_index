			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by B. Filippov and own correspondent Arif Useynov </F> under general headline: "To Whom Does Caspian Shelf Belong?  Geydar Aliyev Does Not Agree With Russian Federation Foreign  Ministry Note"]    [Text] As already reported in the pages of our newspaper,  following the USSR's disintegration Azerbaijan, having become a  sovereign state, proclaimed the Caspian Sea oil shelf off the  republic's shores to be its own property and on this basis  announced an international competition to sell oil deposits.    This competition was won by British companies, although it  was promised that between 10 and 20 percent of this deal would  be given to the Russian company "LUKoil."    But last week the Russian Foreign Ministry sent the British  ambassador in Moscow a note describing as premature the  conclusion of an Anglo-Azerbaijani memorandum on cooperation to  survey and extract oil and gas in the Caspian Sea's so-called  "Azerbaijani sector," because in the opinion of Smolensk Square  [Foreign Ministry's location] there is no such thing as sectoral  demarcation of the seabed in the Caspian and for that reason  questions concerning the practical utilization of this closed  basin's natural resources must be resolved jointly by all  Caspian states -- Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, and  Turkmenia [Turkmenistan].    This note provoked a sharply negative reaction in the  British  Isles and Baku. British newspapers and the BBC immediately  started talking about Russia's "imperial intentions." Official  Baku also responded vigorously to the Russian Federation Foreign  Ministry note. Our own correspondent reports on this.  [Filippov ends]    [Useynov report] Baku -- In a conversation with British  Ambassador to Baku Thomas Young Heydar Aliyev stated that the  note's appearance should be regarded as a minor, insignificant  event. "If any state wishes to hold talks about oil extraction  in the Caspian by Azerbaijan," he said, "then let it approach  Azerbaijan. If this is the Russian Government's intention, why  address the note to the British Embassy and not Azerbaijan?  What has Britain got to do with it?"    The head of state noted that it was with Azerbaijan's  agreement that the Russian company "LUKoil" had been included in  the consortium of oil-extracting firms headed by British  Petroleum.    He reported that he had discussed this subject with Russian  Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin by telephone 31  May. According to him, the Russian premier knows nothing about  the Foreign Ministry message and expressed considerable surprise  concerning this. Chernomyrdin noted that he is not raising the  question of the Caspian's status and has no intention of doing  so, and he requested that this be officially conveyed on his  behalf to the participants in the Istanbul talks.    Observers believe that the oil question has touched on  another, no less important, problem. On what basis do the  Caspian states intend to carry out joint utilization of the  sea's resources -- not only oil resources, of course? After  all, the question of the need to elaborate the Caspian's  international status has been raised at international ecological  conferences, meetings of Caspian states' representatives on  problems of fishing, navigation, and protecting and increasing  bioresources, and in all discussions and talks. Without this it  is extremely difficult to make the optimal decisions and  guarantee the unique water basin's ecological well-being.</p>

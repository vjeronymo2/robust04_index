			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> TILE EXPOSITION'S BID TO USE HALL DENIED  </P> <P> A judge on Wednesday denied a tile exposition's request to use a nearly  completed Anaheim Convention Center exhibit hall for a June show.  </P> <P> International Tile Exposition, which recently sued Anaheim over construction  delays at the center, wanted permission to set up structures in the unfinished  exhibit hall rather than split the exhibit between two areas.  </P> <P> Andrew Guilford, an attorney for ITE, said the show's coordinators plan to  continue the suit against the city for damages resulting from the unusable  hall. The city maintains that the building will not be ready for use, and it  foresees no out-of-court settlement in the case, said Lou Anne Merritt-Mc Lean,  an assistant city attorney.  </P> <P> The expansion of the convention center was to have been completed in February  but is now slated for July.  </P></p>

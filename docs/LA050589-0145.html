			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR GIRLS' TENNIS TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> PHEBUS, MALL GAIN QUARTERFINALS  </P> <P> Two of Orange County's top junior girls' tennis players, Keri Phebus of Newport  Beach and Anne Mall of Laguna Niguel, are among the participants in the 14th  Seventeen Magazine Tennis Tournament of Champions at the Marguerite Recreation  Center in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> As two of the 96 juniors invited to the four-day tournament, they are hoping,  perhaps, to become the next Tracy Austin -- who one year played the event until  her feet blistered. Or perhaps Andrea Jaeger, Kathy Rinaldi or Zina Garrison,  who also have participated in past years.  </P> <P> "I have so many future goals and aspirations," Phebus said. "I know I can do it  (reach the professional ranks). That keeps me on the court."  </P> <P> Phebus and Mall will be on the courts today in quarterfinal matches after  advancing with victories Thursday.  </P> <P> Phebus, 15 and ranked 18th nationally in 16s, cruised through two-set matches  in the first and second rounds of the 16s. She defeated Susie Starrett of North  Aurora, Ill., 6-2, 6-0, Wednesday, and Courtney Roberts of Lexington, Ky., 6-0,  6-1, Thursday.  </P> <P> Mall, 14 and ranked 37th nationally in 18s, also advanced with two-set  victories at 18s, but had more problems Thursday than on the first day.  </P> <P> "I was nervous going into the match," Mall said. "After that first set (which  Mall won, 6-4), I loosened up and felt more comfortable."  </P> <P> She broke the service of Michelle McMillen, of East Palestine, Ohio, in every  game of her 6-1 second-game victory Thursday. She blamed her aggressiveness for  the one loss.  </P> <P> "In the beginning I played more aggressive, but I kept missing," Mall said.  "And there was no time to attack. There weren't any long rallies. I felt if I  hit (hard), I'd miss."  </P> <P> So she went to soft lobs just to get through the match and waited for McMillen  to commit an error, which she did frequently in the second set.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Mall defeated Dawn Martin of St. Clair Shores, Mich., 6-0. 6-1.  </P> <P> Mall will face Christine Newman of Downers Grove, Ill. Phebus will play  Jennifer Nasser, who is seeded seventh,of Arlington Heights, Ill., in today's  matches, which are scheduled for 10 a.m.  </P></p>

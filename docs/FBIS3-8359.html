			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with I. Prikryl, chairman of the Union of Czech </F> and Moravian Housing Cooperatives, by Vladimir Cechlovsky; place  and date not given: "Including Transformation Norms in the  Housing Law Is Neither Legally Clean nor Decent"]    [Text] [Cechlovsky] Recently, when commenting on the  proposals by the [government] coalition deputies that other  cooperative property be included in the transfer of cooperative  housing units [to private ownership], you said that it would  lead to the liquidation of many cooperatives. These deputies,  however--O. Fejfar (Civic Democratic Party), for  instance--categorically refused this view. Do you insist on it?    [Prikryl] Yes, I do. Following the adoption of the new  statutes, which the Transformation Law of 1992 compelled the  cooperatives to accept, most of the cooperatives' property was  included in an indivisible fund. If it is now enshrined in the  law that the member of a cooperative also has the right, when  taking over the housing unit, to have that part of the property  that is registered in the indivisible fund paid out, it really  can lead to the liquidation of the cooperative. As a matter of  fact, such a liquidation can also be initiated by the court. To  pretend that nothing is at stake and, at the same time, beyond  the framework of the proposal of their own coalition government,  try to include fundamental transformation norms in the housing  law is neither legally clean nor decent.    [Cechlovsky] So, you are against a further transformation of  housing cooperatives?    [Prikryl] The transformation of housing cooperatives took  place in the past, and precisely according to instructions.  Another question altogether is whether the instructions called  for a lot or a little. Nonetheless, the actual responsibility  for the results is borne by the deputies of the then Federal  Assembly. They are basically the same ones as those who are  dissatisfied today and submit additional proposals. If, today,  the coalition deputies do not like the result of the  transformation of cooperatives, they certainly are free to  request another transformation. We consider it appropriate,  however, that such an intervention has the form of an amendment  to the transformation law, the Commercial Code, and the law on  banks.    [Cechlovsky] Why?    [Prikryl] It is a guarantee that the eventual change is  implemented responsibly. After all, no parliament--and that  includes this one--it is not a simple matter to alter the  Commercial or Civic Codes, which belong to the pillars of the  legal system in any advanced country.    [Cechlovsky] That is the legal side of the issue. The  deputies are reasoning for urgency, however, by, among other  things, numerous letters from the cooperative members, and, by  extension, that a further transformation is in the interest of  all members of the cooperatives.    [Prikryl] As long as it was not self-help construction by  the members or nonresidential premises in cooperative buildings,  like various shops, stores, offices, etc., in 90 percent of  cases they were financed solely by the state and not by the  members of the cooperatives. In these instances, I do not see  any reason that several individuals should grab these  nonresidential premises. They should remain in the ownership of  the cooperative, and the proceeds should support the cost of  housing of all members of the cooperative.    [Cechlovsky] Without any exception? What if these  nonresidential premises are a burden for the people living in  the given house because, for instance, there is noise, etc.?    [Prikryl] That is something else. In such an instance, we  would agree that the nonresidential premises be transferred to  co-ownership of the people in the building. It is necessary,  however, to individually assess whether that is the case. In  case of a conflict, even before a court.    [Cechlovsky] What about the other nonresidential premises,  the cost of which the cooperative members in the given building  shared?    [Prikryl] It is quite clear there. We have no objections  regarding their transfer to the co-ownership of the people in  the building.    [Cechlovsky] The deputies are proposing and will probably  approve a compulsory transfer of the housing units from the  ownership of the cooperative to the ownership of the members.  How do you feel about that?    [Prikryl] Frankly, this stipulation does not worry us in the  least. If I decided to do something voluntarily earlier, it  cannot trouble me when the state orders me to do it by law.  Personally, however, I cannot come to terms with the parliament  again showing disrespect for the ownership rights. After all,  it is inexcusable to expropriate a legal person to benefit its  shareholder. It is a dangerous precedent.    [Cechlovsky] The fact is that the transfers of cooperative  housing units stopped....    [Prikryl] It is not through any fault of ours. The housing  cooperatives wanted to transfer the units and did a lot for that  purpose. The transfers were stopped by the Czech Land Register  and Surveying Bureau that reasoned for this by not having a  legal basis for making the entry in the real estate register.  This lapse is to be eliminated by the currently drafted law on  housing ownership.    [Cechlovsky] To own a housing unit is not the end. Someone  must maintain it and take care of its administration. A  cooperative member may not feel comfortable in a large  cooperative. What will you offer to these people? Should they  not have the opportunity, after all, to secede from the  cooperative even with a share of the cooperative property.    [Prikryl] There is a better solution--namely, that  individual self-administrative units emerge from the original  cooperative, which, however, remains functional. The new units  would then take care of the entrusted housing units, thus  bringing the ownership closer to the people while being able to  use the services of the original cooperative.    [Cechlovsky] How would this benefit the people?    [Prikryl] The principle of cooperatives is a service to the  people. They will not have to take care of everything, and the  cost will be relatively reasonable. Take the energy aspect of  our housing, for instance. There are many houses that should  have been built in North Africa rather than here because their  insulation would be more appropriate there, are in desperate  need of repairs: a thermal treatment of the encasements and  roofs, and reconstruction of the housing cores. The people in  an individual building are not always able to take care of this  all by themselves. Nonetheless, there is also just the ordinary  caretaking in the building. If the cooperatives were eliminated  and each member got with his unit, say, 3,000 korunas--it would  hardly be more--it would not be of much help. For this money,  nobody would take care of the houses for long.    [Cechlovsky] The individual buildings can, however, leave  the cooperatives right now. They do not need any complex  legislation for that....    [Prikryl] Yes, that is true, but there still are certain  barriers. The secession of the self-administration would result  in the transfer of property, and that means paying taxes. Thus,  the taxes must be eliminated first. Furthermore, the secession  of any self-administration must be approved by the plenary  session of the entire cooperative. The transformation means  that a decision by the self-administration would suffice for  leaving the cooperative. No outsider could prevent it. Such a  solution is virtually identical with that demanded by the  coalition deputies, but it is a pragmatic one and not a  politically impulsive one.</p>

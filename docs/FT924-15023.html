			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Guyana's opposition takes election lead DR Cheddi Jagan, a former marxist who now advocates market economics, has taken an early lead in the race to be the next president of Guyana, following Monday's election. With about 20 per cent of the votes counted last night, Dr Jagan's opposition People's Progressive party (PPP) had just over 62 per cent, with the incumbent People's National Congress (PNC) party of President Desmond Hoyte winning 33 per cent. The remaining votes were shared by nine other parties, none of which is expected to win. Election officials said last night the counting of votes was slow, attributing this to the outbreak of violence and looting on Monday in Georgetown, the capital. Heavily armed soldiers and policemen patrolled the city last night. There was sporadic gunfire, shops and offices remained closed, public transport was limited, and most residents stayed home. Two people were killed, several injured and just under 200 arrested in violence which began when supporters of the PNC attacked the offices of the independent Elections Commission, claiming they were being prevented from voting. Mr Hoyte said he 'empathised' with the complaints of his supporters, but that he did not condone the violence. He then called out the army to support the police. The violence had cast doubt on the completion of what is widely held to be the country's first fair elections in 30 years. Foreign observers led by Mr Jimmy Carter, the former US president, and Mr David Peterson, former premier of Ontario province, Canada, are monitoring the elections and the counting of ballots. Any fraud would be detected, they said.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Observer: Fresh face If Conservative party rumours are to be believed John Major is toying with the idea of making Sarah Hogg, boss of his policy unit, governor of the Bank of England after Robin Leigh-Pemberton. But if a woman can make it into the Old Lady why can't a foreigner? It would certainly widen the catchment area and provide a welcome breath of fresh air. After all if the Central Statistical Office can recruit Australian Bill McLennan, why can't the authorities show the same sort of adventurousness in choosing the next governor? One candidate who springs to mind is Donald Brash, New Zealand's central bank governor. He has reduced inflation to under 1 per cent well ahead of the end-1993 deadline set by his official paymasters. He has also succeeded in halving his bank's staff in the past few years - an achievement that should impress ministers. Another advantage - apart from Brash's good record as a public speaker  - is that he will be free for the job. His term of office ends in August next year, precisely two months after the Threadneedle Street job becomes vacant.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Adolph Coors Co.: The brewer's third-quarter net income dipped 3% from a year  ago to $21 million. Sales totaled a record $583.3 million, up 17%. The Golden,  Colo., firm attributed earnings results to increased manufacturing costs,  particularly packaging materials, and price competition in the beer business.  The figures came despite improved sales in all its major businesses and the  introduction of Keystone and Keystone Light, Coors Brewing's first entries into  the popular-priced category.  </P></p>

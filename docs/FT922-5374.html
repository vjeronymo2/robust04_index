			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Revised trial data led Britain to ban Halcion: 'Very high frequency' of adverse side effects found BRITAIN banned Halcion, the controversial sleeping pill which is still on sale in many other countries, after receiving details of a clinical trial in which half of the patients taking the drug suffered 'psychiatric events' including hallucinations and amnesia. Revised data from the trial provided by Upjohn, the US company which makes Halcion, demonstrated a 'very high frequency' of adverse side effects, according to a report on the drug by the UK's Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The committee, which advises the Department of Health, said there was a causal link between Halcion, the world's best-selling sleeping pill, and psychiatric events. The drug was banned in the UK last October after Upjohn refused to withdraw it voluntarily. Norway, Finland, Bermuda and Argentina also withdrew the drug, while restrictions on dosing levels have been imposed in France and Spain. The final result of an appeal in the UK by Upjohn is expected imminently. The CSM report raises questions as to why an advisory panel of the US Food and Drug Administration, which had access to the revised data, recommended last week that there was no reason to withdraw Halcion. The document, obtained by Scrip, an independent London-based industry newsletter, alleges Upjohn failed to report 73 per cent of psychiatric events recorded during a clinical trial in 1972. The trial, known as Protocol 321, involved testing the drug on prisoners in the US. Such testing has since been abandoned. The original data submitted by Upjohn suggested there were 123 psychiatric events among prisoners taking the drug. However, the company admitted in revised data last year that 453 events were recorded. Upjohn said yesterday the 73 per cent under-recording was due to a transcription error. The new data were only provided by the company after defence lawyers in a US murder trial argued that Halcion was to blame for a woman killing her mother. The defendant, Mrs Ilo Grundberg, shot her mother eight times while allegedly under the influence of Halcion. She was acquitted. The FDA is still investigating alleged irregularities in procedures and reporting practices in the original data. Upjohn said yesterday it was co-operating with the review, but maintained it had not intentionally misled the regulatory agency. Upjohn said Protocol 321 had been discussed at the FDA advisory panel on May 18. The company said it stood by the evidence given at that time and by the decision of the committee. Upjohn said Halcion was safe and effective when used as recommended for short-term treatment. Halcion's worldwide sales fell by 39 per cent during the first quarter of this year. Last year Halcion accounted for Dollars 237m (Pounds 131m) of Upjohn's Dollars 3.4bn sales. Upjohn announced yesterday it was beginning a strategic review of all operations. It plans to freeze wages and stop hiring until the study is complete.</p>

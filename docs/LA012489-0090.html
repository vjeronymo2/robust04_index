			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: CHEROKEE GROUP IN SUNLAND LOSES $1.57 MILLION IN QUARTER  </P> <P> Cherokee Group, a Sunland apparel company that is in the process of going  private, said it lost $1.57 million in its fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 26.  </P> <P> Cherokee, which earned $2.28 million, or 18 cents a share, in the year-earlier  period, said the loss mostly reflected $1.9 million in pretax costs that  stemmed from the pending $174-million leveraged buyout of Cherokee by Green  Acquisition Co., an investor group that includes some top Cherokee executives.  </P> <P> Cherokee's second-quarter sales fell to $27.9 million from $33.2 million, which  the company blamed on a slowdown in the apparel industry and customer  uncertainty about the proposed takeover of the company. Cherokee said its  orders have improved in the current quarter, however.  </P> <P> For the first half of its fiscal year, Cherokee's profit tumbled to $891,000,  or 7 cents a share, from $5.23 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier.  Six-month sales climbed to $71.1 million from $68.9 million.  </P></p>

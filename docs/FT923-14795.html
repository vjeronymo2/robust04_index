			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Syndicated Loans: Borrowers search elsewhere for funds ACTIVITY in the international syndicated loans market plummeted in the first half of 1992 as borrowers scaled back their bank financing and turned to the international bond and equity markets instead for funding. Syndicated lending amounted to Dollars 163.9bn in the first six months, which is 32 per cent lower than the Dollars 241.6bn in the first half of 1991, and 44 per cent below the Dollars 291.6bn in the second half of 1991, according to figures supplied by Euromoney Publications. 'This is the quietest half-year I've ever seen,' said one loans adviser at a European bank. Syndicated lending in the US and Canada amounted to Dollars 86.9bn in the first half, against Dollars 124.2bn and Dollars 165.6bn in the first and second halves of 1991 respectively. Lending to western European borrowers also showed a marked decline to Dollars 30.9bn compared with Dollars 49.2bn and Dollars 60.3bn in the first and second halves of last year. Bankers blame the recession in the Anglo-Saxon economies for the drop in borrowing by US and European companies, as the slowdown in economic growth has depressed takeover activity and reduced investment in capital equipment. The increase in the level of pricing over the past three years has also deterred many companies from arranging large facilities simply for the sake of it. In the mid to late-1980s many companies set up Multi-Option Facilities (Mofs), attracted by their cheapness - in some cases the facilities only cost around 6 to 10 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). As these facilities approach maturity, companies seem reluctant to refinance them at today's high level of pricing. While demand from borrowers for syndicated loans has clearly fallen, the banks themselves have come under pressure to lend more prudently and place more emphasis on credit analysis. Mr Hans Meissner, executive director at Credit Suisse First Boston, says: 'Lenders have been bruised by loans which have gone wrong - just look at Maxwell, Canary Wharf, and Heron International.' While most bankers agree that 1992 has been an abysmal year so far in terms of lending volumes, a few have suggested that the decline in volume may not be quite as severe as indicated by the official figures. Some corporate borrowing is deliberately hidden from the public gaze in the form of private club deals and bilateral loans, often because the borrower does not want to be seen paying generously for its credit or risk the public humiliation of an unsuccessful deal.</p>

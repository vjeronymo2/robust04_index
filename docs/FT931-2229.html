			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Sour sound of twisted surveys: Dominic Lawson hears pro-Maastricht politicians utter the most depressing words in English WE ALL have our own ideas about what constitute the most depressing words in the English language. Sir Kingsley Amis, famously partial to a drink before lunch, once nominated the phrase 'Shall we go straight through?' As I recall, Sir Kingsley's runner up for the prize was 'Red or White, Sir?'. My nomination would have to go to the phrase 'according to a recent survey . . .' Usually this forms the introduction to the sort of article which purports to prove that breathing can give you cancer, that advertising pays, or that pigs can fly. More dangerously, it is a phrase beloved of politicians hoping to justify a policy or to defend their appalling record. A horrible example was perpetrated last week by the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, as part of his increasingly desperate attempts to persuade members of his party that they should support the government's Maastricht Bill. Hurd quoted a survey by a body calling itself the European Policy Forum - a disinterested body, I am sure - to the effect that if Britain failed to ratify the Maastricht Treaty 'the cost to our national income of . . . a policy of detachment . . . would be some Pounds 50bn over five years.' This fantastic figure was later given the highest political authority, by being quoted in a speech by the prime minister. You are probably wondering how the European Policy Forum arrived at this figure. Simple. It supposed that foreign direct investment in Britain would amount to 3 per cent of output, or Pounds 20bn a year. It further supposed that this figure would be halved if Britain pulled out of the Maastricht process. This is the truly heroic assumption, which the prime minister and the foreign secretary apparently share, and which enables them to claim that Britain would 'lose' Pounds 10bn a year, and hence Pounds 50bn over five. QED, I don't think. Not surprisingly this piece of arithmetical mumbo-jumbo failed to impress anti-Maastricht Tory MPs. So the government's faithful euro-hound, the Confederation of British Industry did its bit by circulating a brief to MPs and peers which claimed that: 'If the UK fails to ratify the Maastricht Treaty and is perceived to be part of a second tier in a two speed Europe, this would have a negative effect on half the (foreign) investors'. It later turned out that of the 16 foreign companies questioned by the CBI, only one said categorically that a failure to ratify Maastricht would have a serious impact on its investment in Britain. According to the Sunday Telegraph, one of the companies, a Japanese car maker, was typical of the general tone, saying: 'Disinvestment is unthinkable regardless of the political situation. We have made a commitment to the UK and disinvestment will not happen, no matter what.' Possibly that response contains an element of diplomatic exaggeration, but is it not odd that Major and Hurd did not give this part of the survey the publicity they gave to the more negative aspects? They are always complaining about those who knock Britain. Yet here was a Japanese company prepared to say it would invest in Britain regardless of Maastricht, and the government attempts to suppress the good news. The truth is that politicians use only those survey answers which suit their political objectives. That is why the government will not wish to draw attention to another, heartening, survey, which was reported in the FT on Monday. KPMG Peat Marwick Consultants interviewed 50 EC banks, and found that most assume that Britain will be in the slow lane, and that monetary union will take place with an inner core of Germany, France, and the Benelux countries. Bad news for Britain? Not a bit of it, say the banks, who 'anticipate a trend towards centralised currency trading in London in the aftermath of union, irrespective of whether or not Britain rejoins the EMS.' Why does the government keep twisting surveys to prove that Britain will become an economic pariah, if it does not ratify Maastricht? The answer is, because it has no positive reasons for wanting the treaty. So it is left only with negative ones, which amount to no more than handwringing and bedwetting. It does not take a survey to see that. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

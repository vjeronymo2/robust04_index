			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Third world 'faces neglect from industrial nations' DEVELOPING countries face a 'period of neglect' from the industrial north when trade and protectionism will be more important than aid or debt relief in shaping growth, Sir Peter Leslie, Commonwealth Development Corporation chairman, said yesterday, David Dodwell, World Trade Editor, reports. Presenting the annual report of the CDC, the UK government-controlled organisation channelling aid into private-sector projects in developing countries, Sir Peter said funds were flowing less freely to the third world now than in the 1970s and 1980s. Political and economic reform was the key to attracting investment, with good governance and an end to corruption important preconditions for aid. He noted the 'progressive disappearance' of British private investors in countries where the CDC operates, and warned the protectionist consequences of a failure of the Uruguay Round trade talks would have 'serious repercussions' on many of the 68 countries where the CDC has operations. New investment in 105 projects reached a record Pounds 157.3m in 1991, up from Pounds 145.9m in 1990, with less than 45 per cent provided from the UK government's aid programme. The majority (about Pounds 87m) came from profits earned on past CDC investments, lifting to Pounds 1.33bn total CDC investments and third world commitments. CDC income from investments rose to Pounds 86.9m, from Pounds 83.1m in 1990, leading to an operating surplus of Pounds 69.9m, up from Pounds 67.2m. Extraordinary profits of Pounds 22.3m from the sale of long-standing investments in Thailand and Singapore lifted the surplus transferred to reserves to Pounds 28.4m, almost four times the 1990 transfer of Pounds 7.7m. An extraordinary gain of Pounds 45m will be reported next year, following the sale in April of its shareholding in a Hong Kong container terminal.</p>

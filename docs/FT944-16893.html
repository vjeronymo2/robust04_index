			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: JP Morgan offers free use of its toolbox - Bank's decision to open up its risk measurement system The decision by J. P. Morgan to offer its Risk-Metrics financial risk measurement system free of charge prompts an obvious question. Why is one of the world's most powerful investment banks choosing not to charge for a service which has cost it millions of dollars to develop? There are two basic answers. First, the move must be viewed against the background of the debate over the regulation of derivatives, which has intensified as a result of a string of recent losses. Investors and corporate treasurers have become more frequent users of derivative products but are increasingly aware of the risks of financial loss. Over the past 12 months losses related to derivatives - incurred by companies such as Metallgesellschaft and Kashima Oil - have amounted to more than Dollars 6bn, according to one recent estimate. The use of a consistent measure to calculate market risk over a defined time horizon was among the leading recommendations of a study in 1993 by the so-called 'Group of 30', headed by Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of J. P. Morgan. Sir Dennis said yesterday the system 'will benefit the market if we can add transparency. If we didn't do something the risks of accidents were greater. By establishing a benchmark for genuinely useful risk management it could improve the market overall.' The widespread use of so-called 'mark-to-market valuation' techniques has made participants in the financial markets more aware of what were previously 'unseen market risks'. 'RiskMetrics will promote greater transparency of risks, which is a key to identifying potential problems,' adds Mr Till Guldimann, head of global research at J. P. Morgan. Second, J. P. Morgan must also be hoping the association of its name with what it hopes will become a widely accepted benchmark will yield longer-term commercial advantages, partly through strengthening ties with existing customers. The bank plays down the proprietary character of the information it is offering, arguing, for example, there is nothing new in the algorithms or mathematics deployed in the RiskMetrics system. But it concedes the development of 'common numbers and a common framework' will increase its dialogue with customers about risk management, presumably encouraging the more effective use of derivative products. Certainly those of its customers at its Budapest 'client meeting' last weekend, where the RiskMetrics system was announced, were keen on the new systems. 'The information you could get before was simply unreliable,' said Mr Miguel Escrig, a director of Banco Santander, one of Spain's largest banks. Mr Escrig pointed to information on both the volatility of financial instruments and on the correlation between the performance of various classes of assets as being 'either inadequate or simply not available'. Predicting that the service would be particularly useful for medium-sized investors, he added: 'Some banks offer this as a consultancy service but it is a big project and it can be expensive.' The system will not completely prevent loss, a fact underlined just two years ago when - in an otherwise highly profitable year - Morgan lost up to Dollars 150m in mortgage-backed bond trading. Nevertheless, Mr Jacques Longerstaey, head of market risk research, said firms could now 'concentrate on building good risk management systems rather than occupying themselves with collecting data, much of it hard to find'. Sir Dennis insists that Morgan is offering a 'tool box' rather than its black box. 'The information will help but companies will still need to make their own judgments,' he says.</p>

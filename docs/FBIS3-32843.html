Peace Commission President Hector Rosada Granados confirmed  that Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez Morales  informed him of his decision to seek new mechanisms to  participate in the peace process. In that sense, he said that he  plans to carry out a number of military changes within the  government Peace Commission. He added that a consensus is being  sought to determine who will replace Generals Marco Antonio  Gonzalez Taracena, Victor Manuel Ventura Arellano, and Victor  Manuel Argueta Villalta.    Rosada Granados said he is getting ready for discussions on  human rights with the URNG and is preparing with information  from human rights representatives at the Archbishop's Office,  the Presidential Commission, and Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge  Mario Garcia, with whom he will arrange a meeting.  <H5>  Former Guerrilla Commander Offers To Cooperate in Process </H5>   It was also reported that former guerrilla commander Cesar  Montes or Macias on various occasions has expressed his  willingness to cooperate with the peace process, particularly  with the demobilization of rebel troops.    Rosada Granados said that although he has talked with the  former rebel commander on several occasions, he has never  expressed his desire to seek amnesty or safe-conduct that would  enable him to join society. In any event, he added, if he wanted  to return to legal life, Montes or Macias would be protected by  the amnesty program implemented in 1986 and 1988.</p>

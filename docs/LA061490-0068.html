			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DURENBERGER APOLOGIZES, ENDS ETHICS HEARING  </P> <P> Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.) apologized to his colleagues Wednesday for  alleged financial misconduct and abruptly brought to a close an unusual public  hearing of the Senate Ethics Committee by waiving his right to call or  cross-examine witnesses.  </P> <P> Durenberger said he regretted what he characterized as honest mistakes in his  financial affairs and asked committee members for sympathetic treatment as they  consider possible sanctions for alleged violations of Senate ethics rules.  </P> <P> "My life and reputation are at stake," said the embattled lawmaker, speaking  carefully in a soft voice from a statement that took an hour to read.  </P> <P> "I hope that you will consider the whole person of Dave Durenberger, what I did  wrong and what I've done right for this institution," he said. "I hope you will  compare that with your own experience of life in this body."  </P> <P> Durenberger insisted that "in my heart" there was no intent to break Senate  ethics rules by allegedly evading limits on speech honorariums and claiming  rent reimbursements for a condominium he partly owned.  </P> <P> Although saying that he accepted "full responsibility" for any violations, he  urged the committee not to follow the recommendation of special counsel Robert  S. Bennett to publicly denounce him -- the most severe sanction available short  of outright expulsion.  </P> <P> The rare public hearing before the Ethics Committee, the first such session in  nine years, had been expected to last as long as two weeks. But Durenberger's  decision to waive his right to call witnesses ended the hearing after only two  days.  </P> <P> Durenberger's attorney, James Hamilton, said his client had opted to put the  complex inquiry before the committee for judgment based on the voluminous  written record compiled over more than a year of investigation.  </P> <P> Committee Chairman Howell Heflin (D-Ala.), a former judge, noted that, by  waiving further public proceedings, Durenberger would avoid the ordeal of  cross-examination by Bennett and committee members. The hearing was adjourned  and the 32 committee witnesses and 25 defense witnesses who had been subpoenaed  to testify were told that they could go home.  </P> <P> Bennett is required to submit a final report to the committee. He said he would  try to complete it within two weeks. Hamilton is entitled to submit a final  brief in defense of Durenberger. The panel then will prepare its final report,  which will recommend to the full Senate whether Durenberger should be  exonerated, reprimanded, denounced, censured or expelled.  </P> <P> In his statement Wednesday, Durenberger repeated his contention that he had  acted "in good faith" in his financial affairs and pleaded for compassion and  understanding from the quasi-judicial committee.  </P> <P> "I believe, because I know you, that each of you will combine both good  judgment and compassion in your decision," Durenberger told the six-member  panel, of which he was once a member.  </P> <P> "To the extent my actions, inactions or failure to perceive the consequences of  my actions have in any way reflected poorly on the Senate as an institution, or  been uncomfortable or distressful to you as persons, I am sincerely sorry."  </P> <P> Durenberger drew heavily on personal experience in his appeal. He described his  upbringing in a Benedictine community in Minnesota, where he was the child of  an academic family, and spoke of his struggle to raise four sons after his  first wife's early death from cancer.  </P> <P> He said he is determined to make amends for the ethics scandal by continuing to  serve as an effective senator until his six-year term ends in 1994. Later,  speaking to reporters, he firmly rejected any suggestion that he resign.  </P> <P> Durenberger repeatedly stressed to the committee that any improper actions were  undertaken "on the advice of outside, independent attorneys." He said: "I have  never sold my vote or improperly used my influence with a federal agency for my  personal gain."  </P> <P> He acknowledged having made mistakes in his dealings with a book company that  paid him $100,000 over two years from fees collected from speaking engagements,  an arrangement characterized by Bennett as a "clearly . . . unethical" evasion  of rules limiting honorarium income.  </P> <P> Durenberger said he never attempted to hide the complex arrangements by which  he sought to maximize income at a time of personal financial difficulty.  </P> <P> "All these matters were done in the open and disclosed," he said. "There has  been no obfuscation or cover-up. Would anyone in their right mind cook up a  scheme to evade the Senate rules with an organization called Piranha Press?"  </P> <P> Durenberger suggested that the Senate's ethics standards have been changing  rapidly -- so much so that it has become virtually impossible for a  "citizen-politician" who does not have substantial private income to make ends  meet under present rules.  </P> <P> "I needn't remind the six of you in particular that the U.S. Senate is no  longer the place to which America brings its poor, its tired, its hungry masses  to represent people like them and the rest of our country," he said. "While the  pride of our democracy is still the citizen nature of our Legislature, we've  made it awfully difficult for ordinary folks to be represented here by people  just like them."  </P> <P> The accusations against Durenberger were the first to be presented in public  hearings before the Ethics Committee since 1981, when Sen. Harrison A. Williams  Jr. (D-N.J.) was investigated for his role in the Abscam bribery scandal.  Williams resigned after the committee recommended his expulsion from the  Senate.  </P></p>

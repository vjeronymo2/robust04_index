			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Maxwell saga enters new phase: How the investigations may develop THE ARREST and charging of Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell this week - together with Mr Larry Trachtenberg, the US businessman who was one of their investment strategists - propels the Maxwell investigation into a new phase. Media reporting about the Maxwell brothers and Mr Trachtenberg is now restricted by the rules of contempt of court. The recent flood of 'signature' stories - about who allegedly signed which documents and when - had started piecing together a public explanation of how the money may have vanished. The flood will now largely stop. But the investigation by the administrators of Robert Maxwell's collapsed business empire and by the provisional liquidators of the raided pension funds continues, and so will the accompanying civil cases in the courts over the ownership of the assets of the Maxwell empire. Several pressing questions remain to be answered. First, how much can be recovered for the pensioners? The Maxwell pension funds should have been worth more than Pounds 670m. Instead, Pounds 448m of the assets are missing. Some cash is now in the hands of the banks. The tussle between banks and pensioners will be one of the focuses of civil actions that will occupy the next few years. Meanwhile, MPs from both sides of the Commons have declared that the banks have a 'moral responsibility' to return some of the money. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, announced last week a government trust to solicit contributions for the Maxwell pensioners. Mr Lilley suggested that financial institutions might feel they had some responsibility to recompense Maxwell pensioners. The trust arose out of the intense public pressure of the past two weeks, both from the press and from the recent pensioners' march on the Commons. Its aims may well be too optimistic; financial institutions have reacted with indignation, saying they are not responsible for the alleged fraud. The issue will be systematically and probably more effectively tackled in the courts, but that will take years. Until the response of the banks is clearer, the government has allocated just Pounds 2.5m as an emergency fund for the Maxwell pensioners. There will also be civil actions against individuals. Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm appointed to try to recover pension money, already has actions for recovery of assets against both Maxwell brothers. The second main question awaiting an answer concerns the mysterious overseas Swiss, Gibraltar and Liechtenstein trusts set up by Maxwell. Up to this point, investigators' have been rebuffed by laws of confidentiality of those countries. But those trusts, which are the ultimate owners of some of his companies, also handled hundreds of millions of pounds of cash in the last year of Maxwell's life, flowing in and out of his more accessible UK and US companies. So far, the investigators have not found evidence of a hidden Maxwell pot of gold that would offer some comfort to the creditors and pensioners' difficulties. If there is one, though, it lies in some of those trusts. Last week saw a second, unexpected response to press and public pressure: the first press conference by Dr Werner Keicher, director of the secretive Liechtenstein-based Maxwell Foundation, which is one of the owners of the Maxwell corporate empire. Dr Keicher indicated that he was willing to co-operate with UK investigators in establishing whether money could be retrieved for victims of the Maxwell fraud. Attention is also likely to turn to the question of whether the professional firms involved - auditors, actuaries, merchant banks, stockbrokers - fulfilled their responsibilities. Similar questions can  - and will - be directed against Imro, the fund management watchdog, which had the responsibility for licensing and supervising the Maxwell pension management companies. The alleged offences in the charges made against the Maxwell brothers and Mr Trachtenberg occurred between November 1990 and December 1991, five weeks after Robert Maxwell's death. The questions that may be directed to professional firms are likely to cover whether they should have detected worrying patterns of behaviour as far back as 1989. Robson Rhodes has said that in its view some of the pension funds' trading may have been highly irregular from that date. Robert Maxwell's last will and testament left more than Pounds 2m to his family and friends, with the rest of his personal estate going to a variety of causes. It is expected to go to probate. Once that happens, it will be in the public domain and will form part of the assets to which the various creditors have claims.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Iberia tries to avert strikes as financial crisis grows Management of Iberia, the Spanish state-owned airline, will meet unions today and tomorrow in a final effort to avert strikes planned for next month at the financially crippled flag-carrier. Iberia is seeking to become viable through drastic cost-cutting and by an injection of public funds. The airline wants to cut salaries by an average of 15 per cent over the next two years and the Madrid government is to ask the European Union to permit the injection of at least Pta125bn (Pounds 615m) in new capital. Iberia said yesterday that unless agreement was obtained over the salary cuts and the capital injection, the airline would be technically bankrupt by spring. Unions have nevertheless called strikes over a separate issue linked to Iberia's refusal to make up back pay that is due at the end of this month under the terms of a salary agreement dating back to August last year. Twenty-four hour strikes are scheduled for November 3 and 11. Iberia is on course to lose Pta44bn this year. The salary reductions, along with additional measures, including shedding 2,120 jobs from the 24,456 labour force, seek to save Pta32.3bn. The the back-pay agreement, which Iberia says it is in no position to honour, represents an additional cost of Pta17bn. In an effort to stem its losses, Iberia has renegotiated with Airbus, the European aircraft manufacturing consortium, the Pta109bn purchase of eight A-340 long-range aircraft which were due for delivery over the next three years. Under a recent agreement Iberia will lease four of the aircraft and will delay the acquisition of the other four. The airline is now negotiating the cancellation of a second contract, worth Pta69bn, involving the acquisition of eight A-321 aircraft, a smaller, short-range Airbus. 'We can't buy them because we can't pay for them; it is as simple as that,' an Iberia spokesman said. Iberia says that unless it has first managed radically to overhaul its spending, the government will be unable to negotiate new funds for the airline in Brussels. The company was last recapitalised by INI, the public-sector holding company, in 1992 when Brussels authorised subsidies totalling Pta120bn on condition that no more public money be made available until 1996. The company's losses over the past four years, which have in part been linked to an ambitious airline investment programme in Latin America, have effectively wiped out the 1992 capital injection.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Microsoft to focus on software over support MICROSOFT, the world's big-gest personal computer software supplier, has taken a strategically critical decision to remain a developer of technically advanced software, rather than diversify into support services. The decision will reassure investors concerned that the company's profitability could have been damaged by an excursion into a complex area where Microsoft has little expertise. It will also open the likelihood of the growth of a new computing sector providing third party services to Microsoft's large corporate customers. Microsoft will in future rely on alliances forged with distributors, dealers and consultancies to provide support and services to its large customers. In the UK, for example, it might rely on computing services companies like Hoskyns or ACT to support large customers in the finance sector. Yesterday, in the first of a series of measures paving the way for these new relationships, Microsoft announced that from July 1 it was abandoning suggested retail prices for its software products in Europe while standardising terms and conditions to enable customers to sign pan-European contracts more easily. Microsoft's profits before tax at the nine-month mark in April this year were Dollars 688m on sales of Dollars 2.71bn. The company competes in most areas of the PC software market, but its success is chiefly due to the MS/DOS and Windows operating systems, which are standard on virtually all IBM-style personal computers. This year it announced a new operating system called Windows NT designed to run on networks of PCs rather than stand-alone systems. Corporate customers are increasingly developing PC networks for new applications, arguing they are less expensive than mainframe computers. Windows NT, however, is a large piece of software, bigger than some mainframe operating systems, and it requires the kind of support typically provided by large computer companies like IBM or Digital Equipment. According to Mr John Leftwich, director of marketing for Microsoft in the UK, the decision to abandon suggested retail prices is unlikely to result in price changes for customers. Most software packages are already heavily discounted by dealers and retailers. There was now little difference between the cost of Microsoft software in Europe and the US, he said. English-language software typically cost 10-20 per cent more in Europe than in the US. Software translated into local languages cost about 60 per cent more than the US equivalent.</p>

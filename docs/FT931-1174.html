			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / CGIP eyes packaging stake CGIP, the French holding company, yesterday confirmed that it is in negotiations as part of a consortium of investors to acquire a 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the packaging company, from MB-Caradon, the UK building products group. MB-Caradon announced last month that it planned to sell its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox. The stake, which dates back to the merger of Metalbox Packaging and Carnaud in 1989, earns a poor return for MB-Caradon, bringing in a dividend of Pounds 7.8m in 1991. CGIP, also a 25.3 per cent shareholder in the packaging company, has rights of first refusal over the MB-Caradon shares. The MB-Caradon stake, worth around FFr4.8bn (Pounds 600m) at the current market price, would be too expensive for CGIP to buy intact, given that the latter only has FFr700m of cash in its balance sheet. CGIP is also constrained by a recent ruling by the French stock market authorities that it must mount a full bid for CarnaudMetalbox if it raised its current holding by more than 7 per cent. CGIP said yesterday that it planned to bid for the stake together with 'a number of other investors'. It confirmed that those investors included Mr Albert Frere and Mr Paul Desmarais, two businessmen. However, CGIP declined to comment on a report that Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled banks, were also involved in its bid. CGIP also refused to verify La Tribune's report that it planned to offer FFr190 a share, which would value the MB-Caradon stake at FFr3.9bn. This compares with CarnaudMetalbox's current share price, which closed down FFr15 at FFr221 yesterday. CGIP said it was still in negotiations with MB-Caradon and had not yet finalised its offer. A number of other companies have already expressed an interest in the stake, including Pechiney, the French state-controlled aluminium group which is a major player in packaging. Pechiney has said it would be prepared to buy shares in CarnaudMetalbox to prevent a competitor investing in the company.</p>

With Bosnian  Serbs retracting a previous offer to give the Moslems a third of  the former Yugoslav republic in an ethnic carveup, peace  mediators held out little hope for progress here.    "There is no particular reason for optimism," conference  spokesman John Mills said after the European Community and  United Nations mediators held separate talks with the warring  Serbs, Croats and Moslems.    The talks coincided with further fighting in Bosnia and  continuing hand-wringing in the West over its Yugoslavia policy.  [passage omitted]    In the peace negotiations, which resumed here after being  broken off on December 23 in Brussels, Moslems and Serbs accused  each other of rejecting the EC peace plan for the ethnic  division of their country. [passage omitted]    Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic called the Serb  proposal unacceptable and [Bosnia-Herzegovina Ambassador to the  UN] Sacirbey accused the Serbs of bad faith as they "have still  not accepted the concept of a viable territory" for a future  Moslem republic. [passage omitted]    Sacirbey said the Bosnian delegation had presented the  Croats  with new proposals concerning the Adriatic port of Neum, the  southern city of Mostar and central Bosnia, but there were no  details.

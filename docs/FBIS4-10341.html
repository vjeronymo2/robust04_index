			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar has announced a  series of measures to prevent the illegal entry of foreigners  into Honduras. These measures range from heavy sanctions  against airlines that repeatedly transport them to the  punishment of officials involved in the trafficking of illegal  aliens.    These measures result from reports an international mafia  operating from Honduras is involved in the trafficking of  illegal aliens to the United States.    "The government's intention is to clean up public  administration and whatever is associated with the Foreign  Ministry in line with its fight against corruption in all  fields," the minister has said.    According to the minister, there are names of people,  including former officials, who are involved in this business.  "Irregularities have been detected in the Honduran consulates in  Hong Kong and Panama," the minister said.    "Both consulates are under investigation, and the  responsible  officials will, naturally, be punished," Paz has said.    He has said the name of a former Foreign Ministry senior  officer from the previous administration was being used for  illegal procedures. "The former officer is aware of this, and  we are investigating the matter."    Paz has charged certain attorneys, whom he did not identify,  handle the documentation of illegal aliens who arrive in the  country.    On the other hand, the minister considers it unfair the  United States should take steps against the new Honduran  Government for cases that were not resolved during previous  administrations.    Paz believes most of the claims show delays in the  application of justice, "something which is linked to the  general problem afflicting the Judicial Branch, which many  believe should be brought up to professional standards to allow  Honduras to offer legal security to foreign investors."    Meanwhile, the minister expressed pride over Honduras'  diplomatic victory as a virtual nonpermanent UN member.    "This would be a resounding success for Honduran diplomacy,"  he expressed with satisfaction.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson There was something comically predictable about yesterday's talk in the London market of a bid from Hanson. The assumption was that because Hanson has failed to get anywhere with ICI, it is bent on making the same mistake with a fresh target. The idea of a bid for BP may have been regarded as slightly far-fetched. But there was plenty of enthusiasm for Blue Circle, English China Clays, Allied-Lyons and Cadbury Schweppes. One wonders why the market was not equally excited by BTR's sale of its stake in Pilkington. Why should Hanson not now bid for Pilkington and BTR for ICI? This is not to dismiss the possibility of Hanson making a purchase which would count as big by normal standards. Rumours of its interest in German cranes or French cement would be consistent with the picture of a group seeking to strengthen its portfolio through agreed deals. But Hanson is in transition, with different and slightly confusing signals coming from the new management and the old, from the UK and the US. Perhaps the best that can be said is that its range of preferred industries seems to be shrinking rather than expanding, and that in today's markets it seems unlikely to pay the premium required for control in a bid battle.</p>

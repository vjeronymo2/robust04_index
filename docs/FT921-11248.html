			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Expatriates and the EC I WORK at Nato, and meet no UK income tax payment criteria. I am UK resident, and my salary is paid in the UK. I am negotiating an extension of my contract. Such negotiations may be subject to income tax changes brought about by the single European market. Working outside the UK may no longer be considered to be a tax advantage. To get an idea of the way the wind is blowing, you may like to write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Office, Somerset House, Strand, London, UK, WC2R 1LB, for copies of the following press releases: (December 4) Ordinary residence in the UK - statement of practice; (Dec 4) Individual residence in - the UK - extrastatutory concessions; (Dec 6) Foreign-earnings deduction - visits to the UK. You must draw your own inferences from these straws in the wind. One should never let one's life be dictated by taxation, so our basic comment must be that you should decide what you would like to do, and accept whatever tax price your chosen path carries. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (7): Era of pint-sized wonder cars - Microcars / Stuart Marshall wonders if, in 10 years' time, these three-metre-long microcars may be the only ones allowed in city centres IMAGINE cars which are just five inches longer than a Rover Mini but accommodate four adults, sitting upright, with their heads clear of the roof, and which also have adequate luggage space. Impossible? But such cars do exist. No-one would ever call them good-looking. But one might pat them on their bonnets. Under them live engines of less than 660 cc capacity, with four or even five valves per cylinder, fuel injection and often turbocharging and intercooling. Driven sensibly, they burn about one gallon (4.5 litres) of unleaded petrol every 60 miles (96 km). Use them in town and they are as gentle and featherlight to drive and park as the best of shopping cars. But flick the five-speed gearshift around freely, let the engine howl up to high revolutions (tachometers are red-lined at about 8,000 rpm) and the hot ones go like the Mini Cooper 1275S of blessed memory. At least, they do until you reach about 80 mph/130 kmh. Then a governor cuts out the fuel injection. Visibility is panoramic. You can hardly see their bonnets and the rear screens are like picture windows. A driver more than 6ft (183 cm) can settle comfortably behind the steering wheel. In the back, providing the seat in front is not occupied by someone equally long in the leg, his head will be nowhere near the roof. You need space for two sets of golf clubs in their trolleys? Just fold the rear seat flat and there is ample room to get them in without a struggle. Typical of these pint-sized wonder cars are the Dangan ZZ, top model in the Mitsubishi Minica range of microcars, and the Daihatsu Mira Turbo TRXX Avanzato. If you think they sound like perfect second cars - nimble and economical, as entertaining as they are effortless to drive - you are right. The Dangan (bullet in Japanese) ZZ and the Avanzato are just two top performing models among scores of different microcars, of which about 1m are sold in Japan each year. By law, all have engines of under 660 cc. They cost from about Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 7,000, depending on specification and how much optional equipment is fitted. The snag is you have to live in Japan to get one because - officially - they are not sold anywhere else. That situation could change. The gentlemen's agreement limiting Japanese car imports into Britain to 11 per cent of total registrations will not survive indefinitely. British production of Japanese cars like the Nissan Primera (soon to be joined by the Micra), Honda Concerto (soon also the Syncro) and, from December, Toyota Carina must change the picture. And in any case, these engaging microcars can already be brought in as personal imports through Jersey, in the Channel Islands, though not at Japanese home-market prices. Mr Clive de Carle of Rare Imports (0734 713244) has the details. Traditionally, about 60 per cent of all microcars have been bought by women. Recently, though, young Japanese males have begun to take an interest as high-performers become available. It is easy to see why. Their tiny catalyser equipped, three-cylinder turbocharged and intercooled engine puts out a lusty 63 or so horsepower. They are mechanical jewels; the kind of things top Swiss watchmakers might produce if asked to diversify into cars. Whether one is making them pull quite hard in fifth gear, or urging them up to a joyous 7,000-plus rpm, one would never suspect they had only three cylinders. They run with the smoothness of an electric motor. Microcars may form a sub-class in Japan but it is 'sub' only in size, not sophistication. Standard options include manual or automatic transmission, both with four-wheel drive if required. Power steering, central locking, cabriolet bodies, air conditioning and remotely controlled CD players are all available. Some even have lights and screenwipers that are turned on automatically when it gets dark or starts to rain. At Tokyo Motor Show last year, many were on display. Honda, for example, had a sweet little three-door, three-cylinder hatchback called the Today, looking like a shrunken, but still nicely proportioned, Honda Civic. More spectacular is the two-seat Honda Beat, mid-engined and rear-wheel driven, with a lift-off roof. Like the front-wheel drive Daihatsu Leeza soft top, the Beat will not go much faster than 80 mph (130 kmh). But who cares? They give you the fun of a Ferrari at a fraction of the price. Mazda's baby is called Carol and can be front or four-wheel driven. Its bigger brother, the 121, has been available in Britain for some time. This Rover Metro-sized four-door saloon is almost 5ft (150 cm) high which means there is more headroom, especially in the back, than you would find in a much larger European car. With automatic transmission only, its UK price is Pounds 8,350. Subaru's Rex microcar can be had with four doors, four-wheel drive, manual or automatic transmission and a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. And one of the most ingenious town cars of all is the Suzuki Alto, with sliding doors on each side and a seat that swivels 90 degrees so the driver can step straight out on the pavement. At the moment, the European motor industry has nothing to compare with the Japanese microcars for size (except the 30-year-old Mini and the new Fiat Cinquecento) and nothing that comes within light years of matching their sheer sophistication. But in 10 years' time these three-metre-long microcars may be the only ones allowed in city centres. So one hopes someone is paying attention. Otherwise, the Japanese carmakers will clean up - once again.</p>

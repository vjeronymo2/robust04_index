			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SECOND SUSPECT IN SHOOTING AT POINT LOMA CLUB SURRENDERS  </P> <P> A former Navy man wanted in the fatal shooting of a 20-year-old woman at a  Point Loma nightclub surrendered to police Tuesday, authorities said.  </P> <P> Willie J. Pitts, 22, of San Diego, had notified police he would be turning  himself in before arriving at police headquarters Tuesday afternoon accompanied  by his attorney, police spokesman Lt. Dan Berglund said.  </P> <P> "He's being processed, and he'll be charged with murder and assault with a  deadly weapon," Berglund said.  </P> <P> On Monday, police arrested another man in connection with the drive-by shooting  at Rasputin's Disco and Nightclub that left one person dead and three others  wounded.  </P> <P> Petty Officer 3rd Class Patrick Daniel Wallace, 24, was in custody on a murder  charge. A .41-caliber magnum revolver used in the shooting early Sunday morning  has not been recovered, Berglund said.  </P> <P> Pitts and Wallace, who is stationed in San Diego, reportedly were kicked out of  the after-hours dance club twice for causing a disturbance. About 45 minutes  after their last ejection, the two allegedly returned in a car and opened fire  on the club's security personnel in retaliation.  </P> <P> None of the staff was hit, but shots then were fired through a stained-glass  window at the rear of the club.  </P> <P> Tanya Elise Shaw, who was standing inside the club, was struck twice, once in  the head, and died several hours later at UC San Diego Medical Center. She was  a native of Buffalo, N.Y., and a data-processing seaman stationed at the San  Diego Naval Training Center for the past four months.  </P> <P> Three others were injured.  </P> <P> Petty Officer 2nd Class Jerome Wood, 21, a native of Bristol, Pa., and an  electrician's mate at the Naval Training Center, was wounded in the neck. He  was treated and released from the same hospital.  </P> <P> Two people who were standing with Shaw and Wood in the dance club received  minor wounds, police said. Their names have not been released.  </P></p>

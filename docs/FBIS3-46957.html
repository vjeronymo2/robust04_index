Gen. Bernard Sandoz, chief Swiss member on the Neutral Nations  Supervisory Commission (NNSC), said Friday [7 January].    "There is danger of pushing North Korea and having something  that no one wants to have," he said in an exclusive interview  with YONHAP. "Be patient," Sandoz, asked about prospects of  Korean reunification, told YONHAP reporters at the Swiss Club  inside the truce village of Panmunjom.    "It is not in the interest of South Korea, China, Japan or  the United States to have collapse of North Korea," he said,  warning of tremendous repercussions. While hailing the progress  in Pyongyang-Washington dialogue in solving the nuclear  situation, the major general noted that North Korea basically  has "no confidence in Americans."    North Korea claims it has come close to meeting U.S. terms  only to see Washington move away by attaching more conditions to  better relations, and so North Korea is demanding a package deal  to resolve the nuclear question, he said.    "Yongbyon is the only card in their (North Korean) game," he  said, referring to the site of suspected nuclear facilities  involved in secretive arms development. U.S. concern for peace  and stability in Northeast Asia is well understood, Sandoz said.    "It's important for North Korea to have something where they  know they will not be cheated."    The 58-year-old general, a diplomat by profession, has been  at his post since August 1990 and witnessed changes in  inter-Korean relations and the status of the commission,  established in 1953 at the end of a three-year Korean war to  oversee the Armistice Agreement. All official contact between  North Korea and the NNSC was broken off in May 1991 by  Pyongyang, a result of North Korea's protest against the  appointment of the first South Korean chief of the Military  Armistice Commission in March that year.    "It's very frustrating to be here and not be able to fulfill  the mission completely because of the boycott," he told YONHAP.  He said they had to accept other channels of dialogue such as  the ongoing working-level talks between North Korea and the  United States in New York.    Despite North Korea's insistence on dissolving the NNSC,  Sandoz said, the commission will stay until the Armistice  Agreement is replaced by a peace treaty.    The Armistice Agreement is the only legal base, he said, and  the NNSC is part of this legal base.    "We will stay until both sides (South and North Korea) agree  we should leave," he said. "This is the official position of the  NNSC and members' governments."</p>

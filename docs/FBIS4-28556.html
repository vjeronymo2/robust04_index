			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  opened two days of vice-ministerial bilateral talks Friday [10  June] on further opening Japan's auto and auto parts markets.    Auto and auto parts are at the center of ongoing bilateral  talks on a new trade framework through which Washington aims to  pry open Japan's markets to rectify the chronic bilateral trade  imbalance.    U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade  Jeffrey Garten is leading the U.S. negotiating team, while  Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister of international trade and  industry for international affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy  foreign minister for economic affairs, are representing the  Japanese side.    The negotiations follow working-level talks held in  Washington last week when the two sides failed to iron out  differences over "quantitative criteria" demanded by the U.S. as  a way to measure progress in opening markets.    Japanese negotiators say the U.S. is not seeking binding  targets, but it is still looking for quantitative standards on  the number of dealers handling imported autos, and the import  volume of autos and auto parts. They say Tokyo cannot accept  any request that would bind any future action.    The U.S. first demanded "numerical targets" to measure  progress in market access, but dropped the demands to revive the  framework talks which had been stalled since February when then  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton  failed to reach any market-opening agreements.</p>

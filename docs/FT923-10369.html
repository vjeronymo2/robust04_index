			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Stalingrad falls to onward march of capitalism: Leyla Boulton accompanies western experts advising on privatisation as they enter Stalin's hero city THE FORMER Stalingrad, site of the heroic Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, has been chosen as the focus for a new attempt to build 'capitalism in one city'. It kicked off when a team of well-heeled executives from the Washington-based International Finance Corporation (IFC) flew in by private jet on Wednesday to sign a deal to advise on the privatisation of small businesses in what is now called Volgograd. Four months after turning the town of Nizhny-Novgorod into a showcase for successful privatisation, the World Bank's private investment arm is pursuing what its chief executive, Sir William Ryrie, calls a trend-setting exercise, but this time on a more ambitious scale. The aim is to auction some 600 shops, 350 restaurants and 270 service outlets in Volgograd and the surrounding region. The IFC is not touching the area's ailing industrial giants for now, since eastern European experience shows that this sort of activity is much slower to produce positive results. On the surface, life in the 'hero city' has already changed considerably in the past 18 months. Underlining the demise of communist rule since the abortive coup last August, Mr Ivan Shabunin, the regional governor, has taken over the best office in the local government building from the ex-Communist party boss, who is himself reported to have joined a private company by the name of 'Tsaritsa'. Mr Albert Orlov, the previous administration chief who closed down private tomato hothouses, has also gone into business. One of the first regions to promote private farming, Volgograd now has more than 3,000 new farmers and cheap credit is still available to help newcomers, thanks to generous state subsidies, according to Ms Lyudmilla Tatokhina, chairman of the local agricultural bank. But apart from that, the little privatisation that has taken place so far has been messy and unpopular and Volgograd will need all the help it can get from its IFC advisers. 'First they have to explain what privatisation is,' said Ms Elena Bocharova, a 56-year-old accountant. 'I understand privatisation if my apartment becomes mine, but the rest I don't have a clue about.' The employees at Nevesta (Bride), a dressmaker's shop which was sold for Rbs10m at Volgograd's first auction of small state businesses, have been kept in the dark about the new owners' plans for two months. 'We've got magic hands but we can't earn money to pay ourselves because our customers think that privatisation means we've stopped making dresses,' complained a depressed employee. IFC officials suggested the uncertainty at Nevesta was the sort of problem they could help avoid in future - by switching to a system of selling physical assets without liabilities rather than privatising going concerns. But this approach risks attracting popular anger because workers are laid off before a sale goes ahead, leaving it up to the new owner to decide whether to rehire them. Another big problem, admits Mr Yuri Chekhov, the city's mayor, is 'nomenclatura privatisation' whereby privileged officials acquire or sell state property by crooked means. He has already fired one of his own deputies for such practices. 'Any good idea we get from the west turns into a deformed monster in Russia,' said Ms Julia Sablina, a young journalist who is trying to set up her own business. 'So it will be good if the foreigners can control how privatisation is conducted here.' Anti-western graffiti proclaiming Russia to be 'the 51st state of the USA' suggest that not all Volgograders share her enthusiasm. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the Russian privatisation minister, said yesterday that vouchers entitling all citizens to acquire an unspecified amount of privatised property free of charge would soon be ready for distribution. The IFC published a manual on privatisation for local officials.</p>

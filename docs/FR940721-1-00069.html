			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One of the Federal agencies commenting on the rule, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), suggested that separate review standards for preemption determinations were unnecessary and that HUD could employ a case-by-case analysis, using the review method outlined in &sect;3500.13(c) of the final rule. (OTS submitted comments critical of the final rule on the referral fee and CLO issues.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Positions Taken by Supporters of the Preemption Provisions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As in the case of commenters critical of the final rule, supporters of the rule commented less frequently on the preemption issue than any of the other questions raised in the July 6, 1993, notice. However, there was perhaps a greater gulf between supporters of the 1992 final rule and its opponents on this issue than on any other. As indicated earlier in this preamble, opponents of the rule expressed widespread fear that the Department would use its preemption power to nullify what the opponents perceived as salutary State regulation of controlled business. Proponents of the final rule  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> also <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  read &sect;3500.13(b)(2) of the rule as promising extensive HUD employment of preemption; however, these commenters welcomed it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters regarded RESPA as sufficient to provide consumers with protection against unfair pricing by settlement service providers. Often, the commenters claimed, State laws that purport to be protective of consumers are actually designed to benefit local settlement service providers, by hindering the entry of larger, broad-based providers into local markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters appeared to assume that the chief intended target of preemption would be State laws directly or indirectly preventing real estate brokers from owning affiliated title businesses, prohibiting mortgage lenders from affiliating with title agencies, or restricting the percentage of business that can be derived from referrals from affiliated businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A lender with nationwide business objected strongly to the inefficiencies it said resulted from multiple and inconsistent State law requirements. While these varying requirements are justified if they provide identifiable consumer benefits, the commenter said, they frequently represent attempts to limit competition among lenders, and actually increase the costs paid by consumers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The experience in Kansas is instructive. After the state enacted a law limiting referrals to affiliated entities, many title agent affiliates of real estate brokers and mortgage companies were forced out of business. Freed from the need to compete with such providers, we understand that independent title agents increased their rates by approximately 60%. The Department need look no further than this example to recognize that protection of ``turf,'' rather than protection of consumers, is normally at the heart of such limitations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenter went on to urge that HUD make clear that State limitations affecting controlled business arrangements are preempted by RESPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter said that RESPA regulations encourage nationwide service providers to diversify their product offerings and enter new geographic markets. Accordingly, Federal preemption of adverse State laws would result in increased competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While a few commenters appeared to be recommending summary preemption of the array of State laws affecting controlled business, other commenters, responding to the Department's direct question, urged the establishment of standards for the case-by-case determination of whether State laws or regulations are inconsistent with RESPA in the controlled business area, i.e., whether a particular law ``give(s) more protection to consumers and/or competition'' than does RESPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that the final rule's treatment of preemption should be fundamentally changed because it is ``unclear and vaguely worded'': ``What is meant by `stringent limitations' and `give more protection to *&blank;*&blank;* competition?'''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter cited the legislative history of the 1983 RESPA amendments as indicating Congress' expectation that, if necessary to protect consumers or encourage competition, HUD would recommend further legislation to place a percentage limitation on the amount of controlled business that could be transacted. The commenter observed that in the ten years since the controlled business exemption became law, HUD has not recommended further legislation in this area. Additionally, the commenter claimed, many State governments have not seen the necessity of enacting restrictions on the percentage of business that can be derived from affiliated entities. The commenter concluded that State ``percentage of business'' laws were inconsistent with RESPA and should be preempted as anticompetitive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Position on Preemption in the Proposed Rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Based upon the comments and testimony, the Secretary has determined that it is unnecessary at this time to set out specific written standards for preemption of State laws. As numerous commenters, including the State Attorneys General, observed, setting out comprehensive and informative preemption standards presents an almost insurmountable task, in the absence of a wide array of specific fact situations that are raising preemption issues. If it becomes necessary to consider this issue further, the Secretary may reopen the issue by rulemaking or deal with specific preemption issues by means of interpretive rules. No amendments are proposed on this subject in this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Issue 4: Adequacy of the Controlled Business Disclosure Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;3500.15(b)(1) of the 1992 final rule, provision was made for ``written disclosure, in the format of the Controlled Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set forth in appendix D of this part.'' This disclosure referred to certain information regarding the ownership and financial relationships between referring and referred-to parties, as well as information regarding the timing of the disclosure and other methods for disclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD solicited the views of commenters in its July 6, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice concerning whether the controlled business disclosures outlined in appendix D ``are adequate to protect the consumer, and, if not, how they might be improved.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

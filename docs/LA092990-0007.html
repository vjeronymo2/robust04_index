			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE PREVENTION OFFICE DESTROYED IN BLAZE  </P> <P> A county fire prevention office in a building without sprinklers caught fire  and burned west of downtown Los Angeles this week.  </P> <P> "It's not embarrassing unless we find that something in our office caused the  fire," said county Fire Capt. Robert Grafton.  </P> <P> "There were no sprinklers in this building and it certainly would have been  better to have them."  </P> <P> The building may have been built before a sprinkler system was required, he  added.  </P> <P> Wednesday night's blaze caused $280,000 damage.  </P> <P> "From time to time office buildings burn," Grafton said. "We think it's pretty  unfortunate that it happened to us."  </P> <P> Firefighters were alerted at about 9:55 p.m. They arrived to find the one-story  building engulfed in flames, said city fire spokesman Pat Marek.  </P> <P> The firefighters had the blaze out in about 40 minutes, Marek said. There were  no injuries and the building was empty, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Thomas Cook backs alliance with Owners THOMAS Cook, the travel agency and financial service company, yesterday backed its plans for a commercial alliance with Owners Abroad by making a tender offer at 150p for up to 12.5 per cent of the UK holiday company. The Pounds 29m cash offer is conditional on Owners Abroad's shareholders rejecting the hostile all share offer and partial cash alternative from Airtours, the rival tour company. Mr Christopher Rodrigues, Thomas Cook chief executive, characterised the offer as a substantial capital investment to support what was a 'quite unique commercial alliance'. Owners Abroad and Thomas Cook say the arrangement would allow Thomas Cook and LTU, the German tour operator - both of which are controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank - to create a substantial pan-European holiday company. Airtours responded to the offer by saying it would neither extend its offer beyond March 16 nor increase its final offers which last night valued Owners Abroad at Pounds 285m. Airtours' share price closed unchanged at 237.5p while Owners shares fell 3p to 141p after heavy two-way trade. Thomas Cook's emphasis on the commercial attractions of the alliance was greeted as an unusual move at this stage in a bid. Owners Abroad's directors and their trusts, which control 5.5 per cent of the stock, will not be accepting the tender. Even so Owners shareholders could therefore expect cash for only about 13.2 per cent of their holdings. By comparison, Airtours is offering a partial cash alternative up to 56 per cent of Owners shares, valuing the offer yesterday at 131p. City observers' immediate reaction was that Thomas Cook had offered too little too late in the bid. Mr Rodrigues stressed that the tender offer had not been an attempt to frustrate the Airtours bid but was an alternative for Owners shareholders that would lead to substantial long-term commercial benefits. Thomas Cook had decided it wanted to buy a share stake of about 10 per cent in Owners Abroad and believed an investment of about Pounds 30m was the correct allocation of capital to support its plans in the UK market.

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Citizen's Charter cuts BR payouts MONEY paid to British Rail passengers whose trains are late or cancelled has been cut by more than half since the introduction of the Passenger's Charter. Latest figures confirm predictions that the charter would leave passengers no better off than they were under the previous arbitrary and unpublicised refund scheme. BR says it has not yet calculated how much compensation has been paid since the charter came into operation, but estimates the figure at a little more than Pounds 3m a year. In 1991, the last full year before the charter, BR paid out Pounds 7m - although that figure was boosted by disruption to services caused by what BR dubbed the 'wrong kind of snow'. Before the Passenger's Charter came into force in May 1992, local managers had discretion to hand out cash or travel vouchers when passengers wrote to complain about unpunctuality or poor service. The charter imposed a more rigid system of compensation. For example, trains had to be more than an hour late before refunds could be claimed, and the entitlement consisted of a voucher worth only 20 per cent of the fare. When the Passenger's Charter was introduced, BR estimated that compensation would soar to Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m a year. The Consumers' Association said: 'What the latest figures show more than anything else is that the performance targets were too soft.' The association said it had also had reports that BR was interpreting the charter too rigidly, taking the guidelines as maximum levels of entitlement instead of minimum ones. It called on BR to 'go with the spirit of the charter rather than the letter'. Another factor in the low level of payouts is believed to be a reluctance among passengers to go to the trouble of submitting claims for trifling levels of compensation. BR says most passengers are far more concerned about improvements in performance than about claiming refunds. Complaints about rail punctuality from passengers travelling to and from the west of England have risen by 80 per cent, the Western England Transport Users Consultative Committee says. The number of passengers complaining to the committee in 1992-93 totalled 587 - a 20 per cent rise on 1991-92.</p>

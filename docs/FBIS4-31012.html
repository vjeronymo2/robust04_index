			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- The importance of  the development of the bilateral economic and commercial  relations was evoked during the interview on 31 May between  Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma and Romanian Prime  Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu.    Noting the current growing tendency of the bilateral trade,  the Indian president pointed to the need for speeding up that  process. The guest appreciated the Romanian-Indian relations as  a bridge between Asia and Europe, considering that Romania could  become in future an economic leader in Eastern Europe. The  Indian party's interest in developing economic relations with  Romania resulted also from the fact that the delegation included  four members of the Indian cabinet -- ministers of the interior,  foreign affairs, tourism and agriculture, as well as the  president of the Association of Chambers of Commerce and  Industry of India.    Premier Vacaroiu evoked the traditional friendship between  the two countries and emphasized the necessity of extending the  current legal framework, so that the fine political bilateral  relations should be matched by economic ones. The creation  during the visit of an adequate legal framework is a component  of utmost importance of the government's policy of relaunching  and expanding the traditional economic and commercial relations  of Romania, Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu added.</p>

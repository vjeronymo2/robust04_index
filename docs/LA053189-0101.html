			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A developer who is building more than 860 apartments in a San Francisco  neighborhood has hired a consulting firm to help stop a proposed baseball park  nearby because of possible noise and traffic congestion. The Cleveland-based  Forest City Development reportedly paid $10,000 to back "San Franciscans for  Planning Priorities," which describes itself as a community-based movement  supported by neighborhood activists and environmentalists. The group is urging  citizens to write Mayor Art Agnos and Spectacor Management Group, a  Philadelphia firm that is negotiating with the city to develop a ballpark and  arena.  </P></p>

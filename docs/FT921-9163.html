			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Sell-off plan in Western Australia Dr Carmen Lawrence, premier of Western Australia, plans to privatise the state's two largest financial institutions as part of an economic package announced yesterday, writes Bruce Jacques. Dr Lawrence said the government's Insurance Office would be sold outright and 40-49 per cent of R&amp;I Bank would be sold. But she said the economic environment precluded immediate sales and the government would wait until 'the time was right'. She did not specify whether the institutions, both involved in lending to failed entrepreneurs, would be floated or offered for trade sale. There are also question marks over their attractiveness. The R&amp;I Bank late last year required a ADollars 70m (Pounds 28.7m) capital injection from the Reserve Bank.</p>

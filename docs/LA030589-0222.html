			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NUCLEAR SUB IS NO TRIBUTE  </P> <P> The press, including The Times, recently reported on the commissioning  ceremonies for a new U.S. nuclear-powered attack submarine named after  Pasadena.  </P> <P> In ready compliance with the Navy's public relations campaign, several  Pasadena-area dignitaries attended the commissioning ceremonies. Mayor William  Thomson, Vice Mayor Jess Hughston, Director John Crowley and Rep. Carlos J.  Moorhead (R-Glendale) were all on hand to bestow their blessings on the sub.  </P> <P> Thomson's remarks that Pasadena is "fortunate" and "honored" to have the  submarine named after it have met with favorable editorial response by one  local newspaper. But before anyone breaks into jubilant celebration, I think  the citizens of Pasadena deserve to know more about the Pasadena than has been  reported by the press.  </P> <P> A front-page story in the Feb. 12 Star-News mentioned that the sub comes  equipped with cruise missiles. Even less was revealed about the sub in The  Times. Unfortunately, none of the press reported that some of these missiles  are tipped with 200-kiloton nuclear warheads that have an explosive force 15  times more powerful than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.  </P> <P> In addition, these missiles have a range of 1,500 miles, pinpoint accuracy and  capabilities that make them potential first-strike weapons. Because it is  extremely difficult to distinguish between cruise missiles with nuclear or  conventional warheads, such weapons present verification nightmares for  attempts to ensure compliance with nuclear arms controls. They will make  negotiations for future arms control treaties much more difficult.  </P> <P> In a time of massive federal debt, greatly decreased Cold War tensions and  critical human needs in Pasadena and other San Gabriel Valley communities, it  seems difficult to justify the expenditure of the $800 million it took to build  this single submarine.  </P> <P> I call on Thomson, Hughston, Crowley and Moorhead to explain to the citizens of  Pasadena why we need to deploy this submarine when the U.S. nuclear arsenal  already contains the equivalent of two tons of TNT for every man, woman and  child on this planet. I ask them to explain why they support the deployment of  weapons that have first-strike capabilities and can only make new arms control  treaties more difficult to obtain. And finally, I ask them why they expect  Pasadena citizens to celebrate this $800-million expenditure when they know the  critical human needs of Pasadena and many other communities.  </P> <P> To these Pasadena civic leaders I say "congratulations." You have done your  part to perpetuate the ever-more threatening and ruinously expensive arms race.  I'm sorry, but I do not share your pride and joy in the commissioning of the  Pasadena.  </P> <P> JOHN GRULA  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

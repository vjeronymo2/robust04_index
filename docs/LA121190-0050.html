			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> LOTT LEADS HIT PARADE, MAKING 200 POUNDS FEEL LIKE A TON  </P> <P> As New York lost to San Francisco last week, the play that symbolized three  combative hours in Candlestick Park was probably the hit of the year.  </P> <P> It was the hit that Giant tight end Mark Bavaro absorbed from 49er free safety  Ronnie Lott.  </P> <P> It didn't save the game, a low-scoring affair that ended 7-3. The save came  later -- when Lott made his other big play of a defensive night, a diving,  one-handed deflection in the end zone.  </P> <P> But it did raise a good question: How can this guy hit football players  seemingly harder than anyone else does?  </P> <P> He isn't the biggest 49er. Standing an even 6 feet, Lott, a former USC  All-American, weighs an even 200 pounds. He is a lightweight next to the man he  clobbered.  </P> <P> A six-year NFL veteran from Notre Dame, Bavaro goes 6-4 and 245.  </P> <P> Yet Lott, timing the hit perfectly, knocked him groggy.  </P> <P> Lott's key is that he is a student of the mechanics of hitting. Muhammad Ali  would be proud of him. So would any clean liver.  </P> <P> Lott never goes for the knees. And unlike football's other heavy hitters, he  doesn't attack shoulder-first.  </P> <P> He is a body-to-body hitter. In a classic NFL moment, Giant quarterback Phil  Simms, hurried by the 49er pass rush, had overthrown the target -- forcing  Bavaro to stretch far out for the ball -- when Lott smashed him with the entire  front of his body from the forehead down.  </P> <P> It was an exotic piece of offensive defense.  </P> <P> One unusual thing about pro football is that it seems to attract a good many  casual fans.  </P> <P> The TV crowd for any big NFL game obviously includes many thousands of passive,  indifferent, or slightly interested fans -- those who doubt that football is a  particularly great sport, though they will watch it, idly, on occasion.  </P> <P> That is the only way to explain the audience-survey numbers.  </P> <P> For the Giant-49er game last week, the Nielsen rating was 27. By comparison,  the World Series last fall averaged 20.8. The NBA finals last spring averaged  12.4.  </P> <P> The strange truth is that the Neilsen rating for the Super Bowl's pregame show  is larger than the numbers for championship games in other sports.  </P> <P> In college basketball last spring, the title game hit 20.  </P> <P> Leading into the Super Bowl last winter, the pregame show hit 21.6.  </P> <P> The point is that many football spectators -- specifically, many of those who  watched the 49ers and Giants last week -- are comparatively undiscerning fans.  </P> <P> They are basketball fans or rock fans or, possibly, fast-car fans who, for a  night, were drawn to an NFL event because it seemed to be the nation's biggest  sports event since the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> And that accounts for the dichotomy of the national reaction.  </P> <P> Most football fans called it a good defensive game.  </P> <P> Most casual fans called it boring.  </P> <P> Casual fans criticized the 49er defensive team because it never sacked Simms.  </P> <P> Football fans realized that Lott's big hit, for example, was set up by the 49er  rush on Simms. They realized that for better or worse, football is offense and  defense.  </P> <P> In one of linebacker Lawrence Taylor's big years, the Giant defense will get  another chance against another brilliant offensive team Saturday when  quarterback Jim Kelly arrives at the Meadowlands with the Buffalo Bills.  </P> <P> Buffalo and New York are each 11-2, a tick behind the 49ers. And as the AFC's  only 11-2 club, the Bills, in the opinion of many, are Super Bowl-bound.  </P> <P> The Giants and other NFC clubs have won six consecutive Super Bowl games and  eight of the last nine. Do the Bills really want to get there?  </P> <P> Won't the AFC's 1990 champion become its seventh consecutive Super Bowl  casualty?  </P> <P> "It isn't the NFC that's been beating the AFC," Buffalo General Manager Bill  Polian said. "As the regular-season results have told us for years, the  conferences are about even.  </P> <P> "What's important to understand is that the Super Bowl is a game of matchups.  And it just happens that most of the teams that won AFC championships in the  1980s didn't match up well with NFC champions.  </P> <P> "Secondly, the 49ers were a super Super Bowl team in the '80s. They've won four  of the last nine. They'd have beaten anybody. The reason they win so often is  that their big-play guys are more consistent than anyone else's."  </P> <P> How would the Bills match up with the 49ers or Giants in Super Bowl XXV?  </P> <P> "We have the defense and the quarterback," Polian said. "Defense gets you into  the playoffs, and quarterbacking takes you the rest of the way."  </P> <P> Of the AFC champions of recent years, only the Cincinnati Bengals have made a  game of it against the NFC, losing Super Bowl XXIII to the 49ers in the last  minute, 20-16.  </P> <P> In a rematch Sunday, the 49ers caught the Bengals again, 20-17, in overtime.  </P> <P> "Cincinnati is the only AFC team that has matched up well with an (NFC  champion) lately," the Buffalo executive said. "As you saw again (Sunday), they  have what it takes to battle Montana all the way -- a big offensive line, good  play-action passing, an active defense and speed in the secondary.  </P> <P> "Denver is an example of a team that could win AFC (titles) but didn't match up  with NFC (champion). They're agile and well conditioned, but built to excel in  Denver's rarefied air, and sometimes they've been too small."  </P> <P> Will Buffalo beat the Giants Saturday?  </P> <P> "Our quarterback can do more things on his own than their quarterback," Polian  said. "But everything depends on how we handle their power."  </P> <P> Quote Department:  </P> <P> Bernie Kosar, Cleveland quarterback commenting on one aspect of the Browns'  slump: "(Coach) Jim Shofner is the fifth play-caller I've had in six years."  </P> <P> Herb Adderley, Green Bay's Hall of Fame cornerback, on Hall of Famer Dick  (Night Train) Lane, as quoted by Rick Korch in Pro Football Weekly: "Night  Train was the best defensive back to ever play the game. I tried to pattern my  game after him. I've never seen a defensive back hit the way he hit -- I mean,  take them down, whether it be Jim Taylor or Jim Brown."  </P> <P> Chris Doleman, Minnesota defensive lineman: "I don't like these bye weeks. I  like getting right back in there and playing."  </P></p>

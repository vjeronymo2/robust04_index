			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Soltan commentary] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang still has the time and the possibility to  avoid sanctions. One thing only is needed for that: North Korea  must change its present stand, which only generates more  suspicion that the country already has or intends to have its  own nuclear weapons. The Moscow proposal still holds about  calling a many-sided conference to postpone sanctions. The  conference might work out effective measures to safeguard the  sovereignty and security of the two Korean states, that's on the  one hand, and on the other to guarantee a nuclear-free status  for the Korean peninsula.    North Korea is among many countries that considers such a  conference feasible, but its conduct so far, especially its  withdrawal from the IAEA, makes one think that the country opts  for a path of upsetting the nuclear nonproliferation regimen.  If that is the case the international community has no other  choice but to introduce sanctions. Russia's foreign minister,  Andrey Kozyrev, says such a development would be highly  undesirable.    The United States draft resolution put before the United  Nations Security Council offers an embargo on arms supplies to  North Korea, curtailing financial transactions with it and  suspending United Nations relief aid, but even if the draft is  passed the sanctions will be phased, not introduced immediately.  Pyongyang still has the time to prove to the world that its  nuclear program is strictly peaceful.    As for brandishing arms, this is something fully applicable  not only to Pyongyang but also to Washington and Seoul. That  can have serious complications on the state of affairs on the  Korean peninsula and in the rest of northeast Asia.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LEVINGSTON HELPS HAWKS BEAT BUCKS, 111-98  </P> <P> The Atlanta Hawks have had their troubles trying to blend some new talent into  a championship team. It could have been worse.  </P> <P> Forward Kevin Willis was injured in training camp and hasn't played a minute.  </P> <P> While newcomers Moses Malone and Reggie Theus have had some problems adjusting  to Dominique Wilkins, it was easy to replace Willis.  </P> <P> Cliff Levingston, who spent his first 6 National Basketball Assn. seasons  coming off the bench, has blended in as the substitute for the 7-foot power  forward.  </P> <P> Right from the start, Levingston has had the Hawks' best shooting percentage  and has been a strong rebounder.  </P> <P> Levingston was 10 for 12 from the field Tuesday night at Atlanta as the Hawks  put an end to Milwaukee's 6-game winning streak with a 111-98 victory.  </P> <P> Levingston helped the Hawks build a 19-point lead in the third quarter. He was  on the bench when Ricky Pierce came off the bench to lead a rally by the Bucks  that cut the lead to 4 points with more than 2 1/2 minutes left. Pierce had 14  of his 22 points in the last quarter.  </P> <P> It was Glenn Rivers, starting in place of injured Jeff Malone, who killed the  Bucks' rally. With 2:13 left and the shot clock running down, Rivers sank a  3-point basket to increase the lead to 99-92.  </P> <P> "It was a big shot," Rivers said after taking the pass from Wilkins. I saw it  coming. When I got the pass, I knew I had to shoot it. I also knew that if it  went in, it was all over. I like pressure situations."  </P> <P> The win was only the Hawks' third in their last 8 games. It was the Bucks'  second loss in 12 games, both to the Hawks.  </P> <P> Levingston scored 8 of his 23 points in the second quarter when the Hawks  outscored the Bucks, 32-16, to build what appeared to be a comfortable lead.  </P> <P> "It has really helped me to know that I will play at least 30 minutes,"  Levingston said. "It's a good feeling to know you can make a mistake or two and  not come out. We need Kevin, but it has been a big break for me."  </P> <P> For one of the few times in his career, Moses Malone was not in the starting  lineup. No, Malone was not ill or ailing. No, the 6-11 center wasn't being  disciplined. Just before the opening tipoff, there was a call from nature and  Moses answered it.  </P> <P> Jon Koncak drew a rare last-minute start at center. Malone played 35 minutes,  had 17 points and 9 rebounds.  </P> <P> Chicago 103, Indiana 96 -- The Bulls have had to depend on Michael Jordan,  nearly exclusively, almost every time they have been in tough games.  </P> <P> So, it was refreshing for Jordan, as well as his teammates, when the star guard  turned playmaker and ball stealer in this victory at Chicago.  </P> <P> Jordan scored only 22 points but had 13 assists. John Paxson led the Bulls in  scoring with 24 points. Jordan scored half his points in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "I had a lot of fun just contributing," Jordan said after getting 6 rebounds  and 4 steals. "I don't think I just stood around, but it was my job to get a  couple of the other guys active.  </P> <P> "I have to give the Pacers credit for the way they held me off for 3 quarters.  I kind of paced myself tonight, because I did not get a rest until the last 3  minutes of the third quarter."  </P> <P> The Pacers' comeback effort had a blow when Chuck Person was hit with his  second technical foul with 6:28 remaining.  </P> <P> Person, who scored 29 points, was given a technical in the opening minutes, so  when he became involved in a shoving match with Chicago's Scottie Pippen, the  second technical resulted in an automatic ejection.  </P> <P> Indiana Coach Dick Versace was upset with referee Ed Rush for making the second  call.  </P> <P> "It was a little double push," he said. "It happens all the time. If it had  been Michael Jordan and he had a technical already, it wouldn't have been  called."  </P> <P> Sacramento 123, Houston 109 -- Harold Pressley scored 7 of his game-high 24  points in the last 5 minutes at Sacramento to keep the Kings in command.  </P> <P> The Kings, in a surprisingly easy victory, led several times by 23 points in  the victory over the Midwest Division leaders.  </P> <P> Utah 111, Portland 110 -- John Stockton sank 4 free throws in the last 14  seconds at Portland to wrap up a brilliant performance.  </P> <P> Stockton had 20 points, 11 in the last quarter, and 18 assists as the Jazz  handed the Trail Blazers just their second home loss in 16 games.  </P> <P> Stockton's free throws came after Jerome Kersey of the Blazers missed a layup  with 22 seconds left and Utah leading, 107-106.  </P> <P> Clyde Drexler, averaging 27.9 points per game for Portland, was held to 19.  </P> <P> New Jersey 117, San Antonio 112 -- Mike McGee came off the bench to score 24  points at East Rutherford, N.J., and the Nets handed the Spurs their sixth  defeat in a row.  </P> <P> The Nets built a 19-point lead in the first half, but the Spurs wiped it out  and took a 2-point lead with 4:11 to go. Lester Conner scored twice and Joe  Barry Carroll once to restore the Nets' control. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

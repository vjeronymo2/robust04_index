			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Update for the KGB bosses I WAS struck, this week, by a worrying thought. I realised that I had left the KGB bosses in St Petersburg dangling in the lurch. Not that they are called the KGB any more. They are known as the Russian security ministry. But in the lurch they dangled. I first made contact with the security bosses in St Petersburg 10 months ago. I did so because I had read that they were miffed that Barbara Hay, the new British consul-general to that city, had been offered sumptuous quarters near the town hall in which to ply her dangerous trade. The security bosses were miffed because ultra-secret cables carrying government messages run under this building. As a result, they believed that the British intelligence service would be able to tap into these cables 'using various technical means and devices'. So I sailed to Ms Hay's rescue. I rang Andrei Korodkhov at the security ministry, and told him that if he would get Ms Hay bedded comfortably in her new quarters I would radio him, regularly, intelligence news from London to counterbalance anything Ms Hay might learn by tapping into the security cables beneath her building. I sent my first bulletin to St Petersburg on October 30 1992, and a second two months later. Then - nothing. I forgot about the KGB, which was not a good career move. So this week I made amends by radioing a bumper bulletin, encrypted, as before, in five-digital numerical groups transformed (via false addition: 2 + 3 = 7) by a second devious encryption. To start with, I filled them in on the ERM. 'The collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism', I radioed, 'holds important lessons for fledgling Russia. First, never trust the Germans. Second, never believe the French. The ERM was an attempt to bring stability to western Europe's warring currencies. Unfortunately, it worked reasonably well for a long time and then surprisingly badly for a short time. A bit like democracy, in fact. 'The ERM collapsed because it produced appalling unemployment, dangerous smog levels, dirty beaches, a plague of boll weevils, a fall in standards throughout Europe's media, rioting at cricket matches and a surge in reported cases of rudeness and date rape. You are lucky you have got the rouble to anchor you to reality.' Then I gave them a business story. They like a nice business story in St Petersburg. 'UK corporate biggie Cadbury Schweppes', I radioed, 'plans to sell chocolate pandas to Chinese children - all 999m of them  - as part of a plan to grab market leadership in the Chinese confectionery market. In 1991, the Chinese consumed only 11,000 tonnes of chocolate whereas Britons consumed 507,000 tonnes. Cadbury's chocky is even more addictive than opium. Russia had better toss its hat into the ring, because full-scale chocky wars are predicted by century's end.' Apart from business and money matters, the Russians like to hear about the British aristocracy and monarchy (the two are very different), so I updated them on the eclipse of Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, whose memorial service was held in London this week. ''Intrigue follows penniless society beauty to grave',' I started, quoting The Times' headline. Then I returned to normal mode: 'The duchess was a woman of prodigious and fleshly appetites', I radioed, 'just like Catherine the Great. Her behaviour shocked everyone. In a democracy, the advantage of having aristocrats and a monarchy is that their cavortings, caperings, sprees and feuds help take the heat off the government when times are hard. The Russian parliament should restore your monarchy at once and create several hundred noblemen. Then sit back and watch the fun.' After that I turned to fashion, with this quote from The Face: ''Casual nouveau est arrive . . . on the post-rave back of 1,000 stoned lads who've seen fit to spend less cash on records and more on clothes. In its most literal form, this reawakened interest in . . . conspicuous consumption and obscure sportswear is unashamedly and simply retro'.' I had no idea what this meant, but the code-breakers in St Petersburg are skilful and resourceful. Finally I sent a joke, from the FT's Observer column: 'When is the ERM not an ERM? When it's an ERM-aphrodite.' I bet they loved that in St Petersburg. Probably split their sides.</p>

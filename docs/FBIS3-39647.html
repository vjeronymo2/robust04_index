			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial report] Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK)  officials view the April party congress as a "dress rehearsal"  for the future congress that will determine Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou's succession, writes Stavros Liyeros in the  30 January Athens daily I KATHIMERINI. Given the widespread  belief that the PASOK congress will be the last under  Papandreou's leadership, potential successors will make no moves  likely to threaten the prime minister's position. They will  focus instead on shaping the balance of power most favorable to  each of them, Liyeros continues. For this reason, the battle  will mainly center on the composition of the new central  committee. Meanwhile, alliances are forming to promote the  chances of each candidate. One of the main factions, composed of  Finance Minister Yiorgos Yennimatas, Environment Minister Kostas  Laliotis, and Industry, Energy and Technology Minister Kostas  Simitis, has attracted a number of high officials. Vaso  Papandreou, PASOK deputy and former EC commissioner, is among  them, but is not yet viewed as an equal partner by the others,  Liyeros affirms. The Yennimatas-Laliotis-Simitis "axis" is  counterbalanced by Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis. While his  influence on the party apparatus is "significant," it is  insufficient to ensure him "first place" in the succession  battle, for many see him as a "black sheep" for founding his own  party--now disbanded--after being proscribed by PASOK in the  1980's, Liyeros writes.    Another pole of attraction is Interior Minister Akis  Tsokhatzopoulos, who has "impressively" strengthened his bases  of support within the party apparatus after his election as  PASOK central committee secretary. Since Tsokhatzopoulos until  recently was not considered a potential successor to Papandreou,  it was believed his power would wane with the prime minister's  exit from active politics. This widespread impression has now  given way to the belief that the interior minister is attempting  to firm up his position both within the party and the  government, with a view to claiming the PASOK leadership.    Minister to the Prime Minister Andonios Livanis,  Papandreou's  "closest aide, completes the square," Liyeros writes. Having  played a "determining" role in the cabinet appointments, he has  attracted significant support both from the PASOK parliamentary  group and the party apparatus. While Livanis nourishes no  leadership ambitions, he will play a principal role in the  struggle for succession because of his ability to influence the  prime minister, as well as a large group of "Andreists," Liyeros  contends. While relations between Arsenis, Tsokhatzopoulos, and  Livanis are not "excellent," the three share Papandreou as a  point of reference and will surely conform to his wishes as long  as he remains in power, only breaking ranks on the succession  issue, Liyeros contends.    Although the Yennimatas-Laliotis-Simitis alliance had  attempted until recently to limit Tsokhatzopoulos' influence in  the party, it seems they have had "second thoughts," Liyeros  continues. The three officials are attempting to reach an  understanding with the interior minister in order to "isolate"  Arsenis, and thus will not oppose his immediate reelection as  central committee secretary. Nevertheless, their long-term goal  is to elect a party chairman and secretary of their own  choosing, with Tsokhatzopoulos remaining a "figurehead" as  deputy party leader. PASOK party members gathered around the  trio will surely support Yennimatas for party chairman and  Laliotis for secretary when the time comes, Liyeros contends,  adding that the sole uncertain factor is Yennimatas' health,  which may not allow him to run. An intermediate solution may  then be sought with the support of such PASOK luminaries as  Minister to the Prime Minister Anastasios Peponis and deputy  Apostolos Kaklamanis, Liyeros concludes.</p>

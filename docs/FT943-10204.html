			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: South Crofty tin mine wins its fight for life The UK's last operating tin mine has won its fight for life. Mr Kevin Ross, managing director of the South Crofty mine near Cambourne, Cornwall, announced yesterday morning that applications for an offer of shares in the company had reached Pounds 1.15m, beating the minimum requirement under a survival package agreed with the government by Pounds 150,000 and the Thursday midnight deadline by a few hours. As soon as the company's auditors and solicitors have confirmed that the issue has met all requirements, which Mr Ross said would take three or four days, the government will write off loans totalling Pounds 23.4m. Also, RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, which sold South Crofty and its sister mine Wheal Jane to management and employees in 1985, will forgive loans of Pounds 7.7m. The survival of the 400 year-old mine and the jobs of its 260 employees are now assured for a year to 18 months. But Mr Ross believed the company's position was now actually stronger than that. He was encouraged by the fact that Pounds 650,000 of the share applications were on behalf of two corporate investors involved in the mining and minerals sector - the rest being from small private investors. 'These companies (which cannot be named until the issue has been verified and the loans written off) have taken a view that tin does have a future in the medium to longer term,' he said, 'and that puts us in a more secure position'. Mr Ross was also confident that the issue could now get close to the full offer of Pounds 1.8m. That, he said, would enable the company to bring forward some projects and possibly expand the workforce, which has already grown by more than 40 per cent over the past three years. At about Pounds 3,300 a tonne, the world tin price remains nearly Pounds 700 below the level that South Crofty needs to make a decent profit. But Mr Ross said the outlook was improving, with emergence from recession likely to lead to good demand growth, particularly from Pacific Rim countries. The development of new uses for tin was also encouraging, he said, and there were good prospects that improvements in tin can technology could help to win back market share from aluminium containers. Last year the mine, which produces about 2,200 tonnes annually of tin in concentrate (an intermediate material), reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 42,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.5m.</p>

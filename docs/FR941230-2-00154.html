The goals of the program are: (1) to increase juvenile offenders' access to legal services; (2) to improve the quality of preadjudication, adjudication, and dispositional advocacy for juvenile offenders; and (3) to ensure due process to all juveniles in the juvenile justice system. The strategies will be made available to State and local bar associations and other relevant organizations so that they can develop approaches to increase the availability and quality of counsel for juveniles. The ABA, JLC, and YLC have completed an assessment of the current state of the art with regard to legal services, training, and education. In fiscal year 1995, they will develop strategies to improve access, availability, and the quality of counsel and provide a comprehensive report on these issues. During this second funding cycle, training materials will be developed and tested in selected sites. Training materials will be adjusted based on experience in the test sites and a dissemination strategy developed. The ABA will establish mechanisms for networking with legal service providers such as public defender offices and children's law centers. Fiscal year 1995, funding will support the second six months of the second year budget for this 3-year effort. No new applications will be solicited in fiscal year 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Improvement in Correctional Education for Juvenile Offenders_$250,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The purpose of this program is to assist juvenile corrections administrators in planning and implementing improved educational services for detained and incarcerated juvenile offenders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In fiscal year 1992, the National Office for Social Responsibility (NOSR) was awarded a 3-year cooperative agreement to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the literature and to produce a report documenting state of the art practices in educational reform.

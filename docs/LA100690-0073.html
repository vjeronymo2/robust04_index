			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOY, 5, INJURED IN SHOOTING BY SUSPECTED GANG MEMBERS  </P> <P> Suspected gang members shot and slightly injured a 5-year-old boy as he stood  in front of a North Hollywood house with relatives, Los Angeles police said  Friday.  </P> <P> Three suspects were arrested.  </P> <P> The shooting occurred in the 5200 block of Harmony Avenue shortly after 8 p.m.  Thursday night, Officer Jeff Godown said.  </P> <P> The boy was standing near the porch with several relatives when a gunman  approached on foot and fired about three rounds of birdshot into the group,  striking the child once in the hand, he said.  </P> <P> The boy was treated at the scene by paramedics and released.  </P> <P> Police said the gunman had argued with a member of the boy's family earlier  that evening and was actually attempting to shoot him and not the boy.  </P> <P> "The child wasn't the target," Godown said.  </P> <P> Officers traced a car, found several blocks from the shooting scene, which was  allegedly used in the gunman's escape.  </P> <P> Police recovered a shotgun and arrested Jaime Ortiz, 21, and Carlos Morales,  20, both of North Hollywood, and a 15-year-old on suspicion of attempted  murder.  </P></p>

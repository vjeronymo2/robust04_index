			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Rules on imports and  distribution of lumber and construction materials as well as on  land use should be eased to lower housing costs and promote  effective use of land in large cities, a government panel  suggested Monday [23 May].    The recommendations were submitted to Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata by a special group on land and housing of the government's  team, dubbed Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters, which  is chaired by Hata himself. The task force team was launched by  former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    The suggestions covered 40 points in five areas regarding  housing and land use in Japan. The areas are reducing housing  construction costs, easing rules on construction such as floor  space of housing, increasing supply of housing land, reviewing  restrictions on land and houses for lease, and rules on land  deals.    The special group of six academics and business leaders like  Shigeru Ito, professor at Keio University, particularly stressed  that the government should ease regulations on imported lumber  and housing materials.    For example, it said Japan should make freer lumber and  housing materials imports, if those commodities meet industrial  standards in original production countries.    On land use, it suggested promotion of better use of idle  agricultural land in large cities. However, in order to avoid  inadequate land development, uniform deregulation is not  recommended, it added.    The suggestions will be examined by concerned authorities  like the Construction Ministry and the Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries Ministry, and the government will include conclusions  in its policy reform plan on external economic relations to be  released at the end of June, government officials said.</p>

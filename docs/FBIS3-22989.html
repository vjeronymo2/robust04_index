			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Defense sources said they know nothing about a  breakthrough over navigator Ron Arad and that Iran is  responsible for his fate. The remarks were made after the  REUTER correspondent in Beirut quoted a senior pro-Iranian  source as saying that there are secret talks over Ron Arad and  that a breakthrough is expected soon. The source added: We  will receive something in return. He refused to say who is  involved in the negotiations and where they are taking place,  but other sources told REUTER that it can be assumed that  Hizballah, Iran, Syria, and perhaps also the United States, are  participating in the talks.</p>

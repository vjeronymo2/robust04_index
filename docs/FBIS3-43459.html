			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] There have been bloody ethnic clashes in Guinea.  They occurred in the town of Machinta near the Liberia border  and involved Tomas and Koniankes. It is not the first time the  two groups are being at each other's throats and a lot of people  are reported dead in the latest bloodshed. From Conakry, Foday  Fofana telexed this report:    A senior police officer told me this morning that he had  received report that at least 30 people had already died in the  ethnic clashes and many more had been wounded. He said that the  situation in the town was explosive, but added that the area had  been tense for the past six months and he had been expecting  serious ethnic trouble in the town. The clashes have been  between the Tomas and the Koniankes, who have been opposed to  each other for a long time. The Koniankes had been mainly  business people while the Tomas are mainly agriculturalists or  civil servants.    While the government had said that the clashes are not  political, there is speculation that politics could be the  cause. The Tomas are in the main supporters of President  Lansana Conte, while the Koniankes are known to be supporters of  the opposition leader, Alpha Conde. A senior government officer  told me that the government is taking all necessary measures to  maintain law and order in Machinta and its environment.</p>

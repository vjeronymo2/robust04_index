			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Different schemes and how they work Option guarantees Shaun Coleman, derivatives specialist at Morgan Grenfell, gives the following example (which does not include charges). Options essentially give you the opportunity to look back and say 'If I had only known . . .' In the case of a simple five-year equity bond, someone investing Pounds 100 could be offered back a guaranteed Pounds 125 or the rise in the index, if greater. To achieve this, the manager buys a call option on the FT-SE 100 index worth 16 per cent of the investment (ie, Pounds 16). This gives the manager the right to buy Pounds 100 worth of equity market increase over 25 per cent in five years' time. The remaining Pounds 84 is invested in a five-year deposit at 8.5 per cent and, after five years, is worth Pounds 125. If the market falls, you get the Pounds 125 and the call option is worthless. If the market rises, say 27 per cent, you get the Pounds 125 from the deposit plus the excess in the rise over 25 per cent - ie, 2 per cent - providing a total of Pounds 127 at maturity. Most guaranteed pension funds also offer the chance to lock in to gains at regular intervals. Quarterly lock-ins usually are more flexible but more expensive than the annual version. With-profits Traditional with-profits funds invest in UK and international equities, gilts and fixed-interest securities, plus property. In addition to a guaranteed sum at maturity, the life office adds annual bonuses that also are guaranteed. These bonuses are 'smoothed' - that is, the actuary retains some profits in good years to maintain a fairly consistent return in bad years. On top of this there is a final bonus, which is discretionary and tends to reflect recent performance. This used to represent about 30 per cent of final payout but today it represents between 50 and 70 per cent, so the guaranteed element has been slashed. The main charges are not explicit but are deducted from the fund before the bonus rate is declared. Unitised with-profits have almost entirely replaced traditional with-profits. With these, there is no sum guaranteed at maturity and annual bonuses are applied by increases to the unit price or the number of units. Some, but not all, providers guarantee a minimum increase, usually of 4 per cent. There is also a terminal bonus which is determined by the fund actuary. Charges are more explicit than on the traditional version and include a bid/offer spread, an annual charge, and a capital levy - an extra charge made in the early years to recoup the cost of commission paid to advisers. Equity-linked funds If you want exposure to the stock market and do not need the guarantee, then there are two main pooled fund choices. In each case, the value of your units fluctuates in line with the underlying assets. Unit-linked personal pensions are available from more than 100 life offices, which offer a wide range of UK and international equity funds. The most popular choice is the managed fund, which invests in a range of the provider's other main funds. Charges include a bid/offer spread, an annual management charge, administration fees and the capital. Unit trust personal pensions offer a similar range of funds to unit-linked plans but are available from only a handful of unit trust groups; these include Gartmore, Invesco Fund Managers and Rothschild Asset Management. Charges are transparent and do not include the capital levy used by life offices.</p>

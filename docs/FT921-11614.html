			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Ontario to sell its 25% stake in Suncor THE ONTARIO government is to sell its 25 per cent stake in Suncor, one of Canada's largest oil producers, in the latest of a string of ownership changes in the Canadian energy industry. Suncor said it planned a secondary offering of up to 45 per cent of its shares held by its two shareholders, Sun Company of Philadelphia and the Ontario Energy Corporation, a provincial government agency. The offering will be made in Europe and the US as well as Canada. Sun Company plans to cut its holding to below 55 per cent, from just under 75 per cent. The Ontario government bought its stake at the height of the 1981 oil crisis to get a window on the producing side of the energy industry. About 1 per cent of Suncor's common shares are traded over-the-counter in Canada. Yesterday's bid price of CDollars 20 a share indicates a market value of about CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.7bn). But Mr Denis Mote, analyst at Maison Placements in Toronto, said the price of the thinly-traded shares did not necessarily reflect market value, especially at a time when a large number of oil and gas properties were up for sale. Ontario is unlikely to recoup its original CDollars 650m investment in Suncor. The province has been eager to sell its stake for some time to help fund a spiralling budget deficit. The pace of mergers and acquisitions in the Canadian oil industry has accelerated in the past few years as larger companies, many of them burdened by heavy debts, have sought to rationalise their assets. UK-based Lasmo wants to sell those businesses in Canada it acquired when it took over Ultramar. Petro-Canada and Amoco have been among the other active sellers.</p>

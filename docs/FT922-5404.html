			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Transport secretary angers 'greens' MR JOHN MacGREGOR angered the 'green' lobby yesterday by using his first keynote speech as transport secretary to extol the virtues of the Department of Transport's roadbuilding programme. Environmentalists and the public transport lobby had hoped that Mr MacGregor would build upon the switch of emphasis in favour of railways initiated by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, his predecessor. Mr MacGregor told a meeting of business people in Plymouth, Devon, that road improvements could be 'good news' for the environment and it was time that was more widely recognised. He said suggestions that the expansion of the road network would devastate the environment were wrong. The UK had an environmentally-conscious approach to its road programme. For example, the department's heavy emphasis on bypasses greatly improved conditions in towns and villages with such roads. In addition, every road project had to pass an environmental assessment. Ms Judith Hannah, of the pressure group Transport 2000, said on BBC Radio that Mr MacGregor's speech looked as if it had been written by the road lobby, who were 'trying to apply greenwash' to the cause of Britain's transport woes.</p>

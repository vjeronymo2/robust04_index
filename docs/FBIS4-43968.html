			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German cabinet today approved  sending 70 German police officers to the town of Mostar, which  was destroyed in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. According  to government spokesman Dieter Vogel, the police will take part  in a civilian operation by the Western European Union [WEU],  which is also to be supported by the administrative authorities  in Mostar.    The WEU police contingent will be made up of a total of 200  police officers. The cabinet approved Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel's view that a stronger international police element was  necessary for the success of the European Union [EU]-appointed  administrator, SPD [Social Democratic Party] politician Hans  Koschnick, Vogel said.    The precondition for the start of the EU's administration in  Mostar and sending the police was the complete demilitarization  of the town under the supervision of the UN Protection Force,  Vogel said. The police would only work "in safe surroundings."  If the security situation did not meet the strict requirements  of the EU, then the administration would be suspended and the  personnel withdrawn.    Germany will make 50 new 20-tonne low-loaders available to  the United Nations for "urgently required" heavy goods transport  in war-torn Yugoslavia. The United Nations will also be given  16 German experts to deal with the opening and starting up of  the airport in Tuzla. The German Government is also willing to  get involved in aid flights with Bundeswehr aircraft once the  airport is open.</p>

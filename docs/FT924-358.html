			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Private View: The ghost of Christmas to come THERE WERE straws in the wind, and they blew from Brussels. So this week I found myself knocking at a freshly-painted door high up under the roof of the Berlaymont building. A few days previously, The Times had carried a large colour picture of our local butcher, Robert Harrison, with a turkey in each hand and a smile on his face. Harrison, it explained, had just learned that EC vets and hygienists hoping to ban the 'delayed evisceration' of Christmas fowl (that is Eurospeak for leaving the guts in) had been told by Britain to. . . well, get stuffed. The Sunday before, tucked away on the front page of the Observer, was a story about the Christmas Tree Growers' Association of Western Europe. This grandly-titled body, led by a very modern major-general, is introducing a Eurostandard for its products - height, width, bushiness, needliness, and so on - which it wants the EC to draft into law next year. In spite of these pointers, no newspaper bothered to chase the story. Nobody, I was pleased to discover, had even guessed the existence of DG XXV, the newly-formed EC directorate-general responsible for seasonal policy. I was even more pleased when, after a bit of hemming and hawing, the information people agreed to set up a briefing from the director-general himself. I knocked at the door. 'Entrez]' boomed a voice from within. It was obvious to me as soon as I entered his office that Dr Klaus was new to the ways of Brussels. Large, cheery and overweight, he looked more like a Bavarian farmer than a senior Commission official. His suit might have been expensive, but it did not fit. His shirt had lost the top button. The decor was a bit too Upwardly Mobile Provincial: executive toys on the desk, a stuffed head on the wall, that sort of thing. Above all, he failed to tell me that the interview was for background use only. So I got out my tape-recorder. Dr Klaus, I said, I have been reading about harmonisation of Christmas trees and turkeys. What is going on? 'Ha] So you have noticed]' He beamed. 'Yes, we make a beginning.' He waved an arm around the room. 'Of course, we are new here, still very much in consultation stage. We are far from making, you know, draft directives . . .' He smiled apologetically. But what exactly is 'seasonal policy'? 'Good question] You know, Mr Tyler, how some people, even good people, are afraid of Maastricht - we know this now from Eurobarometer surveys  - and they feel apart. So, we must bring them together]' The role of DG XXV, he explained, was to stimulate a sense of cultural identity among the citizens of the 12 member states in the hope it would lead them to accept political and monetary union more rapidly. And the cultural event most widely observed throughout Europe was, of course, a seasonal one: Christmas. 'You see,' added Dr Klaus, seriously. 'We must seek for seasonal convergence.' But, I objected, every country has its own traditions and they hold them very dear. For example British children hang out stockings for Father Christmas, but don't Italians and Germans use pillowcases? 'Exactly. So we must apply the principle of social cohesion.' You mean every child must hang up the same size article? 'Too fast, Mr Tyler, too fast] First we must equalise the contents, so that little British children will receive equivalent value to little Germans and little Italians.' His eyes moistened. 'For this we will employ the ECSSF, the European Community Seasonal Subsidy Fund - it was agreed, you remember, at the Edinburgh summit - a rebate mechanism for disadvantaged regions on the periphery of the Community which. . .' I broke in. But what about our food, and drink, and decorations? What about the holly and the ivy, the plum pudding and mince pies? 'Please, let me continue. . . which also is a guarantee that seasonal gifts will be totally safe for non-adult use in accordance with CEN and CENELEC.' Who? 'Our standards-setting bureaux, for electrical and other goods. Of course, we have some problems for negotiation,' he continued. 'The Club Med - excuse me, the Mediterranean member states - are not so happy.' Why is that? 'Well, they have some small differences: they like to employ pine trees, not fir trees. In Italy many little children still wait for the good witch La Befana on January 6. In Spain they are putting out hay for the donkeys of the Three Kings. There are other seasonal convergence difficulties of a timetable nature - Scotland, for instance.' Dr. Klaus sighed and sat back in the big swivel chair. 'We must have more transparency.' So that people can see through this stuff, I asked? The d-g ignored my sarcasm and I continued: What did you do before you got this job? 'This is not for official information,' he replied, winking and tapping the side of his nose. Klaus is a German name, I suggested. 'It is of many origins. I would say German, yes, and even Syrian and American - and also Finnish.' Finnish? 'Yes. For very many years, I have been working near the town of Rovaniemi.' On the Arctic Circle? 'Quite so.' The penny dropped. You mean you're not just called Klaus? You're actually it  -I mean him? Santa Claus, Father Christmas . . .? The director-general was delighted. 'Yes, and Nicholas, Knecht Rupprecht, Pere Bonhomme Noel, Robin Goodfellow, all these people.' But, I stuttered, how am I going to tell the children that you are behind all this - that you've left the Frozen North and chucked it all up to come to Brussels on a big expense account? 'That's up to you. They won't believe it. Ho, ho, ho]' He laughed uproariously. The Klaus appointment (I can no longer call him 'Doctor') turned out to be a political compromise struck in anticipation of Finland's hoped-for entry into the Community. In return for abandoning its traditional neutrality to qualify for full membership, the Finnish government had demanded control of one of the Commission's directorates. This, for all the talk of seasonal convergence, is the real reason why DG XXV was created. But what about the reindeer, I asked . . . and the elves? Klaus motioned with one thumb at the trophy on the wall. With the other he pressed a buzzer. Two little figures came skipping through a side door, one carrying a brush, the other a tin of shoe-polish. 'Please meet my staff,' he said. 'I regret that some friends in ECOSOC (the economic and social committee) are envious,' he continued. 'They complain my staff are an example of extra-Community social dumping - cheap foreign labour. I reply that they are atypical but economically active persons admitted under temporary and transitional arrangements.' Santa patted his belly with self-satisfaction. 'Usually, they are engaged on my special database project. With the help of EUROTECNET we are collating pre-season gift requests of nearly 10,000 children in selected cities: this is on a pilot basis, of course.' He flung his arms wide. 'It will spread all over the Community one day. No more letters up the chimney]' I see, I said. 'You will say, course, there are not many chimneys in Europe. And you will be right. So how can all the little children - some are not so little, I may tell you - expect Dr Klaus to come down their chimney with a big sack of presents?' Go on, I said, tell me. 'Subsidiarity]', he roared. You mean chimney subsidies? 'No, no] Subsidiarity. We believe here in DG XXV that national custom is so very important, even while we strive for seasonal convergence. We say we cannot make rules for everything.' So? 'So children of all member states are free to believe what they like]' he finished triumphantly. Well, I said, as I rose to go, thankyou very much. And a Merry Christmas] 'Maybe,' said the director-general. It was an odd reply and I stopped at the door. 'There are so many names, so many greetings, such confusion] I give you our new Community greeting.' Which is? 'Harmonious Eurofest]' And a Ho-ho-ho to you, too, I thought as I closed the door behind me.</p>

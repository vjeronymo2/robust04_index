The Russia's Choice bloc believes that it is not only  "fruitless" but also "unacceptable and dangerous for the public  conscience" to negotiate with them under the present situation.    "One of this grouping is a left-wing radical one made up of  representatives of the ideology of the Soviet, namely communist  period of the Russian history," said Burbulis. The question  concerns the parliamentary factions of Russia's communist party  and agrarian party, he explained. The second right-wing radical  grouping is represented by the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia which "openly propagates national fascist ideas,"  believes Burbulis.    "All constructive proposals set forth by Russia's Choice  confronts self-mercenary interests of there two radical  groupings," he said.    In Burbulis' opinion, continuation of negotiations with  these  two extremely radical forces could lead to the oblivion of those  strategic goals for the sake of which the Russia's Choice bloc  has been formed and of those positions which its candidates have  defended in the course of the pre-election campaign.    The deputies elected from the bloc Russia's Choice, Burbulis  continued, strive "to ensure stability in the country without  deviating from the principal course aimed at deep democratic  transformations in Russia."    Burbulis believes that the participation of Russia's Choice  in the negotiations probably has been a demonstration of its  "political shortsightedness."    In the course of the negotiations, Burbulis said, "appetites  of extremist radical factions have grown into the claims to head  key parliamentary committees, including the committee on  international affairs, defense, security, legislature, and  financial-economic committees."    While commenting the intention of the Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia's Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to head the  international affairs committee, Burbulis declared that "it  should not take place under any situation." "This will be an  appeal to other countries to defend and to move away from Russia  again though the latter has demonstrated that it is ready for a  comprehensive and useful integration into the world community,"  said Burbulis.    When asked whether the faction Russia's Choice does not fear  to appear in the minority, Burbulis answered: "It is more  dangerous for us to loose our positions in the society and  confidence of our electors." According to Burbulis, position of  Russia's Choice is well known to the participants of the  negotiations."</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / US pollution fears hit Lloyd's syndicates UNCERTAINTIES OVER the size of insurance claims from pollution and asbestosis in the US have prevented two more syndicates - 190 and 868 - at the troubled Lloyd's of London insurance market from closing their accounts for the 1989 underwriting year. To close their accounts, syndicate managers would have needed to build up substantial reserves against possible future claims. This would have involved heavy losses for Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's. Both syndicates are among a number of insurers which may have to meet many billion-dollar claims as a result of federal and state-ordered clean-ups of polluted sites. Insurers are contesting their liability in the US courts and there is doubt about the amounts that will be paid. 'To ask Names for a lot of money is not correct at this stage. We felt we should wait until the problem is clearer,' said Mr John Wetherell, the underwriter of 190, which is managed by the Cater Allen agency and is one of the biggest syndicates on the market. As well as leaving its 1989 year open, Mr Wetherell also said that he was expecting to post a loss of Pounds 25.2m compared with stamp capacity (the syndicate's capital base) of Pounds 157.4m. It has also emerged that syndicate 868, managed by AJ Archer, is to leave its 1989 year open. Archer made the decision in spite of increasing its reserves against losses from asbestosis, pollution and errors and omissions business. Losses will amount to Pounds 13.6m, equivalent to 46 per cent of capacity, and more than five times the amount forecast in January. The decisions are in line with the recommendation of the Rowland task force, which completed an exhaustive study of business practices at Lloyd's in January and suggested that 'open years are the only practical way of dealing with uncertainty' surrounding 'the size and timing of latent liability claims'. Another large syndicate, 932, said last month that it intended to leave its 1989 year open. Syndicate 932 is managed by Janson, Green. Mr Wetherell was confident about the pattern of future pollution settlements. In a key ruling earlier this month, the US Court of Appeal said that Diamond Shamrock, a company making herbicides, could not claim on its insurance policies for clearing waste at a site in Newark, New Jersey. The number of Lloyd's agency groups continues to contract and Hiscox Group is to acquire the RM Pateman Underwriting Agencies. Hiscox's members' agency - which acquired the Pateman members' agency last year - provides about 15 per cent of the Names of marine syndicate 52, the biggest of two syndicates managed by Pateman. Last year syndicate 52 suffered a sharp decline in support from members' agents, its stamp capacity falling from Pounds 73m to Pounds 49m. Syndicate 1034 has a stamp capacity of Pounds 16m and could eventually be merged with syndicate 1139 - which has a capacity of Pounds 15.8m. Hiscox now manages six syndicates which have a total capacity for this year of more than Pounds 300m.</p>

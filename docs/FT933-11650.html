			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Asarco turns in shortfall after production setbacks ASARCO, the US integrated copper producer, lost Dollars 24.1m, or 58 cents per share, in the second quarter after production problems at its recently-expanded Arizona mines and processing plants led to a fall in output. The company also continued to be hit by declining base metals prices. Asarco earned Dollars 4.4m, or 58 cents per share, in the second quarter of 1992. Sales were Dollars 416.6m, against Dollars 487.7m last year. For the six months to June 30, Asarco reported a loss of Dollars 55m, or Dollars 1.32, down from Dollars 10.8m, or Dollars 1.30 per share. Sales for the first half were Dollars 875.6m, down from Dollars 946.6m last year. During the quarter the company's average realised price for copper fell 18 cents from a year-ago to 85 cents per pound, with lead and zinc prices also lower. Its average realised price for silver rose 10 cents to Dollars 4.21 per ounce, and for gold, Dollars 10.45 to Dollars 374.39 per ounce. In addition to lower prices, Mr Richard Osborne, chairman, said earnings were hit by the shutdown of the Company's Troy silver/copper mine in Montana and higher costs and lower production rates at its Arizona copper properties. He said rains which flooded the Ray mine in the first quarter continue to dilute the solutions from which copper is extracted, reducing second-quarter copper cathode production by 3m pounds. He said low ore grades reduced production at Asarco's Mission mine by 2m pounds in the quarter, and that start-up disruptions at the new smelter at its El Paso mine raised costs and trimmed output. WEAK base metal prices pushed Cominco into losses for the second quarter and first half of 1992, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The average LME prices for zinc, lead, nickel and copper were off sharply in the second quarter from a year earlier and were also lower than in the first quarter of this year. The company said further efforts were being made to reduce operating costs. The second-quarter loss was CDollars 16.3m (USDollars 12.7m), or 22 cents a share, including a CDollars 31.6m gain on the spin-off of Cominco Fertilisers. This compared with profit of CDollars 18.1m, or 22 cents, a year earlier. Sales fell to CDollars 225m from CDollars 416m. The first half loss was CDollars 53.1m or 69 cents, compared with profit of CDollars 13.2m, or 15 cents, on sales of CDollars 517m, against CDollars 746m. Second-quarter mining and metals sales were off 24 per cent due to lower prices and also the temporary shutdown of the Trail lead smelter.</p>

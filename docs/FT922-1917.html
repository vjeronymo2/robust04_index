			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Treuhand move on state farms EAST Germany's state farms - a quarter of the former communist country's agricultural land - are to be leased to farmers for 12 years and then sold to east Germans and westerners, including the former nobility whose large estates were confiscated after 1945, the Treuhand privatisation agency said yesterday. The agency said it was setting up a company to supervise the leasing of 1m hectares of farmland and 400,000 hectares of managed forests. Previously only one-year leases were granted, which made planning difficult for tenants. Former collective farms are not included and will either continue operating as co-operatives or return the land to the members who were collectivised. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, a member of the Treuhand management board, said priority in the leasing arrangement would be given to former owners who again wanted to work the land and to east Germans wanting to become private farmers.</p>

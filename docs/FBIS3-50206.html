Kajdi said  the plan sets the deadlines for tasks included in the government  program adopted on December 21, 1993, such as the introduction  of bills on land auction and bank consolidation. It also  defines officials in charge of these tasks.    "The cabinet plans to submit six amendments and 25 new bills  to Parliament," Kajdi said. He pointed out that 30 bills  submitted by the government are already awaiting parliamentary  decision. At its February 3 session, the cabinet is expected to  determine the priority of the bills and suggest to Parliament a  hierarchy for consideration. Kajdi added that the plan of  action focuses on economic bills and those discussed during this  week's consultations between the prime minister and  parliamentary party leaders.    The government wants to work at full force up to the last  moment of its term, and it has a full legal and political  mandate for this course of action, Kajdi said. The term of the  present Parliament extends to May 2, 1994, while that of the  government extends to the opening session of the newly-elected  Parliament, he added. Kajdi also said that the government has  various ideas about methods for accelerating legislation. One  already established practice is to hold inter-party  consultations on the bills before Parliament's plenary  discussions, he noted.</p>

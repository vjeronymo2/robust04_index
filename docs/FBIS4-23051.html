This part is  determined by the high sorption capability and rates in mass  exchange and low hydro- and aerodynamic resistance of these  materials. Graft polymerization of ionogenic monomers and  chemical conversion of functional groups in grafted chains are  the most common methods for preparing chemosorbing fibers. To  prepare various types of such fibrous materials, graft  polymerization of radicals to fibers having various chemical  structures have been developed--hydrocellulose, polycaproamide  with redox systems as ionogenic, and non-ionogenic  (acrylonitrile, glycidyl methacrylate). These methods make it  possible to conduct graft polymerization with practically no  homopolymer formation at high process rates and under  ecologically clean conditions. Chemo-sorbing fibrous materials  having ion exchange and complex forming properties were prepared  by chemical conversion of functional groups (epoxy, nitrile) on  grafted copolymers. In the present work a brief characterization  of the results of using these fibers and fabrics made from them  to resolve ecological problems in various areas is presented.  Covered are fibers made from grafted cellulose and  polycaproamide fibers containing hydrazide groups to adsorb  heavy metal ions, the sorption activities of fabrics in respect  to sulfur dioxide, sorbents for radionucleides, and  sorption-active carbon fiber materials. The latter may be used  to adsorb petroleum products from water. Figures 3; references  12: 11 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Welbilt agrees Berisford offer - Pounds 317m rights issue to fund Pounds 295m purchase of US kitchen maker Berisford International, the kitchens and joinery group, yesterday announced a hefty 11-for-5 rights issue to fund a Pounds 295m offer for Welbilt, one of the largest commercial kitchen manufacturers in the US. In addition, the New York-based Kohlberg family, which controls 46.7 per cent of Welbilt, has agreed to sell its shares to Berisford at a discount to the price being offered to most shareholders. Mr Jerome Kohlberg is one of the founders of the leveraged buy-out specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Berisford is offering Dollars 33.75 (Pounds 20.50) a share to investors representing the outstanding 53.3 per cent of Welbilt, against Dollars 30 a share for the Kohlberg stake. In total, Berisford is offering Dollars 312.7m for Welbilt, and will refinance the group's net debt of about Dollars 147.8m. The deal will be funded through the issue of up to 334.25m units of 5 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock, on the basis of 11 for every five shares held, at 100p to raise Pounds 317.1m net of expenses. The units may be converted from August at 245p. The issue will be underwritten by Barings, the UK merchant bank, which with its US sister bank Dillon, Read put the deal together. The acquisition will almost double the size of Berisford, which earlier this year bought Magnet, the kitchens and joinery manufacturer and retailer, for Pounds 56m. That was also funded by a rights issue, then at 120p. Mr Alan Bowkett, Berisford chief executive, said yesterday's rights was likely to be the last equity fund raising for the next two to three years. Berisford, which has net cash of Pounds 70m, expected to make only infill acquisitions over the next 18 months. An announcement has been expected since news about the talks leaked out in London over the weekend. Mr Bowkett said his company had approached the Kohlberg family when it became apparent they wanted to sell their stake through a secondary public offering in the US. The Kohlbergs have held the stake since buying out the family owners in 1990. Berisford was invited to make a bid for the whole company after extensive due diligence and agreeing to pay a higher price to independent shareholders. The total costs of the deal are expected to be about Dollars 35m. This includes the costs of buying out Welbilt bonds worth Dollars 100m at a premium and underwriting costs of Dollars 12m. Mr Bowkett said he was delighted with the acquisition, which would materially enhance earnings in 1995. In the nine months to October 1, Welbilt made operating profits of Dollars 36.4m on sales of Dollars 260.9m. Berisford shares were suspended on Monday at 228p.</p>

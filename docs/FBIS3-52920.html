They arrived from Damascus in US embassy cars and crossed at  this border post, 80 kilometres (50 miles) east of Beirut, which  was guarded by 50 Lebanese troops.    The motorcade, flanked by 10 jeeps carrying members of the  Lebanese army's special forces, then headed for the nearby  village al-Sultan Ya'qub, where three Israeli soldiers went  missing during a battle with the Syrians in 1982.    Syria agreed in December to assist the congressional team to  try to shed light on the fate of the six men, a move Israel  hailed as a step forward for the peace process.    Only airman Ron Arad is believed to be still alive.    The Americans met families of the missing men in Israel on  Thursday, and had talks in Damascus on Saturday with Syrian  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'.</p>

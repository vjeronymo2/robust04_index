			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Rise: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose to the  highest level in more than four years. The Treasury Department sold $7.2  billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 9%, up from 8.69%  last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average  discount rate of 9.04%, up from 8.76% last week. The rates were the highest  since Oct. 29, 1984, when three-month bills sold for 9.38% and since six-month  bills averaged 9.07% on Nov. 5, 1984. The latest 9.04% average for six-month  bills had been matched on March 18, 1985. The new discount rates understate the  actual return to investors -- 9.34% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill  selling for $9,772.50, and 9.60% for a six-month bill selling for $9,543.  </P></p>

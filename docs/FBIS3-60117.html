As a result, the crusade begun by the authorities  has ended in their total defeat.    This is the conclusion reached by Alain Labrousse and Alain  Vallon, respectively director and coordinator of the  geopolitical center on narcotics.    Following the murder by the Medellin cartel of the main  candidate for the post of Colombian president in 1989, the  United States and other Western powers, the authors note,  announced a campaign on an unprecedented scale against drugs and  against the laundering of capital obtained from their sale.    Four years on, however, drugs production in the world has  doubled. In the "golden crescent" (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and  Iran), it has leapt from 800 to 2,200 tonnes. It is growing at  an even faster pace in the "golden triangle" formed by certain  regions of Thailand and Burma. Cocaine production in Latin  America has risen from 800 to 1,500 tonnes. Whereas previously  only Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru engaged in the drugs trade, now  the entire continent has become involved in this lucrative  business.    Finally, the former Soviet Central Asian republics are  becoming an exceptionally important drugs production zone and  staging post. Alain Labrousse warned me last year that a great  new drugs power is emerging from the ruins of the land of the  soviets. It looks as if his prediction is starting to come true.    He feels the explanation for the unprecedented drugs boom is  that the West has no intention of sacrificing its economic  interests in the war on the "white death." For example, 70  percent of heroin enters France from Pakistan, several of whose  ministers have been involved in the drugs business. When  Francois Mitterrand received the Pakistani premier last year,  however, he expressed concern about human rights violations but  said absolutely nothing about heroin.    This diplomatic silence brought dividends: In September  1992, Pakistan signed a contract with Paris to buy three  submarines worth 3.7 billion francs.    The same applies to Burma, which French experts describe as  the world's main "drugs dictatorship." However, France  certainly is not inclined to boycott this country, which is a  major producer of opium and therefore of heroin. The petroleum  concern Total has signed a contract with the local authorities,  who are mixed up in the drugs business. If drugs, as Charles  Pasqua, head of the Interior Ministry, rightly points out, are  the most terrible scourge in the whole world, why then does  France not boycott Morocco, which, on the admission of King  Hassan II himself, has 50,000 hectares of hemp?    The French experts describe the United States as the  "champions of hypocrisy." In order to aid the Nicaraguan  Contras, the CIA and the famous Colonel North did not simply  cover up the drugs dealing in which the Contras engaged--they  actually organized their delivery from Colombia to the United  States.    Afghanistan deserves special attention. When the Soviet  Union was Washington's main enemy, any method of supporting the  mujahidin was acceptable. The CIA used the Pakistani special  services to supply the Afghan rebels with arms. On the return  journey, the trucks carried opium, which was made into heroin at  200 underground laboratories in Pakistan. As a result, opium  production in Afghanistan has risen from 200 tonnes to 3,000  tonnes in the last 15 years.    The West essentially ignores the serious problem of  laundering money obtained from the sale of drugs. The sum is  estimated at $300 billion, 90 percent of which is invested in  industrially developed states. Labrousse warns that Russian and  Italian drugs dealers are beginning to invest their "gains" in  the privatization of Russian enterprises.    Neither Paris, nor London, nor The Hague is in any hurry to  close down banks in Bermuda, Gibraltar, and the Caribbean, where  drugs dollars are kept in total safety.    For many "Third World" countries, the only possibility of  somehow paying for credits lies in the production and sale of  drugs. The IMF demands that they pursue such a tough economic  policy that they have no choice but to cultivate poppies and  hemp or offer their money-laundering services.</p>

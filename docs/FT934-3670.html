			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Legal threats at Lloyd's If Names reject yesterday's offer, many of the agencies which have managed their affairs at the market will face a spate of legal actions over the next few years First big case will start in April next year, involving 3,000 Names who were members of Gooda Walker syndicates 164, 290, 298 and 299 between 1988 and 1990. Names allege negligent underwriting and seek damages of more than Pounds 550m from 71 Lloyd's members' agencies.

The Names face losses of at least Pounds 80m.</p>

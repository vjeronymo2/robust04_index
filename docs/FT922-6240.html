			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Montedison tumbles 70% to L168bn but maintains payout MONTEDISON, the Italian chemical and agribusiness concern controlled by the Ferruzzi family, reported consolidated net profits of L168bn in 1991, a drop of 70 per cent drop on the previous year's L556bn, but proposed leaving its annual dividend unchanged at L50, AP-DJ reports from Milan. The group blamed the sharp drop in profits on the fact that 1990 earnings had been boosted by the sale of its stake in Enimont, the former joint venture with state energy group Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi. Montedison said gross operating earnings rose 12 per cent to L1,828bn last year from L1,631 in 1990. The improvement in the group's operating results was entirely due to its agroindustrial unit Eridania, which reported a gross operating margin of L1,025bn, up 15 per cent from L891bn in 1990. Operating results at Montecatini, the chemical division, slipped 2 per cent to L875bn from L891bn. Better results at its pharmaceuticals, specialty chemicals, specialty polymers and energy divisions were eroded by the tighter margins in the polymers market, which suffered from sluggish demand in the car, construction and electronics industry, Montedison said. IFIL. the Italian holding company which specialises in the food and hotels sectors and is controlled by the Agnelli family, raised net group profits by 42 per cent to L162.5bn last year, Haig Simonian reports from Milan. Net earnings at parent company level climbed 10.8 per cent to L105.5bn, prompting a L10 a share increase in the dividend to L130 for ordinary shares and L150 for savings stock. In an expansion of its hotel activities, IFIL said it now owned 2 per cent of Accor, the French hotels chain, with which it already operates two joint ventures in Italy. The holding had been bought for around L70bn through the Paris bourse and with Accor management's approval.</p>

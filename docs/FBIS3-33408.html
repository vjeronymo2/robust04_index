			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani has declared that the  FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] is denouncing  the electoral process because it feels it will be defeated in  the general March elections. It is unacceptable that they are  denouncing at this time the possibility of fraud in an event  which, like the elections, is still being organized. "We are all  observing how the Supreme Electoral Tribunal is working and to  report fraud is rather ridiculous. I am inclined to think that  what the FMLN is seeking is international publicity," the  president stated.    Cristiani recalled that the Mission of UN Observers for El  Salvador (Onusal) is overseeing the process. "Perhaps the FMLN  already feels defeated," he stressed. Meanwhile, Cristiani  rejected FMLN statements that the government had not consulted  with it on the recent Peace Culture Forum. FMLN Coordinator  Shafik Handal said "the Peace Culture Forum, organized by the  government in coordination with UNESCO, lacks legal validity  because the FMLN was not taken into consideration during its  planning."    President Cristiani stressed that "the government did not  need to consult with a particular sector on all its actions. In  the case of the FMLN, consultations could have been made during  the peace negotiations, but that is over now. FMLN members have  formed a political party, like other groups, and must act  accordingly. Let Shafik Handal make a big fuss, poor Shafik, but  the government should not have to inform him of every one of its  actions," the president highlighted.    Cristiani pointed out that the organization of the Peace  Forum was supported by different groups. He added that even an  international assembly held last year in Salvador Bahia, Brazil,  agreed to support El Salvador in holding that event. Cristiani  made the aforementioned statements at the Camino Real Hotel,  after participating in the inauguration of the National Seminar  of Science and Technology, organized by the National Council of  Science and Technology with the assistance of the Chamber of  Commerce and Industry of El Salvador.</p>

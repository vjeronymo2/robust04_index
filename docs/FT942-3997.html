			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Outdoors: Ferrari's need to win - A look at the profile of a legendary company There is a magic about Ferrari. Although the company only races 16 times a season, and makes a paltry 3,000 road cars annually, virtually everyone has heard of it. It is estimated that one-third of the spectators who attend grand prix come just to watch the red cars bearing the prancing horse emblem. In Italy, Ferrari is one of the few sources of national identity. British teams such as Williams and McLaren have enjoyed far more success than Ferrari over the last decade but they have failed to stir the emotions of the public - this has been left to the drivers, notably Nigel Mansell. In Italy it is the other way round. The fans, the famous tifosi, go in their tens of thousands to watch their beloved Ferrari: support for Italian drivers is an afterthought. Two years ago at the San Marino Grand Prix, held at Imola, not too far from the Ferrari factory at Maranello, both Ferraris retired soon after the start. The tifosi, for whom the race had simply lost its point, immediately left in droves, leaving great empty spaces around the track. Ferrari worship is, not surprisingly, at its most devout at Maranello, a small nondescript town of 15,000 near Bologna, the heart of red Italy. When the new Ferrari Formula One car made its first appearance in February at the team's test circuit next to the factory, more than 1,000 people turned up to watch. The magic of Ferrari is the product of many ingredients. Ferrari is the only team to have entered every grand prix since the world championship was inaugurated in 1950 and for many years it has been the only team which has made both the car and the engine. And unlike every other team, Ferrari has resisted the demands of the sponsors and insisted on its cars being painted red. Up until the early 1970s, Ferrari entered sports car events as well as grand prix, winning at Le Mans many times, and until McLaren's recent involvement, Ferrari was the only team to make production cars as well as racing cars. Enzo Ferrari, the larger than life founder of the firm who died in 1988, was one of the most famous men in Italy, receiving visits from both the Pope and the Italian president. The explanation for the magic of the Prancing Horse is not Ferrari's record on the track. It is true that, until last season when it was passed by McLaren, Ferrari had won more grand prix than any other team. But that is hardly surprising as it has entered far more than anyone else. But since the centre of gravity of the international motor racing industry began to shift to the UK at the end of the 1950s, Ferrari victories have been the exception rather than the rule. The team has not won the world drivers' championship since 1979 and its last grand prix victory was nearly four years ago. Britain's rise as the centre of the motor racing community reflected a deeper shift in the nature of the industry. Motor racing had always been a child of the car industry, with the engine regarded as the heart of any racing car. This remains the Italian tradition. But from the early 1960s, the influence of the motor industry was replaced by aerospace, the engine by aerodynamics and roadholding. With the precipitous decline of a large domestic aerospace industry, the fledgling UK racing companies were well-placed to take advantage of the new synergy: a sophisticated and increasingly international motor racing intelligentsia took root around the M25 corridor around London. Ferrari had no such luck. There was little in the way of an Italian aircraft industry. Ferrari remained rooted in a mechanical culture, assimilating rather than pioneering the latest innovations. When the engines were placed behind rather than in front of the drivers, Ferrari was one of the last to follow suit. When carbon fibre became de rigueur for the construction of the monocoque, Ferrari was obliged in 1981 to appoint a British designer, Harvey Postlethwaite, to introduce the new technology. Even now, when it is clear that the best configuration for a grand prix engine is probably a V10, Ferrari, for reasons of tradition and sentiment, is sticking steadfastly to its beloved V12. Ferrari's fierce sense of tradition has been a formidable handicap in the way of its adaptation to the demands of an enormously competitive and innovative industry. An obvious example is Ferrari's commitment to make both car and engine. The last team to do this was Renault in the early 1980s. It never won the world championship. The technical, logistical and financial strains of doing both are huge. Whatever the disadvantages though, it is impossible to conceive of a Ferrari without a Ferrari engine. As Giancarlo Baccini, Ferrari's press chief put it: 'The engine is where the Ferrari heart beats.' Tradition is also a mixed blessing when it comes to the Ferrari workforce. There has been a long history of employing non-Italians, notably British. It started with Ferrari drivers in the 1950s and slowly spread into the technical areas. Postlethwaite's appointment in 1981 was an important moment, as was John Barnard's as technical director in 1988. They represented a grudging and belated recognition by Ferrari that the epicentre of motor racing lay elsewhere. Nonetheless, the team and its methods remained thoroughly Italian. The opportunity provided by Barnard's appointment - the best designer in Formula One - was ultimately squandered by poor management, and he left. Ferrari's difficulties were compounded by the death of Enzo Ferrari in 1988. Some thought that without the quirks and idiosyncracies of the commendatore, Ferrari could be reborn. But all modern racing teams require a highly skilled, compact and mobile workforce exercising autonomy and initiative - the classic flat structure - combined with a strong figure who provides leadership, focus and discipline. Ron Dennis at McLaren and Frank Williams at Williams are the outstanding examples. With the death of Enzo Ferrari, Fiat acquired 90 per cent control of Ferrari and the team began to lose both direction and personality. After a couple of relatively successful seasons with Barnard as designer, the team went to pot. Slowly, however, Ferrari has been putting together a new team. At its head is Luca di Montezemolo, who was in charge of the Ferrari racing team during the 1970s, when Niki Lauda won two world championships for them. Last July, the Frenchman Jean Todt, who had previously been the successful director of Peugeot Sport, was appointed to head the racing team. Todt, a small man, slightly overweight and with a face a bit like a pumpkin, is under no illusions about the task he faces. He intones that there are no short-term solutions. When asked why Ferrari had failed to deliver the goods, he replied: 'There was a lack of professionalism, an underestimation of what was needed to succeed in Formula One in the present era, a tendency to be too short-term.' Todt is the first non-Italian to head the Ferrari team, a brave decision. He is joined by Englishman John Barnard, the awkward genius who pioneered the use of carbon fibre and semi-automatic gearbox and the most important designer in F1 since Colin Chapman at Lotus, back again as chief designer and based in Shalford, Surrey, where all Ferrari's design work on the car is now done. A few months ago, Ferrari also appointed the Japanese engineer Osamu Goto, who was responsible for the all-conquering Honda V10 of the late 1980s, to take responsibility for research and development in the engine department. And an Austrian, Gustav Brunner, now occupies a senior position on the car side. Ferrari, that most Italian of institutions, has gone international. Todt admitted that in the past Ferrari had been 'too nationally minded'. 'The English teams,' he added, 'are no good at speaking foreign languages, but they are very good at using foreigners and their expertise.' Ferrari is attempting to join them. But whether its international team can be blended to produce success is another matter. Todt recognises that there can be no overnight miracle. 'This season, I just want to win a race,' he said. Ferrari's latest F1 car, a work of great beauty and the most advanced on the starting grid - as befits a Barnard creation - could certainly do that.</p>

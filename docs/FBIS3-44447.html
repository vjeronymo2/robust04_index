			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "China's Aerospace Industry Sets Great Store by </F> Role of Hong Kong"]    [Text] Today, Hong Kong's China Aerospace International  Holdings Limited held a party to mark the 1994 New Year. Liu  Jiyuan, president of the China Aerospace Industry Corporation  [CAIC] and honorary chairman of the board of directors of the  China Aerospace International Holdings Limited [CAIH] flew in  from Beijing specifically to host the party. He said: As the  parent company of CAIH, CAIC will pay great attention to its  development because it is an important window through which the  will proceed to the world. We will surely make a success of it.  In addition to financially supporting CAIH's business, we will  also support its development with high-tech products and  high-tech personnel resources. In particular, we will have to  choose some high-quality and high-efficiency high-tech projects  and inject them into CAIH, the example being the just announced  Guizhou-Jiangnan auto project, so that CAIH's product mix can be  readjusted in a comparatively short time, changing the outlook  of its operation and management, and so that it will produce  comparatively ideal economic returns after one to three years.    He said: CAIC is a technology-led company which integrates  technology, industry, and trade, and which is directly under the  PRC State Council. It was reorganized and set up in June 1993  against the background of reform and opening up and on the basis  of the former Fifth Research Institute of the National Defense  Ministry set up in October 1956, which eventually evolved into  the Seventh Ministry of Machine Building, to the Astronautics  Industry Ministry, and to the Ministry of Aeronautics and  Astronautics Industry. CAIC has accumulated scientific and  technological achievements and management experience over the  past 40 years or more in the astronautics industry, and  possesses powerful scientific and technological strength and  rich management experience, forming a complete air-ground  integrated system that researches, designs, experiments with,  and produces carrier rockets, satellites, and other applied  ground-based systems. CAIC has large comprehensive research  academies including the China Carrier Rocket Research Academy  and the China Space Technology Academy and over 300 research  institutes, three colleges of higher learning, and six large and  medium-sized enterprise groups. Under CAIC are research and  educational institutes and various types of enterprises in 24  provinces and municipalities across the country. It has 270,000  employees of whom 100,000 are professional technical personnel  and 40,000 are senior professional technical personnel. CAIC  currently has assets totaling 30 billion yuan and annual sales  of 8 billion yuan and earns a post-tax net profit of  approximately one billion yuan.    CAIC mainly develops, produces, and deals in all types of  aerospace products and launches all types of series carrier  rockets and various types of applied satellites and scientific  experimental satellites including telecommunications and  broadcasting, meteorological, and earth resources survey  satellites, and various types of earth receivers and applied  systems. CAIC is utilizing the high-tech advantages it  possesses to develop a variety of fair-sized and marketable  civilian products covering electronics, telecommunications,  computers, industrial automation control, petrochemistry,  medical equipment, autos, and all kinds of home electrical  appliances. It has obtained comparatively good economic returns  by developing and dealing in these civilian products.    In the past two decades, eight models of the Long March  series carrier rockets have been developed and manufactured by  China. As of the end of 1993, China had succeeded in launching  36 satellites, five of which were successfully launched into  preset orbits for overseas customers. At present, China  possesses world advanced technology in retrieving satellites,  launching several satellites with one rocket, and launching  stationary satellites. It also has fixed-point, satellite  survey and control, and rocket high-energy and low-temperature  technology. Each year, CAIC is awarded by various ministries  for over 500 scientific and technological achievements and by  the state for a dozen or more achievements.    Since reform and opening up, CAIC has established good  cooperative ties with foreign businesses and has set up 21  solely funded enterprises and joint ventures in the United  States, Canada, Australia, and Russia. Moreover, it has set up  55 joint-ventures and cooperative enterprises with other  countries in China. CAIC and its affiliated companies have  always maintained a good cooperative relationship with Hong  Kong. CAIC launched the satellite Asiat-1 for the Asia  Satellite Company Limited, whose headquarters are in Hong Kong,  with the carrier rocket Long March Three and succeeded in  completing the Buddha Tian Tan project on Lantau Island, Hong  Kong.    Furthermore, CAIC carries out technological cooperation and  has business ties with many countries, consortia, and  corporations around the world. Recently, it signed an agreement  with the U.S. Motorola Corporation by which the corporation will  for the first time invest $40 million to jointly develop an  iridium satellite system. It has also signed an agreement with  the corporation to launch satellites and build three mobile  telecommunications ground stations for it. The company has  signed an agreement with Brazil to develop and launch resource  survey satellites and with Germany's MBB corporation to jointly  develop satellites. It has also set up a joint venture, the  Huadi Computer Company, with Digital, a U.S. corporation. CAIC  has already received service orders for 60 satellites up to the  year 2000, totalling some $1 billion.</p>

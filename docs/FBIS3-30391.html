			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] President Ion Iliescu has been holding  talks with representatives of the Democratic Union of Hungarians  in Romania [UDMR] at Cotroceni Palace this evening. At the end  of more than three hours of talks, UDMR President Bela Marko was  kind enough to answer several questions from journalists.  First, he referred to a list of documents presented by the UDMR  to the president.    [Marko] "This list actually contains a number of older UDMR  documents as well as several more recent documents, including a  draft bill on national minorities and autonomous communities  worked out by the UDMR and already submitted to the Chamber of  Deputies. Consequently, I actually put forth the idea that this  package of documents, this list, contains all the more important  problems of the minorities in Romania and of the Hungarian  minority in Romania; on the other hand, in addition to problems,  it also offers solutions to these problems, through the draft  bill, that is, solutions to a number of concrete issues.    "Of course, the package presented to the president also  includes our position regarding the recommendations of the  Council of Europe, since the majority of these recommendations  coincide with the problems raised in the UDMR memorandum,  namely, the problem of the law on education -- or rather the  problem of the chapter of that draft bill on education dealing  with instruction in the language of the minorities, which has  not yet been discussed or approved by the Education Commission  of the Chamber of Deputies -- the problem of the law on  minorities, the problem of church assets and religious schools,  as well as other concrete problems that could have been solved  without too much delay, such as the situation of the people  imprisoned in the wake of the December 1989 events in Harghita  County and of the events of March 1990 in Targu Mures; despite  the promises of the representatives of the government and of the  institutions of the executive power in Romania, these problems  have not yet been solved."    [Announcer] Bela Marko was asked about President Ion  Iliescu's reaction to the UDMR's proposals:    [Marko] "I must point out that we have very different  positions on a number of major problems. At the same time, we  conducted a rather thorough dialogue on all the problems raised  today and we reached the conclusion that the presidency will  examine the list of documents presented by us, with the promise  that conclusions will be drawn on these matters. However, I  would like to emphasize that our positions are very different on  the majority of the problems discussed."    [Announcer] The UDMR president was asked by journalists to  elaborate on the aide memoire sent by the UDMR to the Council of  Europe.    [Marko] "The aide memoire assesses the current situation,  since four months have elapsed since Romania's admission to the  Council of Europe and, despite the fact that the Council's  people will check on Romania's compliance with these criteria  within six months, for the time being we note that no progress  has been made in the past four months in terms of complying with  those criteria."</p>

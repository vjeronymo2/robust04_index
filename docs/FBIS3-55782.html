The opening State Duma meeting will be held in the  same premises on Tuesday. Taking part in today's session are 32  of the 35 deputies, elected by Muscovites on December 12, 1993.    In his opening address, 61-year-old Vladimir Plotnikov, the  Duma's elder, said that the main task today was to adopt a  statute of Moscow, which will become "a constitution for Moscow  as a constituent part of the Federation." He also voiced hope  that the relatively small membership of the Duma would guarantee  its cohesion.    On Monday, deputies will discuss procedural matters, elect a  speaker, and hear a speech by Konstantin Buravlev, the first  vice-premier of Moscow's Government, who will discuss social and  economic development and the budget for Moscow this year, report  about temporary working groups, and announce an agenda for the  next Duma session, scheduled for January 19.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / French plea for German rates cut MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday called on Germany to reduce interest rates as soon as possible. He also sought to damp down speculation about further increases in French base rates. He urged Germany to 'shoulder its responsibilities' by bringing its rates down, thereby enabling other European economies to follow suit. France's real interest rates, which are among the highest in Europe, are one of the main factors affecting the French economy, and they threaten to be a sensitive issue in the run-up to next month's legislative elections. There is also considerable speculation about another rise in French base rates. Money market rates have risen since the Bank of France last month introduced a new one-day lending facility of 14 per cent to protect the franc, but the commercial banks have held base rates at 10 per cent. This discrepancy has triggered a steep increase in the banks' borrowing costs. Societe Generale, one of the largest banks, estimates that it is losing FFr1m (Pounds 125,000) a day and the whole banking system FFr10m a day. The banks are lobbying the Bank of France to alleviate the impact of high market rates by widening the range of collateral available to them, as it did during the September currency crisis. The French government seems to be gambling that it can prevent an electorally embarrassing increase in base rates if it staves off pressure on the franc for long enough to enable the Bank of France to signal a fall in market rates. Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, yesterday said there were already signs of market rates starting to fall.</p>

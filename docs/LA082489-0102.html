			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 12-YEAR-OLD SAN PEDRO GIRL IN LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES;  </P> <P> VICTORIA STEPS TO PLATE, AND INTO RECORDS  </P> <P> The score was 1 to 0, with the team from San Pedro ahead. Twelve-year-old  Victoria Brucker stretched over her bat, and then pulled her long dark hair  away from her neck, where it was sticking in the muggy Pennsylvania heat. She  picked at the shirt of her uniform.  </P> <P> Finally, she stepped up to the plate, and in doing so on Wednesday became the  first girl to play on an American team in this youngest version of the national  pastime -- the Little League World Series.  </P> <P> With a nonchalance befitting a big league player, which in fact Victoria hopes  someday to be, the Eastview Little League clean-up hitter took one, two, three  casual warm-up swings, while the pitcher from the Tampa sized her up and  prepared to throw.  </P> <P> The crowd of about 10,000 roared from the stands of Lamade Stadium and from the  grassy hill beyond center field, where people had gathered on blankets and lawn  chairs.  </P> <P> Victoria -- who only allows her teammates to call her Vicky -- let the first  pitch go by.  </P> <P> "Strike one!" came the umpire's call.  </P> <P> Her stepfather, 38-year-old Rick Roderick, the first person who ever threw a  ball to her, said he could tell from the stands that Victoria was not herself.  </P> <P> "She's nervous," he said to Victoria's mother, Elizabeth. They had driven 2,700  miles from San Pedro to be here.  </P> <P> In three more pitches, Victoria struck out.  </P> <P> But, as they say in baseball, it ain't over 'til it's over, and Victoria -- the  team's leading home-run hitter -- would find redemption in her next three at  bats.  </P> <P> She walked twice and, in her last at bat, knocked a single through the infield.  She scored every time she reached base, and the San Pedro team, which won the  Western Regional championship last weekend and was playing in a World Series  for the first time, went on to rout the Southern champs from Tampa, 12 to 5.  </P> <P> In all, San Pedro pounded out 14 hits, with three home runs. Tim Harper, who  pitched all six innings, got two hits, as did Gary Sloan and Steve Williams,  both pitchers, and left fielder Joe Sulentor.  </P> <P> San Pedro now advances to the semifinals, playing a team from Trumbull, Conn.,  today for the U.S. championship. If the team is victorious in this game, it  will play for the world title Saturday on network television. In the last five  years, Asian teams have won the Little League title, and this year, the Chinese  team from Taipei, winners the last two years, is touted as the team to beat.  </P> <P> Many of the fans here are pulling for San Pedro -- and Victoria.  </P> <P> It has been 15 years since girls started to participate in organized Little  League, at first playing in a softball division and later creeping onto the  rosters of regular hardball teams.  </P> <P> Although Victoria was not the first female athlete to play in a Little League  World Series (Victoria Roche of Brussels, Belgium, earned that distinction in  1984), she was the first girl on a U.S. team to take part, and the first from  anywhere to get a hit and score a run.  </P> <P> "This year, the girl is gonna get them," Kathy Gilbert, a Little League  staffer, said with a laugh as she distributed press credentials in league  headquarters near the stadium. The cheers for Victoria from the crowd, here to  observe the 50th anniversary of Little League, indicated by their volume that  Gilbert was not alone in the sentiment.  </P> <P> Victoria, a 5-foot, 3-inch, 137-pound first baseman, made several good  defensive plays, twice making good pegs to finish off double plays.  </P> <P> Baseball, as all Little Leaguers seem to divine, is also a matter of style, and  Victoria had all the proper moves down pat. She would stand casually between  plays, weight on one leg, one hand on a hip. She would walk off base a few  feet, and smooth the red dirt with her cleats. Then she would return to the  base, and kick it. And adjust her cap. And lean over, hands and mitt on knees,  ready for play.  </P> <P> "Victoria eats, lives and breathes baseball," said her mother, Elizabeth  Roderick.  </P> <P> "You know how little girls love to get together and play with each other? Not  Victoria. What does she do? If she's home she puts on her mitt and drags her  brother, Adam, (age 8) outside."  </P> <P> Victoria handles questions about herself with aplomb, looking half shy and a  little bored. Before the game, reporters constantly asked her if she felt  special, and she always shrugged and said, "No. I'm just one of the guys."  </P> <P> Then she'd laugh and shrug like a girl who is not yet sure of herself. But she  is sure about one thing: baseball.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hungered for Hardball  </P> <P> From the time she first played T-ball, a modified version of baseball played by  the youngest players, Victoria hungered to play hardball. She refused to follow  the suggestions of many coaches and switch to softball, like many other girls  do.  </P> <P> Victoria says she does not know why that happened.  </P> <P> "I don't really remember," she said during the warm-up, "because I was 9 then.  My mom probably told me to do what you want to do and I wanted to play  baseball."  </P> <P> Victoria's bedroom at home, Roderick said, is "wall to wall" trophies from her  swimming days, which she did before age 9, and baseballs retrieved from home  runs she has hit. The only concession to girlish fancy is a pink wristband. But  the wristband stayed home this week.  </P> <P> This fall, she enters the eighth grade at Dodson Junior High School in San  Pedro, although her teammates, who also are 12, will be entering seventh grade.  Victoria has skipped a grade, and says she earns A's and B's in her studies.  </P> <P> It is too early to choose a career path, of course, but Victoria does have an  early preference.  </P> <P> "I want to play baseball," she said.  </P> <P> Victoria, by her presence, attracted unusual press attention. From the moment  she stepped out for warm-ups, she was surrounded by camera crews and reporters.  </P> <P> Her teammates have accepted the fact that Victoria gets much of the ink, said  team manager Joe Dileva, an insurance agent who has volunteered with the league  for eight years.  </P> <P> "She's just another player to us," he said.  </P> <P> The team is comprised of 14 all-stars from the Eastview Little League in San  Pedro. It earned a trip to the World Series with 17 victories in preliminary  play.  </P> <P> And Victoria carried her load, hitting nine home runs in the early games and  sometimes pitching as well. In one regional game, her stepfather recalled,  opposing players laughed at her. Then she hit a home run. The next time, they  walked her intentionally.  </P> <P> Asked how she thought she played in the Wednesday game, Victoria was modest.  </P> <P> "It was OK," she said.  </P> <P> Her face revealed a more vivid account, however, after her base hit. It was  fairly aglow as she rounded first base, and took a few taunting steps toward  second.  </P> <P> Added her manager: "She was trying to put the ball out in the first. After  that, she calmed down. They didn't give her nothing to hit. They didn't want to  give up a long ball to a girl, I guess."  </P> <P> After the game, Victoria was escorted by a coach to a television interview.  Several times along the way, she had to stop to sign autographs.  </P> <P> "She handles it really well," her mother said, adding in a lower voice, "I hope  that continues."  </P> <P> Victoria, meanwhile, trudged along next to the coach, Nick Lusic. Even though  they won, he was saying, the team didn't play well.  </P> <P> "It was a bad game, really," he said, ticking off mistakes players had made.  </P> <P> Victoria looked up at the sky, where a drizzling rain had started to fall. For  once, it seemed, she'd had her fill of baseball and, more to the point, her  moment in its spotlight.  </P> <P> "I want," she said, "to go to the pool."  </P></p>

"The Romanian-Greek relations, which I can term as  excellent," the president of Romania said, "are based on long  and solid traditions. Along history many have been the  circumstances in which our countries helped each other in  friendship and solidarity. Maybe the inter-war period was the  most flourishing, when Romania and Greece were the promoters of  development and cooperation in the Balkans.    "After the 1989 revolution in Romania, the relations between  Romania and Greece have followed an ascending curve in all  spheres, building an atmosphere of mutual confidence which we  intend to capitalise during this visit. We shall avail  ourselves of this opportunity not only to enhance the relations  of friendship and cooperation between our countries, but also to  find new practical ways of developing the political  consultations, economic collaboration, cultural and human  contacts between our peoples. We have always appreciated the  assistance Greece has rendered to us, the attachment to our  demarches for integration in the European Union and for gaining  full membership to the Council of Europe. The Greek Parliament  was the first to ratify the treaty for Romania's association  with the European Union. It was also Greece that upheld the  idea of non-differential treatment by NATO of the countries in  the Centre and East of Europe and we believe that Greece can  have a new and important contribution in all the phases of  Romania's integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures.    "At the talks we are going to have in Athens we shall  doubtlessly approach the aspects concerning the complex  situation in our region. By dialogue and exchange of ideas we  hope to bring our contribution to finding the best solutions apt  to strengthen stability and peace in this part of Europe,"  President Ion Iliescu said.</p>

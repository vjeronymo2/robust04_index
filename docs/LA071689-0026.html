			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO DEFENSE FOR FIRMS  </P> <P> Regarding your June 11 Viewpoints column, "Should Defense Firms Switch From  Swords to Plowshares?":  </P> <P> Having done some business with defense contractors, I know that retraining  workers on the production line is not a problem. That's a matter of a few weeks  at most.  </P> <P> The problem is in feather-bedded management. How is somebody going to learn to  be competitive in the marketplace on a fixed-price item? In civilian  production, cost overruns are not forgiven or accommodated. Cost overruns mean  bankruptcies.  </P> <P> Universities should gear up to teach executives how to get along with fewer  people, how to cut salaries, including their own, and how to motivate workers  to do quality work and fire those who don't do the job. If universities are  unprepared to teach courses like these because the professors lack the  background, they can enlist qualified instructors from the world of small  business entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> JACK BIRNS  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P></p>

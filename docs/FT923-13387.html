			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER prices appeared to be consolidating at the London Metal Exchange yesterday after the three months position was trimmed back from a morning high at the equivalent of Dollars 2,510 a tonne, dealers said, adding that the uptrend might be resumed later. The price ended at Dollars 2,493 a tonne, up Dollars 23 from the pre-weekend level. In other LME markets the trend was modestly downwards, notably in ZINC, where the cash price fall of Dollars 10 to Dollars 1,292 a tonne widened its discount against three months metal by Dollars 7 to Dollars 22 a tonne. Three months NICKEL closed Dollars 80 lower at Dollars 7,515 a tonne after commission house liquidation triggered stop-loss selling orders. Talk of an imminent 3-month closure of a Chinese nickel smelter for maintenance had little impact. At the London bullion market dealers described GOLD as subdued but steady and no further attempt was made to breach upside resistance at Dollars 350 a troy ounce, although healthy physical offtake from the jewellery trade was reported to be lending extra support. The price closed 25 cents up at Dollars 348.70 an ounce. Patchy buying on continuing South African worries helped PLATINUM to gain Dollars 1.85 at Dollars 386.85 an ounce. Compiled from Reuters</p>

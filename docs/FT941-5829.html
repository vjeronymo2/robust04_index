			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Financial sector prepares to rebuild relations in Malaysia Sir, The current difficulties over commercial relations with Malaysia are of great concern to companies in the financial services sector. Malaysian government policy has been the driving force behind the transformation of Malaysian corporate structure. In assisting the implementation of that policy over many years, we have learnt to value the Malaysian viewpoint and to admire the political stability and economic management of a country which has achieved steady growth averaging more than 8 per cent per annum for the last five years. We are proud to have played a part in this success story. We would encourage both governments to bear strongly in mind the mutual benefits which have accrued through the investment banking industry as well as through the success of Malaysian/UK industrial co-operation. We shall do everything we can to repair the damage. A Tuckey, chairman, Baring Brothers, J Rockley, chairman, Kleinwort Benson, G Mallinckrodt, chairman, Schroders, Sir Michael Richardson, chairman, Smith New Court, Sir David Scholey, chairman, SG Warburg</p>

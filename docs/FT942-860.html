			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (6): End of the Wild West free-for-all - Commercial banking is coming of age Russian commercial banking, one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy, is coming of age - as is the country's central bank, which only recently began taking seriously its role as guardian of the country's financial health. As the central bank gets to grips with banking supervision and responsible monetary policy, the country's 2,214 banks may finally be embarking on a transition from a Wild West free-for-all to competition, consolidation, and regulation. In the latest sign of changes to come, President Boris Yeltsin only two weeks ago gave up attempts to keep western competition out of the domestic market and reversed restrictions on half a dozen western banks licensed to set up full banking subsidiaries in Russia. The licences, issued by the central bank almost a year ago in an attempt to attract western investment and banking know-how to Russia, had been effectively frozen under fierce pressure from some powerful Russian banks. 'Bringing in foreign banks is like saying 'Let's invite foreign police to Russia to deal with crime',' says Mr Garegin Tasunian, chairman of Technobank and deputy chief of the Association of Russian Banks (ARB). Technobank and other ARB members had lobbied for blanket protection against western banks for at least a few years more to give 'Russian banking time to stand on its own two feet'. But apart from bringing in foreign banks to raise standards through increased competition, the Russian central bank has also begun to turn to the task of restructuring and monitoring the health of domestic commercial banks. The growth of Russian banking since the break-up of the old Soviet Union's state banking monopoly in the late 1980s has been prodigious - and virtually unregulated. Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy central bank governor, reckons that with a 71 per cent return on equity last year, banking is probably the most profitable sector of the Russian economy. Benefiting from wild currency fluctuations, high inflation and, until recently, ridiculously cheap central bank credits, banking in Russia has been tantamount to a licence to print money. But the boom days may be numbered since the central bank began charging positive interest rates on loans to commercial banks intended to support industry, agriculture and Russia's northern territories. This form of state subsidy, first attacked by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister, was intended to act as a sort of industrial policy but is now recognised as ineffective and open to corruption. The central bank itself says its official goal is to phase out so-called directed credits altogether so that its resources are allocated only by a new system of auctions introduced this year. It auctioned off 13 per cent of total first-quarter lending to commercial banks of Rbs2,700bn. Meanwhile, in a welcome move to make a clear distinction between lending and subsidies, Rbs6,000bn (Dollars 3bn) which started off the year as 'credits' earmarked for agriculture have already been incorporated into the 1994 budget as straight subsidies. Another improvement for consumers is that Sberbank, the national savings bank, has been paying positive interest rates on savings accounts for the first time since the value of citizens' savings were wiped out by price liberalisation in January 1992. In an attempt to flush out a proliferation of smaller institutions which, to quote Mr Tulin, are just 'pretending to be banks', the central bank decreed from January 1995 a 20-fold increase in banks' minimum capital requirement. Under the old threshold of Rbs100m, he says that entrepreneurs could 'choose between buying a new car and setting up a bank'. From 1999, the threshold will rise further from Rbs2bn to the equivalent of Ecu5m - the present minimum requirement for banks in the European Union. The main game of small banks and financial institutions has been to attract the savings of citizens using deceitful advertising promising very high interest rates. As long as they can continue to attract funds, such institutions may be able to keep their promises to investors for a while. But as soon as the new money runs out, the danger is that if they have not already run off with depositors' money, such institutions will simply collapse. In an attempt to pre-empt such dangers - which take on important dimensions in a country where viewers are used to believing everything they see on television - President Yeltsin earlier this month issued a long-awaited decree banning dishonest advertising. But a potentially more serious threat to the banking sector comes from bigger banks owed large sums of money by ailing enterprises which happen to be their shareholders and may for the first time be allowed to go bankrupt. The threat in this case is of a 'domino' effect of bank crashes precipitating business collapses across the economy. For the first time in post-Communist history, the central bank withdrew licences from 19 banks last year. Another 21 lost their licences for non-compliance with central bank regulations in the first half of this year alone. 'There have been no major banking scandals so far because we have been dealing with small banks, with very few individual customers, and very small companies as clients,' says Mr Tulin. But he reveals that 40 banks now being investigated for potential trouble include some among Russia's top 50 to 100 banks although, he hastens to add, none of them are well-known internationally. Some of the problems are the result of 'classical mistakes' by banks which, for example, invested too much in real estate, including their own new premises, at the expense of liquidity. Other banks were caught napping by the central bank's sharp increase in interest rates from negative levels of 100 per cent to now positive rates of about 200 per cent. Despite the problems, the banks' wealth has attracted not just the keen interest of Russian organised crime, which launders money through the banks without controls, and is behind contract killings of bankers who resist extortion attempts. At a time when industry is starved of capital, certain politicians, including Mr Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister, have issued veiled threats about the need to force banks to lend to the 'productive sector of the economy'. Any attempts to force banks to lend by legislation will not work,' retorts Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the Soviet-era central bank chairman, who until last year expressed more concern about the health of industry than the health of the rouble or the banks. Except when they are acting as transmission belts for state loans to companies, the banks as a rule do not provide medium or long-term loans because of high inflation, still at about 10 per cent a month, and a lack of security for such lending. Typical is the loan portfolio of Incombank, one of the leading private Russian commercial banks. Last year, only 3 per cent of its rouble loans were for more than a year, with 75 per cent up to six months. Although President Yeltsin promised that the arrival of foreign banks would make it easier for entrepreneurs and industry to borrow money at low rates, the western banks also see obstacles to lending in Russia. 'We are prepared to lend to Russian companies if we can get security,' says Mr Dominique Menu, Moscow representative for Banque Nationale de Paris. 'But for the moment this is an economy without sanctions.' Apart from the fact that most clients do not have a track record, many standard tools for assessing credit risk do not apply in Russia, and the most popular methods for recovering loans from bad borrowers remain violent. The only companies which can raise bank finance in Russia today are involved in trading and Russia's more lucrative exports. But the picture may slowly begin to change. In a project inspired by Mr Fyodorov when he was still in the government last year, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is trying to encourage banks to lend to small businesses which could play an important role in the country's economic recovery. For example, Nizhegorodsky Bankirsky Dom, a commercial bank in the reformist province of Nizhny-Novgorod, has already been lent Dollars 500,000 under an EBRD scheme which consists of lending funds to Russian banks which agree to pick up half the cost of loans which do not get repaid. But the main hope of harnessing banks to economic growth is for the authorities to stick to their new-found financial orthodoxy, while making it easier for banks to lend money to companies - for example by improving the courts' ability to handle commercial disputes. Prof Yevgeny Yasin, chief economic analyst for President Yeltsin, says that the government is examining ways of insuring banks against lending risk. Meanwhile, the central bank, whose own irregular practices were revealed in a Coopers &amp; Lybrand audit two years ago, faces the prospect of external supervision on its own activities. Mr Fyodorov, the former finance minister who now heads parliament's sub-committee on central bank reform, has, together with commercial banks, drafted a new law which inter alia would create a supervisory council to monitor the central bank's performance.</p>

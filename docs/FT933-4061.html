			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Technology: At the Sharp end Some 20 years have passed since Sharp, the Japanese electronics company, launched the world's first calculator that used a liquid crystal display. Sharp has placed LCDs firmly at the centre of its devices business, which it believes will provide the company with a big advantage over other consumer electronics makers by helping it to differentiate its products from those of its competitors. The number of R&amp;D staff working on LCD has increased sixfold over the past six years to 1,000 and LCD-related capital expenditure has ballooned to Y100bn (Pounds 630m) over the past three years. The company is already seeing the beneficial effect its expertise in LCD can have on its consumer electronics business. Sharp's camcorder, known in Japan as the ViewCam, uses a four-inch liquid crystal monitor instead of a viewfinder, and is doing well in the domestic market despite sluggish demand for camcorders. Sharp's share of this market is expected to surge on the strength of the ViewCam. The LCD monitor is big enough for on-the-spot viewing and can be rotated 270 degrees for shooting from a variety of angles. The great advantage of the LCD monitor is that there is no need to keep your eye glued to the viewfinder. You can shoot scenes even if stuck behind a crowd. Sharp is also concentrating on LCD television. One of its latest products, the Crystaltron, is a portable television which uses a low-reflectivity thin-film transistor LCD. A big problem with portable televisions has been the difficulty of getting clear pictures outdoors. Because LCDs do not emit light on their own but need to use a backlight, they are more likely to lose picture brightness than CRTs when another light source interferes. Sharp has improved the brightness of the Crystaltron by using a stronger but smaller back light, together with a low-reflectivity LCD panel and by replacing the glass of the front cover with a low-reflectivity material. In order to improve picture quality, Sharp was able to increase the amount of light that reaches the eye after passing through the LCD panel. In the past, only about 40 per cent of the light penetrated the LCD panel, but this has been increased to 48 per cent. Another product using LCD into which Sharp has been putting its energies is projection television. LCD panels are placed inside the projector which makes it much easier to set up than conventional televisions, and portable as well. Since conventional television uses tubes which bend under the influence of the earth's magnetism, they need to be adjusted each time they are set up in a different place. With LCD projection television, that problem is eliminated altogether, says Takashi Matsumoto, general manager of Sharp's LCD visual systems division. Sharp has developed a 2.8-inch high-density LCD panel with 217,945 pixels for the system. By combining three of these panels its projection television produces high quality resulting from 653,835 pixels. There are a number of problems that continue to plague LCDs. Not least is the technological complexity of producing them, which makes LCDs both costly and difficult to make in larger sizes. But the light weight, low-power consumption and flatness of the screens give LCDs an advantage in portable applications that is hard to beat.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Investment-starved companies offer lure of gold Promissory notes backed by gold held in London bank vaults are the latest instrument to appear on Russia's fast-growing and virtually unregulated securities market. Mr Vyacheslav Pankin of the Moscow central stock exchange, where the notes will be listed, reckons that Rbs50bn-100bn (Dollars 27m-Dollars 54m) will be sold in a month's time in the first of several offerings to investors. The fact that the notes will be partially backed by gold held by Rothschild's in London is the main attraction of the instrument, offered by a little-known commercial bank called Russian National Bank. To Russia's investment-starved companies which cannot afford hard currency loans offered by Russian banks at interest rates of around 35 per cent a year, the notes offer a form of collateral to borrow money from western banks at much lower rates. Most western banks refuse to lend to Russian companies in the absence of guarantees they will be repaid. The promissory notes have a maturity of one year. Offered in denominations of Rbs100,000, Rbs1m, Rbs5m and Rbs10m, the notes will carry an interest rate of around 300 per cent, designed to beat high Russian inflation and rouble depreciation. 'The only thing that surprises me about this plan is that nobody thought of it before,' said Mr Pankin. Rothschild's is expected to use gold options to protect itself against fluctuations in the gold market. Russian businessmen and economic reformers are displaying apparently limitless imagination in adjusting new capitalist tools to the particularities of Russian life, which include high inflation, political instability, and the public's lack of faith in the authorities. Mr Boris Nemtsov, the governor of the Nizhny-Novgorod region, said on Friday he had launched a 'telephone loan' promising its purchasers a telephone in their home within six months. The loan, to finance the development of a new telephone network, stipulates that every day of delay in installing investors' new phones will cost the local telephone company a 1 per cent fine. Mr Nemtsov is now planning a housing loan to finance the construction of apartments in a country where millions of adults still live in hostels or communal apartments. Long-term mortgages do not exist in Russia or anywhere else in the former Soviet Union. Nizhny-Novgorod, often seen as Russia's laboratory for economic reform, is soon expected to launch a second regional bond to raise Dollars 55m following a successful first issue worth Dollars 7m. St Petersburg, Russia's second city, will be following Nizhny-Novgorod's example this summer, when it launches a municipal bond designed to help plug a big local budget deficit. Russian citizens and banks hold surprisingly large reserves which they are willing to invest in new instruments, and the main danger to Russia's fast growing securities market is inadequate supervision to protect a credulous public from crooks. While bogus companies, some of which have already disappeared, raise millions of dollars through dishonest but persistent television advertising, the authorities are still squabbling among themselves as to how the market should be policed.</p>

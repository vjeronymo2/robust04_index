			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Banda takes back power President Hastings Banda resumed executive power in Malawi yesterday, in an apparent move to restore order after an army crackdown on Malawi Young Pioneers, the armed wing of the ruling Congress party, Nick Young writes from Lilongwe. Government and party premises were attacked during the crackdown. Opposition leaders doubt Dr Banda's ability to govern after a brain operation and a two-month convalescence, during which power passed to a Congress party triumvirate.</p>

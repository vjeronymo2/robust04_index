			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LET'S HAVE A DEBATE  </P> <P> The people deserve to know the specific voting record of Congressman Elton  Gallegly, and they deserve to hear a real debate between the incumbent  congressman and his opponent, Richard Freiman.  </P> <P> Incumbents have huge advantages -- name recognition, money and access to the  press. The people are the losers; they never hear anything negative about them.  Gallegly's political letters, mailed to his constituents at taxpayers' expense,  are carefully written to his advantage, never addressing anything  controversial.  </P> <P> Congressman Gallegly should accept Richard Freiman's invitation to debate. It's  the democratic thing to do.  </P> <P> MARY BAIRD  </P> <P> Simi Valley  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by the Communist Faction `For Social Justice and </F> Sovereignty of the People'"]    [Text] The very name of our deputies group indicates that  we are consistently fulfilling the will of the voters and our  election programs.    During this critical period marked by the collapse of the  economy and financial system, the impoverishment of the working  people, the wild outburst of organized crime, and the  manifestations of separatism that threaten the very existence of  our state and realizing the whole burden of responsibility for  the fate of Ukraine, we Communists called upon all factions of  the Supreme Council to constructively cooperate in order to  extricate the state from the impasse.    As the most numerous deputies group in the parliament, we  have a moral right to claim the highest posts in the parliament.  However, in order to avoid bitter confrontations in the  struggle for the seats and to proceed, as soon as possible, to  resolving painful economic jumbles, the Communists have not  become preoccupied with their party ambitions. They acted in an  optimal manner, something that is attested to by the quite  concerted election of the Supreme Council chairman.    Quite naturally, we also expected mutual understanding from  our opponents. However, as early as on 19 May, when the  question of electing first deputy chairman of the Supreme  Council was discussed, the right-wing forces declared that their  representative alone had to become first deputy chairman. Even  without starting a normal parliamentary discussion, they  disrupted the work of the session. Having applied known methods  of the old parliament, they simply failed to register, having  thereby disrupted the normal work. They are those same people  who sowed dissent in the preceding Supreme Council.    Voters must know the names of those deputies for whom power,  and not the state, is all that matters.    Particularly alarming is the fact that some representatives  of the "power party" and power structures have united with  national extremists. Using their official position, they resort  to putting pressure upon the left-wing forces.    Almost all mass media have taken their side and are  assailing  the left-wing forces in an organized manner. They employ  well-tested methods of juggling with facts, which is also  attested to by today's statements by the groups "Statehood"  [Derzhavnist] and "Center" [Tsentr].    The most dangerous thing is the fact that this assault by  the  right-wing forces is taking place in the context of Crimean  events, which have recently become particularly exacerbated. In  this connection, the communist faction calls upon its supporters  in the Crimea to do everything possible in order that peace and  harmony would prevail on the peninsula for the benefit of all of  Ukraine's peoples.    We state unequivocally that those forces that are presently  disrupting the work of the parliament are supporting the cause  of separatism.    Standing up, firmly and consistently, for the interests of  the voters, we will do everything we can in order to achieve  peace and harmony in our society. However, the public must also  know about those who oppose this. That is why we reserve the  right to efficiently inform the voters about the events in the  parliament.</p>

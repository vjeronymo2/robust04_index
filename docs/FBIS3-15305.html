During a  conversation, the Hungarian ambassador said in particular that  the Hungarian Government does not recognize the so-called  Ruthenian "shadow government" and regards the question of the  recognition of Ruthenians as an independent nationality as a  Ukrainian internal affair. The ambassador stressed that certain  assessments and views with regard to the "Ruthenian" question  that appear in some of Hungary's mass media do not always  coincide with the government's position.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Violence tops agenda in S Africa: The ANC's week of protest SOUTH AFRICA'S week of protest came to a subdued conclusion over the weekend, overtaken by the prospect of a United Nations observer mission to the country and a call for a thorough investigation into the security forces. The disclosure that Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, spoke to President FW de Klerk by telephone on Friday - the first direct communication between the two men for weeks - fuelled speculation that an early resumption of the stalled constitutional negotiations was likely. Whether the week of protest played a significant part in bringing the two parties together is debatable. An ANC official said yesterday that the two-day general strike on Monday and Tuesday and marches during the rest of the week had strengthened the ANC's hand. But if the objective was to force Mr de Klerk to concede to the early implementation of measures leading to majority rule, there is little evidence of success. Government ministers continue to talk in terms of power sharing - a concept which envisages guaranteed minority representation at all levels of government. In the meantime, the need to curb political violence remains a critical issue. The judge leading South Africa's official inquiry into township killings has called for a full-scale investigation of the country's security forces and the military wings of political organisations. In a weekend statement, Mr Justice Goldstone urged the government to act on recommendations made by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, in his report to the Security Council on Friday. Mr Boutros Ghali proposed that about 30 UN observers be stationed in South Africa to help curb political violence. For some years, Justice Goldstone said, 'there had been widespread and serious allegations' about the unlawful activities of the South African army and police, as well as the guerrilla wing of the ANC and the police force of the KwaZulu homeland. Piecemeal investigations will do no more than 'scratch the surface of the widespread perceptions which make all of these agencies the object of mistrust, distrust and suspicion'. Turning specifically to the South African Defence Force and police force, the judge said that, unless they were 'fully investigated by a neutral and reliable body, they will have no prospect of receiving the trust, confidence and co-operation of the South African public'. The police investigation of the Boipatong massacre in June was criticised last month by a British criminal expert attached to the Goldstone commission. This was followed by allegations from a prominent pathologist that police brutality had been responsible for scores of the deaths in custody that he had investigated. The judge also noted that the continued existence of the ANC's guerrilla wing had been a cause of complaint, especially from Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party. At the same time, commented the judge, the activities of the KwaZulu police force had come under question. 'It is widely perceived to be a force acting as the arm of the IFP.' In short, he concluded: 'The commission believes that, if it is not able to investigate fully the operations of these agencies, it will not be able to carry out its mandate of making recommendations for curbing the violence.' The judge also raised the possibility of offering an amnesty to members of organisations allegedly involved in violence, saying this 'would make the work of the commission more efficient and searching'. The grudging response of the police to criticism of their Boipatong investigation, and the truculent conduct of SADF counsel at the Goldstone commission, suggests that both parties remain reluctant to open their activities to detailed scrutiny. Indeed, observers believe that without amnesty provisions, their co-operation will be difficult to obtain. As for Mr Boutros Ghali's recommendation that UN observers should be sent to South Africa, Mr de Klerk has already made clear that he supports such a proposal in principle.</p>

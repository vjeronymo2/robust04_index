			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNING: THESE LETTERS COULD BE HAZARDOUS TO DIE-HARD A'S FANS  </P> <P> So Dave Stewart claims that his is still the better team.  </P> <P> Well, I want to thank Dave for clearing things up for me. I was under the  misconception that teams like the A's, Reds and Yankees of the '70s were great  teams simply because they consecutively won World (Series) championships. But  now, Dave, I'll have to change my view. You've made it obvious that winning  isn't the indicator of true greatness, but rather how often a team gets into a  position to win a championship.  </P> <P> I guess that puts your club right up there with the Denver Broncos and  Minnesota Vikings. Congratulations.  </P> <P> LANCE BARNETT  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P></p>

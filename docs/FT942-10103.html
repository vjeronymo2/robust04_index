			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / People: Wathen resurfaces at NatWest Chris Wathen, who left Midland Bank last month after his job as managing director of branch banking and was eliminated in a reshuffle has reappeared at National Westminster Bank as general manager in charge of human resources. The appointment is against the trend; clearing banks have been recruiting outsiders from different industries, and NatWest was sifting through non-bankers for its vacant post when Wathen unexpectedly appeared on the job market. Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief executive, says it is 'not common to find someone available with this breadth of experience at a senior level'. He says NatWest approached Wathen when it heard that he had left Midland. Wathen will join the executive group at NatWest's group head office which comprises Wanless, senior group executives such as John Melbourn, the deputy chief executive, and the heads of the bank's operating divisions such as branch banking. Wanless says that NatWest was not merely putting Wathen into his new post in the short-term. 'He will be able to contribute as a member of the team, but he is coming to do a particular job for the foreseeable future.' Wathen, 48, has experience of human resources, having been group personnel director of Midland before becoming managing director of branch banking. Before that, he was in charge of handling its relationship with Hongkong Bank. The job of handling NatWest human resources became vacant in February when Stuart Chandler, the general manager who was responsible for human resources and strategic development, became deputy chief executive for branch banking.</p>

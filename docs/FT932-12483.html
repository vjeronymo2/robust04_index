			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Russia 'faces collapse' without rapid reforms: West and Moscow officials warn of financial failure RUSSIA FACES financial collapse and risks a social explosion if President Boris Yeltsin fails to put radical economic reforms into place immediately, western economists and Russian officials warned yesterday. The dominant fear in Moscow is that between now and elections, which might be held this autumn, the pre-referendum ploy of keeping voters happy by delaying harsh reform measures and issuing boundless credits to avoid bankruptcies would continue. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister for nationalities and an important aide to Mr Yeltsin, said that without decisive action, 'the rouble will disappear by the autumn' as more people lose confidence in it. Mr Sergei Vassiliev, head of the government's Centre for Economic Reform, said there were 'strong political imperatives now for delay in reforms. Mr Yeltsin should right now implement tough policies, but he won't'. He said the government was not in control and he expected 'there could be hyperinflation by the autumn. People don't understand what hyperinflation means, and so we will have to live through one before we get stabilisation'. The government meets tomorrow and is likely to try to approve the economic measures, including a control on credits, delayed by the referendum campaign. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent economist and a candidate for the presidency, believes the government also represents 'an enormous compromise with conservative forces, which means that it is no longer able to control inflation, but is simply a forum for the political struggle'. Since Mr Yeltsin has constructed a compromise cabinet to placate the centre ground whose support he needs, he will not disturb the balance before new elections - although Mr Shakhrai said there would be a 'reshuffle of posts' in the next few days. Within this cabinet, the radical ministers known to the west are a small and embattled minority. Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister in charge of finance, has said that of the 117 people of ministerial rank in the government, only four understood the market system: Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy premier for privatisation; Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy premier for foreign economic affairs; Mr Shakhrai and himself. The latest Yeltsin appointment was Mr Oleg Lobov, an old ally of the president but deeply sceptical of radical reform. He is now first deputy prime minister in charge of the economy - vying with the other first deputy, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, and outranking Mr Fyodorov at the finance ministry. This issue is expected to be the subject of heated debate at the cabinet meeting tomorrow. Mr Vassiliev said even the radical ministers had not been able to get a strong grip on credit expansion. That would lead, he said, to a reversal in the recent fall in inflation from 27 per cent a month in January to about 15 per cent last month. Independent figures show there is likely to be a rise to 20 per cent or more this month and more in May, as raised pensions make an impact.

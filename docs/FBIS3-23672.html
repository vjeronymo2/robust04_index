			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valdis Kiploks: "The Quiet, Merciless War: </F> Sending Unarmed Soldiers into Combat is a Crime!"]    [Text] Valdis Kiploks continues his discussion of the  disorder and even degradation in Latvia's defense organizations.  At the center of attention: the Home Guard. But not it alone...    One must agree with Defense Forces Commander D.  Turlais's statement that right now the threats to the  independence and security of the Latvian state are greater than  the ability to thwart them (interview in the newspaper LABRIT,  26 January of this year, "A Running Officer Provokes Laughter in  Peacetime".) Previously (RIGAS BALSS, 4 January) I wrote "The  Quiet, Merciless War" about the growth in Russia's legal  activities related to the withdrawal of military forces from our  country. We must return to these themes yet again, first of all  because the government has finally seemingly recognized the  priority of national defense and also the Saeima has approved  supplementary sums for these needs. But this money will provide  only evil if serious endeavors are not undertaken to clean up  defense organizations.    The complicated state defense system can be simplified in  the  classical way by thinking of it as a tiered fortress defense, in  which the first line of defense is manned by diplomats, the  second by ideology, the third by national industry; the fourth,  though, is the fortress itself, that is the national military  defense forces. If the first three lines of defense spend their  time in uninterrupted struggles which the founder of military  theory, Clausewitz, reminds us that peacetime is only imaginary,  then defense forces in this time carry out only the role of  catalyst. In an active battle they would be drawn in and their  direct functions will be carried out only in time of military  conflict, therefore in the event of final necessity, when the  first three lines of defense have not achieved what is desired.  Of course, the meaning and arrangement of these lines of defense  varies from country to country. For example, in the  over-militarized Russia, all defense is based almost entirely on  the military complex and that dominates the diplomatic,  psychological, industrial and other spheres. In such a country  the diplomat Kozyrev or the politician Zhirinovskiy can afford  to explore openly armed provocations; their national defense  will not suffer from it, for that is guaranteed by a giant army,  armed with weapons of mass destruction, and the consequences of  their use scientists can only predict, but not precisely  calculate. There are similar defense systems in all of the  militarized great powers except Japan and Germany. The latter  was not permitted by the victorious countries to develop a new  Wehrmacht after its capitualation in 1945 and it now is  seriously reviewing its defense doctrine. Similar defense issues  are being resolved also in the war-vanquished Japan.    Such a model of defense, which was forced on Japan and  Germany, but on smaller countries because of meager resources,  cannot protect and they came to establish a total defense  system, in which all lines of defense flowed together in a  seemingly amorphous formation, though actually each  insignificant basic organization is subordinated in coordinated  action from one center. The exceptions are the defense forces,  which stand as a discrete organization carrying out training,  supply, and the aforementioned coordination functions. That is a  description of an ideal type, in which there would not be also  military defense forces, but all the country's defense problems  would be resolved by "public defense," which was offered as an  alternative to the military by Albert Einstein Institute senior  researcher J. Sharp in his speech at the symposium, "New  Thinking About European Security." (It is known in Latvia in an  expanded version as the brochure, "Defense of Independent  Countries Without War and Destruction.") But Mr. Sharp should  have known that science and philosophy would permit such an  ideal--absolute harmony--only as a momentary pause, after which  the rapid slide downward begins, so that the concrete process  begins anew, a difficult ascent, but of a different quality. And  that is a sufficient basis to conclude that "public defense"  alone can never be an alternative to a military. If we truly  want to defend ourselves, then we can only go down this road of  plenty and there is no alternative.    It becomes clear from the D. Turlais interview that Latvia  still does not have a national defense doctrine, since the  Defense Ministry must analyze potential threats to our country.  But what should be the relationship between this analysis and  the working out of the basic law on national defense? National  defense cannot be implemented for just some individual event,  but must be effective against any, often sudden and unforeseen  type of attack. This defense force "umbrella law" must  determine, according to a defense system developed according to  some model, how we will arrive at the end result and how that  will be integrated, first of all, with the Baltic states' mutual  defense system. Two years have passed since the renewal of the  country's independence. Yet, we still have no laws nor  doctrines. But there have been no changes made in the  composition of Defense Ministry personnel. And, if that has not  yet been done, then there is a basis for thinking that in the  Defense Ministry they are not exerting themselves by sitting on  eggs that will never hatch, and that the empty nest-egg should  be taken out.    But, if we are talking about threats to our national  security, then it would be interesting to know the conclusions  of such a competent analysis regarding which is more dangerous:  the activities of Zhirinovsky's without political anesthesia,  self-declared, Russian "Derzhavniki" [Statists], or  the masked "Western expansion," and what might be the defense  against each of these events? Everybody knows the facts about  the transfer of many millions of dollars, which the Central  Committee of the CPSU donated to the Communist parties they  maintained in various countries, not to fund picnics, but to  maintain the dirty deals and destructive actions connected with  associated companies in these countries. But now, right in front  of our eyes, innumerable foreign companies with dubious  reputations are establishing here practically uncontrollable  foreign joint ventures, including Russian and local  self-seekers. And all of the negative by-products of this  process show that the characteristics of those activities are  the same as those for which some USSR Communist party paid such  collosal sums in the West. Just on 10 January of this year the  conflict in Riga's Vidzeme borough plainly showed that making  contact with with such puzzling organizations will be much more  dangerous than the Skrunda radar remaining and that a whorehouse  established by some foreign country's military personnel (their  existence at their respective addresses is news to the municipal  authorities) could give rise to a military conflict fateful to  the country. These facts alone already create the belief that  our government's publicized "Western investment" in Latvia is  nothing more than the same Communist money flooding in through  the West. And the apparent sharp disagreement provoked by the  East serves only to deflect attention from this, our country's  truly dangerous process. Although in Russia it has been even  officially announced that for political purposes gigantic sums  will flood into Latvia.    It is clear that the delay in working out the basic law on  national defense connects the Defense Forces commander and his  actions in the work of the existing headquarters and creates  chaos in subordination of defense forces, thereby directing them  down the path of degradation. National defense cannot be  developed today by fitting it to some personality or situational  flow, but we must proceed in accordance with the law, in  developing a concrete defense system. And we will immediately  see where such unnecessary delay takes us.    Today it is clear to every somewhat thinking person that  Latvia's defense cannot be ensured by barbed wire fences and  minefields on the country's borders, nor could it be done with a  Maginot or Mannerheim line. Only the aforementioned seemingly  amorphous national total defense formation can create the threat  of unacceptable casualties to an invader and cool the heads of  warriors. If we accept that right now the worries about our  security are directly related to Russia's behavior, then  Russia's critical demographic characteristic right now still  shows that the former popular and military mass is not there any  more and so this factor cannot be depended on.    The most appropriate defense to develop in a modern state  was  the Home Guard. Correctly organized, well trained, armed and  supplied, it could have become the basis for such a defense. But  at that time, contrary to the accepted standards of defense  development, it was not subordinated to the Defense Ministry and  the supreme command of the Defense Forces. And what is happening  there now?    In the training for the officers of the Riga Home Guard  brigade in October, company commanders spent a whole week  learning how to determine proper protocol for a completely woozy  person, that it is humane to hit someone sleeping on the street  in the nose, to make it bleed, because without bleeding and some  apparent trauma medics simply will not take this person and he  will freeze, and that car theft does not qualify as theft,  because such a crime is missing an "objective side." They  clarified still others of the Russian criminal code demagogic  absurdities actually in force and the militia's acquired tricks.  And such training is paid for, so, as was said on television,  more will be carried out!    Theorists of revolutionary wars and practice prove that  organizations established according to voluntary principles,  such as our Home Guard, can have only one task: to protect the  people and the country. Losing that, it disintegrates with the  tendency of individual groupings to develop new or to integrate  themselves with already existing criminal character  organizations. Thus the world-renowned Italian mafia, "la Cosa  Nostra," developed from the self-defense organizations of  Sicily's inhabitants. Totalitarian regimes did not permit the  existence of organized crime without state sanction (the coming  into existence of those is one of the surest weaknesses of the  regime and symptoms of imminent collapse), therefore after  carrying out their assignment these organizations are simply  liquidated. Thus totalitarian regimes liquidated the  Oprichniki, the early Chekha, the  Istrebiteli, Rem's Shturmoviki in Red  Russia, and the Red Guards--the implementors of the "Cultural  Revolution" in China.    This same destruction theory and practice is safely and  effectively used by psychological warfare specialists and  parallel to the chief task in these organizations or popular  movements with patriotic motivation brings in some side  assignment or responsibility. With that division, the  organization is innoculated with the virus and its movement in  the main direction is practically halted. A glaring example of  this sort of invasion is found in the actions of the Supreme  Council, etc.    The people who joined the Home Guard were patriots, and in  the beginning it was organized to protect Latvia's independence.  But now at such a critical time to the country, it is obviously  being shifted to carrying out police auxilliary service  functions! Thus, it is on the road to degradation and  disintegration!    One of the characteristics of revolutionary war tactics, to  influence the enemy in the most painful way possible, is the  fourth thesis formulated by Mao Zedong: "Concentrate in every  battle on superior enemy forces." This thesis must be understood  to mean that by pretending to rob banks, telegraph centrals and  other objects one achieves their stationary guard. And, the more  objects that are guarded, and the larger numerically are the  guard units, the more beneficial the situation will be for the  attackers. A well-planned operation in such an instance will  involve a numerically small, well-prepared group of men, who can  destroy many numerically large guard units in a few hours.  Working out countermeasures to such tactics the German military  specialist E. Vorwerk wrote: "One must have the perimeters of  objects guarded by those who have a stake in saving the country.  For the most part the existing protected objects and sensitive  points must be locked together in object groups, which are close  together, and they must be protected by roving patrols, but at  irregular times."    And what is our Home Guard occupied with right now? Chiefly  with the stationary protection of companies able to pay to  protect themselves! It is hard to believe that that is out of  ignorance or circumstance; it is more logical to conclude that  the Home Guard is deliberately being prepared in conformance  with the aforementioned scheme or even without pretend robberies  and noises, with the help of the same aforementioned Communist  party money.    An increase in funding from the state budget for the Home  Guard in such a situation will only promote it as the collapse  of the national defense organizations. And that is why it is  without resistance subordinated to the Defense Ministry and the  Defense Forces command, no matter how powerless and undeveloped  this ministry is right now. The experience of Lithuania and  Estonia is that with such a merging of defense forces protests  from some Home Guard commanders or even units could be  anticipated. But that will only prove that it is not in their  own personal interest to subordinate themselves to anyone and it  will clearly show how productive were the activities of the  rotting invaders of the the Home Guard.    Both the Defense Forces and the Home Guard still are short  of  weapons. We are talking here about the most basic soldier's  armaments: mortars, grenades, machine guns, automatic rifles,  flame throwers, etc. That must be labeled as particularly  illogical because producing these weapons is simple in reality.  The experience of war indicates that producing them without  particular difficulty can be begun in a week's time wherever  there are general-purpose metalworking tables. Latvia has enough  specialists and all the prerequisites for light weapon  production. In its place they open a monopoly company store,  where Home Guardsmen must use their personal resources to  acquire pistols and carbines, but not the automatic weapons  needed for defending the country. In addition, even these  limited arms end up in the hands of civilians who have money and  a personal interest. No one in the government has shown any  interest in weapons so essential to national defense, such as  mortars, grenades and automatic rifles, and none of the Riga  Home Guard batallions have any of that. One must must be  severely limited to be unable to understand what kind of  policies and from what quarters it comes!    Production and sale of battlefield weapons is one of the  most  profitable businesses in any country and in the current  situation it cannot be allowed to be managed by a private  company. Such action will permit store proprietors to skim off  public money intended for national defense needs into their own  pockets, and state control over this branch would be lost.    The battle readiness of the army, including the Home Guard,  is determined by three factors. "If one of them is zero or only  at a low level, then the level of battle readiness, irrespective  of the strength of the other indicators, will not exceed the  level of the lowest factor. Therefore, if the army is not armed,  then the remaining determinants of battle readiness cannot save  you." For the sake of clarity in his interview Mr. Turlais  should have expressed this axiom to its end, that is, "A  government that sends into battle unarmed soldiers, is a  criminal one."    Completely puzzling in the interview are the Defense Forces  commander's statements about the functions of the Defense  Ministry, it activities and his relationship with this  institution. In reality and also in essence, the Defense Forces  commander also is a member of the government and democracy would  not tolerate it if the supreme commander would also be the  Minister and the Defense Ministry did not exist. The division of  power principle would not change by that. Defense ministries  were established in the highly organized countries to free  defense force commanders from all the ancillary duties, such as  supplies, finance and other similar questions and so they coiuld  effectively resolve only one assignment: the military defense of  the country. In addition, by establishing a total model of  national defense, all civilian spheres are included and the  defense ministry must resolve problems associated with it. Here,  too, issues of a military character remain within the competence  of the supreme commander. One can imagine what kind of defense  that would be in war time, if military operations were planned  by a civilian ministry and the commander received those plans  the evening before the battle.    In his ignorance the staggering officer will be no better  than the running one to whom D. Turlais referred. And, freeing  ourselves from Soviet thinking, we must still understand how to  avoid falling into the trench of helplessness. The Defense  Forces commander is and must be the person who has the final  word in all military questions, within the national defense  policy confines determined by the Saeima and Constitution, of  course. And such a commander will have the recognition and  support of the people.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: KAPSTEIN, PADRES TO YANK VIP SEATS  </P> <P> Jerry Kapstein, after being informed of several complaints by Padre season  ticket holders over the construction of 70 field-level seats that would  diminish the quality of their own, said Sunday that the seats will be removed.  </P> <P> The VIP seats were added in January along the first- and third-base lines  behind the dugouts for Padre executives to entertain sponsors and guests, but  Kapstein said that the Padres now will spend additional funds to remove the  seats.  </P> <P> Kapstein, who was hired Thursday to oversee the daily operations of the Padres,  said in a prepared statement: "It has been brought to my attention that plans  were made and acted upon to add 70 field-level seats for the 1990 regular  season. We are taking immediate action by ordering the cancellation of these  plans. We will do nothing that is contrary to the best interest of our loyal  and valued season-ticket holders. Business and ticket operations have been  installed to put the field-seating configuration back as it has been in  previous years." BOB NIGHTENGALE  </P></p>

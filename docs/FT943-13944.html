			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Sport: C stands for seaworthy - Sailing / Keith Wheatley draws up his own guide to top sailing events Something about the letter C appears to have seized hold of the sailing world - Cork Week, Commodore's Cup, Cowes Week - they all take place this month. The letter C is about all these events have in common, however, marvellous though each of them is. CORK WEEK Cork Week has been described as 'a party with yachts'. The organisers promise in the Notice of Race that no competition afloat should take more than about three hours, thus leaving ample time for the festivities to re-convene in the marquees ashore. In spite of its grand and authentic claim to be the world's oldest yacht club, the Royal Cork promotes Cork Week with almost teenage zest. The grounds of the RCYC, above the harbour at Cross-haven, are turned into a tented village with bars, shops and restaurants. Nearly 400 boats turned up to race this week in 10 classes, making the Irish regatta one of Europe's largest, second only to Cowes in the number of entries. The heatwave and light airs were a marked contrast to 1992 (the event is bi-annual) when rain and gales lashed down, requiring even more inner fortification. Such conditions can be disastrous for the big racing machines that even their opponents want to see at full blast. Yachts such as Richard Mathews' ex-America's Cup 12-metre Crusader, the Swan yachts Highland Fling VII (Irving Laidlaw) and Desperado (Richard Loftus) had to wriggle through big packs of smaller boats. Only the latter found enough of a lead to save its handicap. Laidlaw has been a keen and successful competitor at the regular Swan regattas around Europe and has persuaded the Finnish yard to build him the first fractionally-rigged Swan in Highland Fling VII. Success on the water - two wins in the first three days - indicates that other racing owners may soon be calling on Swan to vary the previously obligatory masthead rig. Laidlaw's new boat made Desperado, 10ft longer and theoretically faster on handicap, look pedestrian. THE COMMODORE'S CUP The Royal Ocean Racing Club created the inaugural Rolex Commodore's Cup two years ago. Its function was to let owners of non-Grand Prix production yachts compete for their country in an international competition. There was a widespread feeling that the Admiral's Cup had become an entirely professional event, with oblivion and penury likely for amateur competitors. However, rivalry for places in the Commodore's Cup national teams has been so intense that one skipper suggested United Nations intervention. Of the nine nations competing, the US and Germany are bringing two three-boat teams. And the American crew whose Mumm 36 Pigs in Space was held to ransom in a Merseyside wharf dispute can confirm that dock strikes are not a slice of history. Officially, England has but one team when racing begins on Wednesday. However, the Jersey team consists largely of top British big-boat sailors anxious to avoid the knife-fight of the selection process. Graham Walker's crack Indulgence heads the Channel Islands' effort, with the interesting Tram in support. In her initial guise of an IOR one-tonner, Tram was better known as the King of Norway's yacht Fram XI, sunk so spectacularly last year by Harold Cudmore during the Admiral's Cup. Also competing is a Welsh team. A trio of yachts, Eagle, Integrity and Shogun, that just missed the England call-up tried to register as England-B. RORC polled the field but only England-A objected. So the owners scoured Welsh sailing clubs to make up a requisite 30 per cent crew on each boat of the appropriate nationality. Sheep carried as ballast were ruled not to count. COWES WEEK As usual with Cowes Week, beginning on July 30, the sailing will be excellent while the onshore muddle continues. Unfortunately, good on-the-water organisation is expensive. Without sponsorship, entry fees for an average 32ft yacht might rise from around Pounds 250 to Pounds 750. This year's fairy godmother seemed to have arrived in the form of the Japanese-owned Aquascutum clothing company. But then at Easter, when the Pounds 100,000 sponsorship deal was close to completion, Aquascutum's advisers discovered that Cowes Combined Clubs had sold the Japanese rights in the name Cowes Week a decade ago. Exit Aquascutum. Lawyers began combing Greater Tokyo for the Mr Yamaguchi who owns the trademark purchased in perpetuity, it seems, for the princely sum of Pounds 1,000. However, in the nick of time the taxpayer rode to the rescue. Medina borough council came up with a Pounds 100,000 financial package to support Cowes Week. MBC said in its announcement that the regatta brought in Pounds 6m to the island during the eight-day event, in a struggling local economy where 25 per cent of jobs depended on tourism. Residents steeped in local government cynicism observed that since the council was shortly to disappear in a reorganisation that will bring a unitary authority to the Isle of Wight, the grant to the yachties might be seen as a last carefree fling with the chequebook by councillors who will not have to go back and face the electorate.</p>

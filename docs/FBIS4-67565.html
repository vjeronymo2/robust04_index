			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Shmelev: "Kremlev Phantoms"] </F>   [Text] In the mid-1960's all radio stations often  used to air the song "Blue Cities." Do you remember the words?  "Sometimes people dream of blue cities with no names..."    This was some prankster's big joke at our censorship, the  most powerful in the world. He hailed cities that never existed  on any map. But these phantom cities did have names, and their  names were quite poetic: Sarov, Ozersk, Verkh-Neyvinsk,  Saraklych, Zolotaya Sablya [Golden Saber]... On secret charts,  however, their names sounded more boring: Arzamas-16,  Chelyabinsk-65, Zlatoust-26... There also were ZATO's ("Closed  Administrative/Territorial Units").    Seven cities were formed by the 17 March 1954 edict in  locations which contained establishments of the Ministry of  Medium Machine-Building nuclear weaponry complex. Forty years  ago. (Besides the three cities mentioned above, there were  Krasnoyarsk-26, Sverdlovsk-44, Tomsk-7, Sverdlovsk-45.) Three  more were added a little later: Chelyabinsk-70, Krasnoyarsk-46,  and Penza-16.    For the entire 40 years the numbered cities existed under  conditions of total secrecy. They were absent from post office  directories and statistical reference books; they were also  excluded every time there was an official census or when voters'  lists were compiled.    Every road that led into such a place was blocked by barbed  wire strung along its perimeter and had a military checkpoint at  the point of entry. Further on, there was the territory of a  military unit with another checkpoint at the exit. Only after  these two filters could one get to a "Zero city." This "close"  atmosphere contributed to a specific "zero" mentality. On the  one hand, for instance, these phantom cities had a high level of  technical education because the defense used to draw the best  graduates from the best schools. On the other hand, there was  also a hysterical spy mania and a caste disassociation from the  "uninitiated."    On the one hand, there is patriotism deserving nothing but  respect and an obsession with work (many "zero" residents do not  know what vacations are and have not gone beyond the barbed wire  for years). They also have strict morals typical of restricted  communities and monasteries. On the other hand, there is a  humanities gap borne by being so remote from any source of  culture and by the restricted character of these science-towns,  closed to artists' tours, congresses, festivals, student  Olympics, etc. There are also GULAG traditions inherited from  the prisoners who built the cities. All this results in  flourishing provincial conservatism. "Zeroites" cannot stand the  press media. To this day they are overly careful as they mumble  "site," "item," "experiment," "building N" instead of "reactor,"  "bomb," explosion," "storage vault..." Meanwhile, their faces  acquire an expression as if they need to go to the bathroom on  serious business.    Zero cities have their own specific features: the totally  geometric layout of their streets, groups of marching soldiers,  plenty of sports grounds and arenas.    Another distinctive feature of the science-towns is their  ecological unpredictability. Neither the unique underground, 250  meters deep, atomic station of the Krasnoyarsk mining and  chemical combine, nor the Chelyabinsk complexes which process  the exposed fuel and produce weapons-grade plutonium, nor the  cyclotrons of Dubna, Protvin, and Arzamas have undergone  independent ecological analysis for decades. But who used to  control the radiation environment? It was the services of the  same classified complex that created this radiation danger in  the first place. In other words, I drink, and then I take myself  to the sobering-up station too...    One can imagine the results of all this. Especially  considering that even in the open city of Moscow, which is as  stuffed with secret sites as a Christmas turkey with apples,  radiation ecologists are wandering under solid fences trying to  use the wind rose, at least, to figure out the parameters of  radioisotopes and other toxic pollutants emitted into the  atmosphere. Moreover, radioactive sources and waste are being  found in neighboring kindergartens and private apartments. One  can imagine what is happening behind those fences.    A new dawn is finally breaking over the phantom cities. The  Russian Federation Government issued an edict on 4 January 1994  which officially assigns the following geographic names to them:  Zheleznogorsk (Krasnoyarsk-26), Kremlev (Arzamas-16), Zarechnyy  (Penza-19), Novouralsk (Sverdlovsk-44), Zelenogorsk  (Krasnoyarsk-45), Lesnoy (Sverdlovsk-45), Seversk (Tomsk-7),  Ozersk (Chelyabinsk-65), Snezhinsk (Chelyabinsk-70), Trekhgornyy  (Zlatoust-26). Some of the information on these cities has been  declassified.    We learned that, by 1 January 1993, the population of the  big  10 among Zero cities numbered 723,000 people instead of the 123  million claimed by OGONEK a couple of years ago. According to  data provided by the Main Administration for Social Policy of  the Minatom [Ministry of Atomic Energy], they enjoy the services  of 385 kindergartens and nurseries, 149 schools, nine higher  education establishments, nine vocational technical schools, 21  movie theaters, four puppet and four music and drama theaters,  10 music schools, 23 libraries, seven museums, 105 gyms, 18  stadiums, 10 swimming pools, 24 young pioneers' camps, etc.  Unemployment is still rather low there--only 7,518 were  unemployed as of December of last year.    These data, however, do not cover other numbered locations  (Shkotovo-22, Krasnoyarsk-39, Zagorsk-7, Severodvinsk,  Golitsyno-2). Neither do they disclose the number of reactors,  nuclear fuel storage vaults, stored total energy, radioactive  waste dumps, the technology for its conditioning, methods of  radiation monitoring, the number of times the Minatom dinosaurs  were visited by ecological commissions of international  Greenpeace, of the Doctors of the World for the Prevention of  Nuclear War committee, of the Toward a New Earth movement, and  other nonagency experts.    However, it is not everybody that wants to make the  information on Zero cities public. A representative poll of  Chelyabinsk-Ozersk residents conducted by the city  administration sociological group at the beginning of this year  showed that the absolute majority of the people (82 percent)  spoke unequivocally against "opening" their city...</p>

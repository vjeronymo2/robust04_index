			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The U.S. Air Force canceled all its air shows in West Germany for 1989, six  months after the Ramstein Air Base crash that killed 70 people and injured  hundreds, a military spokesman at the base said. Three Italian stunt jets  collided in flight over Ramstein on Aug. 28, and one of the flaming planes  plowed into a crowd of spectators. That crash, and a series of allied training  flight crashes in West Germany last year that killed more than 100 people,  caused a public outcry and demands for a stop to low-level military flights.  </P></p>

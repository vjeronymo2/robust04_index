			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Patten may back fees from students MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday gave the strongest signal yet that the government is seriously considering raising extra funds from students for universities. Mr Patten, who was addressing the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals at Leicester University, said that no options were ruled out. He added that the taxpayer benefited from higher education in a less direct way than graduates. However, he suggested that different universities should not be allowed to charge different levels of fees. The committee last month commissioned a report by consultants London Economics on four methods of extra funding from students, and today will announce which is favoured. The options include: increased income tax for graduates; loans to pay for flat-rate tuition; loans for living costs; and loans for additional 'top-up fees' that may be charged by universities. Under the last option, universities could charge differential fees to students, without subsidy from the government. This option was attacked on Tuesday by Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary. Mr Patten has also signalled reservations. In a series of questions for the vice-chancellors, he asked: 'Should selection for entry to higher education continue, as far as possible, to be made on educational grounds with no student excluded because of the need to contribute financially? As you know, the government has been concerned in the past on this point in connection with the possible introduction of top-up fees by individual universities.' He also asked the vice-chancellors if they wanted to continue expanding higher education, and whether there was any evidence that students who contributed towards their tuition were more motivated. Mr Patten defended quality checks in university departments by higher education funding councils. He also backed the higher education charter, launched earlier this week and attacked by vice-chancellors as an 'opportunity missed', and as a 'sham' by the Association of University Teachers. Middlesex University has become the first British college to set up a recruiting office in Malaysia. The move follows intensive efforts by the government to attract more students from the Far East.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, The Netherlands (8): Doors open for managers of non-domestic parentage - Pensions THE Netherlands, purportedly home to the world's oldest stock exchange, has no shortage of fund management expertise. Indeed, the names of some of its largest and oldest fund managers, such as ABN Amro and Rabobank, are household names in other European capitals. But now, changing appetites among fund managers' clients - pension funds in particular - have opened the doors for an influx of non-domestic fund managers into the Netherlands. A list of the 25 largest fund managers in the Netherlands - a list compiled by consulting actuaries William Mercer Fraser International - shows that 16 of them are non-Dutch. Of these fund managers, six have a British parent, three a Japanese parent, three an American parent and two have German parents. The rise of foreign fund managers in a country which so clearly has home-grown expertise suggests that tastes are indeed changing, according to Ms Julia Hobart, senior consultant at Mercer Fraser. It also suggests that unlike many of its European counterparts which have been putting in place restrictions to prevent the encroachment of foreigners in that industry, the Netherlands, like Britain, is a relatively open market. What has fueled the growth of Dutch fund management expertise in recent years has been its pension laws. These have helped to build the largest pool of funded pension schemes outside the UK. An estimated Dollars 270bn lies in public and private sector funds. Of these, ABP, with assets of nearly Fl160bn, is the world's second-largest pension fund and PGGM, which covers hospital and medical care workers, is also among the world's largest. There are more than 80 industry-wide pools in the Netherlands, a development which has concentrated relatively large amounts of pension money in the hands of relatively few managers. The Netherlands is also home to some of the biggest single-employer pension schemes of such household names as Royal Dutch Shell and Phillips, the electronics giant, and these are managed in-house. 'On the Continent, the big funds are much more involved in decisions on asset allocation,' Ms Hobart said. 'This has opened the door to the use of specialist managers. The foreign firms are rarely employed to do balanced portfolio management - it is almost always specialist mandates.' But despite the growth of foreign fund managers, pension funds are hardly rushing to put their money abroad. Data from InterSec Research, a firm specialising in international pension research, notes that Dutch private sector pension funds increased their foreign share ownership to 13.1 per cent of total portfolios in 1991 from 8.4 per cent in 1988. However, the data suggests that some of this shift may have been at the expense of investments in international bonds. By 1991, non-Dutch bonds formed 4.7 per cent of Dutch portfolios, down from 5.9 per cent in 1988. 'Dutch pension funds are risk averse,' said a fund manager at one leading Dutch bank. Indeed, the latest data from the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics shows that the average of pension funds has some 75 per cent in fixed-interest securities and the pension funds historically have been the primary purchasers of government debt. ABP alone holds roughly 20 per cent of the government's debt securities. But ABP, partly because of its size, may be more adventurous than most of its smaller counterparts. In 1988, after strenuous efforts, it won the right to invest up to five per cent of its assets abroad and has since then made several well-publicised moves into the international property market. Among professional fund management companies, ABN Amro, one of the Netherlands' largest, has allocated 35 per cent of its average multi-asset discretionary pool to international equities, another 5 per cent to domestic equities and a relatively modest 37 per cent to domestic and foreign fixed interest. Cash, however, accounts for a further 17 per cent of assets. Rotrusco, a division of the Robeco Group, has a somewhat more modest weighting in domestic and international equities of 30 per cent in total and a 55 per cent weighting in foreign and domestic bonds. The non-Dutch fund managers which have made real inroads into the market are almost exclusively doing so with specialist mandates for forays into Japanese, US or Continental equities or for experimentation with index-tracking and other quantitative management techniques. That is not to say that Dutch fund managers themselves have failed to exploit the increasing trend towards internationalisation or passive management technique. Henkelman, Pontier, Van Drie en Partners, based in Amsterdam, ranks 25th among fund managers but has only been around for 10 years. It was founded as an options brokerage firm and specialises in quantitative and options-oriented products. Meanwhile, analysts say that the influx of foreign firms reflects both the general recognition of the size of the potential market there and the generally profitable nature of the business. Because fund managers are typically subsidiaries of banks who operate brokerage arms as well, common practice calls for all share transactions to be effected through the parent company. 'They all provide rationales for why this is done, but when you get right down to it, they want the fee income,' said one analyst. Nominal fees are typically no more than 0.1 to 0.3 per cent of funds under management. 'The absolute fee level is lower than that of the UK and the US, but the charge to the fund itself is higher,' said one industry analyst.</p>

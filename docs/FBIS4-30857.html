			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kujtim Ymeri, member of the Management </F> Council of Albanian Radio-Television, by Ilir Keko in Tirana;  date not given: "Albanian Radio-Television Is Politically  Partial and Not Independent"]    [Text] [Keko] It has now been some time ago since  numerous remarks appeared in the press regarding our national  Radio-Television's position and role. Do you think these  remarks are fair?    [Ymeri] Unfortunately, the activities of RTSh [Albanian  Radio-Television] deserve most of the remarks, not only those of  the press, but also those of our political and cultural  personalities and of international bodies or their  representatives.    [Keko] How would you, briefly, summarize some of RTSh's  shortcomings?    [Ymeri] A shortage and distortion of information, the  barring of alternative opinions, and an open political stance.    [Keko] Let us take the issue of information....    [Ymeri] It is very difficult, if not impossible, to learn  from radio and television information programs what is going on  in Albania. In these programs you can find virtually all the  meetings of our president, our prime minister, and other  ministers; you can learn that a minor thief or ordinary murderer  has been caught, you hear every single declaration of the  Democratic Party [PD] and its offshoots, you can follow rosy  reports on Albanian existence, but serious events of our  political, economic, and social life are either passed over in  silence or viewed according to the official version. I do not  know a single case of our television having taken the lead with  its own information or any example of professionalism having  prompted a RTSh journalist to refute official communiques with  actual facts.    [Keko] Do you think it is a matter of a lack of  professionalism?    [Ymeri] No. I think that in spite of the massive purges  that have occurred among the RTSh journalists, there are still  many capable journalists left who like their profession and know  it well. The same thing can be said about the newcomers. You  can of course come across incompetent journalists, uncultured  ones, some of whom are running important departments. But it is  not here that the root of the evil lies. In the final analysis,  one can blurt out the truth. The principal reason for this  situation is that RTSh's activities are subject to strict  political censorship.    [Keko] You spoke about RTSh's political stance and the  exclusion of alternative opinions....    [Ymeri] ...which are not only an infringement of the law,  but also a violation of the basics of a democratic state. It is  a known fact that RTSh's microphones and cameras are closed to  any kind of criticism of the state or to any alternative way of  thinking about politics, economy, and international relations.  They are closed to the opposition and forbidden for prominent  figures of our culture, even to august and respected  international bodies, if they give vent to "heretical" opinions.    The RTSh has, on the one hand, undertaken, in an  illegitimate  way, to "denounce" all the activities of the opposition forces,  but on the other hand, it never acknowledges their legitimate  right to express their own opinions.    The European Parliament endorsed a special resolution on  Albania underscoring the violation of basic human rights and the  freedom of the press, but the RTSh kept silent for a time,  pronouncing itself only after governmental bodies reacted by  putting together their response to the resolution in a  remarkably primitive style. Let us compare this fact with the  ridiculous hullabaloo that we heard about a survey carried out  by Euro-Barometer.    Here is another example: Let us remember Professor Rexhep  Qosja's criticism of the policy of our government and president.  The RTSh did not publicize a single article by R. Qosja, whereas  it was quick to broadcast, with gleeful alacrity, our  president's reaction to his criticism. We can therefore safely  affirm that our "national" RTSh has declared a total embargo on  Professor Rexhep Qosja ever since.    Still another example: Several months ago, the doors of the  RTSh were open to Mr. Kalakula, who was one of the PD's top  leaders. Nobody even ventured to censure his fascist-type  declaration made in parliament. However, these ever-growing  contradictions with the PD sufficed to make him a target of  smear statements and accusations, broadcast by the RTSh.  Personally speaking, I do not feel the least sympathy for  Kalakula's political viewpoints. Nevertheless I cannot help  admitting that he should have been given the right to respond to  those attacks.    [Keko] What then should be, according to you, the RTSH's  role in Albanian political life?    [Ymeri] As an impartial institution, the RTSH cannot remain  outside politics, neither can we ask for such a thing. The RTSH  must, however, be an objective mirror of our political life,  reflecting the stands of different political forces, both for  and against the government, without ever undertaking to play the  role of a referee in the competition among political parties.    In reality, however, just the opposite is happening, a  typical example being the way how they went about the "Nano  affair." It remains a fact that the RTSH went out of its way to  keep Nano's trial hush-hush, and those who were looking forward  to following this event with interest were disillusioned. If  "smothering" Fatos Nano's declaration was, technically speaking,  an easy thing to do, the pains taken to back up the indictment  and the judicial bench were really heroic. I can imagine the  fatigue of editing, making "cuts" and "patchwork" phrases in  order to concoct a chronicle that was the fruit of betraying  one's profession, civil honor, and dignity.    It seems to me, however, that we are asking too much from  such department heads and journalists, who never dared to rise  up and voice their support for their colleagues sacked by the  RTSh, for their fellow-professionals who were put in prison.  Besides, they did not utter a word in support of one of their  colleagues who was beaten up by the bodyguards of some  government dignitary. It, therefore, comes as no surprise that  one of the these maltreated journalists puts together servile  commentaries on Fatos Nano's trial. Under such circumstances,  there is simply no room to speak of human dignity, let alone  professionalism!    [Keko] Who is running the RTSH, according to your opinion:  the president, the government, the PD, or someone else?    [Ymeri] I do not see any essential difference within this  trio. Their policy is the same, their goals also. It is  natural to think that the branch that has got most weight in his  trio is the one that decides. One thing is clear; when you see  the RTSh's teams running after the PD leaders escorted by a  suite of ministers, and following their every step, when you see  press conferences and reports on visits concocted on no criteria  whatsoever, it becomes evident that the RTSh has been relegated  to the position of a private taxi: Aside from the fact that, in  this particular case, it is the state that pays for the petrol.    [Keko] What would you say about the Management Council's  role?    [Ymeri] The Management Council has almost been converted  into a formal rubber stamp. Its rare meetings are postponed  indefinitely, especially in moments of political "crises." All  important issues are resolved outside this council and more  often than not its members are confronted with a fait accompli.  The same thing happened with the dismissal of the RTSh's  employees. Naturally, we, I and other of my colleagues, voiced  our concern and objections at our council's meetings, but the  result was such as you can see for yourself today.    [Keko] Do you think the RTSh is heading for a new cycle of  single-party propaganda?    [Ymeri] A tendency toward control, circumscription, and  censorship is becoming more and more evident. We can compare  the present with the past, but not the monist [single-party  rule] period. In this respect, the fact should be mentioned  that, as far as economy is concerned, the state compares the  present situation with that of 1992, whereas when it comes to  democratic freedom and rights it makes comparisons with 1989.  Let us now compare the RTSh of 1991 with today's RTSh. There  is no doubt that, even though we were just coming out of a  period of single-party rule, the degree of freedom of speech and  information we enjoyed at that time was higher than today.  Thus, ever since, we have been heading for restrictions on the  freedom of information and the expression of opinions. The RTSh  is on the verge of being converted into an entirely party and  government instrument. I believe and hope however that this  will not happen. I am even certain that the RTSh will soon take  the place it deserves in our country's political life and  national culture.    [Keko] Do you base your belief on the prospect of a  forthcoming political change?    [Ymeri] Not only on this. It is everybody's feeling that  the number of those who have remained disillusioned by the new  situation, who are tired of trials and discrimination, of  demagogy, and unprincipled political life, is growing rapidly.  This will, of course, lead to political changes, which will  create a new climate in the state-owned RTSh's activities. I  entertain this belief, relying also on a number, by no means  small, of journalists of this institution, who, regardless of  their convictions, have their own viewpoints, which differ a lot  from those of the RTSh's present leaders and controllers. I  hope that the changes in the RTSh's activities will precede the  political change you were speaking about. Professional  journalists always have a lucid and incisive intuition, enabling  them to properly distinguish the requirements of the time.    [Keko] Now a question about the RTSh's satellite program:  Word reaches us that this programme is threatened with closure  and that the RTSh has run up a debt of $600,000 because of  satellite transmissions. Is it so, or what is the truth?    [Ymeri] As far as I know, the problem is not so dramatic.  At least at the Management Council's meeting, where this  problem was discussed, it was not treated in such tones. It is  true that there are financial difficulties. Here I want to  explain that, according to the contract concluded between the  RTSh and the Radio-Television of Kosova, the transmission  expenses would be borne by the latter and not by the RTSh. As  our Kosovar colleagues explain, these financial difficulties  have emerged as a result of the fact that the bank accounts in  the countries where the Kosovar emigrants are living have been  delayed. It has been impossible therefore to collect their  financial contributions to the desired degree. There is no  doubt that the closure of this program would be regretful, and I  hope this handicap will be overcome. I would like however to  add in this respect that improvements in the RTSh's programs  will certainly boost the interest of the Albanians living  outside our state borders. Here I have in mind what I already  mentioned above: If there is discontent about the RTSh in  Albania, it cannot happen otherwise in the diaspora or elsewhere.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has denied an  allegation in the 26 March 1994 edition of THE NEWS newspaper in  which the (?newspaper alleged) without any proof whatsoever that  Liberian diplomatic passports have become the hottest commodity  in Europe and the Far East for (?tourists) posing as businessmen.    The paper reported that a Foreign Ministry official is said  to be the passport merchant. A Foreign Ministry release pointed  out that following the appearance of the allegations, the  ministry formally invited the editor of THE NEWS newspaper to  have some clarifications made in connection with this great  issue of national interest so that (?tough) action would be  taken to arrest the situation in the supreme interest of the  government and people of Liberia. However, the release states  the editor in chief of THE NEWS newspaper failed to name the  passport merchant referred to in her column and could also not  give any clues to help the authorities of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs to arrest this frightening situation.    In the absence of any tangible proof to substantiate THE  NEWS  newspaper's disturbing allegations, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs wishes to make it clear that it is by no means aware of  the operation of any diplomatic passport merchant within the  ranks of its functionaries, whose integrity it has no reason to  question. The ministry says it is constrained by the conduct of  the NEWS newspaper to admonish its editors to be sufficiently  circumspect in their professional undertakings so that the  imaginations of individuals [words indistinct] unfounded malice  and [words indistinct] will not continue to embarrass them  unnecessarily.</p>

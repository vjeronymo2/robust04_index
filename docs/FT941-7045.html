			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Southwestern Bell expands Southwestern Bell, the aggressive US telecommunications group, yesterday announced a Dollars 680m deal to expand its wireless telephone operations in six new markets in the north-east and California. The San Antonio, Texas-based company, one of the seven US Baby Bell regional telephone groups, agreed to acquire the domestic cellular operations of Associated Communications, based in Pittsburgh. The sale includes majority shares in systems in four markets in New York state, as well as minority interests in businesses serving Pittsburgh and the San Francisco area. The transaction involves the transfer of stock to Associated shareholders and the assumption of Dollars 123m in Associated debt by Southwestern. The acquisition is part of Southwestern Bell's strategy of challenging American Telephone &amp; Telegraph for leadership in the booming US market for wireless communications. AT&amp;T underlined the potential of the industry with its Dollars 12.3bn takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications last year. Southwestern Bell is the one of the world's fastest growing companies in the industry. In the fourth quarter of last year, it added 272,000 cellular customers for a total of 2m. The group has acquired wireless systems in Illinois, Massachusetts, Washington DC and three other New York markets, adding to networks in its traditional operating area in the south-western US. The move into other areas of the country puts Southwestern into direct competition with rival Baby Bells, including Nynex, based in New York. The company declined to comment on the number of customers served by the Associated systems, which cover regions with a total population of 3.2m. Southwestern leads all North American cellular providers with a 5.7 per cent penetration of the markets it serves. The deal is structured as a tax-free merger. To facilitate the transaction, Associated will spin off a subsidiary, which will own all of its other assets. The agreement, subject to approval of federal and state regulators and shareholders, is expected to be completed by late 1994.</p>

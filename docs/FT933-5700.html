			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Aspin sets stage for defence switch: George Graham looks at the US thinking about the wars it may have to fight MR Les Aspin, defence secretary, had plenty of practice at the theoretical exercise of drafting a force structure design for the US military in his previous role as chairman of the House of Representatives armed services committee. The results of the Bottom-Up Review he announced yesterday draw heavily on some of the concepts he worked with before, but they also show the Pentagon's own thinking. After submitting to Congress a budget for 1994 he frankly described as 'treading water', Mr Aspin has now completed the more detailed review he promised would set the stage for more radical changes in the US defence budget. The review is based on a complete change in the threats and missions the US armed forces are to be built to confront. Instead of preparing for the third world war, the US military strategy will now be based on the need to be ready for two nearly simultaneous regional conflicts. There has been much debate at the Pentagon in recent months over the 'win-hold-win' and 'win-win' concepts for dealing with such big regional conflicts - a debate which has wide implications for the size of the US forces. A force structure geared to winning a single big regional conflict would, according to Pentagon documents, require eight active army divisions, eight navy aircraft carrier battle groups and 10 air force active fighter wings. A strategy based on winning one such conflict while containing a second conflict until the first was won - the win-hold-win strategy - would require another two army divisions, two more carrier groups and three more fighter wings. To be able to win two nearly simultaneous big conflicts and have spare capacity for action elsewhere such as peacekeeping, as Mr Aspin has decided, adds another two divisions, two carrier groups and a fighter wing to the force. Some outside defence analysts believe this structure to be excessive. They argue there have only been three such big regional conflicts in 50 years - Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf - though the Soviet Union loomed throughout as the big threat. Gen Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged yesterday that it was not really likely that two such wars would confront the US simultaneously, but he argued that it would be 'irresponsible and unwise' not to prepare for the possibility; failure to do so could encourage the very eventuality that the US sought to avoid. Gen Powell said the review assumed potential attacks by Iraq and North Korea, but said that this was merely a basis for planning the force structure. 'History teaches us that we never really fight where we thought we were going to fight. The forces you buy with this assessment might well be used in a conflict you never dreamed of,' he said. By gearing forces only for 'nearly simultaneous' conflicts, however, the US can save a lot on its strategic lift capacity, essentially preserving only enough sea and air transport capacity to transport to one front at a time. Improved air and sea lift, nevertheless, are a big component of the Pentagon plan to adapt US forces to meet the different kinds of task they will be required to handle in the future. Mr Aspin said the Pentagon would either continue the programme to buy the new but controversial C-17 transport aircraft or buy other airliners to replace the ageing C-141s, and would also keep a brigade of heavy armour permanently afloat on ships that could be sent to the Gulf or to north-east Asia at short notice. Other 'enhancements' to improve the flexibility and capability of US forces would include: Adding ground attack capability to the navy's carrier-based F-14 fighters. Modifying B-1 and B-2 bombers to enable them to drop conventional weapons as well as nuclear. Developing smart rockets and missiles for the army. Preparing brigade-size National Guard units to back up active units, instead of whole National Guard divisions, which have in the past taken longer to reach full readiness. The Bottom-Up Review was supposed to be driven only by an assessment of the forces the US would need to defend itself in the future, not by the need to meet a budget savings target, and Mr Aspin yesterday ducked questions on the budget implications of the plan. Nevertheless, critics are already charging that by preserving a force structure that is only slightly slimmer than the Base Force planned by Mr Richard Cheney, President George Bush's defence secretary, the Bottom-Up Review may have jeopardised the development of defence programmes for the longer term, when more dangerous threats may have emerged. 'We really aren't in a position to pursue a rich man's strategy any more. What we really need is a bottom-up review that looks not only at short-term requirements but also establishes a security posture for the medium and long term,' said Mr Andrew Krepinevich of Defence Budget Project, a Washington group that monitors defence spending.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US FORCE STRUCTURE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                1993    Cheney     Aspin                                          Plan    Review Army active divisions            14        12        10 Navy aircraft carriers           13        12        12 Navy ships                      443       450       346 Air force fighter wings          16        15.25     13 Nuclear submarines               22        18        18  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

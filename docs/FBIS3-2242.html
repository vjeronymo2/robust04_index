			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong estimated  that it might lose up to 187 billion H.K. dollars (24 billion  U.S. dollars) in overall trade, 26 billion H.K. dollars (3.3  billion U.S. dollars) in income and 75,000 in jobs if China's  most favored nation [MFN] trading status were withdrawn.    The local government's latest assessment of the impact on  Hong Kong's economy if China were to lose its MFN trading status  in the United States was announced at a press conference held by  the Trade Department here this afternoon.    Christopher Jackson, deputy director of the Trade  Department,  said that the removal of China's MFN trading status by the  United States would have direct adverse effect on Hong Kong's  re-exports of the Chinese Mainland origin to the United States.    "A reduction of up to 77 billion H.K. dollars (one billion  U.S. dollars) worth of re-exports is double the impact that we  estimated in 1990," said Jackson, adding that this is largely a  result of the rapid growth in Hong Kong's re-export of goods  made in the mainland to the United States over the past few  years.    The withdrawal would also have significant adverse effect on  manufacturing investment ventures and other production  arrangements by Hong Kong and foreign companies in the Chinese  Mainland, said Jackson.    According to Jackson, the local government has stepped its  lobbying activities in Washington as President Clinton is  required by the U.S. law to indicate by June 3 whether he  intends to renew China's MFN status for another year.    "We have reinforced our lobbying team and are working with  American business allies to impress upon members of the  administration and Congress the damage which MFN withdrawal  would do to Hong Kong and to American interests in this region,"  he said.</p>

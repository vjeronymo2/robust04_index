			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> NINTENDO PLANS SIMPSONS GAME  </P> <P> Now there's going to be even more Simpsons on the small screen. Acclaim  Entertainment Inc. announced today that it has acquired exclusive rights to  manufacture Nintendo video games featuring the wildly popular Bart Simpson and  his cartoon family.  </P> <P> Robert Holmes, president of Acclaim, said the value of the licensing deal "is  amplified by the fact that young adults feel a strong attachment to both 'The  Simpsons' and the video gaming world. By joining the two together, we  anticipate the result to be an incredibly powerful product."  </P> <P> Based on the family of characters created by cartoonist Matt Groening, the Fox  Network series draws high Nielsen ratings from a broad range of age groups  including the core Nintendo customers -- 8- to 16-year-olds. A hand-held  Simpsons game is expected this fall.  </P></p>

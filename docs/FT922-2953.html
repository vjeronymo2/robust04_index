			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / World Bank tells India to reduce budget deficit INDIA has been warned by the World Bank that any delay in reducing the budget deficit or in implementing structural reforms would erode the credibility of its economic readjustment programme. The Bank, in its report before the annual gathering in Paris of western donor countries at the end of the month, says that a rapid reduction in inflation and strong export growth are 'critical' to the short-term prospects of the programme. It adds that if the Indian government can maintain the pace of reform, India could become 'one of the most dynamic economies' in the latter half of the 1990s and beyond. The report comes, however, at a time when the government's ability to take fresh policy initiatives has been badly affected by the Bombay financial scandal. An opposition leader has alleged that four ministers in prime minister Narasimha Rao's administration are involved. The possible political fall-out from the scandal is already putting the government on the defensive and impairing its ability to take unpopular decisions. The other factor that could throw out of joint the government's macroeconomic calculations is a growing prospect of a failure of the monsoon this year. Diplomats with access to international data say that there are grim omens after four years of good monsoons. A worsening of the drought that has already hit parts of western India would further push up prices and imports. The Bank says India needs a further Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.0bn) in exceptional balance of payments financing this year following the Dollars 3.7bn provided last year. India will be asking the aid donor consortium meeting in Paris for an additional Dollars 600m beyond the Dollars 2.4bn being provided by the World Bank and the IMF. The Bank says in its report, which was leaked to a government-owned news agency, that the government had achieved 'impressive' progress in reducing deficits and initiating structural changes. It calls for continuing budget austerity, a reduction in subsidies, a containing of the government wage bill and a broadening of the direct tax base. It says the balance of payments situation is still 'fragile' and the present foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 5.5bn is insufficient to cope with shocks such as a decline in agricultural output or adverse developments externally.</p>

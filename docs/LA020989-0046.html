			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FIDELITY FEDERAL WILL BUY RANCHO BERNARDO SAVINGS  </P> <P> Rancho Bernardo Savings Bank has agreed to be acquired by Citadel Holding  Corp., the parent of Fidelity Federal Savings of Glendale, for $23 a share or  $6.5 million, Rancho Bernardo Savings Chairman H. M. Darmstandler said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The savings bank's offices in Rancho Bernardo, Escondido and Rancho Penasquitos  would become Fidelity Federal offices once the proposed acquisition is  completed late this year, Darmstandler said.  </P> <P> The proposed sale must be approved by Rancho Bernardo Savings' shareholders at  an upcoming meeting. Federal and state regulatory approvals also are required.  </P> <P> Citadel has agreed to pay 1.5 times book value for Rancho Bernardo Savings,  Darmstandler said. "I think that's very good, given the prices for S&amp;Ls  these days," Darmstandler said. "Our initial stock price was $10 in 1983, and  we've had one (20%) stock split, so (shareholders) will be getting close to  three times what they paid initially."  </P> <P> The savings bank's board accepted Citadel's offer "because quite frankly, we've  been looking for some way to provide a return to our shareholders,"  Darmstandler said. "I have the feeling that consolidation will be the name of  the game in coming years."  </P> <P> Rancho Bernardo Savings, which opened for business in 1983, reported a $558,000  net profit for 1988, down from a $704,000 net profit during 1987. Darmstandler  linked the profit decline to the opening of a new branch in Escondido.  </P> <P> The savings bank had $124 million in assets on Dec. 31, 1988, up from $110  million in assets at the end of 1987. Total loans rose to $105 million, up from  $94 million and deposits rose to $106 million, up from $100 million.  </P></p>

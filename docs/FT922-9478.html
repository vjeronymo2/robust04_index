			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Businesses win more rate relief - Local Government COUNCILLORS WILL be relieved to hear that for once local government, prominent in recent years, is notable for its virtual absence from the Queen's Speech. Virtual, because occupiers of 900,000 business premises will welcome the one minor measure proposed: to enact the concession announced in the last Budget extending transitional relief for payers of the uniform business rate, introduced in 1990. The concession will spare them any real terms increase in bills in the current year, with the existing limits on real annual increases to apply again from 1993-94. It will grant relief on the same terms to new occupiers when premises change hands. It will also increase the maximum reduction for businesses in transition to 3 percentage points higher than that applying now. These businesses will receive all their remaining gains in 1993-94. The existing transitional arrangements give businesses that face severe rate increases a year-on-year rise limited to 20 per cent in real terms for large premises, 15 per cent for small premises and 10 per cent for small premises with living accommodation attached. The reliefs apply to England and Wales, but business rate payers in Scotland and Northern Ireland - which have different systems  - will gain reductions of a similar size. The legislation will backdate the the relief for new occupiers to March and other changes to April. Meanwhile, councils will have their hands full introducing the council tax, due to replace the poll tax next April. A few may also be visited by the local government commission, another fruit of Mr Michael Heseltine's brief stint at the environment department, which is examining the case for more single-tier authorities. Local councils will be keen to know whether Mr Michael Howard, the new environment secretary, shares his predecessor's enthusiasm for unitary authorities. The current signs are that he does not - but a strong Tory lobby is urging him to the contrary. With county council elections due next year, the outcome will soon be a hot issue in Britain's council chambers.</p>

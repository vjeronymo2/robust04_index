			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (10): Progress will be painfully slow - Deregulation Paying a bill through a Japanese bank amply illustrates why Japan's path to deregulation will be painfully slow. A white-gloved attendant bows respectfully as you enter, murmuring 'Welcome dear customer.' You are led to a ticket machine, which issues a numbered slip, indicating your place in the queue. Another attendant hands the ticket from the machine to the the dear customer and ushers you to a comfortable chair, next to a rack well-stocked with scandal magazines and mail order catalogues. There you browse until your number is called. The teller will then ask you to fill out a form, with duplicates, giving details of the money transfer. Cash only is accepted. Yet at the end of all this, the funds are transferred electronically; at least that is before the dear customer is bowed out of the door again. It is a costly system, paid for by customers - on the whole without complaint - in the form of bank charges two or three times European levels. Yet this kind of service, whether it be at department stores, filling stations or banks, has been until now a valuable staple of Japan's social structure. The highly regulated service sector, generously sheltered from foreign competition, has traditionally absorbed surplus jobs, shed by internationally competitive manufacturing businesses. Banks are not legally obliged to perform these expensive rituals in their retail halls, but they are so protected from competition that they are under little pressure to break with comfortable old ways. The service sector's ability to mop up jobs is one reason why Japan has been able to stay near or above US levels of competitiveness in manufacturing - depending on the sector - and yet lag 50 per cent behind it in some kinds of services, according to a study by McKinsey Global Institute. However, that comfortable arrangement is up for renegotiation. It only worked so long as manufacturers could continue to race ahead in the world's export markets, and perform their traditional job of being the main motor of Japan's economic growth. But US and European pressure to curb the trade surplus, combined with the squeeze on export profit margins imposed by the high yen, has obliged the Japanese government to turn to a new strategy, deregulation, as a way to increase the economy's capacity to grow. If services could be made as efficient as manufacturing, the argument goes, Japan might rediscover the growth rates achieved in the heady 1980s. Three Japanese administrations over the past year have recognised this and have accordingly begun to make progress in pushing away some of the more than 10,000 official rules and regulations that control an estimated 40 per cent of industrial activity. For the first time in Japanese post-war politics, government, opposition and the main business lobbies officially favour deregulation  - even if they sometimes appear to pay no more than lip-service to the idea. As in previous deregulation drives, a decade ago, progress has run into resistance. Companies are reluctant to fire the men in white gloves, since redundancies remain socially unacceptable. Firing staff is seen as a sign of corporate weakness, at least until a large company gives the lead. According to a recent study by the Keidanren, the business federation, deregulation on a scale to bring Japanese costs in line with US ones would initially put 2.84m people out of work, but would by the end of the decade stimulate growth enough to produce a net gain of 740,000 jobs. On top of this, government departments are averse to giving up some of the powers they have used to control Japan's economy until now with such success. In Japan, vested interests make no sacrifices without being mollified first. And yet there has been progress. It started with the popular attack on the bureaucracy launched just over a year ago by former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's first non-Liberal Democratic Party leader for 38 years. The present prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, aims to continue, with a five-year deregulation programme starting in April 1995. The main sectors to see the beginning of a change in the restrictive old ways are retailing, food, financial services and cars. Retailing: The Large Scale Retail Law, which governs planning consent and opening hours, has been relaxed twice in the past two years, most recently in May. This has removed local shopkeepers' power to veto a new supermarket and allowed stores to stay open later. As a result the number of supermarket openings has quadrupled since May to about 80 a month. At the same time, imports of foreign consumer goods are growing rapidly, helped by the cheapness they derive from the rising yen. Food: The decision to allow, for the first time, limited rice imports, has weakened the power of the farm lobby, formerly fundamental to keeping the LDP in power. This is bad news for interest groups in other sectors. The rice import ban is to be gradually phased out from next year and replaced with tariffs. There is a pay-off, of course, in the form of a Y6,010bn aid package. Financial services: Finance ministry officials are planning to step up the pace, motivated by the gradual loss of the capital markets' competitiveness to other markets in Asia and Europe. So far, Japan's march to financial deregulation has been slow. It continued this year, with the end of government controls on ordinary savings and bank deposits, completing the freeing of interest rates begun in 1985. This has encouraged banks to seek new ways to attract savers' patronage. One credit group even offered savers a lottery prize, to the consternation of the finance ministry and the banking industry federation. It may be a sign of things to come. At the same time, the government in October permitted the large commercial banks to issue corporate bonds, for the first time. This privilege was granted to long-term credit banks last year and is the latest stage in a cautious dismantling of the barriers between banking and securities. Cars: There has been a slight loosening in car dealers' formerly rigid allegiance to single Japanese manufacturers, for business rather than deregulation reasons. This, plus the yen's strength, lies behind a 93 per cent rise in car imports in the year to October, where they account for nearly 9 per cent of the Japanese market. However, the government has not yet touched the barrier to trade most often cited by frustrated exporters, the 'shaken' system. This is a costly test, obligatory after a car is three years old, which foreigners complain gives high volume producers an unfair advantage. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, president of the otherwise pro-deregulation Keidanren and chairman of Toyota, believes the system should stay as it is.</p>

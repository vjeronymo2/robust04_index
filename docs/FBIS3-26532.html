			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Feb 9 (AFP) -- China's ageing paramount  leader, Deng Xiaoping, on Wednesday made his first appearance on  television in more than a year, looking frail and apparently  speaking with difficulty. Deng, 89, was filmed at a Lunar New  Year's reception in Shanghai, the television said. The report  of more than four minutes on the national evening news showed  him looking frail, with a somewhat vacant look, and walking with  difficulty, supported all the while by two of his daughters,  Deng Rong and Deng Nan.    The television said Deng spoke to local officials, wishing  them a successful new year and predicting "new victories" for  China. But the report did not give the sound of Deng's voice,  merely reporting his message. The few words he spoke were  apparently pronounced with difficulty.    He also expressed best wishes to communist party secretary  Jiang Zemin and called on communists to unite around Jiang, who  is also head of state and touted by analysts as a likely  successor to Deng, the report said. Deng also congratulated the  people of Shanghai, China's largest city, for their economic  success.    China's media reported only four brief outings by the  supreme  leader in Beijing and Shanghai late last year, but no  photographs or television images were shown. The official news  agency Xinhua, in a dispatch marked "urgent", said Deng  "exchanged spring festival greetings with local officials and  retirees."    Deng holds no official post other than that of president of  the China bridge players' association, although he remains at  the top of China's political power structure. He was spending  his seventh consecutive Lunar New Year in Shanghai, China's  biggest city. The new year's celebration, which is on Thursday,  is the biggest date in the Chinese calendar, and the occasion  for feasting and family reunions.</p>

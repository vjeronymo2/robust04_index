			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Thai banking sector buoyant The Thai banking sector is proving to be robustly profitable in the third quarter in spite of fears that increased competition and a tougher interest rate regime could hurt revenues. Bangkok Bank, the biggest financial institution in south-east Asia, reported a 31 per cent rise in third-quarter net profits to Bt4.33bn (Dollars 173m). This proved to be a disappointment for some analysts, however, after Thai Farmers Bank had earlier reported a net gain of 66 per cent to Bt2.77bn and Krung Thai a 75 per cent profits increase to Bt2.36bn in the quarter to end-September. Bangkok Bank - like most other Thai banks - issues only a bare profits figure prior to the release of the full audited financial figures. A spokesman said net profits should rise at least nearly 30 per cent over the full year to about Bt18bn. Bangkok Bank's lending growth climbed 12 per cent over the three quarters, ahead of deposit growth which rose 6.3 per cent, according to the spokesman. Analysts say there have been three principal reasons for the sector's buoyant profits - accelerated loan growth, slower-than-expected convergence of spreads between deposit and lending rates, and declining loan-loss provisions.</p>

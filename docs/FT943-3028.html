			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Resignation rocks Crimea's government Crimea's vice-prime minister, Mr Yevgeny Saburov, yesterday resigned in the wake of a confrontation between President Yuri Meshkov and the parliament of the autonomous Ukrainian peninsula, dealing a further blow to the president, writes Matthew Kaminski. Mr Saburov, a former Russian economics minister, said he did not 'see the possibility of working further in a constructive way if this situation continues'. Mr Saburov's appointment, along with other 'Moscow experts', to head the contested region's government was, ironically, resented by parliament, a pro-Russian chamber dedicated to breaking from Ukraine. Mr Meshkov appointed Mr Saburov to revive economic links with Russia, although stopping short of complete independence from Ukraine. Mr Meshkov, his position uncertain, told the Interfax news agency he would defend the Saburov government against parliament. Last Sunday he suspended parliament but ended the lock-out two days later. Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's special envoy, Mr Yevgeny Marchuk, arrived in Simferopol yesterday to try to settle the dispute.</p>

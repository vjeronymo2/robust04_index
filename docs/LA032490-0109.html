			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMADAN  </P> <P> The holiest month on the Islamic calendar, observed by Muslims with daytime  fasting and devotion, will begin next week after the first appearance of the  new moon's crescent. The Islamic Center of Southern California has calculated  that Tuesday will be the first day of the fast, but other centers have  indicated that the observance should begin Wednesday.  </P> <P> TRADITION: Ramadan is the month on the lunar calendar when the Prophet Mohammed  (570-632) was said to have received the first revelations of the Koran, the  holy scriptures of Islam. Fasting is one of the pillars, or obligations, of the  faith.  </P> <P> OBSERVANCES: Faithful Muslims are expected to neither eat nor drink between  daybreak and dark during the 28-day month with exceptions made for the very  young and old, the sick, pregnant women and those with physical problems. If  necessary, the fasting time may be made up at another time or by contributions  to feed the poor. The period brings together families and friends for evening  dinners and Koran reading and prayer. Humility and compassion toward others is  emphasized. The month ends with the sighting or calculated appearance of the  next new moon.  </P></p>

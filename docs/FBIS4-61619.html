			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia needs a strong army which would help to  pursue an efficient foreign policy, leader of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy declared  at a meeting in Moscow devoted to the 49th anniversary of the  victory over the fascist Germany.    In his words, "the West has the aim to collapse our army and  to make Russia's peoples fight each other." "They have  destroyed us as a military and political rival and have turned  the country into a flee market," Zhirinovskiy said.    At the same time he underlined: "Everybody who encroaches  upon Russia's interests must know that in 3-4 years Russian army  will stand on the land of its adversaries."    "If I were Stalin, I would have ordered to our divisions to  inflict a preventive strike against Germany on June 20 and would  have destroyed the German army," said Zhirinovskiy and noted the  following: "We do not want any war but currently adversaries  pose threat to Russia from each side."    "If the enemy stands near our borders and the war is  unavoidable it is necessary to inflict the first strike,"  declared Zhirinovskiy. In his words, one should prevent  Russian-American exercises on the Totsk test range because "50  years ago analogical exercises of the Soviet and German forces  finished with the forty first year."    Zhirinovskiy promised that when the LDPR is at power it will  bring order in this nation and will put an end to crime. He  spoke in favor of creation "of special courts over bandits:  there is no need to organize long trials--punishment, including  shooting on the spot, should await the criminals."    According to Zhirinovskiy, "the present authorities have  made  the greatest part of our population poor and miserable." In his  opinion, "the president should dismiss Ministers Pavel Grachev,  Viktor Yerin, Aleksandr Shokhin, Anatoliy Chubays, Sergey  Shakhray, and Andrey Kozyrev, but it will be best of all if the  whole ruling political team resigns."    Zhirinovskiy believes that this autumn the situation in  Russia will sharply worsen, many factories will be stopped and  political crisis will seize the country. "The authorities will  be forced to hold early elections and under this situation we  must do everything so that the president, the government, and  the parliament will become ours," Zhirinovskiy said.    At the same time he complained about lack of objectivity on  the part of mass media and declared that "correspondents are  agents to whom the CIA pays for their lie about Zhirinovskiy."  About 700 people were listening Zhirinovskiy's speech at the  meeting held near the metrostation Sokolniki.</p>

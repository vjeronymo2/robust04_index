The case involved roundabout dealings with  4,000 tons of steel intended for the construction of the  north-south 500- kilovolt powerline. These dealings caused more  than 3 billion dong in losses to the state budget.    Mr. Mai Ngoc Chinh, chief judge of the Criminal Court of the  People's Supreme Court, presided over the court session. During  its proceedings, the court heard Mr. Nguyen Tien Dam, a senior  officer representing the People's Supreme Organ of Control,  present a conviction report by the procurator of the Supreme  People's Organ of Control against the following defendants:    1. Doan Trung Thanh, former director of the Vietnam-Poland  Economic, Technological, and Cultural Development Support  Services Corporation, called VINAPOL for contact purposes.    2. Doan Thi Huu Nghi, director of the VINAPOL Limited  Corporation.    3. Former Energy Minister Vu Ngoc Hai, also known as Vu  Hung Hai.    4. Deputy Energy Minister [title as heard] Le Liem.    5.

The court questioned the defendants and heard the views of  the 11 defense lawyers.    This afternoon, after five days of work, Mr. Mai Ngoc Chinh,  who presided over the court session, read the verdict of the  trial council. The verdict thoroughly analyzed the developments  in the case and the criminal activities involved as well as the  seriousness of each defendant's crime.

The trial council also imposed additional sentences as  follows:    -- Dinh Ngoc Dat and Nguyen Trong Sang are prohibited from  holding positions related to economic management by state  agencies for a three-year period starting on the date their jail  terms are completed.    -- Nguyen Duc Ai is prohibited from holding positions  related to economic management by state agencies for a  three-year period starting on 23 February 1994.    -- The sum of 3,383,842,200 dong -- which has been held  temporarily by the investigation committee -- will be  confiscated and turned over to state funds.

Immediately after the conclusion of the court session, Pham  Hung, chief judge of the Supreme People's Court, convened a news  conference and answered a number of questions from journalists  concerning this case. Comrade Pham Hung suggested that  journalists give objective and accurate coverage to this public  case in the mass media. Answering a question on whether the  court trial was aimed at corrupt elements, the comrade chief  judge of the People's Supreme Court said: This is not a  corruption trial. The case, however, has taken place at a time  when our party and state are launching an anticorruption  campaign that aims not only at opposing theft and bribery, but  also at achieving an important goal; namely, to struggle against  wrongdoing, lack of responsibility, extravagance, and failure to  act in accordance with one's duties and thereby incurring  losses. All of these things must also be regarded as criminal  activities. Therefore, we must take action against them.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Managers attack quality of training Employers would like more official help in weeding out poor providers of training, on which they are estimated to spend more than Pounds 18bn a year, according to an Industrial Society survey published today, Lisa Wood writes. The survey says half of Britain's managers believe a significant amount of the staff training they pay for is 'very poor'. Much more than a third of the 531 managers surveyed felt that increased regulation was desirable. Half of them agreed that there should be some kind of system to licence approved trainers. Respondents did not give opinions as to who should provide the regulation. At present the market for training is largely unregulated, although some training and enterprise councils - the government-backed training bodies in England and Wales - provide lists of 'approved' consultancies for initiatives such as Investors in People, the programme which seeks to help employers link training more effectively to business needs. The society, which exists to promote best personnel management practice and is a large provider of training, describes the concern over training quality as 'alarming'. But it does not support a licensing system, which it says might be bureaucratic. Instead, it calls for training bodies to draw up agreed criteria to help employers judge the effectiveness of trainers. Mr Andrew Forrest, the society's human resources director, said a more fundamental issue was that while employers spent a lot of money on training, many of them did not know exactly what they wanted from a course and so it was more than likely they would not be satisfied with the outcome. The vast majority of employers, he said, had no system in place to specify their training needs or measure the results. Employers, he said, should think more carefully about why they sent people on courses and consider whether other forms of training might be more appropriate. Training Trends No 11.

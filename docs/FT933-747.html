			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / West to urge greater verification: Biological weapons control WESTERN nations are to press for a strengthening of the international treaty banning use, production and stockpiling of biological weapons, following the conclusion of an expert group that measures to check compliance would be both feasible and useful. Government experts from 41 countries last week completed a report detailing 21 types of verification procedure, including on-site inspections, which they say could help guard against cheating. The report now goes to the 134 signatory states to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. European officials said yesterday they hoped to garner support from the required majority of treaty members to call a special conference within the next two years which would discuss ways of tightening up the convention. Some developing countries, notably China, India and Iran, are opposed to such moves which they fear could be intrusive and compromise military security. China and Iran are among five nations - the others being Russia, Syria and Iraq - thought by the US to possess biological weapons. Other countries which may have such weapons are Egypt, Taiwan and Libya. Unlike the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention, the biological weapons convention contains no policing or verification measures. This is partly because verification of toxic arms production was thought to pose insuperable difficulties. Biological weapons are much harder to detect than nuclear or chemical arms; they can be easily produced and stored in tiny quantities and the agents and equipment often have peaceful as well as belligerent uses. In its report the expert group admits that even in combination there are no foolproof ways of detecting whether a country has or is trying to acquire biological weapons.</p>

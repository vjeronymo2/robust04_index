			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chi Haotian (6688 3185 3944): "Su Yu's Grandeur As a </F> General Will Live Forever, His Art of Command Remains Applicable  -- Marking the 10th Anniversary of Comrade Su Yu's Death"]    [Text] Ten years have elapsed since Comrade Su Yu passed  away. We will cherish his memory forever.    I joined the Army in my early youth. I served under the  command of Comrades Chen Yi and Su Yu, fighting in different  parts of east China, and I directly perceived Comrade Su Yu's  rare gifts and bold strategy in the art of war. Later on, I  respectfully listened to his teachings. After he passed away,  his wife, Elder Sister Chu Qing, presented me with the book  Su Yu's Collections of the War Years. Through the  study of Mao Zedong's military thinking, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  thinking on army building in the new period, of this military  masterpiece -- which was the fruit of Comrade Su Yu's life-long  labor -- and other articles recalling Comrade Su Yu, I have  gained a further understanding of the brilliant art of military  command as shown by this proletarian revolutionary and military  strategist who made great contributions in the Chinese  revolutionary war. Throughout his military life, Comrade Su Yu  "had a loyal heart for his country while his hairs turned white  in the war years," creatively studied and applied Mao Zedong's  military thinking, and added rich and vivid content to Mao  Zedong's military thinking with his own practice. He was an  outstanding military scientist and strategist who had both  military theory and operational command practice. While  fighting in battlefields, he cleverly devised strategies and  thus led brilliant military successes. A devoted military  officer with a lofty spirit and great force of character, he led  troops and high-ranking military officers. He wrote books with  unique original ideas and penetrating judgments. He deserves to  be called a famous combat general commanding a million bold  warriors. The legacy of his superb sense of command and his  refinement as a general constitute a precious spiritual heritage.    Being strategically minded as a commander of tactical  operations was the important characteristic of Comrade Su Yu,  who directed military operations with miraculous skill. Comrade  Su Yu was a commander of tactical operations, but he would  always conscientiously take the overall strategic situation into  account as the starting point in reflecting on problems. During  the 22 years of his combat career, Comrade Su Yu held important  leadership posts in the relatively independent war zones, which  were far away from the central authorities. While undertaking a  combat task, he would attach great importance to the advantages  and disadvantages and losses and gains of its implementation  from the height of the overall strategic situation. He  approached and pondered problems from a broad and far-reaching  point of view and thus managed to serve, influence, and push the  overall situation ahead conscientiously and freely with active  and effective partial operations. The famous campaigns, which  Comrade Su Yu directly conducted or in which he was engaged,  included the central Jiangsu, south Shandong, Laizhou-Wuhu,  Menglianggu, Shatuji, east Henan, Jinan, and Huaihai campaigns.  He made proposals or tactical assumptions of his own accord for  almost all of the campaigns, which were carried out after they  had been approved by the Central Military Commission and Comrade  Mao Zedong. These numerous major campaigns constituted the  basic trend in east and central China in the Liberation War and  realized the strategic intentions of the supreme command in a  powerful manner.    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The most important thing  for those who direct the situation as a whole is to devote their  attention to the overall war situation." In making military  plans, Comrade Su Yu could not only give consideration to the  situation in a specific war zone, but also kept his eyes on the  overall strategic situation, set store by the overall situation  and the strategic interests, and he did not hesitate to make the  greatest sacrifices in terms of partial interests. For example,  in the summer of 1947, to coordinate with the strategic move  taken by the Li Bocheng-Deng Xiaoping Army to thrust into the  Dabie Shan by leaping from 1,000 li away from the Dabie Shan --  while deciding without the slightest hesitation to leave some  troops behind and encouraging them to support the extremely grim  situation in Shandong and to do what they could to break through  the enemy's selective attacks -- Comrades Chen Yi and Su Yu led  the regular formations of the East China Field Army in rushing  westward and launched attacks on exterior lines, thus creating  the situation in which the Liu Bocheng-Deng Xiaoping Army, the  Chen Geng-Xie Fuzhi Army, and the Chen Yi-Su Yu Army were  bidding for state power.    As the commander of a strategic area, Comrade Su Yu was  admired for his boldness and adeptness in independently  considering the issues which had a bearing on the overall war  situation and promptly putting forth strategic proposals to the  Military Commission. For example, in the early days of the  Liberation War, his suggestion of first fighting on interior  lines by relying on the liberated areas played an important role  in changing the Central Military Commission's strategic  principle of "launching attacks on exterior lines while going  southward to conduct operations" into the principle of "first  winning several battles on interior lines before turning to  exterior lines." In the spring of 1948, his suggestion that the  army under Su's command stay for the time being in central China  to fight large-scale battles of annihilation rather than cross  the river and swiftly open up the war situation in central China  after achieving combat successes played a very good role in  urging the Central Military Commission to determine to fight a  strategic, decisive battle with the enemy. In the autumn of  1948, he suggested launching the Huaihai Campaign and further  suggested cutting the Xuzhou-Bengpu line and annihilating the  enemy's main forces in the places north to the Chang Jiang, thus  greatly accelerating the victorious process of the national  liberation war.    It is very important for a military commander, a  high-ranking  commander in particular, to have a strong strategic awareness,  be good at clearly discerning the changing situation, and grasp  the developing overall situation. With profound understanding,  Comrade Su Yu said: "As a military commander, one must  understand the strategic issue of the Chinese Liberation War.  Only when he has a profound understanding of the issue and can  keep a clear head can he devise strategies and direct operations  with facility."    Drawing strategic plans and making analyses systematically  are the main secrets of Comrade Su Yu's calm generalship. In  organizing every campaign, Comrade Su Yu would always  systematically draw up a plan after careful consideration to  ensure that the plan was well-designed for carrying out schemes  to give the enemy a false impression to lead them to make  errors, for creating determination to launch operations, for  starting a campaign to withdraw from battlefields to plan the  next campaign, and for improving operational command to logistic  support and to ideological education. In terms of mode of  thinking, Comrade Su Yu's operational planning was identical  with the basic viewpoints of modern operational systems  engineering. The east Henan campaign was the masterpiece of  Comrade Su Yu's systematic planning in operational command, and  is of immortal military and academic value.    In planning the campaign, Comrade Su Yu considered the war  situation in central China as a big system. After giving  consideration to the situations of both the enemy and his own  army in central China, to the East China Field Army, and the  Central China Field Army, and to the war zone's favorable  climatic condition (being at the stage of a strategic turning  point), favorable geographical condition (vast areas and smooth  terrain are favorable for our regular army formations' mobile  operations), and favorable human condition (with Shandong and  the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated area behind, the new  liberated area in central China had begun to take shape) and  comparing the advantages and disadvantages of conducting  operations in central China and by crossing the Chang Jiang,  Comrade Su Yu reached the conclusion that it was more  advantageous to concentrate forces to conduct operations in  central China than to cross the Chang Jiang and swiftly open the  situation in central China, that it was imperative to fight  large-scale battles of annihilation, and the condition for  fighting such battles in central China was basically ripe. This  was the basic operational assumption for concentrating forces to  fight sizable battles in central China. On this basis, Comrade  Su Yu further made an quantitative and qualitative analysis and  by following the central demands, clearly defined that the basic  goal of operations for the near future was to annihilate 5 or 6  to 11 or 12 enemy brigades in the Huang He-Huai He area.    From the viewpoint of systematics, Comrade Su Yu's planning  and direction of operations fully embodied the principle of  "appropriate selection of the superior." In military struggle,  the weighing of "discard" and "take" and decisionmaking are full  of dialectics. Everyone who has some knowledge of the theory of  systematics knows that the operations system is a dynamic system  under which two living forces sharply confront each other and  undergo drastic changes, and commanders of the opposing sides  will make strenuous efforts to annihilate their enemy and  achieve the "maximum value" of systems planning. However,  although the "maximum value" exists in theory, it is difficult  to achieve in reality. As such, military commanders are  required to be good at judging the hour and sizing up the  situation, weighing the advantages and disadvantages, and having  the courage to "discard" while being good at "taking," and  direct operations in a lively way. Comrade Su Yu attained  perfection in this regard.    At the beginning of the east Henan campaign, a method of  "catching big fish" was adopted to annihilate the enemy's  reorganized 5th Army and at the same time, Comrade Su Yu had  worked out a plan to storm Kaifeng and then annihilate the enemy  relief force. The enemy's reinforced 5th Army was Chiang  Kai-shek's "elite" unit and the main force of the Qiu Qingquan  Army in the battlefields of central China. Annihilating it  would open the war situation in central China. Naturally, that  was a "maximum value." When the Third and Eighth Columns under  the command of the East China Field Army were moving from the  Xichang area to Huaiyang, the Qiu Army, which was stationed in  the southwestern region of Shandong, was lured by our forces and  rushed southward. By seizing the opportunity, the main forces  of the East China Field Army crossed the Huang He from the  Puyang area. At that time, shocked by the move, the enemy  supreme command swiftly ordered the main forces of the Qiu Army  and the reorganized 75th Division to return to the north at top  speed so as to block our troops from crossing the river. At the  same time, they reinforced the area by dispatching three more  reorganized divisions and a brigade. For a while, big armies  converged there, and moreover, it was not easy to break up the  reorganized 5th Army, the main force of the Qiu Army, as it was  neatly deployed. As the enemy advanced, we retreated, and the  conditions to annihilate the 5th Army had not matured, but the  opportunity of first attacking Kaifeng and then annihilating the  enemy reinforcements had emerged. By this time, our Third and  Eighth Columns had entered Tongxu, Weixian, and Jixian, a  one-day journey to Kaifeng, the capital of Henan under the  Kuomintang government. Although the city was guarded by more  than 30,000 enemy troops, their combat capability was poor as  they were not under unified command; moreover, they were in a  state of isolation and the regular army formations that could be  moved to reinforce them were deployed 100 kilometers away from  the capital. On the contrary, the regular formations of the  East China Field Army and a unit under the command of the  Central China Field Army were deployed relatively closely. In  terms of timing and position, capturing the city was like taking  something from one's pocket and attacking the enemy  reinforcements was like casting a net to catch fish. Comrade Su  Yu determinedly discarded the pursuit of the expected "maximum  value" and made a prompt decision to strive for the relatively  realistic "satisfaction value" of attacking Kaifeng and  annihilating the enemy reinforcements. In the course of  operations, he was considering creating conditions for the  coming operations. To ensure the victory of the current  campaign, once again Comrade Su Yu discarded the pursuit of the  "maximum value" of completely annihilating the surviving forces  of the enemy's besieged reorganized 72th Division and  concentrated forces to attack the Huang Botao Army, which  frenziedly advanced toward our positions in an attempt to  overwhelm our forces. With overriding momentum, he attacked the  enemy forces in their early move, thus overawing the other enemy  reinforcements and gaining the "satisfaction value" of  victorious troop shifts.    By continuously devising brilliant moves and blazing new  trails, Comrade Su Yu was able to win every battle he fought.  Marshal Chen Yi said: "In directing battles, General Su Yu has  consistently maintained his record of being invincible. The  more moves he devises, the more brilliant they will become, and  the more battles he fights, the more brilliantly he does." As I  understand it, this remark was not only praise for Comrade Su  Yu, but also an indication of one characteristic of his art of  war, namely, continuously bringing forth new ideas which are  "boundless like heaven and earth and inexhaustible like the  rivers" rather than confining oneself to set rules. It was  precisely his ability to "devise a brilliant move in every  battle he fights" that enabled him to "fight the battle more and  more brilliantly."    In his article "Develop Ourselves in the Enemy's Rear Areas  in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the Tianmu Shan Campaign," there  were remarks full of military philosophy. He wrote: "In  fighting battles, dialectics is necessary, because both sides  are living persons in action and like ourselves, the enemy can  use their brains and can walk. While fighting, they can change  their tactics. We have to follow suit. Even if they do not  change their tactics, we must change our tactics in light of the  changes in the battlefields." Comrade Su Yu was well versed in  military dialectics. Like everything, war undergoes constant  change as time, place, and conditions change. No two operations  are completely the same. Military tactics are bound to differ  in thousands of ways. War is a field full of vitality. Only a  military strategist who has a trailblazing spirit and keeps  forging ahead can establish himself in an unassailable position.    In operations, Comrade Su Yu boldly blazed new trails and  adopted appropriate measures as time, geological conditions, and  the enemy's situation changed. In the central Jiangsu campaign,  he carefully directed one live drama full of power and grandeur  after another. In the first battle he launched in Xuanjiabao and  Taixing, he directed troops in an unusual way: Annihilating the  enemy troops before they managed to take action by adopting a  counteroffensive method. In the battle of Runan, he ignored the  closer enemy positions and led his troops 100 li away and then  stormed the enemy from their flanks and rear. In the Haian  battle, he blunted the edge of the enemy's advance while beating  them back. In the Libao battle, he commanded his troops to  launch a surprise attack on the enemy while they had their heads  turned by "victory celebrations." In the Dingyan-Linzi battle,  selecting the enemy's weak points, he directed his troops in  launching a frontal attack on the enemy, and later on, in  attacking Huang (Qiao) to rescue Shao (Bo), he commanded his  troops to go deep into the enemy's hinterland to carry out  operations there. Thus he successfully applied the Chinese  ancient military tactic of "besieging the State of Wei to rescue  the State of Zhao" in a tactical operation. It helped  energetically support Shao Bo's operations and annihilate 17,000  enemy troops in the operation. The enemy were so badly beaten  that they were reduced to a state of utter stupefaction and were  completely at a loss. Comrade Su Yu commanded a 30,000-strong  army to confront an enemy army 120,000 strong. His troops  fought the enemy for 18 months in the strategic forward areas  close to the enemy's heartland, won the seven battles they  fought, and annihilated more than 50,000 enemy troops. This was  rarely seen in the history of war. In the Menglianggu battle,  when the strong enemy forces converged to launch selective  attacks on our forces, in accordance with Chen Yi's instructions  and by making full use of the favorable condition that our  troops fought in the hinterland of the liberated areas, Comrade  Su Yu adopted the method of "playing a dragon lantern" --  sometimes fighting in the south and sometimes in the north,  sometimes in the east and sometimes in the west, and sometimes  advancing and sometimes retreating, and fighting while  retreating -- and created opportunities to fight. By seizing  the opportunity of the enemy elite force, the reorganized 74th  Division, made a central breakthrough and, using the tactic of  "a fierce tiger ripping out the heart of its prey," he assigned  five columns the task of surrounding and annihilating the enemy  and four columns the task of blocking the enemy relief force and  ordered his troops to thrust into the middle of the enemy battle  formation to cut the 14th Division's ties with its friendly  neighboring units, thus wiping out the whole division in one  fell swoop and creating the miracle of "chopping off the head of  a general in an army one million strong." This was also an  example of Comrade Su Yu's "marvelous" art of war.    There are rules, but not hard and fast rules, to follow in  directing operations. In directing operations, Comrade Su Yu  would always seek rules outside the established ones, and seek  original changes. In the Laizhou-Wuhu campaign, by adopting the  tactic of feinting to the east and attacking in the west, while  putting a military presence in south Shandong, he launched a  decisive battle in central Shandong. In the Wusong-Shanghai  campaign, while attacking Wusong, he adopted the tactic of  making a feint to the east and attacking the east and directed  this offensive at the enemy's main and strong positions so as to  lure more enemy troops to bite the hook. In the Huaihai  Campaign, he adopted the tactic of "leaving the unconditioned as  it stands and making the best of everything" and gave the enemy  in Xuzhou a way out. In the Jinan campaign, he adopted the  tactic of "leaving the conditioned as it stands and making the  best of everything" and by ordering a 180,000-strong army to  prepare to attack the enemy relief force, he clearly stated to  the enemy that so long as you had the courage to come, we were  in a position to annihilate you. In terms of ambush, sometimes  he ambushed the rescuing, retreating or "passing-by" enemy  troops and sometimes he "lured the enemy by promise of gain" or  "threatened them by force." In terms of encirclement and  annihilation, he sometimes "encircled a division and destroyed  one-tenth of its force [wei shi que yi 0953 1597 7067 0001],"  sometimes he "encircled the enemy without destroying it,"  sometimes he laid a long-term encirclement on the enemy, and  sometimes he annihilated the enemy the moment he encircled them.  In terms of besieging a city to annihilate the enemy relief  force, sometimes he made a faked besieging a city but attacked  the enemy relief force in reality. He sometimes faked attacking  the enemy relief force but actually besieged or captured the  city while attacking the enemy relief force. This endless  change in his use of stratagems was a vivid embodiment of  Comrade Su Yu's outstanding ability to command.    Being brave, fearless, capable, industrious, and prudent  constituted the solid foundation for Comrade Su Yu to put  himself in a superior position against the enemy in the sharp  and complicated military struggles. He was well-known for  daring to fight big battles, tough battles, and fierce battles.  During his 22 years of military life in battlefields, he always  used a small force to defeat a large one, used a weak force to  fight a strong one, destroyed enemy strongholds and took the  edge off the enemy's spirit, and inflicted repeated reverses on  a formidable enemy. He had unusual revolutionary courage and  resourcefulness. Nevertheless, in reviewing his brilliant  battlefield experience full of "shining spears and armored  horses and daring" in those years, this battle-tested veteran  general with several decades of military life made such remarks  as "the burden is heavy" and "I feel nervous," and made no  mention of his bravery. When recalling his feelings on the eve  of the decisive Huangqiao battle, he said: "The responsibility  for the success or failure of the battle rests completely with  us. In a situation in which we are outnumbered by the enemy,  the burden we are shouldering is very heavy." When recalling  the central Jiangsu campaign, he stated: "In helping Comrade  Chen Yi direct the Subei campaign, I deeply feel that I have a  grave responsibility and I feel nervous." In speaking of the  Shatuji campaign, he remarked: "Now I feel I have a grave  responsibility." In talking about his feelings when he was  ordered to plan operations for east Henan, he said: "I deeply  feel the burden I am shouldering is heavy and I feel I issued a  'military order' to the central authorities this time" and it  was not until Kaifeng was captured that he said "I feel secure."  These thought-provoking records genuinely and vividly reflected  Comrade Su Yu's fine character of being brave and fearless,  capable, industrious, and prudent.    The confrontation of two armies is not only a contest in  military strength, firepower, and morale, but also a contest in  the astuteness and resourcefulness and the art of command and of  both sides' commanders. Under given conditions, more often than  not, victory hangs on a momentary slip of the commanders.  Therefore, their burdens cannot be said to be light and they  cannot be said not to feel nervous. The feelings that "I am  shouldering a heavy burden" and "I feel nervous" precisely  reflected Comrade Su Yu's high level of responsibility to the  party's cause and extreme prudence in directing military  operations. In studying the many campaigns Comrade Su Yu  directed, we all felt they were soul- stirring. A careful study  shows that he did not have the slightest idea of winning by  fluke. His profound idea of creating a spirited atmosphere  using strategy and the superb art of command are admirable.  Comrade Su Yu led troops in crossing the natural chasm -- the  Chang Jiang -- at full speed three times. Whether he led  several hundred troops in sneaking across the river or commanded  a 100,000-strong army in forging the river, he always "made  serious preparations and worked out well-conceived plans" and  directed the operations by "centering his complete concentration  on" them. Hence, no errors were made. In the second phase of  the Huaihai Campaign, he did not sleep for seven days and nights  and later on, he contracted Meniere's syndrome and still he  directed military operations in spite of illness. It was said  that Marshal Chen Yi praised Comrade Su Yu as a "Master Zhuge  who eats less but attends to numerous things." This was a vivid  embodiment of Comrade Su Yu's fine style of working diligently  and rigorously, sparing no pains. Comrade Mao Zedong urged  commanders to become brave and wise generals. Comrade Su Yu may  be rated as a good example in this regard.    Persisting in seeking truth from facts, proceeding in all  cases from actual conditions, and taking the unity of subjective  guidance and objective reality as the basic principle and  requirement for directing military operations constituted the  essence of Comrade Su Yu's art of command. Comrade Su Yu  studied war realistically and worked hard to probe the objective  laws governing war. He said: "In my youth, I studied how to  lead troops and fight with Commissar Mao [Zedong] and Army  Commander Zhu [De]. The most profound experience I gained is  that war has its own laws. We must seek the method of  vanquishing the enemy in accordance with the actual conditions  of the enemy and ourselves and the inherent laws governing war.  This truth has benefited me all my life." In studying war,  with his eyes focused on characteristics and development,  Comrade Su Yu was good at grasping the laws governing war at  different levels and periods. For example, his theory of a  "turning point" in operations direction divides war into three  levels: The strategic turning point of the overall war  situation, the periodical turning point of the war zone, and the  turning point of the process of campaigns. When the Liberation  War was imminent, in the light of the changed new situation,  Comrade Su Yu "repeatedly pondered so as to seek the laws  governing the war, in particular, the laws governing the early  period of the war." Until his evening years he was still  working hard to probe the laws governing modern war.    In directing war, Comrade Su Yu always combined the higher  authorities' instructions and actual conditions and creatively  implemented the higher authorities' intentions. He persisted in  going deep into the realities of life to conduct studies and  familiarize himself with the various aspects of the situation of  the enemy and ourselves, sought the laws governing military  actions, and applied these laws to his own operations, and  ensured the unity of subjective guidance and objective realities.    "Fight battles wherever it is convenient for us to wipe out  the enemy, fight battles whenever it is convenient to wipe out  the enemy, and attack the enemy whom it is convenient for us to  wipe out." This idea completely stresses basing oneself on  actual conditions.    Comrade Su Yu was not only good at integrating the universal  truth of Mao Zedong's military thinking and the concrete  practice of directing operations, but also good at summing up  practical experience and condensing and upgrading it into  theory. In his remaining years, he devoted himself to summing  up his operations experience. While writing his recollections,  he insisted in "writing real past events" and worked hard to  "accurately reflect how the understanding and mastery of the  laws governing war by the commander of a campaign leads to a  victory or a loss." He maintained: "If we describe the complex  war process as a process which has been well planned by wise  commanders and use this idea to educate our coming generations,  this will get us into trouble when a war breaks out." This  fully demonstrates the firmness and persistence of a proletarian  military strategist in upholding the ideological line of seeking  truth from facts.    The best way to commemorate Comrade Su Yu is to learn his  art  of command and decorum as a general, realistically study the  military struggles under the conditions of contemporary  technology, in particular, high technology, more conscientiously  study and apply Mao Zedong's military thinking, implement  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on army building in the new  period, carry out Comrade Jiang Zemin's "five remarks" general  requirement for army building, and strive to provide a powerful  security guarantee for China's reform and opening up to the  outside world and economic construction as well.</p>

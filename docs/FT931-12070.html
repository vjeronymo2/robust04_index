			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Giro speeds cash transfers in Europe - New system responds to complaints about banks TRANSFERRING money internationally through commercial banks is slow and expensive - something that is well known to anyone who makes and receives payments regularly. Often, the customer finds it difficult to discover the price. There is, however, an answer to the problem, at least for intra-European payments. A new system called Eurogiro links 14 European countries and could be joined by Japan before long. The 14 members are the three Nordic nations - Sweden, Norway and Finland - Switzerland, and all EC members except Italy, Greece, and Portugal. Italy is expected to announce that it intends to join when the Eurogiro directors hold their next meeting in Brussels on Friday. Japan's Postbank would also like to join, but the United States is a problem because there is nothing resembling the post office giro system in America. Eurogiro is run by the Danes, who got the job because the giro system is especially well developed in Scandinavia. Its managing director, Mogens Hansen - a co-director of Denmark's GiroBank - said in Copenhagen this week that it began in November last year in response to criticisms of the system operated by commercial banks. Hansen said: 'We offer the consumer a product which is cheap. It is transparent: the customer knows exactly what the cost is for both sender and recipient. And it is fast: we guarantee to complete a transfer within three bank days of a debit, or one day less if the system for urgent transfers is used.' A card, available to all customers, lists prices for payers and payees in each country. For example, making a payment from Denmark costs DKr15 while the receiver in the UK pays Pounds 2. 'We guarantee to keep our prices lower - or, at a maximum, never higher - than the banks,' Hansen said. Britain's Girobank, which has been owned wholly by the Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society since being privatised in 1989, is a part of Eurogiro. But the giro system is relatively undeveloped in Britain. According to Girobank's press office, the UK operation carries out about 135,000 transactions a year compared with about 250m by Denmark's GiroBank, although Denmark's population is only 5.1m to Britain's 60m. Hansen said that since Eurogiro opened - accompanied by a big advertising campaign in all member countries - interest had been enormous. Eurogiro expects to make around 7m transactions in its first year. In view of the large number of trade transactions between European countries, this total is quite small. But Hansen points out that the more people who use Eurogiro, the cheaper it will become. The system is easy to use. The recipient must have a giro account and the sender needs to know the number, but the sender does not necessarily need an account. You can go to the local post office, fill out a grio form, pay cash at the counter - and off it goes.</p>

"Nickerson is ready," declared Waters, who described herself as a  child of St. Louis' housing projects.  </P> <P> The management training -- open to all adult Nickerson residents -- is being  paid for by a $93,000 HUD grant, one of five such grants given to Los Angeles  public housing projects. The others will go to the Estrada Courts, Jordan  Downs, Normont Terrace and Pico Aliso projects.  </P> <P> Nickerson has hired Bertha Gilkey to run the sessions, which will be held three  times a month for the next year. Gilkey, a seemingly irrepressible advocate of  tenant rights, is known nationally for helping notoriously bad housing  projects, such as Cochran Gardens in St. Louis, clean up by putting the people  who live there in charge.  </P> <P> "I say to the 6 million people in public housing in this country . . . it is  time to challenge the system. . . . Who can better manage us than us?" Gilkey  said.  </P> <P> There are now more than a dozen public housing developments around the country  that are run at least in part by tenants, and efforts are under way to start  similar programs at more than 100 other housing projects.  </P> <P> Kemp also announced that the Los Angeles Housing Authority will get $18 million  this fiscal year to make improvements at its housing projects. Last year the  authority received nearly $15 million for repairs and improvements, but housing  officials say it would take more than $200 million to do all the improvement  work they would like to do.  </P></p>

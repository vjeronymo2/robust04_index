			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- The director of the  Defence Agency of Japan, Kazuo Aichi, reportedly told a press  conference that "the suspicion concerning North Korea's nuclear  development is ever increasing" and "North Korea is the biggest  factor of instability in Asia."    We cannot but take a serious view of his preposterous  sophism, which is an intolerable insult to the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea.    His utterances reveal a base scheme to impose unreasonable  "nuclear inspections" on the DPRK at any cost with international  pressure by spreading again the rumor of the DPRK's "suspected  nuclear development."    This "suspicion" is an offspring of the U.S. anti-socialist,  anti-DPRK moves. It is a fiction.    It is really ridiculous of Japan to cry over "a factor of  instability in Asia" and "a global problem", basing itself on  this fiction.    It is only too clear that Japan itself is the biggest factor  of instability in Asia.    Japan's moves to become a military power equipped with  nuclear arms, which are entering a dangerous stage, pose a  potential, grave threat to peace and security not only in Asia  but in the world.    The scheme of the Japanese reactionaries to develop the  "Theatre Missile Defence" system in collusion with the United  States is a grave threat and open challenge to the Korean people.    While crying for the "Theatre Missile Defence" system, Aichi  twaddled about "Japan-U.S. security system" and South  Korea-U.S. "alliance." This revealed the sinister intention to  strengthen the U.S.-Japan-South Korea "tripartite military  alliance" and contain the DPRK militarily.    It is, however, a foolish daydream.    The Japanese reactionaries must abandon the habit of  caviling  at others and give up their moves to convert Japan into a  nuclear power and military power, which pose a threat to peace  and security in Asia and the world.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Amstrad The Viglen acquisition is the latest and clearest expression of Amstrad's new strategy. Gone are the days of piling gadgetry high and selling it cheap, which made chairman Mr Alan Sugar famous. Margins on that business are wafer thin. Instead, the group is using its cash to acquire companies in higher margin niche markets. One of the attractions of Viglen is that it supplies personal computers direct to customers, cutting out middle men. Simultaneously Amstrad is turning itself into a holding company. There are so far four divisions: its original consumer electronics business; Betacom; Dancall, bought last year; and now Viglen. Further acquisitions seem probable given that Amstrad will still have cash after paying for Viglen. Viglen looks like a risky purchase. Though its executives have built it into a well-regarded business, their golden handcuffs will last only three and a half years. It is hard to see what competitive advantage Viglen will retain, if and when they leave. Nor is it obvious that Mr Sugar's proven skills as a mass marketeer can add much to a niche player like Viglen. His personal involvement is less important than it was. The implementation of the new strategy will largely depend on the business acumen of Mr David Rodgers, due to join as chief executive in August and about whom the stock market so far knows little.</p>

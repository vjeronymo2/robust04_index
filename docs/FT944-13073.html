			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Clinton reassures Kuwait over Iraq President Bill Clinton left Saudi Arabia at the end of a Middle East tour yesterday, having reassured Kuwait that Iraq would never again be allowed to threaten its security, writes our Middle East staff. 'The United States and the international community will not allow Baghdad to threaten its neighbour, now or in the future,' he said earlier in a brief visit to Kuwait. 'That is not a threat. That is a promise,' he told an audience of US troops who had been rushed to the emirate following Iraq's military build-up on the border earlier this month. Flanked by tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, Mr Clinton told hundreds of US, British, Kuwaiti and other Gulf Arab troops: 'We will not permit Iraq to enhance its capability below the 32nd parallel,' the line below which Iraq is barred from flying its warplanes. Mr Clinton was greeted with placards proclaiming 'Thank you, Mr President,' and 'Welcome, Mr President.' Washington announced on the eve of Mr Clinton's arrival in Kuwait that it was doubling its deployment of armour and attack jets in the Gulf to deter any military threat from Iraq. Mr Clinton's final stop on his six-nation tour was at the northern Saudi military city of Hafr al-Batin where he met King Fahd before flying back to Washington.</p>

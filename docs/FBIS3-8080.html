			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1000 GMT on 4 March carries in its  regular 4-minute newscast two reports updating the fighting in  the republic.    Mirudin Aldobasic reports from the 7-South Operative Group  Information Center saying that "overnight and in the early  morning hours the aggressor continued his bestial destruction of  residential areas in the Maglaj and Tesanj regions, and the free  territories of Doboj and Teslic. In addition to this, he is  relentlessly attacking the 133 km long defense lines in this  area. The chetniks also attacked Tesanj and its outskirts.  They attempted infantry breakthroughs in the area of Cerik and  Jelicev Gaj, situated in the wider region of Miljanovci, but  their attempts were thwarted. Over 100 enemy troops were put  out of action in last night's battles on the Teslic-Tesanj  defense line, 30 of whom were killed. In addition to this, they  [Serbs] shelled civilian targets in the Tesanj region,  particularly Mrkotic, Planje, and Radrsa. These attacks and the  chetnik devastation are still in progress." He adds that "there  was also fierce fighting in the Doboj region. One of the  enemy's terrorist-subversion groups infiltrated the area of  Mravici, Karusaj, and Matuzici, but it was quickly discovered  and destroyed. This morning, the brave members of the 203d  Motorized Brigade Doboj-Bosna repelled fierce enemy infantry  attacks in this area."    Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "the  bestial  shelling of the Bihac and Cazin areas continued overnight.  Chetnik howitzers, tanks, Bofors, Zis, mortars [words  indistinct] where everything is being systematically destroyed.  Fierce shelling and combined artillery and infantry attacks  directed at the defenders on Grabez and the Grmusko-Srbljanski  plateau continued late last night and this morning. Artillery  provocations continued on the demarcation lines with the army of  the so-called Kladusa autonomy, particularly in the region of  (?Trst) in the Cazin Commune. The situation in the Velika  Kladusa Commune is best illustrated by Fikret Abdic himself, who  two days ago ordered new measures against all those who are not  on his side. This is in effect an introduction to a fresh  offensive on the free part of Bihac Commune."</p>

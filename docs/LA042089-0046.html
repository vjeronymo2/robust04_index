			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: PIONEER AVIATOR FETE AT MUSEUM OF FLYING  </P> <P> It's not often that an invitation comes with the option for aviation attire. It  will be more de rigueur than black-tie (also acceptable) for the Museum of  Flying's special evening Saturday on the grounds of the Santa Monica Airport.  The invitations are slick with a photo of a DT Torpedo Bomber, 1923 vintage,  surrounded by the original Douglas Aircraft employees.  </P> <P> Joan Stewart, the museum's executive director, is putting the dinner and  dancing together honoring a host of aviation pioneers who have written their  names across the skies. (Stewart was a mover and shaker in the original  Pasadena Showcase House of Design, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary  the same night).  </P> <P> They'll all cocktail amidst Spitfires and P-51 Mustangs. The museum's board of  governors will lend pizazz -- Donald Douglas Jr., chairman; David G. Price,  president; and board members including actor/producer Tony Bill; Walter J.  Boyne, former director of the Smithsonian; William P. Clark; Charles Knapp;  Lois Hamilton Knapp; Dr. Paul MacCready; John Marin; Bruce W. Orriss; actor  Cliff Robertson; Edwin M. Stanley and Madine Pulaski.  </P> <P> BIGGER, BETTER: The pride of UCLA was evident the other evening in gargantuan  proportions as the powers plopped a big white tent over the Royce Hall Quad --  site of the campus's original four buildings -- to host 1,000 friends (UCLA has  180,000 alums in the Southern California area) for a black-tie sit-down dinner  and then a stage salute from Gregory Peck, Mel Torme and Henry Mancini at  Royce.  </P> <P> The white chocolate cornucopias filled with spring berries and sabayon sauce  were planned by John and Marion Anderson, UCLA campaign celebration co-chairs,  to be symbolic of the university's successful conclusion of its UCLA Campaign  -- $375 million raised privately over the past six years for academic programs  campuswide.  </P> <P> "This is one of the proudest and happiest moments in UCLA history," Anderson,  who went to UCLA on an ice hockey scholarship, told the crowd. "Please raise  your glasses -- here's to UCLA, here's to the Bruins, here's to the Blue and  the Gold -- to all of you and to all of us -- to UCLA, our beloved university.  Let the feast begin."  </P> <P> Anderson truly could say us. He and Marion (wearing Bulgari cabachon rubies and  diamonds) have given $15 million to UCLA. There were other colossal givers,  though. And the Andersons shared the stage with UCLA Campaign National Chairman  James A. Collins and Chancellor Charles Young, both praised profusely for their  dedication to the drive. They, in turn, praised their wives -- Carol Collins  and Sue Young -- and the city's prominent. As Raymond L. Orbach, College of  Letters and Science provost, pointed out, Young was also celebrating his 20th  year with the university. "He has coaxed, cajoled us to the heights of  excellence."  </P> <P> Present were at least 17 of the 30 faculty members who are the recipients of  endowed chairs from the campaign. Among the others, gazing up through the clear  tent to the turquoise and apricot illumination of Royce and the library, was a  crowd including prominent donors Eugene and Maxine Rosenfeld, former Ambassador  to the United Nations Economic and Social Council Lester and Carolbeth Korn,  Leonard and Dorothy Straus, Richard and Eileen Eamer, Edgardo and Francesca  Acosta, Roy and Carol Doumani, Robert and Lois Erburu, Dr. Peter and Helen  Bing, Phillip and Helen Fowler, Gordon and Virginia MacDonald, Henry and Ginny  Mancini, Edward and Hannah Carter, David and Dallas Price, Yvonne Lenart,  Stephen and Kitty Moses.  </P> <P> The evening ended romantically with Mancini at the piano and Torme's velvet  warbles of "The Days of Wine and Roses" and, of course, "Moon River" for a  finale.  </P> <P> KUDOS: To Caroline Leonetti Ahmanson, who blew out the candle on each birthday  cake in a cake parade for 256 guests at the Beverly Hills Hotel Crystal  Ballroom. Not only did His Excellency Han Xu, Ambassador to the U.S. from  China, attend, but China also sent its first ambassador to the United States,  Chai Zemin, to present Caroline with the American Marco Polo award for her  achievements in developing relations between the U.S. and the People's Republic  of China. The Los Angeles-Guangzhou Sister City Assn. hosted . . .  </P> <P> To Henry Droz of Beverly Hills, president of Warner/Electra/Atlantic  Distributing Company, honored by the T. J. Martel Foundation in New York. Paul  Cooper was West Coast dinner chairman . . .  </P> <P> To Rodney Peete, receiving applause from the Ebonics Scholarship Fund-Raising  Dinner hosted by USC Black Alumni Assn. at Town and Gown.  </P> <P> PAST PERFECT: A starlight crowd for the Ahmanson Theatre "Hapgood" opening  party at the Brown Derby -- Barbara Bain, Alan and Marilyn Bergman, Carol  Channing, Robert Fryer, Harry Hamlin, Katherine Helmond, John Lithgow . . .  </P></p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Market-Testing in Whitehall: 44,000 civil servants must compete to keep jobs THE PROGRAMME of market-testing announced yesterday by Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, represents an enormous increase in the scale of contracting out of central government functions. The market-testing, the first step in the process that leads to contracting out, means that in the next 10 months, more than 44,000 civil servants - one in 12 - will have to compete against outside contractors to keep their jobs. The value of the activities to be contracted out will rise 50-fold, from Pounds 25m this year to almost Pounds 1.5bn next. There will also be a change in the type of work that is put out to tender. At the start of the 1980s, government support services such as cleaning, security and reprographics were contracted out to the private sector. As in much of UK industry, these were seen as non-core functions, better left to specialist contractors. Now a much wider range of activities is to be put out to tender, reaching deep into the heart of government. The largest category of business to be market-tested in yesterday's announcement is information technology and computer services. Throughout the Civil Service, the provision of IT services and the running of computers - including those holding sensitive tax and benefit information - will increasingly be carried out by private companies. Other activities long regarded as core government functions are also included: The Treasury's economic model. The management of the police national computer at Hendon. Typing and secretarial services in the Inland Revenue. Ship radio licensing currently done by the Radiocommunications Agency. Naval surveillance operations by Customs and Excise and the Agriculture Ministry's fishery protection department. Engineering and maintenance services for the armed forces. The survey and certification of ships in British waters. Many departments will be market-testing payroll, building and estate management, training and internal audit. Entire executive agencies such as Companies House and DVOIT (the Transport Department's information technology agency) will be in the market. In most cases, staff will be encouraged to bid for the business with help from management consultants to ensure their bids are competitive. In some, managers may be able to mount management buyouts, particularly where entire agencies are to be market-tested. The government expects as much as Pounds 350m to be saved from the programme. Yesterday's white paper says: 'In previous years, savings . . . have typically been about 25 per cent of the original cost, even where the activity has remained in-house.' Where the internal team wins the bid, a formal contract will be signed, specifying the standard of work and means of redress if these are not met. Mr Waldegrave expects that the result will be not only cheaper services but also better-quality work. That optimism has certainly been justified by this year's contracting out of typing and secretarial services at the new Inland Revenue head office building in Nottingham. The winning bid, from Blue Arrow, was reported to have undercut the Revenue's bid by 25 per cent while offering longer hours of service, higher accuracy levels and faster turnround targets. In the past year, every department and agency has had to draw up plans to extend market-testing to new areas of operation. In most cases it has been done with consultants who have tried to analyse activities to see what can be contracted out and to establish that there will be more than one company interested in bidding for the work. The programme has been masterminded by the government's efficiency unit, headed by Sir Peter Levene, the former head of defence procurement at the Ministry of Defence, who is now deputy chairman and managing director of Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking concern. Departments have already started the process of drawing up tenders and attracting bidders. The defence ministry last week attracted more than 600 companies to a conference in Birmingham designed to provide information on what would be market-tested and how to frame a bid. There is an incentive for contracts to be put out before next July, when the EC directive on public procurement of services will require all but the smallest contracts to be advertised throughout the EC. The government has said that it wishes to be able to take final decisions on awarding contracts by the end of September next year with contracts starting in 1994. By then, more market-testing is likely to be under way. Some departments, such as Trade and Industry and the Welsh Office, are already putting out to tender more than 10 per cent of their work. Others, such as the Employment Department, are contracting out less than 5 per cent. The laggards can expect the spotlight to turn on them next time round, with hard questions from the government's efficiency unit about why they have yet to market-test activities that other departments have put out to tender.</p>

A Palestinian source said that the Israelis had brought  general proposals on the international presence, [in the  occupied territories] security measures on the ground and the  stationing of the Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho.    The talks between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and  U.S. coordinator Dennis Ross also ended yesterday evening with a  second meeting, which lasted over an hour. At the end of the  meeting the U.S. official made clear his satisfaction with what  had been achieved on a number of issues, which he refused to  clarify, saying that what was more important was that something  had been accomplished. Dennis Ross will leave Tunis this  morning for Cairo.</p>

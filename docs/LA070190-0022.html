			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'WORD WARRIORS' SHOULD CAP POISON PENS  </P> <P> The point of Edward Iwata's article describing the feud between Asian-American  writers Maxine Hong Kingston and Frank Chin ("Word Warriors," June 24) was  well-taken. It struck me as a fitting parallel to the overwhelming alienation  that dominates the power struggle between the sexes in our society today.  </P> <P> As a writer, I can appreciate the courage and dedication both authors share to  commit their visions to paper. Both have been willing to face and rename the  ghosts and demons of their Chinese souls. They may not be soul mates or even  approximate the male-female polarity and relationship that Henry Miller and  Anais Nin had in their day, but they do have a strong basis for mutual support  and respect. Their intentions -- to examine and expand the integrity of their  culture -- appear to be carved from the same piece of marble, but their styles  differ, something that seems to be less and less tolerated today due to the  growth of hypercritical and hate-driven standards.  </P> <P> We're learning that something backfired in the feminist movement. The  shattering of the old myths has not brought about a new vision shared between  men and women as expected. We women assumed men would cheer us on (at least  eventually). Yet the outcome seems to be that men feel abandoned and women feel  unsupported.  </P> <P> If it's true that Chin's acknowledgment or befriending of Kingston would  "betray his life's work, the justification of his rage," and that Kingston  "might tarnish her (feminist mother) image if she publicly admitted Chin helped  shape her writing," then I feel terribly despairing. If these powerful,  literary pioneers can't take the next step toward facing each other's demons,  then perhaps the very souls of all races are doomed to shrivel.  </P> <P> KAREN KAYE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lonrho in gold mine venture with Uzbekistan LONRHO, the UK-based con-glomerate, said yesterday it hoped next week to sign a joint venture agreement to develop a new gold mine in Uzbekistan, part of the former Soviet Union. 'We are in the final stages of negotiations and it would be very good timing if we could sign during the president of Uzbekistan's visit to London next week,' the company said. 'But the negotiations are proving very tough.' The potential mine would be 'substantial' in world terms and 'very large' for Uzbekistan, the eighth largest gold producer in the world with an annual output of between 70 and 80 tonnes. Mr Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan's president, told Reuters the venture would be at the Kokpatas and Amanmaitau mines near Zarafshan, about 560km north of the capital, Tashkent. It would be a joint venture between Lonrho, the Uzbek Ministry of Geology and a mining enterprise in the Navoi region and the mine would take three to four years to reach full production.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Giorgio Battistini report: "They Are Trying To Undermine </F> the Elections"]    [Text] Rome -- A "dirty game": Someone is trying to  "poison the wells and to have the election campaign conducted by  corrupt men connected with [former Socialist leader] Craxi who  are working according to a specific plan" using "minutely  orchestrated disclosures" and reports "as spectacular as to cite  one dead man who is unable to provide confirmation and two  living men who have already denied it." And this is "just the  beginning of the election campaign."    This was announced 24 hours earlier by Achille Occhetto  [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) secretary], who was starting  his campaign. He was referred enthusiastically to the agreement  among the eight progressive groupings on using a single symbol  for their electoral lists. The same words were spoken, quietly,  24 hours later. And it was immediately apparent that he did not  expect this cold shower from Milan. Was it really so cold? Not  at all. It has already been denied. And yet an annoying breeze  is already upsetting the political contest.    At PDS headquarters they refused to believe it at first.  What? Mr. Sama again? Right now? They did not start taking it  seriously until mid-afternoon, after a deluge of telephone calls  from all over Italy: It was like having a fever, with everyone  asking how do you feel; are you alright, despite everything? It  was later, as they watched the television news, that they  started to take Sama's latest statement to [Judge] Di Pietro  seriously. It then became impossible to maintain the low  profile that they initially wanted to adopt, confining their  response to an angry denial from the press bureau, an indignant  statement to ANSA by Occhetto. Much more was needed, following  the accusation that has tainted the start of the election  campaign. An attack on those who are maneuvering, not even so  secretly. By late evening the roll of drums could be heard  throughout the capital, and newspaper and television reporters  were summoned urgently. The PDS leadership was assembled, as  befitting an important occasions.    It fell to Visani to issue the angry denial. Occhetto  displayed all the incredulity proper to a complete fabrication,  provided a political interpretation of the operation, and  expressed his contempt for those who "right on cue, have tried  to spoil the party for the progressive forces, the very day  after an extraordinary agreement was reached. But the party  goes on." [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema yielded to the  temptation of sarcasm: "Of course they pondered it for a long  time, and examined things carefully for months in order to  fabricate this nonsense. Who could it have been? Let me see:  Didn't Cusani work for Craxi?" D'Alema was the only one of the  PDS leaders to go beyond an expression of outrage and to explore  possible leads. The corruption investigation has nothing to do  with it, and their respect for Di Pietro has not been undermined  (indeed, "he is doing his job; it is Sama who is telling lies,"  Visani admitted). But certainly "it is a strange trial; it is  not clear who is being accused. Sama said these things months  ago, and we have already given evidence. Now he is trying  again. He is repeating himself, with some additional novelties,  figures, and details. He must have studied hard in the interim.  They are rather strange charges: We do not know how, when, or  where. We do not even know who should be accused, since it is  unfortunately impossible to sue a dead man -- Gardini."    The honor of destroying the Romagnese Sama fell to  Visentini,  another, ice-cool, Romagnese. "Why is he now recycling this old  and clearly groundless story? It is a fabrication, with some  shameful allusions. There is proof. Dragoni and Tassinari,  identified as the couriers who accompanied the billion lire,  issued a denial. Dragoni, the mayor of Ravenna, merely obeyed  Gardini's request to meet with Occhetto. All the rest is a  fabrication. The facts are clear -- unfortunately for Sama and  fortunately for us." His words stung like whiplashes. "Let us  forget about the remarks on television" (which can do enormous  damage during an election campaign), "but neither Sama nor  anyone else can say to whom the money was consigned, where, or  when this supposedly took place. But the fact that remains is  the vote in parliament in which the PDS turned down Gardini's  request to drop the Enimont inquiry."    So who is vilifying the PDS, two months before the  elections? Suspicions were voiced. Occhetto tried his hand as  a reporter. Wearing his blue jacket and Clinton-style dark  necktie with yellow squares (the same one he wore on the great  day the progressive pact was signed), he announced "a  spectacular piece of news." "An expose is fabricated  artificially, implicating a dead man who cannot confirm it and  two living people who deny it. Some scoop. So the real news is  this: Someone is already trying to undermine the March  elections. It deserves the loud laugh due to such a macabre and  grotesque event. As a citizen, together with D'Alema, I call  for the utmost protection because from now on anybody could cite  a dead person, attributing to him who knows what accusations to  the detriment of who knows whom. Beware: Somebody is secretly  planning further carefully calculated coups."    After the statements came the round of repetitive interviews  for the television networks. It must really have been a  terrible moment to make Occhetto angry ("No, your question is  wrongly formulated; it is not true that I am implicated") with a  Fininvest reporter.    The day after the left-wing party was one of great  irritation. The inevitable question was: Why is Sama lying, why  now? D'Alema attempted a reply: "I do not know whether he is  just raving or performing a role written by someone else. I  judge the reliability of his recollections on the basis of  certain details: He has always spoken about an imaginary dinner  with me. Actually, I went one morning, at breakfast time, to  the hotel that he used as his base in Rome. It may be just a  detail, but I only had coffee. What can I say? I think that  Carlo Sama is now very heavily influenced, or easily influenced,  and heavily involved in some excessively complex affairs. I  also think that we do not yet know what happened to all that  money from the Enimont kickbacks. I have seen the figures, and  they do not add up. There is still a lot missing. And I think  that there may still be someone to whom he cannot deny certain  favors." Be that as it may, Franco Bassanini pointed out, the  PDS acted "extremely scrupulously in parliament. We voted  against Gardini's request to shelve the inquiry. That day 82  percent of PDS deputies were present. With regard to Sama's  lies I would put forward three hypotheses: He fabricated the  whole thing because somebody asked for his help. Or Gardini told  him to do so, because he really hoped to soften the PDS' stance,  and then gave up. Or, again, he did try it with somebody. But  he was given to understand that it was impossible."</p>

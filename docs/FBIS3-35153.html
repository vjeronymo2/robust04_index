			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F> delegation to the Taba talks, in Cairo, Egypt, by Yusuf Isma'il  in the studio, from "The Week in 1 Hour" program -- live relay]    [Excerpts] [Isma'il] Dr. Nabil, we are talking to you from  "The Week in 1 Hour" program. We understand from the statements  made after the last round of talks that ended yesterday in Taba  that there is much hope and optimism, that some points have been  concluded, and that the resumption of the talks next week in  Cairo will almost be a summing up of the talks. What is the  picture on the evening of this Friday?    [Sha'th] Undoubtedly, progress has been made. This progress  stems from the fact that we have reached the last part of these  talks. There was a prior understanding on numerous components  of this part. Now we are at the final drafting stage.  Therefore, we managed to wrap up an important part relating to  the Palestinian police force, security measures, and security  liaison. We also wrapped up a significant part of the transfer  of civilian powers. We discussed in detail the issue of the  general amnesty of prisoners and release of prisoners. We have  begun the final drafting of the overall preamble, or the overall  agreement. I believe that it was an important and successful  week.    [Isma'il] I would like to ask you about two issues. First  of all, regarding the Palestinian police force -- as far as I  remember you demanded 15,000 policemen and Israel gave its  consent for 6,000. What are the chances of reaching a settlement  on this issue?    [Sha'th] In fact, I do not wish to discuss numbers. I  believe that discussing such details will harm the achievement  of a final result, which requires both sides to arrive at real  figures that will lead to a conclusion. We want to ensure  stability for the Palestinian resident. We wish to provide the  security that every Palestinian and Israeli resident wants. The  attainment of this security requires an efficient and capable  police force apart from all economic and political safety  measures, participation, and democracy. Therefore, the issue is  not only one of figures. It is a comprehensive perception of  the issue.    [Isam'il] It seems that you are in agreement with Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres who was interviewed today by Qol Yisra'el  in Hebrew. He almost made the same remarks. He said that  figures are not important and, ultimately, the issue must be  settled. There is hope then.    [Sha'th] I believe that next week we will manage to settle  this matter.    [Isma'il] The other issue which I wanted to ask you about is  the release of prisoners, which you have been demanding from the  outset. The PLO chairman raised this issue once more today in  Holland. On the other hand, Israel says that in accordance with  the annual custom at the 'Id al-Fitr or at festivals and other  occasions, it releases prisoners. Can you tell us anything new  about this issue?    [Sha'th] In fact, the Israeli authorities' release on  certain occasions -- during Ramadan and the 'Id al-Fitr -- of  detainees whose prison terms have ended or are about to end is  different from what we are talking about. We are talking about  a comprehensive release as part of this agreement. We are  talking about an integral timetble. Therefore, this goes beyond  responding only to humanitarian and religious requirements and  occasions to ending a situation that existed due to the presence  of the occupation and its resistance. Now we are heading toward  a new situation. Therefore, all those who were part of the  previous situation of occupation and resistance should be  released.    [Isma'il] This is your demand, but what is the reality?  What are the contacts between you and the Israeli authorities?  Can we give the good news to our viewers in the West Bank and  the Gaza Strip that you have received promises on the release of  prisoners?    [Sha'th] Yes, I believe that as soon as the agreement is  signed, a few thousand will be released. However, after this  there will be a timetable for a gradual release within framework  of the peaceful measures that we are endeavoring to achieve and  within context of the arrival of the Palestinian authority and  its shouldering of responsibility.    [Isma'il] Dr. Nabil, my understanding then is that during  the month of Ramadan an agreement will be signed and practical  work will begin.    [Sha'th] I hope so. You know that such issues are not  subject to negotiating considerations alone but to numerous  political considerations. I believe that we can reach an  agreement by the 'Id al-Fitr [on or about 13 March] at the  latest so that the feast may have more than one meaning. For  several reasons, however, it is difficult for one to make an  accurate prediction. If not by this feast, then the agreement  will be reached very close to it. I hope, however that we will  sign before this feast, God willing. [passage omitted]    [Isma'il] I understand that Cairo is aware of all  Israeli-Palestinian contacts and of all the negotiations'  secrets. Are the other parties, specially Syria, also aware of  what is taking place in the talks?    [Sha'th] Fraternal Syria and all Arab and international  parties concerned are briefed about the results of our work.  Naturally, however, not as much as the two neighboring and  principal Arab parties, namely, Egypt and Jordan. The talks are  being conducted in Egypt and we have a special relationship with  Jordan. Therefore, the Egyptian and Jordanian Governments are  provided with detailed information, but the other governments  are provided with less detail and only periodically.    [Isma'il] Have you heard that an Israeli Arab delegation  might be visiting Damascus to offer condolences to President  al-Asad on Basil's death?    [Sha'th] I believe that the emotions of our sons everywhere  regarding the tragedy that struck President Hafiz al-Asad are  real and sincere.    [Isma'il] But the significant thing is that the Syrian  authorities have given their approval for such a step for the  first time. Do you see any political meaning or indication by  this?    [Sha'th] There is no doubt that there are numerous meanings  and indications in any such act. However, it is also a  framework for interaction. Undoubtedly, there are also  political considerations in this act.    [Isma'il] Dr. Nabil, we thank you for coming to the studio  in Cairo. Every viewer is now probably asking: What will be  the outcome? What can you say to the viewers in the West Bank  and the Gaza Strip this evening in one minute?    [Sha'th] I say to them that the problem is difficult and  that we are embarking on building an entity and a homeland in  which there will be freedom, self-confidence, and hopes for the  future. I call on them to be patient. I believe that we will  be on the threshhold of this new challenge.    [Isma'il] We thank Dr. Nabil Sha'th for this interview, the  first one in our program via direct relay from Cairo. Our  correspondents have met with you in Tunis and Taba, but it is  the first time that we are meeting with Cairo and Dr. Nabil  Sha'th via satellite. God willing, we will have other meetings  with you.    [Sha'th] Thank you.</p>

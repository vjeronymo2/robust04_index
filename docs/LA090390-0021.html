			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Goodby Stevie: More than 2,000 musicians and fans stood in blazing Dallas heat  Friday to pay last respects to Dallas-born, blues-rock guitarist Stevie Ray  Vaughan, killed Aug. 27 in a helicopter crash in Wisconsin.  </P> <P> "The Texas style of music has lost a great ambassador," said singer Stevie  Wonder, who attended the funeral service. Several mourners, many wearing black  hats in memory of Vaughan's style of dress, collapsed because of the heat.  Singer Bonnie Raitt led a chorus of "Amazing Grace," accompanied by other music  stars such as Phil Collins and members of the group Z.Z. Top. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

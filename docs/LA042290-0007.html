			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN'S FALL  </P> <P> In May of last year I was privileged to be in attendance at one of President  Reagan's "private sector speeches" and feel compelled to let you know the  reaction to his speech by a representative group of tax-paying Americans.  </P> <P> Quite simply, we loved him.  </P> <P> He did again what no journalist and very few politicians can do; he made us  feel enormously proud to be Americans. He summarized the many problems facing  our nation while encouraging each of us, in our own way, to meet these  challenges. He was bright, articulate, positive and, excuse the term,  inspirational.  </P> <P> We know he's not perfect; we understand the implications of budget and trade  deficits as well as anyone, and in spite of these insights, we still love the  man. Amazing? Not really. We just don't expect any more out of Ronald Reagan  than we do of ourselves.  </P> <P> GEORGE ANDERSON  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

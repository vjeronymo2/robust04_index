			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Earthquake in LA blurs growth data The US Commerce Department yesterday reported weak economic data for January, but the figures were consistent with relatively strong economic growth because of distortions caused by cold weather and the Los Angeles earthquake. New home sales fell 20.1 per cent between December and January to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 695,000. This figure was still 14 per cent above the level in January 1993 because of big increases in sales in the second half of last year. Personal income fell 0.3 per cent in the same period, but officials said it would have risen by a robust 0.7 per cent but for special factors such as a decline in rental income and cuts in farm subsidies. Wage and salary income rose a robust 1 per cent from December, and consumer spending increased by 0.5 per cent in real terms, reflecting a 0.9 per cent increase in spending on services. Separately, the Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its 'help wanted' index fell from 110 in December to 106 in January. Other labour market data have signalled sluggish job creation at the start of the year. Most economists believe the rate of growth has slowed significantly from the fourth quarter of last year when real gross domestic product grew at an erratic annual rate of 7.5 per cent in real terms. But distortions caused by bad weather and natural disasters have blurred recent economic signals. Mr Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said the economy was probably growing at an annual rate of about 3.5 per cent. But this was a 'stab in the dark', given the various distortions. There was little evidence of higher inflation, he added. The modest rebound in commodity prices reflected in the purchasing managers' price index reported on Tuesday was to be expected, given the industrial recovery.</p>

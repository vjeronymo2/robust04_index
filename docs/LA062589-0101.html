			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOARD VOTE ON THE AIDS ORDINANCE  </P> <P> Once again the right-wing reactionaries are pushing their will onto the  majority of us who aren't fundamentalists. I'm referring to the defeat of the  AIDS anti-discrimination vote of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. When  will these alleged do-gooders realize that their medieval values are not those  of the general population? Who appointed them the omniscient overseers of the  values and morals of others?  </P> <P> Louis Sheldon says he serves those "religious persons of any persuasion who  believe there are moral absolutes." Well, what about the rest of us who aren't  religious zealots? Does he imply that the non-fundamentalist has no morals?  Hardly. This non-fundamentalist holds many moral absolutes, the strongest of  which is, "don't force your beliefs, platitudes, ideals, and common-good  nonsense down my throat."  </P> <P> The fact that he and other loons like William Dannemeyer can force the vote of  a popularly elected body by bombarding it with phone calls from their obedient  flocks is pretty frightening. The issue isn't AIDS; it's the clout that these  people possess in regards to laws that affect everyone.  </P> <P> An issue such as the AIDS anti-discrimination law is far too touchy and  sensitive to be decided by such a politically and morally bankrupt group as our  Board of Supervisors. It needs to go to a popular vote.  </P> <P> DAVID S. BROUDY  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

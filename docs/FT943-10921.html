			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Cigna registers 53% gain in second-quarter income Cigna, the US insurance group, continued to record strong advances in its second-quarter health insurance business, though the costs of meeting property/casualty claims rose. Overall, net income saw a better-than-expected 53 per cent rise to Dollars 135m. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.86, up from Dollars 1.22. The advance was led by health maintenance organisation (HMO) operations, which lifted operating income to Dollars 50m from Dollars 32m. The number of members in HMOs owned by Cigna was a fifth higher at 3.1m. Operating income from other indemnity insurance rose 11 per cent to Dollars 80m. Property/casualty operations showed an operating loss of Dollars 32m from asbestos and environmental claims. But this was more than offset by falling losses in other property/casualty operations, which dropped two-thirds to Dollars 35m. First-half net income rose to Dollars 249m, or Dollars 3.44 a share, from Dollars 134m, or Dollars 1.86.</p>

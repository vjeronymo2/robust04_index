Ten major unsettled criminal cases of the whole year have  given an answer to this question.    These 10 major cases include damage done to, or attempts to  damage, airports and bridges, and the discovery of inflammable  matter in the Mao Zedong Memorial Hall and on the Tiananmen  Rostrum. All these cases have shocked Zhongnanhai.    No matter whether or not they are of a political or  nonpolitical nature, or whether or not they reflect the  complaints of the people or give vent to personal spite, they  all show that the society is not without trouble at all. Of  course, millions upon millions of people who suffered under the  rule of Mao Zedong will not erase their bitter hatred for Mao  from their minds.    The Ministry of Public Security issued a special document  "10  Major Unsettled Criminal Cases and 10 Major Unsettled Economic  Cases in 1993" to the public security departments (bureaus) of  all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China  on 5 January and urged all public security departments (bureaus)  to strengthen cooperation, crack unsettled serious cases as soon  as possible, and commend and award personnel who render  meritorious service in cracking cases. It is learned that  rewards offered for cracking unsettled cases range from 50,000  to 250,000 yuan and personnel who have rendered meritorious  service in cracking cases will be promoted one or two grades.  <H5>  Ten Major Unsettled Criminal Cases </H5>   The 10 unsettled major criminal cases in 1993 are as  follows:    1.

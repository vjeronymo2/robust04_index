			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Campbell to call October election CANADA'S prime minister, Ms Kim Campbell, is set to call a general election in the next day or two for October 25. The poll, just a month short of the expiry of the ruling Progressive Conservatives' five-year mandate, promises to be one of the most closely fought and unpredictable in recent Canadian history. Pre-election jitters have already unsettled financial markets. The Canadian dollar fell sharply last week, forcing a jump in short-term interest rates. The usual three-way battle among the Conservatives, the opposition Liberals and the left-of-centre New Democratic party is complicated this time by the presence of two popular regional groups. The separatist Bloc Quebecois has won support among French-speaking Quebecers, who played a crucial role in sweeping the Conservatives to victory in the past two elections. In the west, the Reform party has made inroads with a populist platform of less government, tighter immigration controls and a retreat from official bilingualism. The outcome is further clouded by the virtual collapse of the NDP, hobbled by unpopular New Democrat governments in Ontario and British Columbia. Recent opinion polls show the Liberals slightly ahead of the Conservatives. Besides portraying Ms Campbell as a clone of her unpopular predecessor Mr Brian Mulroney, the Liberals stand to benefit most from the NDP's weakness. The Tories are putting their faith in polls which show Ms Campbell far ahead of Liberal leader Mr Jean Chretien in personal popularity. The main parties have so far focused on economic issues, especially deficit reduction and job creation.</p>

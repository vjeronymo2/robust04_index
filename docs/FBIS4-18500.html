			<p>BFN     [Text] Last night Silvio Berlusconi delivered an ultimatum  to the Northern League following 48 hours of skirmishes with  Umberto Bossi. The leader of Forza Italia said that  negotiations were being broken off and that Oscar Luigi Scalfaro  would have the task of appointing the government. Berlusconi  said that if his party were chosen, it already had in place a  team of ministers and a program for government that it would  submit to a parliamentary vote. If rejected by parliament,  Berlusconi said that the country would return to the polling  booths in order to finish the clean-up operation. This view was  shared by Gianfranco Fini [leader of the National Alliance] and  by Pierferdinando Casini [leader of the Christian Democrat  Center party].    Meanwhile, the left is making positive overtures towards the  Northern League. However, Roberto Maroni quickly extinguished  any hopes. He said that it was one thing to contact all the  parties concerning the issue of federalism, but it was another  as far as governing the country was concerned. Maroni said that  there could be no room for doubt; the task of government had to  go to the Freedom Alliance -- the choice of the voters.</p>

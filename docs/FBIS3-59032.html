Kohl assured the Polish delegation of his committment to  improving Polish-German relations. He recalled Chancellor  Konrad Adenauer's declaration of 1949 in which Adenauer  considered German reconcilation with former enemies -- namely,  the French, Jews, and Poles -- as one of his goals.    After the meeting, Oleksy told a news conference that the  talks focused on the significance of the present stage of  Polish-German relations for Europe and for overcoming the fears  of the past. He also said he expected German support in  negotiating the Partnership for Peace, for which Poland wanted a  good agreement.    While addressing the Bundestag, Kohl stressed that the  Partnership for Peace was one of the most significant results of  the NATO summit in Brussels. He added that it opened up  prospects for membership and there was no reason for  disappointment. The German chancellor also stressed the values  of the Partnership for Peace, although he said he understood the  anxieties and needs of nations in East Europe, especially  Poland. He added, however, that it was particularly Germany  which should take into consideration Russia's fears of isolation.    Earlier in the day, the Polish delegation met with Bundestag  President Rita Suessmuth. The two sides stressed the  significance of parliamentary contacts. Suessmuth said they  were marked by considerable progress, and added that the  German-Polish parliamentary group had 108 members.    Oleksy said Polish-German relations were very good, but he  stressed they still could improve. He also assured his German  interlocutors that democracy in Poland was safe and did not  depend on the results of each election.    The Polish delegation met also with Hans Stercken, head of  the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee.    Stercken and Oleksy emphasized the importance of  parliamentary contacts in Polish-German relations.    Oleksy declared that Poland's Euroatlantic security was  unchanging. "We see Poland's strategic security in European  structures," he said, adding that Russia must not be isolated.    The Sejm speaker also said during the news conference that  Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak was expected to visit  Germany soon. According to unofficial sources, the visit could  even take place in the first half of February.    "The opposition won the elections in Poland, but there was  not an earthquake and nothing like this will happen. We are a  country of high political stability, a country where extreme  attitudes are put in their proper place and are marginal," Jozef  Oleksy said while delivering a speech at the German-Polish  Society on Thursday evening.    Present at the meeting were German industrialists with head  of the commission for East German economy Otto Wolff von  Amerongen.    Oleksy also pointed out that Polish political elites no  longer feel hostility toward Poland's western neighbor, and  stressed that he hoped prejudice against Poles no longer existed  in Bonn.    Oleksy appealed to German industrialists to invest in  Poland.  He pointed to the fact that the Federal Republic, Poland's  largest trade partner, placed sixth as far as the invested  capital was concerned.</p>

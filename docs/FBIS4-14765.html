			<p>BFN     [Text] Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy stated in Moscow during the opening of the World  Congress of Slavic Orthodox and Christian Peoples that a union  of Eastern European Slavic states might make the 21st century an  age of Slavic civilization.    He said that Western Europe had always feared the  unification  of Eastern European Slavic states and made efforts to prevent  them from creating a union. "The time has come to stop taking  instructions from Paris and London," he said.    He believes that the Balkan war was the catalyst of the idea  of a Slavic union and that Russia must form up a  military-political alliance in Eastern Europe.    "If the Russian troops come to the Balkans, they will never  tolerate humiliation of the Slavic peoples. We shall send as  many divisions to the Balkans as our Slavic brothers will ask,"  he said.    He emphasized at the same time, that Slavs would never  become  aggressors.    Leader of the Russian National Congress Aleksandr Sterligov  said that the economic crisis in Russia was evolving into a  catastrophe. This can be judged, he continued, from the  unprecedented industrial recession and from the incompetence and  inefficiency of the authorities.    Sterligov demanded that the events in Moscow last October be  investigated and that their actual organizers not be allowed to  evade punishment.    He said that the democrats were preparing for a civil war  and  were forming up armed units.    He urged the opposition to do everything they can to prevent  Russian-American military exercises in the Urals.    In his opinion, the U.S. wanted to obtain information about  the Russian army's combat capability so as to become better  prepared from the occupation of Russia.    He said that public committees should be set up to organize  actions of protest against Russian-American military exercises.    The World Congress of Slavic Orthodox and Christian Peoples  is being held on the initiative of the Liberal-Democratic Party  which claims that the event is being attended by delegations  from Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Bulgaria,  Ukraine and Belarus.</p>

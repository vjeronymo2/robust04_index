			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Buy-out activity declines MANAGEMENT buy-out activity fell to a two-year low in the first quarter of 1993, with just seven large deals worth a total of Pounds 390m being completed, accountants KPMG Peat Marwick said. One reason for the decline was the cautious approach that managers and vendors took to deals, said Mr Chris Beresford, head of management buy-outs at the accountants, said. 'They are taking a belt and braces approach to negotiations and to legal documentation. The larger deals are taking nine months or even longer.' The most recent quarter represents the lowest level of buy-out activity since the first quarter of 1991, when seven deals worth Pounds 120m were completed. However, it compares poorly with the first quarter of last year, when 16 deals worth Pounds 640m were completed. The largest deal completed in the first 1993 quarter was that of McDonnell Douglas Information Systems, valued at about Pounds 200m. Other deals included Colas, a road services and building materials company, from Shell for Pounds 72m; Ashbourne Homes for Pounds 53m; and British International Helicopters for Pounds 33m. In roughly equal measure the buy-outs involved purchases from receivers, corporate restructurings and disposals of non-core activities. In total, Peat Marwick calculates that 130 deals worth Pounds 570m were completed in the first quarter of 1993 compared with a total of 520 worth Pounds 3bn in the whole of 1992.</p>

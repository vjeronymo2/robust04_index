			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cesar Ubeda Bravo] </F>   [Text] Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro  reiterated once again upon her return from Mexico that "EPS  [Sandinist People's Army] General Humberto Ortega will step down  in 1994," thus contradicting the assertions made concurrently by  Ortega to local reporters at the National Assembly.    President Chamorro's remarks prove that military power is  subject to civilian power and that, as she promised on 2  September and during her stay in Mexico, the Army chief will  retire during the course of the year.    President Chamorro announced on 2 September 1993 at the Olof  Palme [Convention Center] that Humberto Ortega would retire this  year, which prompted a disrespectful reaction from the Ortega  brothers toward the president in the presence of Latin American  diplomats.    The presidential announcement, which created friction  between  the top military commanders and the government, forced the  Executive Branch to convene an extraordinary emergency meeting  at the OAS, where the government gained continent-wide support.    "Neither Humberto Ortega nor anyone in the Army will retire  due to U.S. pressures or due to anyone's whim. Within the  context of the 2 September announcement I will never retire,"  the EPS general emphatically stated after meeting yesterday with  National Assembly President Dr. Luis Humberto Guzman to discuss  topics related to the Military Organization Law. "I must clearly  establish my position regarding the issue of my dismissal under  pressure. To insist that Humberto Ortega will step down this  year is to take a superficial view of the Military Organization  Law," stressed Ortega after adding that he will not leave his  post under those conditions "out of dignity and principle."    Ortega admitted that relations between the Executive Branch  and EPS "have not been good" since the presidential announcement  of 2 September. "This does not mean that I am enthroning myself  as commander of the Armed Forces, but my departure will be  within the framework of the Constitution and the Military  Organization Law," the EPS chief added.    Article 144 of the Constitution establishes that the  president of the Republic is the chief of state and government  and commander in chief of the nation's Defense and Security  Forces.    Questioned about the authority of President Chamorro, who is  empowered to replace the EPS chief, Ortega replied evasively:  "It is not a matter of the president removing the EPS chief nor  of the Army removing the president as has historically occurred  in Latin America, but we must work harmoniously for the good of  the nation and avoid falling to extremes," he stated.    The high-ranking military officer indicated there is no  consensus between the EPS and the Executive Branch on the  aforementioned law. Nevertheless, he refused to specify the  points of conflict. "The Army wants an agreement on this," he  underscored. He said it is very probable that an agreement will  be reached within 15 days so the law can be sent to the  Legislative Branch. Ortega defiantly said that if no agreement  is reached in these two weeks, "the EPS will see what course it  will take," but he refrained from indicating what measures the  military command would take.    He indicated that the Military Organization Law must have  the  consensus of the National Assembly, the EPS, and the Executive  Branch. "We must draw up a strong and firm law among all the  involved sectors," he said.    Meanwhile, National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman  threatened to draw up this law if it does not reach the assembly  soon. "If the Military Organization Law is not sent to the  National Assembly in the first half of this year, we will  proceed to draft it," he said.    Guzman said the Nicaraguan people were promised that this  law  would be drawn up in the first half of the year, and this  promise will be kept. "We (the parliament) are not setting a  deadline for the presentation of the Military Organization Law  but one cannot wait forever," he stressed.    Regarding the removal of Humberto Ortega from the EPS, he  was  categoric in stating: "If the president announced that this year  she would appoint a new EPS chief, that is what must happen. It  does not merit discussion." "After talking with Ortega, the  impression I have of him, is that he is aware that his position  is temporary," Guzman said. This contrasts with Ortega's remarks  to journalists. Guzman also denied that there is U.S. pressure  for the removal of the Army chief.</p>

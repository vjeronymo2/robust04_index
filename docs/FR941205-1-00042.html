While such agreements are not as common as they once were, they are severely anticompetitive by nature and must be closely regulated when they do appear.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Classification of Agreements: the Importance of Market Share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule requires any agreement that authorizes one or more of the six ``Class A/B'' activities to be accompanied, upon its initial filing, with an information form showing its parties' market shares both for the entire agreement and also in each of the sub-trades within the overall scope of the agreement, during the most recent calendar quarter for which complete data are available. ``Sub-trade'' is defined as all liner movements between each U.S. port range (Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific) and each foreign country within the overall scope of the agreement. For example, an agreement with an overall scope of U.S. Pacific Coast to the Far East would have sub-trades of U.S. Pacific Coast to Japan, U.S. Pacific Coast to Taiwan, and so forth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An agreement that authorizes at least one of the six ``Class A/B'' activities and holds market shares of 50 percent or more in half or more of its sub-trades is classified as a ``Class A'' agreement under the proposed rule. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  The parties to such an agreement are required to submit extensive historical data on the initial information form and, if the agreement goes into effect, to submit detailed quarterly reports on their operations under the agreement. These requirements are discussed in detail below. An agreement that authorizes at least one of the six activities, but did not hold market shares of 50 percent or more in at least half of its sub-trades, is classified as a ``Class B'' agreement. It would file the same information form as a ``Class A'' agreement but, if it went into effect, would have significantly lighter reporting obligations, as also discussed below. It should be noted that the classification of an agreement as ``Class A'' would not be permanent; the agreement's ongoing reporting obligations would include market share data, and at the beginning of each calendar year, the agreement's sub-trade market shares during the most recent calendar quarter for which complete data are available would determine whether it would remain under ``Class A'' reporting obligations for the upcoming year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, if an agreement with ten sub-trades reported that it had market shares of 50 percent or more in five or more sub-trades, it would be a ``Class A'' agreement. By using that methodology rather than average market share, the proposed rule seeks to focus on those agreements with significant market power spread through at least half of their total geographic scope. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Market share measures an agreement's potential for abuse of economic power and unreasonable or discriminatory price and service practices. The break point of 50 percent in at least half of the sub-trades was chosen in the belief that an agreement that is a relatively minor presence in a majority of its sub-trades_that is, a ``Class B'' agreement_is unlikely to be able to impose unreasonable or unfair rates or practices regardless of what it authorizes its parties to do, and does not require extensive gathering of information about its operation. While commenters on the proposed rule are free to argue for a different break point, it should be noted that an important feature of the proposed rule is that the market share calculation for rate discussion agreements and ``non-binding'' rate agreements adds the market shares held by the non-conference lines to those held by the conference lines for purposes of determining whether such an agreement should be classified as ``Class A'' or ``Class B''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new focus on sub-trades results from the Commission's belief, resulting from the agency's experience over the ten years since passage of the 1984 Act, that economic analysis of an agreement is facilitated and acquires depth of understanding if it is done according to the agreement's smaller components. This is particularly true since, as noted above, the Commission is now seeing more and more agreements that have multi-coast or even multi-continent geographic ranges. Further, in some of the more geographically fragmented parts of the world, such as the Far East and the South Pacific, sub-trades can constitute separate and cloistered markets. Agreements that serve a comparatively unified landmass, such as Europe, might still implement practices that differ from area to area within the general market. These factors all argue for information-gathering systems that acquire data relevant to an agreement's sub-trades, rather than only the market defined by the agreement's total scope. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, the information (besides market share) sought by the proposed rule for ``Class A'' and ``Class B'' agreements is, for the most part, concerned with the agreements' sub-trades.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This approach also allows for the possibility that Commission or court sanctions against an agreement could prevent an agreement only from operating in a particular sub-trade, rather than from operating at all. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Observer: Muddy campaign Sir Rex Hunt, governor of the Falkland Islands during the Argentine invasion ten years ago, takes a predictably robust view of the current British election campaign. In his latest column in the islands' main media outlet, the charmingly quaint Penguin News, he says: 'It is difficult to write a letter from the UK at this time without referring to the forthcoming general election . . . Most of us are heartily sick of the mud-slinging and have already made up our minds for whom to vote; but that will not stop the politicians from wasting millions of pounds on their election campaigns.' Looks like the Green Party might show a distinct swing in Sir Rex's Sunningdale constituency.</p>

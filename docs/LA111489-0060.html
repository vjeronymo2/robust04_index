			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL REFUSES TO RESIGN AS TOP S&amp;L REGULATOR  </P> <P> Embattled savings and loan regulator M. Danny Wall refused to resign Monday and  said President Bush "wants to hear the other side of the story."  </P> <P> Bush said in an interview published Saturday that he is considering whether to  dismiss Wall, who is under fire for his handling of the investigation of  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine.  </P> <P> But Wall, after testifying at a congressional hearing Monday, told reporters  that the President "knows that one is innocent until proven guilty." He said he  had acted properly in handling the case of Lincoln, which suffered a financial  collapse that may ultimately cost the taxpayers $2 billion, making it the  biggest single thrift failure.  </P> <P> "We knew far less than people think we did," said Wall, who rejected a  recommendation by federal regulators in San Francisco in 1987 that the Federal  Home Loan Bank Board seize Lincoln then. Instead, the bank board seized Lincoln  in April of this year, after its losses had mounted substantially.  </P> <P> "We had insufficient basis to take the actions (the San Francisco regulators  were) asking for," Wall said. He was chairman of the bank board then and is now  chairman of its successor agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision.  </P> <P> The Lincoln issue has become politically explosive because of efforts by five  senators, including Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), to intervene with federal  officials on Lincoln's behalf.  </P> <P> Wall said Monday that Cranston's calls to him in 1987 and 1989 were "perfectly  appropriate." In 1987, Wall said, Cranston urged a prompt decision on a pending  regulatory review of Lincoln, and in 1989 Cranston asked for a rapid decision  on whether the government would permit the sale of Lincoln to outside  investors.  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said Monday that the Senate  Ethics Committee is conducting a serious inquiry into the actions of the five  senators: Cranston, Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), John Glenn (D-Ohio), Dennis  DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.).  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 22 -- Ombudsman Tadeusz Zielinski was  applauded by deputies in the Sejm on Friday when he told them  that a country in which some amass unbelievable fortunes while  others live on the edge of poverty "is not only an unjust  country but is also undemocratic. Such a country has nothing in  common with modern capitalism." He was making his ombudsmans  report to parliament on the year 1993.    Zielinski saw the main deficiency in the process of  improving  the legal rights of Polish citizens as being the delay in  passing a new constitution. He emphatically disagreed with  those who thought that Poland could not afford to guarantee  social and economic security, explaining that in constitutional  legislation basic human rights could not be ignored because of a  temporary crisis.    Referring to the letters that were sent to his office  Zielinski said Poland was not a just country and would certainly  not be one for a long time. As proof of his claim Zielinski  listed rising unemployment, worsening health care, the failure  to guarantee minimum housing requirements and above all the lack  of a guaranteed social minimum income.    In Zielinski's view ideological conflicts were still going  on  in Poland. As an example he said that lawyers who wanted to  freely state their opinions on the legal consequences of the  concordat with the Vatican were unfairly accused of having an  unfriendly attitude to the church. This was anologous to  lawyers in communist times being expected to adopt an apologetic  stance towards legislation passed in those days.    Zielinski said that nothing sowed so much mistrust in the  public where the state was concerned as legislative impotence.  Laws were passed which could not be executed because of  insufficient finances.    Zielinski stressed that in the second year of his term in  office he had not noted any important infringements of political  rights such as freedom of assembly or the freedom to join trade  unions. The removal of censorship meant that the right of free  expression was being observed. However many newspapers were  reluctant to correct false information.    A member of the parliamentary justice committee, Wojciech  Lamentowicz, said that Zielinski's speech had been "a job very  well done". This was proof of the ombudsman's office being  staffed by courageous and thoughtful people, he added.</p>

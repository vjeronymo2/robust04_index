			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Up to $3.4 billion is needed to clean up 10 of the Great Lakes' dirtiest areas,  according to a study billed as a step toward putting a price tag on making the  lakes safe for wildlife and people. Governments should explore creative means  of financing the cleanup such as establishing a trust fund and suing polluters,  said the study by the Northeast-Midwest Institute, which does research for  congressmen from 18 Northeastern and Midwestern states. The report emphasizes  solving the problem, whereas earlier studies dealt primarily with what caused  the pollution and which areas were worse off, said Michael J. Donahue,  executive director of the Great Lakes Commission in Ann Arbor, Mich.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, RIA, May 30 -- The State Duma and the  Russian Federation Council are due to consider the issue of  potential financing Sevastopol as the main base of the Black Sea  Fleet during its forthcoming sessions, a RIA correspondent was  told by Viktor Semenov, chairman of the city council of  Sevastopol.    In his words, "the Federal Assembly of Russia must take into  account financing of Sevastopol when endorsing the budget, since  one-fourth of the 400 thousand population of the city works in  the areas related to the Black sea Fleet."    Mr. Semenov also indicated that the situation in Sevastopol  "is quite normal. The citizens are prepared to receive  holiday-makers from all over the former Soviet Union and the  bathing season is in full swing."</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Public-sector pay figures disputed PUBLIC-SECTOR employees continue to earn less than their counterparts in the private sector, even though average public-sector pay was recently reported to have overtaken that in the private sector, according to a new report. The study, by Incomes Data Services, the independent pay analysts, says ministers are using the average pay figures from the government's New Earnings Survey to justify a public-sector pay freeze for next year. IDS, however, says the figures - published last month - are seriously misleading. The survey showed average pay figures of Pounds 307 a week in the public sector and Pounds 303 in the private sector. It also said the average public-sector manual worker earned Pounds 244, lower than the average Pounds 252 in the private sector, while the average non-manual public-sector employee earned Pounds 328, against Pounds 338 in the private sector. IDS says the reason for the higher average in the public sector is that recent privatisations have led to a much higher proportion of non-manual employees in the public sector, who generally earn more than manual employees. Some three quarters of public-sector employees are non-manuals, compared with just under 60 per cent in the private sector. More than six out of 10 men working in the public sector carry out non-manual work, compared with just over half of men in the private sector. Nine out of 10 women in the public sector are non-manual employees, while three quarters in the private sector are non-manuals. IDS also says that the survey's figure of an 8.8 per cent rise in public-sector pay in the year to April this year, compared with 6.3 per cent in the private sector, is distorted by the inclusion of pay reviews in two consecutive years for some public-sector workers. The IDS takes issue with the assumption that pay in the public sector is not responding to the recession in the same way as in the private sector. It says: 'So far in 1992, most settlements in the public sector have been in line with the private sector. Less than 10 per cent of private-sector pay reviews have been freezes and many sectors have been freeze-free.' IDS Report No 627. IDS, 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS.</p>

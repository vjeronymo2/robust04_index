The proclamation of the cooperative Republic of Guyana was a  fruition of the struggle of her people to consolidate national  independence, MINJU CHOSON says, and goes on:    After the proclamation of the republic the Guyanese people  have covered the road of building a new society.    They are now striving hard for the prosperity of the  country,  pushing aside all manners of intervention and pressure of  outside forces.    Pursuing non-aligned policy externally, Guyana is developing  friendly relations with foreign countries and making efforts to  establish a new international economic order.    Though Korea and Guyana are geographically far away from  each  other, the peoples of the two countries are developing the bonds  of friendship.    The Korean people believe that the friendly and cooperative  relations between Korea and Guyana will further expand and  develop in the common interests of the two peoples.    The Korean people extend congratulatory greetings to the  Guyanese people on the day of the proclamation of the republic  and wish them great success in their future work to build a new  prosperous society.</p>

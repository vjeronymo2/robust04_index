			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Arts: Madama Butterfly - Opera The tragedy of sexual exploi-tation by Western travellers to the East seems to be played out afresh for each generation. When television regularly beams to our homes pictures of teenagers in prostitution, these days in Thailand or the Philippines, it is hardly necessary to update the story of Madama Butterfly as though in search of some hidden relevance. Undeterred, the present Royal Opera production updates it anyway. (The original producer, Nuria Espert, introduced costumes that suggest the period around the Second World War.) Dressed in flimsy, flower-patterned trousers, Yoko Watanabe's Madame Butterfly could easily have stepped out of a television documentary, for she looks the very picture of the modern Eastern Miss - and that despite 10 years service in this taxing role. The marvel of Watanabe's performance is that it still looks so spontaneous. Every expression tells; every movement affords another intimate insight into her nave teenage bride of a Butterfly. The moment when she trustingly kisses Pinkerton's letter brings a lump to the throat. When she hears the guns announce his ship in the harbour, years of pent-up hopes and disappointments flash across her face. The whole of the final scene is most movingly played and by that point it seems ungenerous to complain that the voice is no longer as freely produced and beautiful as one would like. In vocal terms Puccini gave sopranos a killer of a part to get through in this opera. Miss Watanabe's strength is that she has learned, over the many times that she must have sung it, how to save her stamina to make the maximum effect when it counts. That is fortunate, as the present revival rests entirely on her delicate shoulders. Arthur Davies, as Pinkerton, sounds less Italianate in Puccini here than he did when he was singing down the road at the Coliseum. Malcolm Donnelly's broad range of virtues makes his Royal Opera debut deserved, but his Sharpless lacks individuality. There are a few bright spots among the supporting cast, including John Dobson's bookish Goro and Yvonne Howard as a Kate Pinkerton with presence - but not many. They all have to struggle against orchestral playing too loud for the size of the voices. Too fast, as well: Sian Edwards cuts 10 minutes off the announced running time. If the idea was to stress the modern elements of Puccini's style by bringing out the music's angular rhythms and percussive drive, then it meets with only limited success. Those glowing Puccini climaxes which should send a shiver down the spine fail to arrive. Altogether, there is little warmth here. The combination of harsh orchestral sounds and the production's grimy setting, which has Butterfly living in a crowded 20th-century tenement block far from the traditional flower-covered hills overlooking Nagasaki, has put the opera down in a hostile milieu. To that extent the performance is, at least, all of a piece. Madama Butterfly Covent Garden</p>

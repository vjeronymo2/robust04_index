			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Arts: The Sound of Music - Theatre Thirty-two years after its Broadway opening, followed by a long-running London production at the Palace Theatre, a Julie Andrews movie, now inexpensively available on video, innumerable David Jacobs-hosted Radio 2 re-playings of the hit numbers, 'Do-Re-Mi' etc. that are continually being re-issued on cassette and CD - what on earth is there left to revive? Hasn't this particular onion been peeled so often that our tear-ducts have completely atrophied to it? Ronald Lee and Shochiku Ltd., the producers of the show, think not, and audiences in the regions have for some weeks been endorsing that view. Now it occupies the venerable boards at Sadler's Wells until September 5 to suffer there an exposure to the more blase theatregoers of the capital and its wicked coven of dramatic critics. The evidence of the rapturously appreciative first night suggests that Londoners are likely to raise the white handkerchief as readily as their provincial and country cousins and like them surrender to the piece with loud, lachrymose howls of approval. The truth is that even a merely competent production - and this one is a good deal more than that - is well-nigh irresistible. With Richard Rodgers to ladle out the music like great dollops of molasses on a cake confected from the memoirs of Maria von Trapp - to whom all this really happened - and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein, from a book by Lindsay and Crouse, the mixture cannot fail to slide down a treat. It is cynically made out of a series of cleverly manipulated stock responses from the spectacle on stage of such surefire winners as nuns, children, Nazis and Alps. Liz Robertson plays the pretty postulant who drops out of the convent. She is sent by the kindly abbess to become governess to the seven children of a recently widowed naval captain whose schloss, her spacious new place of work, is overshadowed by the mountains on the Austrian-Swiss border. With a bobbed hair-cut and simply cut dresses, and looking indeed like a latter-day Julie Andrews, Robertson strikes the right note of simplicity and determination, as she gives her renderings of such numbers as 'I have confidence in me . . .' She is partnered by the rather wooden, heel-clicking Christopher Cazenove, as her all too rapidly besotted employer. The pair certainly look good as they go through the formal Laendler dance. This first sign of things to come is observed by Jan Waters who gives her own stylish elegance to the other woman in the captain's life. The basic story is that of The Turn of the Screw in reverse. The governess marries her boss in the end having aroused the latent goodness in the children rather than corrupting them. Less interesting in human terms, it is much safer box-office. The forces of good are represented by the nuns, led here by Linda Hibberd who raises high the nunnery's roof-beams with a spirited version of 'Climb Ev'ry Mountain'. Evil arrives only with the Austrian Nazis who emerge after the anschluss in the last act. In an affable performance as the Austrian culture-organiser, Robin Nedwell revealed how easy it was in that situation to compromise with them. Musical direction is in the capable hands of Nick Davies; and Wendy Toye, the supremo of the entire production, makes sure that no one puts a foot wrong, especially the excellent child performers.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sterling devaluation behind 9% increase at Spirax-Sarco SPIRAX-SARCO Engineering, the steam equipment specialist which makes 75 per cent of its sales overseas, lifted first-half pre-tax profits by 9 per cent from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 11.4m on the back of sterling's devaluation. The group estimated that the change in exchange rates was worth Pounds 1.2m on pre-tax profits. Earnings per share were 10 per cent ahead at 8.6p (7.8p). The interim dividend goes up to 6.6p (2.7p), equal to the 1992 final dividend. In order to reduce advance corporation tax ahead of the November budget, it is offering an alternative enhanced scrip dividend worth 9.9p per share. It estimates the ACT saving at Pounds 1.3m if there is a 90 per cent take-up. UBS will buy back the shares at a minimum value of 9.702p, or 98 per cent of the value. Mr Chris Tappin, executive chairman, said the group saw no tangible sign of improved trading conditions in its main markets. However, the group's fundamental strengths had enabled it to advance. He defined these as a diverse customer base; a broad geographic spread; a 50 per cent replacement element, and its world market leadership. Spirax last year made 18 per cent of sales in the UK, 31 per cent in the Americas, 30 per cent in continental Europe and 21 per cent in Asia and the rest of the world. Turnover for the half was ahead 11 per cent at Pounds 90.8m (Pounds 81.4m). The latest figure included Pounds 5.3m from the acquisition earlier this year of its Italian licensee and a 25 per cent stake in its Spanish licensee. Last year's figure included Pounds 6.7m from the Drayton domestic heating controls business sold in March. Interest payable fell to Pounds 651,000 against Pounds 798,000. Net borrowings at the end of June were Pounds 24m (Pounds 17m at end of December), giving gearing of 30 per cent (20 per cent).</p>

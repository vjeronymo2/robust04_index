			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC envoys move quickly after US trade offer TWO TOP EC trade negotiators will today try to capitalise on the temporary ceasefire with the US and make fresh progress on the Gatt Uruguay Round talks. Mr Hugo Paemen, the EC's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Thinh Van Tran, EC ambassador to the Gatt talks in Geneva, will meet their US counterparts in Washington - three days after the Clinton administration agreed to suspend sanctions in an escalating dispute over public procurement contracts. A senior Brussels official said the administration had also offered encouraging signals by stating for the first time in public that it wants to make a 'substantial' market access package on goods and services a priority in the renewed negotiations on a Gatt agreement. 'The statement was exactly what we had been looking for,' said the official. The new products in goods and services, suggested by both the US and the EC, have been added to the this week's US-EC market access negotiations, in the hopes that agreement will help 'jumpstart' the Gatt negotiations in time to wrap up the round by the end of the year. Indications that the market access talks would be broadened came on Friday, when President Clinton told EC Commission President Jacques Delors that he would delay sanctions set to go into effect yesterday in the dispute over government procurement. In a joint US-EC statement, the EC promised 'to address constructively US concerns'. Mr Harry Freeman, a Washington trade lobbyist, said the stress on market access reverses the emphasis in the Gatt negotiations from 'the new issues'  -such as services and intellectual property rights - to tariff cutting in a move designed to broaden domestic political support for the Uruguay Round. The sanctions delay put Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, on the defensive. He had suggested to Congress that, unlike his predecessors, he would not back away from threats of retaliation. Questioned about the administration's change of heart on weekend television, he said: 'President Delors came to us and asked that we delay it. . . because he had some constructive suggestions in order to try to meet our concerns.' The encouraging signals came after Mr Jacques Delors, met President Bill Clinton for 50 minutes at the White House and warned him that US sanctions would provoke a very negative response in Europe. After the warning, the Commission president was invited to hold talks with Mr Kantor. In Brussels yesterday, officials were still assessing the motives behind the suspension of trade sanctions which were due to go into effect yesterday. A spokesman for Mr Delors said the moves did not necessarily signal a less aggressive US trade policy. 'We are dealing with signals rather than certainties.' The visit of Mr Paemen and Mr Van Tran aims to lay the groundwork for next week's talks in Brussels between Mr Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner responsible for external trade relations. These talks have become a critical test not only of EC/US intentions to narrow differences on Gatt but also whether they can resolve a series of nagging bilateral disputes including aviation subsidies, steel trade and government procurement. EC officials said yesterday that they hoped the US will consider favourably the proposal for a joint study of the US and EC disagreements over access to their res-pective government procurement markets.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Inga Abgarova and Tinatin Gviniashvili: "Lt. </F> Gen. V. Nadibaidze Was Confirmed as Georgia's Minister of  Defense"]    [Text]  <H5>  Arguments of the Opposition Did Not Affect Results The </H5> meeting of the Georgian Parliament, which was held yesterday,  was declared closed. And no wonder. The question concerning the  confirmation of the candidacy of the Republic's Minister of  Defense was submitted to the verdict of members of Parliament.    Head of the State Eduard Shevardnadze put forward the  candidacy of Lt-Gen V. Nadibaidze, who until yesterday served as  Deputy Commander for Armaments of the Group of Russian Troops in  the Transcaucasus. This factor caused dissatisfaction on the  part of the opposition and, at the same time, was the main  argument "for" in the camp of the parliamentary majority.    Irina Sarishvili, deputy of the National Democratic Party of  Georgia, declared:    "I am of the opinion that it was not obligatory to confirm  the candidacy of the Minister of Defense today. We have bitter  experience with such a hasty appointment for this post. The head  of the state could have appointed General Nadibaidze and  observed for some time whether he justified such high trust.  Unfortunately, professionalism, of course, is obligatory, but by  no means the only quality that a minister of defense must have.  Although, I do not deny, most of the opposition's arguments  sounded simply foolish.    "I could not vote for this candidacy, because I do not know  this man and I simply do not trust the personnel policy of the  head of the state. In general, today reminded me of the  ratification of Georgia's entry into the CIS. In any event, the  composition of deputies was the same as then, which does not  happen often."    Nevertheless, the position expressed by I. Sarishvili in no  way affected the voting results. Deputies voted for the  confirmation of the minister's candidacy by a majority vote. Out  of the 158 present in the hall seven abstained and three voted  "against." The parliamentary majority was 118 people.    Naturally, we were interested in the opinion of parliament  deputy Tengiz Kitovani, who, as is well known, held the post of  Minister of Defense at one time.    "Undoubtedly, V. Nadibaidze is a man with experience,"  Kitovani said. "And I will be very happy if he manages to do  something for Georgia. Although I suspect that it will be  difficult for him to work with our ambitious generals."  <H5>  The Majority Is Certain That the Choice Was Made Correctly </H5>   With regard to the parliamentary majority Vice-Speaker  Vakhtang Rcheulishvili expressed its arguments.    "The chief thing that acted in V. Nadibaidze's favor was his  professionalism," he said. "We were convinced that a normal  battleworthy army could not be established with good intentions  and patriotism alone. Professionalism is needed here. Taking  into consideration the path traversed by General Nadibaidze in  the Russian Army, this is one of the worthiest candidacies for  the post of the minister of defense.    "If we want to build an army, naturally, we need Russia's  help and, of course, real help. Keeping in mind our past and  geopolitical situation, the Russian Army is a loyal ally for us.  Undoubtedly, General Nadibaidze's personal contacts will help us  to establish contacts with the Russian Army. Confrontation with  Russia did not and will not bring us anything good. The policy  adopted by Georgia for rapprochement with Russia and with the  former Union republics and, above all, for a real functioning of  CIS mechanisms requires precisely such a person at this post.    "The opposition's guarded attitude in connection with the  fact that Nadibaidze was in active service in the army of a  foreign state has no basis. In the world there are dozens of  examples of a state, which does not have its own personnel base  in a certain sector, inviting its compatriot from abroad for  service. Estonia's Minister of Defense is an Estonian by birth,  who served in the American Armed Forces and at one time took  part in the Vietnam War."  <H5>  `I Will Try To Justify the Trust and To Perform My Duty to </H5> the Homeland...'    The minister of defense himself, immediately after the  confirmation of his candidacy, gave an exclusive interview to  SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What is your main task at this stage?    [Nadibaidze] The chief thing for me now is to build, or  rather, to continue building Georgia's Armed Forces on the basis  that we already have.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Does building the Georgian Army imply  the possibility of Abkhazia's return by military means?    [Nadibaidze] Abkhazia is an issue for politicians. I am a  soldier and my business is to establish the army.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Are you not afraid that the lot of  General Kamkamidze, who left Georgia at one time, will befall  you?    [Nadibaidze] I do not know which lot of Kamkamidze you are  talking about. Today he is one of the best military figures. I  have information that he left Georgia voluntarily. Personally, I  will try to justify the people's trust and to fully perform my  duty to the homeland.</p>

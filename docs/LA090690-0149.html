			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KOH ADDED TO BASEBALL STAFF AT PIERCE  </P> <P> Joe Koh has resigned as baseball coach at L. A. Baptist after one season and  will join the Pierce College staff as an assistant.  </P> <P> His replacement at L. A. Baptist is Mark Bates, the school's football coach and  last season's junior varsity baseball coach.  </P> <P> Koh, an L. A. Baptist graduate, led the Knights to a 2-15 record and a  last-place, 1-9 finish in the Alpha League. He will be reunited with Pierce  co-Coach Bob Lofrano. Koh assisted Lofrano when the two coached at Chatsworth  High.  </P> <P> "We knew when Joe took the job that he wanted to move to the college level," L.  A. Baptist Athletic Director Maury Neville said Wednesday. "We thought we'd  have him longer and we wish we could still have him, but this is a step up for  him."  </P> <P> Bates, 24, is in his third year at L. A. Baptist and his second as the football  coach.  </P> <P> He also served for two years as the junior varsity baseball coach and teaches  math at the private school in Sepulveda, which has an enrollment of 460.  </P></p>

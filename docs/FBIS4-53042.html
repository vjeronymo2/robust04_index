			<p>CSO     [Text] Nippon Electric Glass is expanding production  capability for non-alkali thin sheet glass for TFT (thin film  transistor) type liquid crystal display devices (LCD). It will  convert the glass furnace at Takatsuki Works (Takatsuki-cho,  Shiga Prefecture) which is producing glass for picture tubes to  liquid crystal use during 1995. Increased production of over  500,000 sheets per month is possible by this and combined with  existing lines, production of over 1 million sheets per month  will be possible.    Since the demand for liquid crystal panels for personal  computers and word processors is increasing, they are hastening  provision of a supply system.    Currently, Nippon Electric Glass is producing from 150,000  to  200,000 sheets of LCD thin sheet glass per month.    Since the production capability of the glass furnace will be  about 500,000 sheets converted to thin sheet glass, up to now  they had aimed at boosting the supply quantity in the form of  augmenting precision processing equipment. Since the increase in  demand is continuing, however, they have decided this time to  convert to LCD use the melting furnace for picture tube glass at  the Takatsuki Works, which has become a surplus facility along  with the Malaysia move plan.    It is estimated that a surplus supply of 500,000 to 700,000  sheets per month will be generated by this.    There also is a policy at the company to continue aggressive  facilities investment of several billion yen a year in the LCD  thin sheet glass business in the future, and the idea is to  devise an aggressive production increase system matching market  expansion.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising) Of soap and Scotch - Guy de Jonquieres and Diane Summers ask if marketing skills are transferable When Crispin Davis last week resigned from United Distillers, Guinness' spirits division, after only 15 months as managing director, his departure was widely cited as proof of what most consumers already knew: that Scotch whisky and soap suds do not go together. Guinness says Davis left because of a personality clash. Competitors say the hard-nosed marketing methods Davis learned in his previous career at Procter &amp; Gamble, the world's biggest detergents manufacturer, did not fit a business which lives by premium pricing and exclusive brand image. Whatever finally triggered his resignation, it raises a broader question. How easily can marketing skills be transferred between different businesses at a time when they are more widely in demand than ever before? As competition intensifies, companies in sectors as diverse as banking, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and public transport are finding - sometimes for the first time - that learning to woo and win consumers is essential for survival. Peter Breen, managing partner of Heidrick &amp; Struggles, an international executive search company, says marketing experience is now a pre-requisite for most top-level management posts. 'Whatever the job title, marketing is a common denominator,' he says. Those who have taken their marketing expertise into new fields stress that it is not a universal discipline which can be effortlessly transplanted. Above all, it only delivers results when combined with a clear understanding of what makes individual companies tick. 'There are certain fundamentals which can be transferred,' says John Robb, chief executive of the pharmaceuticals group Wellcome, who cut his teeth in consumer products marketing. 'But even if you are moving within the same industry, you still have to learn about the company you're moving to. You have to adjust to the new style.' For outsiders that can be a stiff challenge. Mike Sommers, recently named managing director of MGM Cinemas after three years as marketing director of the TSB banking group, vividly recalls the shock of moving to retailing from the consumer goods industry a decade ago. 'For the first month I would sit in meetings and not understand a word anyone said. I felt like a kid who wants to play on a roundabout, and nobody will slow down to let him on,' he says. He and others argue that the transition can be particularly tough for executives schooled in big consumer products manufacturers such as P&amp;G and Mars. That may appear paradoxical, because such companies have been widely regarded as marketing 'universities'. However, sceptics say that their success has depended heavily on rigorous adherence to doing the same things steadily better - an approach that can breed inflexibility and make it hard for alumni to adapt to new corporate cultures. 'There is a big dilemma when you take somebody who has worked in a company with strong life-support systems and very clear rules for everything,' says Sir James Blyth, chief executive of Boots, whose previous employers include Mars, General Foods and Plessey. When marketing executives from big consumer manufacturers switch successfully to other companies, he says it is often because they got out early or were naturally talented, rather than because of any particular skills they brought with them. Colin Fisher, managing director of SRU, a management consultancy with clients including Unilever and Marks and Spencer, goes further. He says many big consumer groups prosper mainly because they attract the brightest graduates, not because their marketing methods are intrinsically superior. 'A lot of consumer products people emphasise the means rather than the ends,' says Sommers. 'They forget it's all about consumers and become obsessed with advertising and packaging. Moving to businesses which are based on distribution or sell mainly to men can be a big wrench for them.' But successful marketing is more than a set of techniques. It is a state of mind which informs corporate priorities. Specialists say that the toughest task of all is to instil it in businesses which have previously paid little attention to customer service and consumer satisfaction. Eurotunnel, for instance, has only just switched its attention from boring holes in the ground to seeking passengers. It has recently recruited executives from consumer companies including Lever Brothers and Heinz. One of their first achievements has been to talk the board out of plans to run an advertising campaign celebrating Eurotunnel's engineering achievements, and to emphasise instead the services it offers. Mercury Communications, part of Cable and Wireless, has also hired marketing talent from the consumer products industry. Roy Doughty, director of marketing, sales and customer service for One-2-One, Mercury's new mobile telephone service, previously worked for Duracell, the battery maker. 'I believe we're launching a brand in the way a consumer products company would do,' he says, although he admits that the technical complexity of telecommunications systems means that much longer lead times are required. Although Mercury Communications has been widely applauded for imaginative advertising, some specialists say that marketing has yet to lay down deep roots in its engineering-dominated culture. 'Mercury only looks good because it is competing with BT, which doesn't even have a marketing director on its board,' says one. Kevin Gavaghan, former retailing executive responsible for launching electronic banking services such as First Direct, Orchard and Vector at Midland Bank, says that the first priority for people recruited to a company to improve marketing is to ensure that they have support from the top. 'You have to be invited in by a sponsor who knows exactly what he is buying,' he says. Gavaghan says he received such backing when he joined Midland, but left because the bank's commitment to marketing dwindled after a change of senior management. But for Sir James Blyth, the golden rule for peripatetic marketing executives is to be absolutely sure what they are letting themselves in for: 'If you have moved companies a couple of times, you learn to pick out those areas where your experience is valuable. But you'd better listen very carefully to people in your new company about exactly why it is different.'</p>

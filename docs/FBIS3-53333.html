[passage omitted]    In an interview with AL-HAYAH, the Afghan president has  welcomed the mediation of the brothers in the Islamic states.  However, he warned that his two rivals, Prime Minister  Golboddin Hekmatyar and Uzbek militia leader Abdul Rashid  Dostam, "have always broken the pledges and failed to abide by  the agreements."    This comes while the Iranian mediation between Rabbani and  Hekmatyar has failed to achieve its aims. The Afghan prime  minister informed the Iranian envoy Ibrahim Zaheryan of the  opposition alliance's refusal to stop the fighting until the  Afghan president submits his resignation.    In a telephone interview conducted with him from Jeddah,  President Rabbani told AL-HAYAH that the Hekmatyar-Dostam  alliance is a "devil's alliance," and that "its aim is to seize  power in Kabul over the bodies and corpses of the innocent."  Pointing clearly to Hekmatyar and Dostam, he said that "the  alliance between them was established secretly long ago, and  when the time came to implement the conspiracy, they announced  it."    Rabbani added that "recent events have provoked the  indignation of the Islamic world, especially as the aggressors  have shelled mosques, houses of worships, and hospitals inside  Kabul." Rabbani welcomed the mediation of the brothers in the  Islamic states but stressed that Hekmatyar and Dostam "have  persisted in breaking pledges and not abiding by agreements."

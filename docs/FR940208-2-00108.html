			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OCC, TCC, and their clearing members will interface with GSF through what is termed the GlobeSet System. The GlobeSet System entails use of specialized software on a personal computer along with a modem and encryption device. Additional security for the GlobeSet System will include the use of identification codes and passwords. Purchase, redemption, transfer, and other instructions will be transmitted to GSF through the GlobeSet System. In addition, it may be used to review account balances and transaction histories and to access and make entries on GSF's electronic bulletin board. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  In the event that the GlobeSet System is unavailable due to operational difficulties, instructions may be sent to GSF via facsimile transmission. GSF will only accept such instructions if, among other things, they are signed by authorized individuals who previously submitted a signature specimen and GSF has verified the contents of the instruction with such individual. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> GSF's electronic bulletin board may be used to identify counterparties (i.e., other GSF shareholders) for purposes of selling fund shares or effecting a matched transfer of fund shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Operationally, OCC, ICC, and their clearing members will each execute shareholder agreements with GSF which will provide, among other things, that shares in the funds acquired by an OCC or ICC clearing member will be deposited in OCC's or ICC's primary account via book-entry. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  OCC or ICC will hold such shares as the ``registered owner'' (within the meaning of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code) as security for the obligations of the depositing clearing member in accordance with OCC's and ICC's rules. Upon receipt of a margin withdrawal request made by a clearing member in accordance with OCC's or ICC's rules, OCC or ICC will transfer the shares back to the clearing member via book-entry transfer after the clearing member's margin requirement ends or the clearing member deposits other collateral. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, OCC and ICC will execute two separate forms of shareholder agreements. One shareholder agreement will provide for the establishment of a primary account in the name of OCC or ICC and for subaccounts in the name of each clearing member that desires to deposit shares in OCC or ICC. All deposited shares will be held in OCC's or ICC's primary account with the subaccounts being used for accounting purposes. The other shareholder agreement will establish a secondary account in OCC's or ICC's name into which OCC or ICC will transfer shares from their primary accounts in order to redeem shares from GSF or in order to effect a disposition of shares with a counterparty identified through GSF's electronic bulletin board. OCC and ICC will limit the value of the margin deposits to 50% of the total value of each non-U.S. dollar-denominated portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Liquidation of shares in each GSF portfolio may be accomplished by one of four means: (i) Redeeming shares for payment in the designated currency; <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  (ii) redeeming shares for payment in securities held by the portfolios (subject to the approval of GSF's investment adviser); (iii) selling shares to a counterparty identified through GSF's electronic bulletin board; or (iv) effecting a matched transfer with a counterparty identified through GSF's electronic bulletin board. GSF will fund liquidations accomplished by the means specified in (i) and (ii) above from payments received on the sale of shares issued by a portfolio, proceeds from maturing portfolio securities, proceeds from the sale of portfolio securities, and proceeds of borrowings by a portfolio that are collateralized by portfolio securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> While OCC or ICC may order the redemption of shares at any time, share redemption occurs at each next asset valuation. The proceeds therefrom, however, will be transferred to OCC and ICC only during the times that the local bank wire system for a particular portfolio is in operation. Accordingly, proceeds of share redemptions from the U.S. dollar portfolio will be paid during the applicable banking hours on the banking days on which the Fedwire is operational. Proceeds of share redemptions from the pound portfolio will be paid during the applicable banking hours on the banking days on which CHAPS is operational. Proceeds of share redemptions from the yen portfolio will be paid during the banking hours on the applicable banking days on which BOJNET is operational. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OCC and ICC believe the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act because the proposed rule changes will accommodate clearing members by providing them another alternative by which to meet their margin requirements because OCC's and ICC's portfolio of margin collateral will be further diversified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OCC and ICC do not believe that the proposed rule changes will impose any burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Labour urged to make corporate deal THE Labour party should take advantage of the new relationship emerging between government and business and strike a 'socialist deal' with the corporate sector, says a paper published today by the Institute for Public Policy Research, the leftwing think tank. Written by Mr Roger Warren Evans, regional property director for the J. Sainsbury supermarket chain, the paper says the consumer society has shifted power decisively towards the corporate sector while the process of globalisation has drained it away from national governments. The task for Labour, he says, is to reach a mutually beneficial understanding with managers who have been alienated from governments of the Thatcher era which refused to plan long-term investment. Coming to Terms. IPPR, 30-32 Southampton St, London WC1E 7RA. Pounds 2 95.</p>

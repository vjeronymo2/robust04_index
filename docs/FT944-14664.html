			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Knocking at the door of corporate mainland China - Taiwan's Evergreen group is preparing for the normalisation of trading links Mr Chang Yung-fa, chairman of Taiwan's Evergreen group, is keen to expand his shipping, airline and hotel businesses into China. But Taipei's continued ban on direct transportation across the Taiwan Strait is blocking his path. The former sailor founded what is now one of the world's biggest container shipping lines with a tramp steamer in 1968. In 1991, he established Taiwan's first private international airline. Frustrated at being frozen out of China's fast-growing market, he is pressing the government to resume direct sea and air links, cut in 1949 following the Nationalist defeat in China's civil war. 'The mainland market should be a Chinese market,' he says. 'If we keep going on like this, how can Taiwan's shipping industry survive? And how will Taiwan's economy continue to develop?' Mr Chang's blue-chip flagship, Evergreen Marine (EMC), is popular among foreign institutional investors. However, foreign ownership restrictions hold foreign holdings at less than 5 per cent of outstanding shares. EMC posted net profits of TDollars 1.22bn (USDollars 46.7m) for first six months to June 30, up 2.4 per cent from a year earlier. A political stalemate between Taipei and Beijing makes it unlikely - although not impossible - that the government will lift the cross-strait shipping ban within a year. Full normalisation of trade ties, including direct flights, could take several years. Meanwhile, the Evergreen group is streamlining its operations and making initial forays into China in preparation for direct links. Only a small fraction of the group's ocean freight currently originates in China. In May, the closely-held group announced plans to invest up to USDollars 80m in China for development of port, terminal and transport systems. Evergreen Marine has earmarked Dollars 50m for China investments, while listed shipper Uniglory Marine Corp, 37 per cent-owned by EMC, will invest up to Dollars 30m. The group's first project is to build an inland container terminal near Shanghai. EMC will invest USDollars 6m for a 60 per cent stake in Shanghai Evergreen Container Transportation, a joint venture with a subsidiary of the Shanghai port authority, which will invest Dollars 4m for a 40 per cent share. The project, the first by a Taiwanese shipping company on the mainland, is scheduled for completion by mid-1996. Evergreen, which has offices in Shanghai and Xiamen, plans to co-operate with the Xiamen Steamship Company to open a Xiamen-Hong Kong route. Uniglory is considering terminal development projects in the ports of Xiamen, Tianjin and Qingdao. Evergreen is also looking at a joint project with US-based General Electric to build a container terminal at Zhangjia harbour near Shanghai. EVA Airways Corp, an important component in the group's diversification strategy, is poised to become highly profitable once direct flights to China are permitted, analysts say. But for the moment, the airline remains a drain on group finances and is unlikely to become profitable before 1996. Since China's open-door and economic reform policies began to bear fruit in the early 1980s, growing cross-strait trade has been routed through Hong Kong or other locations. Once direct shipping is allowed, Uniglory will serve 'feeder' routes as China's harbours are too shallow for larger ships, while EMC will ply the long-haul lanes. To accommodate expected increased business, EMC in June placed orders for its first five U-type (post-panamax, or too wide for the Panama Canal) container ships for trans-Pacific routes. Also on order are five more R-type (panamax) vessels. The group's fleet currently has 75 container vessels. This will rise to 85 in two to three years. EVA is expanding its fleet aggressively and expects to have 25 aircraft by the end of 1995 from 12 at the beginning of this year. Owned 26.5 per cent by EMC, EVA saw a rise in passengers following government-owned flagship carrier China Air Lines' tragedy at Japan's Nagoya airport in April, in which at least 260 people died. EVA has so far secured rights to fly to nearly 20 destinations and is especially keen to gain access to the 'golden' Hong Kong-Taiwan route, now dominated by CAL and Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific. The airline is expected to go public once it makes a profit. Aviation is one of the industries in China in which the Taiwan government bans its citizens from investing, but EVA is believed to be quietly preparing for direct flights to the big Chinese cities.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Taiyuan, May 31 (XINHUA) -- Tian Jiyun,  vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing  Committee, said that Shanxi should make great efforts to  stabilize its agricultural production and promote township  enterprises and coal mining.    He made the remark in his May 28-31 tour of the province,  which is one of China's most important energy bases, producing  most of the country's coal.    Tian, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out that  Shanxi should put the same emphasis on stabilizing both coal  mining and agricultural production.    The province has placed agriculture, infrastructure and  basic  industry as the key sectors for future development. Plans have  been drawn up to develop coal mining, electricity,  transportation, water conservancy and road construction.    A new airport and railway station are under construction in  this provincial capital.    Tian also inspected Dazhai Village in Xiyang County, which  used to be a national model for farming. Great changes have  taken place in this village in recent years, as the villagers  have set up a series of factories.</p>

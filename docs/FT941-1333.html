			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Era Pounds 0.83m in loss and seeks Pounds 5.2m Era Group, the specialist retailing and distribution group, yesterday announced a Pounds 5.2m cash call and a scrip issue in lieu of preference dividends, after reporting a Pounds 1m reversal into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 826,000 for 1993. Mr Anthony Fay, chairman, blamed the loss - which was after a Pounds 280,000 provision for reorganisation and closure costs - on a continuing lack of consumer confidence, an erosion of gross margins and increases in occupancy costs. The 1-for-1 rights issue of 63.12m new ordinary shares is at 9p per share. Convertible preference holders can participate on the same terms as ordinary holders, on the basis of two new ordinary for every three preference shares. In addition, the entitlements of convertible preference holders to accrued and certain future preference dividends, amounting to Pounds 1.05m, will be cancelled and replaced by the issue of 5.27m scrip shares with a value at the rights price of Pounds 474,475. Turnover in 1993 was marginally higher at Pounds 74.3m (Pounds 73.3m). The group - whose retail operations include Beatties, Tecno and Fox Talbot - did not open any new shops in 1993. Losses per share increased from 0.46 to 1.31p and again no dividend is being paid for the period.</p>

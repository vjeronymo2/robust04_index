			<p>BFN     [Text] Japan has agreed to provide a 1.5 billion ringgit  [Malaysian currency] soft loan to Malaysia for the construction  of an airport from which British firms have been shut out.    Hideki Tanaka, a director of the Overseas Economic  Cooperation Fund, OECF, which is extending the credit facility  to Malaysia, said the loan could be signed between the end of  this month and early July. It will be repaid over 25 years with  a three percent annual interest.    The OECF, a non-profit body under Japan's Finance Ministry,  regularly extends long-term loans at a low interest rate to help  emerging economies in Southeast Asia and other developing  countries. The Japanese fund has so far provided 15 loan  packages to Malaysia with more than U.S.$5.1 billion since 1966,  mostly for infrastructure projects.    Tanaka said the loan for the new Kuala Lumpur international  airport followed a personal request by Malaysian Prime Minister  Mahathir Mohamed to his former Japanese counterpart, Kiichi  Miyazawa, in January last year.</p>

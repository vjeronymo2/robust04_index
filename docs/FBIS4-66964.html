			<p>Late'   <F P=102>   FL2904203694 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030  GMT 29 Apr 94 </F>  <F P=103> FL2904203694 </F> <F P=104>  Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio </F> <F P=105>  French </F> BFN     [Text] The spokesman for President Aristide, Jean-Claude  Martineau, has reacted to the antidrug operation led by the  Haitian military authorities. The initiative has come too late,  according to the president's spokesman. Martineau has reaffirmed  that the Haitian military authorities are involved in drug  trafficking, up to the hilt. [begin recording, in Creole]    Martineau: A big drug dealer made a series of  statements before the U.S. Senate, perhaps one week ago. He  stated before a U.S. Senate committee that [Lieutenant Colonel]  Michel Francois [Port-au-Prince police chief] is involved in  drug trafficking, up to the hilt. Obviously, it was not  necessary for anyone to come tell us about that to know it.  Besides, this is something that President Aristide has been  denouncing for some times. We have heard that there is an  operation aimed at arresting drug dealers in Haiti. Why are they  trying to arrest those involved in drug trafficking (only) after  this accusation, when they knew about it previously? [end  recording]    This was the spokesman for President Aristide, Jean-Claude  Martineau.</p>

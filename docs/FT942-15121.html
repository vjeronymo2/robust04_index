			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Pibs level out after plunge After undergoing sharp price falls earlier this year, most prices of permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) have dropped more gently since the Weekend FT last published the table on February 26, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. 'The market has stabilised in line with the gilt edged market and, with the return of confidence, has seen a re-emergence of yield-based buyers,' says David Barker of broker Hoare Govett. Pibs are issued by building societies to raise capital, but they are not the type of share that gives investors part of a company's assets. Instead, they are loans from the investor to the society. They have no redemption date and are, therefore, designed to pay a fixed income indefinitely. Because of this, investors can get back their capital only by selling in the stock market. They have been popular with private investors because of the relatively high income they can provide: the table shows present yields which are between 9.36 and 11.27 per cent. But if the building society were to collapse, Pib investors would rank behind all others for repayment. There is no compensation scheme to protect them, either. Robin Boyle, of London-based stockbroker Dunbar, Boyle &amp; Kingsley - which puts together a portfolio of Pibs now yielding 10.4 per cent after expenses  -says that one way of reducing the risk of capital loss is to include zero coupon preference shares in the portfolio. The Pibs produce the income while the zeros (which do not pay income) provide capital growth for the fund. Exeter Fund Managers has packaged this idea in a unit trust.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                  PERMANENT INTEREST-BEARING SHARES  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Stock                    Coupon      Minimum       Issue date                (gross per cent)      (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires       9.38        1,000         16/12/93 Bradford &amp; Bingley        13.00       10,000          30/9/91 Bradford &amp; Bingley        11.63       10,000          29/6/92 Bristol &amp; West            13.38        1,000         11/12/91 Britannia (1st)           13.00        1,000          13/1/92 Britannia (2nd)           13.00        1,000          8/10/92 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs       11.75       50,000         21/10/92 Coventry**                12.13        1,000          28/5/92 First National            11.75       10,000           4/5/93 Halifax                   12.00       50,000          23/1/92 Halifax                    8.75       50,000           7/9/93 Leeds Permanent           13.63       50,000           3/6/91 Leeds &amp; Holbeck           13.38        1,000          31/3/92 Newcastle                 12.63        1,000           8/9/92 Newcastle                 10.75        1,000          15/6/93 North of England          12.63        1,000          23/6/92 Skipton                   12.88        1,000          27/2/92  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Stock               Issue price       Price*           Yield*                         (pence)      (pence)  (gross, per cent)  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires     100.17        92.00            10.19 Bradford &amp; Bingley       100.20       129.88            10.00 Bradford &amp; Bingley       100.13       117.00             9.94 Bristol &amp; West           100.34       125.25            10.67 Britannia (1st)          100.42       125.75            10.34 Britannia (2nd)          107.13       125.75            10.34 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs      100.96       117.25            10.02 Coventry**               100.75       115.75            10.48 First National           100.25       104.25            11.27 Halifax                  100.28       124.50             9.64 Halifax                  100.62        93.50             9.36 Leeds Permanent          100.00       136.50             9.98 Leeds &amp; Holbeck          100.23       126.00            10.62 Newcastle                100.45       118.25            10.68 Newcastle                100.32       102.13            10.53 North of England         100.14       117.00            10.79 Skipton                  100.48       119.75            10.75  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hoare Govett.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- *Purchase price at mid-day April 13; excludes accrued interest **includes stamp duty payable on Coventry pibs only  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

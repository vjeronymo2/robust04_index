			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / An older, wiser Mickey Mouse: After a year of losses, Euro Disney realises that its customers want a theme park with a genuine American flavour It did not take long for Euro Disney to realise one could go broke overestimating the taste of the European public. When the theme park outside Paris was being built, Euro Disney believed visitors would want sit-down meals and souvenir sweatshirts with discreet logos of Mickey Mouse. Instead they wanted take-away food and Mickey Mouse logos big enough to cover their chests. Mr Philippe Bourguignon, the Frenchman who was appointed Euro Disney chairman last January, says: 'Each time we tried to Europeanise the product we found it didn't work. Europeans want America and they want Disney, whether French intellectuals like it or not.' When Euro Disney celebrates its first anniversary on Easter Monday, it will look back on a year in which knowing what customers wanted proved more difficult than predicted. The company, which expected a profitable start, made a pre-tax loss of FFr339m (Pounds 42.5m) in the year to September 30 1992, which included its first six months of full operation. In the first quarter of the current year, it recorded a deficit of FFr492m. High French interest rates have made Euro Disney's FFr18bn debt more onerous than expected. Inflation, the salvation of many an indebted developer, is currently running at only 2.1 per cent in France, compared with the 5 per cent Euro Disney projected. Occupancy at the park's six hotels has averaged 55 per cent, compared with an expected 68 per cent. One of its hotels had to be closed for most of the winter. Spending on both food and merchandise is lower than expected. Although it has learned from some of its initial mistakes, profitability is still years away. Just when the theme park begins to turn a profit will be influenced as much by Euro Disney's efforts to ease its financial burden as by management initiatives to improve its operations. Mr John Forsgren, finance director, says the company will not make a profit either this year or next. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, expects the group to record a deficit of FFr769m this year and to produce losses of FFr570m in 1994 and FFr352m in 1995. She does not expect Euro Disney to make a profit until 1996. Not all is gloom, however. In the spring sunshine, there are long queues for the Pirates of the Caribbean and the Star Tours intergalactic voyage. Mr Steve Burke, executive vice president, says the company will meet its first-year target of 11m visitors by the end of this month. After a disappointing start, Euro Disney had been expected to miss its target by 500,000. The improved attendance figures are the result of an intense focus on the French market. Initial visitor figures from the UK and Germany exceeded expectations, but French attendances were disappointing, despite the specially built RER suburban railway extension linking the park with central Paris. In the first four months, Euro Disney attracted more British visitors than French. Mr Bourguignon puts the initial lack of French interest down to 'the Eiffel tower syndrome'. People do not have a sense of urgency about visiting an attraction in their own back yard, he says. To boost attendances, Euro Disney offered residents of the Paris area discounts of up to 30 per cent on the FFr225 admission price during the first three months of this year. Giving local people discounts, known as 'resident salute', is a feature of Disney's US parks. Euro Disney also sent sales teams to French schools and companies, offering reduced group rates during off-peak periods. The result was that French visitors accounted for over 35 per cent of the total for the year, compared with 29 per cent in the first six months. British visitors made up 15 per cent of the total for the year, with Germans a short distance behind. Mr Bourguignon estimates that one-sixth of the 12m residents of the greater Paris region have now visited the park. Euro Disney has paid a price for the improved attendances, however. Mr Forsgren says that about half the visitors to the park since January have paid reduced entrance fees. Local visitors also spend less in the park than those coming from further afield. Mr Bourguignon says the Parisian weather has not been the problem many of Euro Disney's detractors predicted. The park was full over the Christmas period when temperatures were below freezing. Nevertheless, he says, seasonal variation has been much sharper than anticipated, with attendances particularly low on weekdays when schools are in session. To encourage visitors during these quiet periods, Euro Disney is to offer winter admission prices 30 per cent cheaper than in summer. Euro Disney executives say they now have a clearer idea of what visitors want. Apart from more take-away food and fewer sit-down restaurants, they prefer Disney-branded souvenirs to general merchandise. They also want cheaper meals and souvenirs. Children want more opportunities to shake hands with Disney characters, who are even more popular in Europe than in the US. But if they prefer American products, visitors to the park still display European behaviour patterns. Mr Burke says that while Americans will eat lunch at 11.30 am or 3 pm, Europeans insist on eating between noon and 2 pm, creating long queues at the restaurants. To try to persuade them to eat earlier, Euro Disney now has a morning parade in addition to the two later in the day. Mr Burke says if a parade ends at 11.30, people are more likely to eat before they do anything else. Euro Disney executives say even the way Europeans travel to the park is different from in the US. There are fewer cars than expected at Euro Disney and many more coaches. The company originally built a recreation room for 30 coach drivers. One day last year, there were 900 coaches in the car park. The company is now building a new cafeteria and recreation room for 700 drivers. While the 12,000 'cast members' seem more assured and competent than a year ago, they also seem more European than American. Two Euro Disney staff could be found telling visitors to the park last month that Sleeping Beauty's Castle was closed because of overcrowding. When will it be open? 'We don't know,' they shrugged, with that time-honoured European insouciance which suggests that not knowing is one of the perks of the job. Mr Bourguignon says he is pleased with the cast members' 'enthusiasm and creativity', and that first-year staff turnover of 34 per cent was below the tourist industry average. Nevertheless, he says, the company wants greater flexibility in deploying employees, particularly during quieter seasons. He says he wants to encourage staff to take holidays in November and January, when business is slackest. He also wants them to work in different parts of the park during the day. Catering staff might work in the park during the afternoon and at the hotels in the evening. Mr Bourguignon wants to increase the company's pool of part-time workers, taking advantage of recent changes in French labour law which have made hiring part-timers less expensive. Mr Forsgren says Euro Disney hopes to make savings in its second year by using fewer staff this summer than last. 'We intentionally overstaffed last year, particularly in areas such as security, because we had no idea what to expect,' he says. The company will retain its minimum team of around 10,000 employees for the low season but will reduce the number of people employed in the summer high season from last year's peak of 19,000 to between 15,000 and 16,000. France's new conservative government is committed to reducing interest rates, which should help Euro Disney. Mr Forsgren says the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of its debt. 'Our objective is clearly to reduce the interest burden. There are a number of different strategies under consideration but we haven't taken any decisions yet,' he says. The group repays FFr9.5bn of its debt at floating interest rates and the remaining FFr8.5bn at fixed rates. It initially expected to repay the floating FFr9.5bn at 9 per cent, but has had to pay an average rate of 2 percentage points more, adding FFr200m to its annual interest bill. Lower French inflation has made it difficult for the company to raise prices, particularly at a time when the French franc is relatively strong against other currencies. Mr Forsgren estimates that lower inflation has cost the company about FFr100m. Euro Disney originally hoped to reduce its debt by raising capital from the sale and lease-back of five of its six hotels and developing property around the park. But both schemes have been scuppered by the sluggish economic environment. The property development plan, expected to provide FFr100m in capital gains last year and FFr200m this year, is on ice until Paris property prices recover. The hotel programme, scheduled to start next year, has been postponed because of the weak condition of the European leisure market. On the operating side, one of the biggest challenges is to persuade more non-Parisian visitors to stay in on-site hotels. The problem is that, in contrast with the group's Florida park, Euro Disney is too small to warrant a stay of more than two days. The company is opening six new attractions, including Le Temple du Peril, a train which takes visitors on 'a thrilling high-speed chase through an archaeological dig in a dense rain forest', and Legends of the Wild West, featuring 'a native American Indian who will help transport guests back in time to the days of the American Wild West'. But plans to open a second theme park, which would give visitors a reason to extend their stay to several days, have been put back a year to 1996. Mr Bourguignon says he would like to see more visitors using the Euro Disney hotels as a base for exploring Paris. The only reason that has not happened yet, he says, is that the Paris tourist industry has been depressed and hotel rooms in the city have been easy to find. He adds that Euro Disney needs to persuade its customers that the hotels, each with their own theme, are an important part of a visit to the park. There is, for example, the Hotel New York, built to resemble the Manhattan skyline, the Sequoia Lodge, designed to evoke images of US national parks, and the Cheyenne, intended to convey the feeling of a Wild West frontier town. Mr Bourguignon says: 'We probably haven't emphasised the whole experience sufficiently. The Cheyenne is not just a sleeping box - it's an experience.' During one guest's recent stay at the New Mexico-style Hotel Santa Fe, there was no shampoo in the bathroom, the handle of the minibar came away in the hand (as did the controls of the shower), a previous occupant's drinking straw lay on the carpet, and a defective telephone resulted in a red 'message waiting' light flashing throughout the night. The park is spotless and in good working order. The hotel 'experience' - so important to Euro Disney's success - might need some upgrading.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Huntleigh up 29% to Pounds 3.03m HUNTLEIGH Technology, the maker of medical control systems, increased first half profits by 29 per cent on a 25 per cent rise in sales. Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 2.35m to Pounds 3.03m on turnover higher at Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 13m). Earnings per share rose 31 per cent to 7.45p (5.67p). The directors are recommending a 50 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 2p (1.33p). The UK side expanded to account for about 23 per cent of group sales, up from 18 per cent for the same period last year, following an expansion of the range of equipment now available through its 12 rental centres. Three years ago the UK accounted for only 10 per cent of sales. Mr Rolf Schild, chairman, said the recently announced healthcare reforms in the US were likely to lead to wider coverage of the population and should benefit the US subsidiaries. The group had net cash of Pounds 2.2m before the Pounds 2m cost of purchasing a new warehouse and office building in Luton.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Lords attack EC packaging scheme EUROPEAN COMMUNITY proposals on packaging could lead to 'waste mountains' of unwanted recycled materials, a Lords committee warns today. A directive drawn up by the European Commission would set recycling targets without taking into account whether the saved materials were useful. The Lords committee on the EC report on packaging and packaging waste calls instead for a tax on packaging with funds raised going towards environmental improvements. Taxes, such as a packaging charge levied by producers, could be used to encourage a reduction in the amount of wrapping used for each item. But they rule out charging individual households for the collection of their rubbish, saying this could have a harmful effect on the environment. Germany comes under attack for dumping its surplus recycled paper and plastics in Britain and other EC countries at below cost. The report also criticises the proposed EC directive for imposing unreasonable restrictions on the use of landfill and incineration and giving too high a priority to recycling when this was not best for the environment. It says that while there is a clear case for recycling steel and aluminium, plastic is less useful because it can be difficult to recycle.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Summit faces discord over Gatt and jobs: Two-day meeting of European Union leaders opens in Brussels today European leaders gather today for a two-day summit likely to be disrupted by internal rows over the cost of the world trade deal now within sight. Further tensions are expected to surface in the debate on how to tackle the continent-wide unemployment crisis, and over a white paper on jobs and growth prepared by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The summit is likely to expose an ideological fault line in the EU, based on the degree of labour market deregulation necessary to create jobs and the cost of infrastructure investment needed to make Europe more competitive. On Gatt, the 12 member states must accommodate France's insistence that its farmers will not have to take more land out of production to meet the requirements of a new world accord on subsidised food exports. This has pitted Paris against Bonn, which is also resisting French demands that the EU put in place trade defence mechanisms as tough as those of the US. France's hard line has encouraged other member states such as Portugal, Greece and Spain to put pressure on their partners for compensation over shortcomings in the likely Gatt accord on textiles, maritime transport and Mediterranean farm produce. Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency, will push hard for a commitment to act on the conclusions of Mr Delors' white paper. 'There is quite a lot of agreement on the orientation; the debate will centre on the financing of it,' a senior Belgian official said. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, is expected to try to paint Mr Delors' blueprint as a free-spending, interventionist recipe. But other British officials at the summit played down the likelihood of confrontation and described the white paper as an intellectually respectable document. Another source of contention is Mr Delors' proposal for the EU to spend up to Ecu20bn (Pounds 15.2bn) a year to the end of the century as a catalyst for heavy pan-European investment in roads, rail, energy, environment and advanced information networks. The projects are to be funded partly through new EU bonds amounting to Ecu8bn a year. Britain may get backing from Germany to oppose the new bonds, but French officials predicted that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would support the scheme on the basis of a yearly review. The budget-conscious Dutch have already signalled support. In London Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, attacked Mr Delors' plans, saying there was no evidence of the need for EU borrowing for infrastructure improvements across Europe. Gatt, Page 6</p>

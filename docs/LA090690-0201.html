			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS' ROBINSON TURNS WORRIES, ATTENTION TO BATTERED OFFENSE UNIT  </P> <P> The Rams have been spending most of their time trying to patch together a  defensive unit, but with the return of three defensive holdouts over the  weekend and the addition of cornerback Mickey Sutton Tuesday, Coach John  Robinson can focus his concern on the offense. And concern he has.  </P> <P> Conditioning will likely be a factor for former holdouts Kevin Greene, Doug  Reed and Michael Stewart. But rushing the passer, plugging up the run holes and  knowing your spot in a zone defense don't require the precise timing that is  involved in the Rams' intricate passing game.  </P> <P> So now, Robinson has new problems to worry about going into Sunday's season  opener against the Packers at Green Bay.  </P> <P> Both starting receivers -- Henry Ellard and Flipper Anderson -- have hamstring  injuries that have severely limited their practice time. Ellard caught one pass  in exhibition play, Anderson none.  </P> <P> "I'm worried about getting started offensively," Robinson said. "The talent is  coming back, but we've been off the practice field for some time now, and I  think the timing could be a problem."  </P> <P> The Rams picked up linebacker Greg Clark off waivers from Green Bay Wednesday.  Clark, from Torrance and Arizona State, who went to the Packers as a Plan B  player from Miami, will be primarily a special teams player.  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> All-Pro wide receiver Henry Ellard agreed to a three-year contract extension  Wednesday. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. . . . Cornerback Mickey  Sutton, picked up on waivers from the Buffalo Bills, will start at left corner  against Green Bay. JOHN WEYLER  </P></p>

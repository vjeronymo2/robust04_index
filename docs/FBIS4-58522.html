			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Hittin Mosque in Irbid last Saturday [30  April] was the scene of a clash between members of the Society  of Repudiation and Renunciation and the Muslim Brotherhood.  Chains, sharp instruments, bricks, and sticks were all used as  weapons. The brawl took place against the backdrop of  differences that have built up over the past year and a half.  The Society of Repudiation and Renunciation activists sought to  settle a score with the Brotherhood members after the evening  prayers at the mosque.    Eyewitnesses of the melee, which began inside the mosque and  then continued outside, said a member of the Society of  Repudiation and Renunciation set upon a member of the  Brotherhood as he performed the evening prayers. The latter  carried on with his prayers, but once they were completed, a  verbal clash developed and degenerated into a scuffle between  the two. Members from the two sides were then drawn into the  battle, with the Society of Redemption and Renunciation men  employing knives, daggers, and sticks. [passage omitted]    By all accounts, it was the Redemption group that triggered  the fight and heightened the tension. Witnesses add that their  hostile behavior was premeditated. There was widespread  resentment of the way the Society of Redemption and Renunciation  adherents sought to rectify the morals of the camp residents  whom they accuse of being infidels for their failure to abide by  the precepts of the Koran. [passage omitted]    A pious, enlightened young man traced the disagreements  between the two sides back a year and a half, to when the  Repudiation and Renunciation Society formed in Irbid. The  group's members, he said, think the Brotherhood's ideas are  moderate and their attitude toward people is too soft. They  want the Brotherhood to adopt a sterner attitude toward the  government and society. Its adherents have more than once  vilified the mufti of Irbid and a number of the city's shaykhs.    The young man maintained that the group was modelled on the  faction of the same name that originated in Egypt. They tend to  view most people as blasphemous, contending that they do not act  by the rules laid down in the Koran. A Muslim who does not  abide fully by the Sunnah is, in their eyes, a blasphemer. They  routinely hassle revelers at wedding parties, sometimes  disrupting such functions. They are also said to be opposed to  people wearing wrist watches, and necklaces, as well as trousers  and various other articles of clothing.    Meanwhile, security sources speaking to AL-BILAD attributed  the mosque brawl to personal reasons. Witnesses, however,  report that differences center on rival interpretations of  prayers from the perspective of the Koran and Sunnism. The  Redemption and Renunciation Society is said by other sources to  be scaring children off religious lessons given by Hamas, the  Islamic Resistance Movement. Police have apprehended an entire  family suspected of membership in Hamas.    Abu-'Adnan, the man who does the calls to prayers for the  Hittin Mosque, told AL-BILAD he witnessed the scuffle at close  range. It began as verbal abuse before it developed into a  clash in which chains, knives and daggers were used. The  attack, he maintains, was several days in the making because the  chains had been in the mosque before the scuffle happened.    Colonel 'Abdallah 'Ulaymat, the Irbid Police Commissioner,  dismissed ideological differences as the cause of the violence,  blaming personal differences instead. 'Ulaymat noted that during  questioning, the suspects disclaimed affiliation to any Islamic  group. The matter is so minor it does not merit a mention in  the press, Col. 'Ulaymat asserted.</p>

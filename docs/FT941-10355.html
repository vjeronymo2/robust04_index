			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Yeltsin tries to head off air strikes President Boris Yeltsin is in urgent contact with world leaders in an apparent attempt to avert a western military strike against Bosnia's Serbs that could cause him severe problems at home, Mr Anatoly Krasikov, Kremlin spokesman, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Krasikov said Mr Yeltsin believed 'the medicine should not be worse than the disease'. The comment set out the Russian leader's opposition to proposed air strikes on Serb positions around Sarajevo. The former Yugoslavia is one area of world politics where Russia - with historic ties with Serbia and the Serbs - has retained at least the semblance of the status of a world power. Romania also spoke out yesterday against Nato strikes, and Greece said it would not allow Nato to use air support bases on its territory. Mr Evangelos Venizelos, Greek government spokesman, said that Athens would withdraw its crews from Nato surveillance aircraft over Bosnia if the alliance launched air strikes. 'Our position is clear,' Mr Venizelos said yesterday as Nato ambassadors met in Brussels. Athens opposed military intervention anywhere in former Yugoslavia, he added. Greece's Nato ambassador was reported to have made this point clear at the Brussels meeting. Romanian officials said a negotiated, political settlement was 'the only viable solution'. In Moscow yesterday, parliament discussed the question of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, and the possible withdrawal of the 1,200 Russian peacekeeping troops from the former Yugoslavia. The effect of sanctions on surrounding regions was also discussed in Geneva, where ministers from seven countries close to former Yugoslavia met international mediators. Officials said the mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, wanted the regional ministers to consider reconstruction needs in and around Serbia and Montenegro once the conflicts were settled.</p>

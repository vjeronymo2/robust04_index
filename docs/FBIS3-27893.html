O Ik-chae, supreme leader of South Korean Chondogyo,  proposed  in his message that they hold a working-level contact in the  Truce Village of Panmunjom in March to discuss ways to jointly  push ahead with a project celebrating the 100th anniversary of  the Tonghak Revolution.    The message to Yu Mi-yong, chairman of the central guidance  committee of North Korean Chondogyo, was in reply to a North  Korean proposal on Jan. 24 that they hold a working-level  contact in Panmunjom on Feb. 3 to discuss the joint  commemoration.    O said, "in the current situation, a visit by your people to  Seoul is not appropriate. I firmly believe that every problem  will be solved by early March and that we must make efforts to  solve the problems by then."    Chondogyo is a religion founded in Korea by Choe Che-u in  1859. It is the religion of the heavenly way (Chondo), but its  name was later changed to Tonghak (eastern learning).    In an era of political chaos in the late 19th century, the  followers of Tonghak rejected the influence of Japan, Russia,  China and other foreign powers and rebelled against the king and  the government. However, they failed to take power.</p>

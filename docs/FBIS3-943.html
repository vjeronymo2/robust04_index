			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Three highly dangerous radioactive sources have been  stolen from the Vaal Reefs Mine near Orkney in the western  Transvaal. An Anglo-American spokesman said the sources were  used to measure the density of mud and had no commercial value  whatsoever. Two of the sources are gray in color and one is  bright yellow. All are about the size and shape of a large  coffee tin, and bear a radiation warning symbol. Mine  management has emphasized the sources are highly dangerous and  should not be approached or handled.</p>

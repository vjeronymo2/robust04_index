			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Report by 'Atif al-Ghamri in London]    [Text] Aldu Aju, deputy speaker of the Sudanese parliament  [name and title as published], who announced his dissent from  the Sudanese Government and asked for political asylum in  Britain, has revealed the secrets behind transforming Sudan into  a center for extremists from outside Sudan. He publicized the  covert methods the Sudanese Government has resorted to to  mislead the world about the locations and nature of training  programs for terrorists inside Sudan.    In an interview with AL-AHRAM, Aldu clarified that at the  beginning of the coup in 1989, the al-Bashir government's  dealings with the international terrorist organizations inside  Sudan used to be public. However, Sudan started to come under  regional and international pressure and decided to resort to  secrecy.    He highlighted the fact that all these activities take place  under the control of al-Turabi's front, which is called the  Islamic Front, that he will be talking from a position of  authority, and that what he says are things he has seen for  himself.    Aldu said: Their method of secrecy made them set up  locations on the outskirts of Khartoum, which are private farms  where training takes place. In addition, training takes place  in mosques, where people usually come to pray. The extremists  also show up among the crowds in the mosque, but they stay on  until the training and guidance courses start. These go on  until 0400. Iranians and other people from Arab countries do the  training.    He added that the second method is to have public training  centers for popular defense programs in numerous locations such  as Jazirat Aba, Juba, and Danqilah. He said: For example,  26,000 mujahid fighters were publicly graduated from training  camps for popular defense in Jazirat Aba on 11 December 1992.  He noted that to mislead people, secret training operations for  terrorists take place as part of this public training. Aldu  said: Extremists from Iran, Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement], and other Islamic and Arab countries take part in  these operations. Recently, some extremists from African  countries were added to them, but their general guidance comes  from Iran.    The third method is to set up what is called the  "international friendship council" which is chaired by al-Bashir  himself and is based in Khartoum. Its public duty is to support  the relations of friendship with other people. But the reality  is that this council is a tool through which contacts with all  terrorist groups in the Arab world and Africa are maintained.    On the Sudanese people's stand on these operations, Aldu  said  that all job opportunities are doled out to those who undergo  training that is under the control of the Islamic Front led by  al- Turabi. He pointed out that the Front has organized a  six-month training program in which each group of Sudanese is  sent to Iran for training and returns after six months. After  that, a second group is sent for another six months' training  period.    Aldu Aju added that after their return to Sudan these  individuals are distributed among the army, police, economic  establishments, and embassies abroad, noting that all Sudanese  diplomats are trained in Iran.    On the Sudanese people's attitude toward Egypt, Aju said:  The Sudanese people want to resolve every dispute with Egypt,  as relations between the two peoples are long-standing. Egypt  must be interested in Sudanese events, Aju noted, saying that  Egypt cannot just sit and look on. He said that Sudan is  governed by one extremist party. He noted that the regime in  Khartoum does not trust Sudanese national principles. It  imports principles of violence and terrorism from abroad and  acts to destabilize the entire region. Egypt, he said, is the  largest force in the region and the Sudanese respect Egypt.    Aju said: The international friendship council is  responsible for foreign policy in Sudan and all the things that  the Sudanese foreign minister says regarding the negotiations to  solve differences with Egypt will not lead to an agreement. He  further noted that foreign policy in Sudan is not run by the  foreign minister.    On the Khartoum government's foreign policy, Aju said that  the Sudanese Government does not deal with governments but with  extremists. It has no good ties with any neighboring Arab or  African country but is trying to act in these countries against  the governments and cited Ethiopia as an example. He said that  this behavior affects Sudan's relations with the Arab world,  Africa, and the whole world.    Aju noted that those who attended the Arab Islamic peoples  conference that was held in Khartoum recently are extremists who  came from Arab, Islamic, African, Asian, and even American  countries. It was noted that the statements made at the  conference were not critical but extremist. He pointed out that  if religion had really been behind this behavior, Sudan would  better have maintained good ties with Egypt because Egypt is the  home of al- Azhar Mosque, which will never be secular. He noted  that the events in Sudan are not motivated by religion but  politics. He said that the Sudanese people are opposed to this  state of affairs, but what can they do when rifles are directed  at them and they are surrounded by security, spying, and  intellectual suppression agencies and faced with the Islamic  Front's control of livelihood, finance, and trade? Summing up  the situation in Sudan, he said: Sudan is a state that has  collapsed after the al-Bashir government destroyed the economy  and all the state's departments. War in the south is  exacerbating the destruction and the collapse is worsening.</p>

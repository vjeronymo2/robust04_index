Jordanian sources had said that while in Saudi Arabia, the  king would hold talks on the Gulf situation, clearing the Arab  atmosphere, and peace efforts.    AL-RA'Y AL-'AMM has learned from its special sources that  the  idea of the Jordanian king's visit to Saudi Arabia had been  proposed by Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Saudi  Arabia during his meeting with the custodian of the two holy  mosques, who welcomed the accord document signed in Amman. The  sources said that al-Bid telephoned King Husayn in the presence  of the custodian of the two holy mosques, who welcomed the  king's visit for minor pilgrimage.</p>

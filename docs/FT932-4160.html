			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Fine Decor gains listing through Pounds 10.7m placing FINE DECOR, the wallpaper designer, manufacturer and distributor came to market yesterday through a placing of 5.39m ordinary shares at 210p each, valuing the Cheshire-based group at Pounds 26.2m. The company demerged from Boots in 1989 via a management buy-out, six months after the chemist and DIY business acquired it as part of Ward White. The placing raised about Pounds 10.7m in net proceeds, of which Pounds 4.6m will be used to repay company debt with the balance representing shares sold by existing institutional shareholders. None of the directors disposed of shares, they retain 3.63m, representing a 29.1 per cent stake. Mr Harry Morgan, chief executive, who previously spent 16 years with Unilever, said the proceeds of the placing would give the group greater flexibility to finance growth and that the listing will give it access to a wider capital market. He added: 'Since the buy-out, we have achieved strong growth in sales, profits and market share, despite severe recessionary conditions in most of the group's markets. The combination of these markets moving out of recession and a recovery in the number of house sales is expected to have a beneficial impact on the group. The directors have forecast operating profits of not less than Pounds 1.62m for the first half to July 31, against Pounds 1.32m in the comparable period. They expect to recommend total dividends for the current year of not less than 7.5p.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Japan makes haste slowly in Vietnam - Victor Mallet tracks a cautious commitment ahead of the west THE popular Vietnamese word for motorcycle is 'honda': while the US agonises about restoring relations with Hanoi, Japanese and other Asian companies are deepening their involvement in the Vietnamese economy as it emerges from decades of war and poverty. American corporations will take heart from President George Bush's move on Monday to allow them to open offices and sign (but not execute) contracts in Vietnam, but the Japanese are several steps ahead. Not only are they fulfilling contracts and doing an increasing amount of business in Vietnam, they are already profiting from the renewal of Japanese aid. Five weeks before Mr Bush's announcement, and three days after the US presidential election, Japan quietly arranged a loan package of Y45.5bn (Pounds 240m) to pay off some of Vietnam's debt arrears to Japan and to finance Vietnamese imports. Japanese project aid for the repair of roads, ports and other infrastructure is expected to follow. Japanese trading companies are already working with Vietnamese officials and Japanese consultants and construction companies to prepare project proposals which could benefit from future Japanese aid. 'Now we are working for next year or the year after next,' says Mr Shuichi Yamamoto, deputy general manager of Sumitomo's operations in Vietnam. This year is busy enough. Japanese companies are importing to Vietnam everything from monosodium glutamate and baby milk powder to chemicals and steel, and exporting crude oil, coal, seafood and textiles to Japan. Except in the oil industry, Japanese companies have so far been cautious about commiting themselves to investment in Vietnam, and Taiwan and Hong Kong have emerged as the most active foreign investors. Japanese businessmen, however, say they are considering investments in petrochemicals, power plants, property development and manufacturing. In a small way, the Japanese are already investing in manufacturing. Sumitomo, for example, is participating in a Dollars 1m-plus joint venture with Vietnamese and Malaysian partners to modernise a factory producing polypropylene sacks in the port of Haiphong, while Marubeni and other Japanese investors are taking a share in a Dollars 4m instant noodle factory. The Japanese do not hide their enthusiasm for the skills and dedication  - and low wages - of Vietnamese workers, and motor manufacturers are known to be interested in establishing plants in Vietnam to add to the small assembly operations already in existence in the country. But it is not all plain sailing. Foreign companies in general, and Japanese companies in particular, face an array of obstacles when it comes to doing business in Vietnam: The Japanese government and Japanese companies are still anxious not to offend the US by undertaking high-profile projects in Vietnam. However, some businessmen regard this as an old-fashioned view now that Vietnam has withdrawn its troops from Cambodia and helped the US trace American servicemen who went missing in action during the Vietnam war. 'Before, people were afraid of America, but now nobody's afraid,' says Sumitomo's Mr Yamamoto. Mr Masao Hirooka of Mitsui disagrees. 'We must still be very, very cautious,' he says. Mr Tsuyoshi Tanaka of Itochu points out that the Japanese government itself is moving cautiously and has 'only the one foot' in the Vietnamese door. Business for everyone is restricted by the poor state of Vietnam's infrastructure. For example the south, where most industry is located, suffers from a severe shortage of electricity. Funds from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank, currently blocked by Washington, are urgently needed. Itochu found that Vietnamese white sand for export could compete with Australian sand on the price of the product alone, but transport costs were prohibitive because Vietnam's southern ports can only accommodate small ships and loading equipment is poor. Japanese and other businessmen frequently complain about inadequate commercial laws and the Vietnamese tendency to renege on contracts. 'I have suffered so much, normally from non-delivery,' says Mr Yamamoto. Japanese companies find their business restricted by hundreds of millions of dollars of bad debts owed by Vietnamese importers. The debts date back to the period before late-1990. Japanese companies seeking market share offered credit of up to two years - some still do - but many letters of credit were not honoured; since 1990 letters of credit have generally been honoured, but most of the arrears and accumulated interest have yet to be paid off. Smuggling, often from Thailand or Singapore by way of Cambodia, undermines investment plans. Instead of building factories in Vietnam, Japanese companies make sure their wholesalers on the Thai-Cambodian border are well supplied. Add to these problems the lack of international schools and golf courses - about which Japanese expatriates in Ho Chi Minh City complain bitterly - and one might forgive the Japanese for throwing up their hands in despair and going home. Needless to say, they are doing nothing of the sort. Working closely with the government in Tokyo, they are seeking to have the infrastructure repaired and the bad debts paid off so they can really get down to business. Apart from American businessmen themselves, it is the Vietnamese who are the keenest to see the Americans return and rescue Vietnam from Japanese dominance. Some of them are almost alarmed by the dedication with which Japanese officials and businessmen are staking their claims in Vietnam. 'They take time because they are not in a hurry, because sooner or later they will be the first, the best, but maybe the most disliked,' says one Vietnamese banker.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK television Granada's barb that an independent LWT risked being marginalised in the brave new world of television has clearly struck a funny bone. LWT has since been constructing inventive theories for how a 'quartet' of television stations could now merge. LWT is quite right to explore every avenue to maximise shareholder value. But from the outside, it is hard to see how it can devise a satisfactory scenario. LWT might have hoped its 14 per cent shareholding in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees would have provided a sound starting point. But this liaison has turned into a nightmarish blind date. The confirmation of further bad news and a passed dividend from Yorkshire yesterday has only complicated the game. A straight deal with Anglia might have represented a simpler and more attractive defence. Granada will be itching to conclude its bid quickly to frustrate any alternative plans and may be prepared to sweeten its terms to do so. LWT's institutional investors, who bought shares in anticipation of industry consolidation, are likely to prove fickle friends, especially when prices of 30 times historic earnings are being thrown around for starters. They may also dwell on the longer term trends in television. After reaping the benefits of the cyclical rebound in advertising revenue, ITV franchises will face a tough challenge growing earnings thereafter. Commercial television is a relatively mature industry. Future advertising growth will be at least partially undermined by emerging satellite and cable rivals.</p>

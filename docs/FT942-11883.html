			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Balladur steps up French attempt to enter Asian markets Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday stepped up France's drive to enter Asian markets by vaunting what his country had to offer Asia in political, aid and commercial terms, David Buchan reports from Nice. Opening the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Nice, the French premier expressed his hope for Europe generally to strengthen its ties with Asia, but then homed in on French export specialties in telecommunications, transport and energy, citing South Korea's recent decision to buy the French-designed TGV train. Mr Balladur urged ADB member countries to join, and play a full role in, the new World Trade Organisation which France had pushed for to replace the Gatt organisation. Welcoming the effort that 'most' Asian countries had made in the Uruguay Round to liberalise their trade, he hoped all Asia would see the need to reciprocate trade concessions made by others, as reciprocity was the only basis for 'lasting agreements'.</p>

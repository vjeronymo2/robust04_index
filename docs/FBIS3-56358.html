A session of the working group to  elaborate a model civil code of the Commonwealth of Independent  States will be held in the latter part of January in St.  Petersburg. Also at the end of January, there will be a  roundtable in St. Petersburg of the Interparliamentary Assembly  for problems of development of the CIS with the participation of  representatives of government bodies on interstate cooperation.  Planned for early in February is a seminar on constitutional  reforms in the Commonwealth countries.    The press service has also indicated that a more important  start-of-the-year event will be held in February -- a session of  the council of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, invited for  which will be all the speakers of parliaments of CIS member  countries. It will elect a new chairman of the council of the  Interparliamentary CIS Assembly because the powers of the  previous chairman -- Russian Parliament Speaker Ruslan  Khasbulatov -- terminated at the end of last October. Andrey  Mazhorov, head of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly press  service, stated that the new head of the Russian Federation  Federal Assembly will hardly seek this office. If the council's  chairman should be elected in accordance with the positions the  CIS countries occupy if ranked in Russian alphabetical order (as  is accepted in some organizational structures of the  Commonwealth), this seat could first be contested by Azerbaijan  Parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev. A CIS Interparliamentary  Assembly chairman's term of office is one year.    The heads of parliament will also approve during the meeting  a plan for 1994, and the rules of procedure and the agenda of  the next plenary session of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly  council.</p>

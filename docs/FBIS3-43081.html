			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview between Raisa Dobraya, KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA </F> correspondent, and Kupzhasar Naribayev, rector, Kazakh State  University; ``We Will Not Erect a Tombstone Over Science''; the  first paragraph is an introduction]    [Text] It is known that the situation of our science,  expressing it gently, is not easy. A high percentage of young  people have been drawn into the business world. A hundred times  more money can be earned in deals, in buying and selling, than  behind the desk at any, even the most important scientific  research institute. After graduating from lower schools,  preference is given to the economics, law and commerce faculties  and to universities. What is being done in order to enhance the  image of the so-called nonprestige science faculties, such as is  the situation for education in general in our country, and is  there still a pull of young people toward science, despite its  present day status? These matters are discussed by Kupzhasar  Naribayev, rector of the Kazakh State University imeni Al-Farabi.    Naribayev: I cannot speak for the entire  educational system. We now have a good many higher educational  institutions, including private ones. But our university, the  oldest in the republic, is intended for training specialists in  the fundamental sciences, and without question there are  difficulties. Although I assume that we somehow like to paint a  dark picture and, incidentally, constantly lay it on thick. Now  is a complex period, but I figure that a solution will be found  in one way or another. I think it would be incorrect to say, for  example, that we are erecting a tombstone over science, on which  the very development of society is dependent. In the most  difficult time a Ministry of Science was organized, which,  incidentally, does not fund groups, as was the case earlier, but  scientific projects. But many scientific organizations have been  accustomed to being funded in advance and at the present time  they are left confused. We, however, have received about 1.5  billion rubles, demonstrating the timeliness of the themes which  we have proposed.    It is difficult for science and the education system, but it  is indeed clear: that country wins out which devotes attention  primarily to them. If we, let's assume, purchase technology in  the West, it must be adapted to our conditions. Who will do  this? Yes, scientists are going into business and students are  engaging in it. The budget is weak. Businessmen produce nothing.  It is necessary to have a system of laws which will favor the  development of goods production and then specialists also will  be needed.    This time, I am sure, will come. The state, recognizing the  problems involved in our own development, must determine the  special role of science and education even against the  background of deep social and economic difficulties and do  everything for their thorough development.    Dobraya: Kupzhasar Naribayev, and what now is the  flow of those entering the science faculties: physics,  philosophy, chemistry?    Naribayev: It seems that it's not that small, the  true devotees of science have not been diverted. Yes, and to  call these faculties nonprestigious due to the fact that there  is a not very high competition for entrance would be incorrect.  After all, today there are many who are simply materially unable  to allow themselves travel for study in the capital and because  of this the flow of those matriculating in the higher  educational institutions in Almaty has been reduced. It is  precisely the university graduates who must develop and further  improve new highly scientific technologies in different branches  of physics, chemistry and biology and their knowledge is the  basis for the further development of nuclear power,  environmental protection and the development of new materials.  And this sort of activity cannot be called nonprestige.    As the economic situation stabilizes it also will be natural  to expect an increase in the motivation for study in the natural  science faculties. The formation of such a long-term motivation  requires a definite period of time.    Dobraya: What is the percentage of foreign  students who are selecting the university?    Nabirayev: A total of 257 persons from 29  countries of the world, which is 1.8% of the total number.    Dobraya: Are they coming from America and Europe?    Nabirayev: Yes, there are students from America,  Germany and Poland. Our education is recognized in the West.    Dobraya: But it is assumed that this is not the  case. Is it not true that our diplomas are not valued there?    Nabirayev: It is impossible to make such a  categorical assertion that our diplomas are not valued in the  West. This problem has its juridical aspect. In world practice  there are agreements in force among countries on the reciprocal  recognition of certificates of education. The former all-union  model of education, having primarily an ideological character,  naturally could not be a partner of the Western system for the  training of personnel. Indeed, in actual practice there have  been no forms of cooperation with the West in the field of  training of personnel that would make it possible to speak of  any discrimination against our diplomas. In individual branches,  such as in economics, there could be no such cooperation. But  nevertheless the quality of training of specialists, especially  in the natural science fields of specialization, in our country  always was and still is at a sufficiently high level for it to  be recognized in both Europe and America. Here we have the  example of numerous cases of successful cooperation between our  scientists and those in the West in different fields of science  and technology. Our graduate students and young scientists are  successfully working in research centers in America and Europe.    However, the radical transformations now transpiring in the  education sphere in our country have the tendency toward  organization of an educational system more adapted to world  standards. Since 1992 our university has switched to a two-level  teaching system such as adopted in many countries. And beginning  with the current academic year this system has been introduced  in a number of other universities of the republic. Such a  changeover was not at all dictated by any striving to imitate  the Western instructional system. It must be noted that in world  practice a high evaluation was given to the former Soviet  education system based on 5-6 years of instruction. But from the  point of view of the feasibility of the expenditures on such an  intensive training of specialists, most of whose knowledge then  remains unused, it is preferable, to be sure, to have a  multilevel structure of education.    The striving for an increase in the quality of education  induced us to study the experience of academic institutions in  many countries in the field of monitoring and evaluating the  knowledge of students. The rating system for checking the  knowledge of students introduced in our university incorporated  the most effective and optimum approaches to the certification  of students and is combined to the maximum with the multilevel  training of specialists.    We are inviting the cooperation of Western specialists in  the  market economy and international law fields in the training of  our people. Agreements have been concluded on cooperation in the  field of training of personnel with universities in France,  Japan, Great Britain, South Korea and Turkey and for the second  year joint work is being done with the World Bank in Washington  on the retraining of our instructors in the principles of a  market economy. All these measures, it is believed, will  facilitate an increase in the quality of instruction in our  university.    Dobraya: Is there a plan for work with the gifted?    Naribayev: There is. Our instructors are  participating in olympiads, such students are assigned to  assistant and full professors, are carrying out individual types  of departmental work and are being sent abroad for study. But,  unfortunately, only those can remain as graduate students who  have material resources: a very small stipend. And I also wish  to add that there are few applications for specialists to enter  from scientific research organizations. On the one hand, to be  sure, they themselves are not in the best situation: they are  being cut back and are poorly funded, etc., but in science there  always is a need, so to speak, for a new infusion, and then it  will develop. This is one of the reasons why our students, even  talented ones, are going into the business world. A sign of the  times, but we will hope that it is temporary.    Dobraya: University science earlier was regarded  as a pariah. It was assumed that fundamental science was being  developed only inside the walls of scientific research  institutes. What's the present-day situation?    Naribayev: Fundamental science is developing in  the Academy of Sciences and in our university. We have large  laboratories and three scientific research institutes have  opened: theoretical and experimental physics, new chemical  technologies and modern problems in biology. A scientific  research humanities center is in operation. We intend to open  institutes of applied mathematics and ecology. But there is a  very difficult problem: science and production are not working  hand-in-hand and for the time being tests are being carried out  nowhere in the country. Once again it remains to hope that these  are temporary difficulties. Just take a look, the realities of  today are unquestionably imposing an imprint on the educational  process. One would think that against the background of a  decline in the prestige of education it would be natural to  expect a decrease in the general intellectual level of the  student body. But each year we are meeting at the university  threshold young people desiring to study Persian and Japanese  literature, the history of the Far East, space physics, the  theory of numbers, genetics and molecular biology. Precisely  these young people constitute an enormous intellectual potential  for our country. Without such young people we cannot construct  in our republic that which we want to build. A tombstone must  not be erected over science.</p>

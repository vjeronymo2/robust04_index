			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSEUM'S ARCHITECT: FIRST CHOICE WAS BEST  </P> <P> As a person who appreciates innovative architecture, I was distressed about the  news coverage in Zan Dubin's informative article "New Architect for Museum Is  Identified" (June 5) concerning the underhanded choice of a second architect,  William Pedersen, to "revise" Renzo Piano's design for the Newport Harbor Art  Museum.  </P> <P> Like many of your readers, I have been to Paris and experienced the  irrepressible, liberating cheerfulness and user-friendliness of the Centre  Pompidou designed by Piano -- -- which, among other features, sports the most  accessible library and mediatheque on the continent.  </P> <P> Unlike many readers, however, I have also been to Cincinnati to view architect  Pedersen's reputed masterwork, the Procter &amp; Gamble headquarters, which I  found to be a leaden, gray, monumentalist design of corporate elephantiasis,  cut off from its urban environment and exuding colossal boredom.  </P> <P> I am disturbed by the stealth with which trustees and donors of the museum have  acted here, particularly Irvine Co. Chairman Donald Bren and Fluor Daniel  Chairman David Tappan -- even when they have no right to impose their tastes,  but should defer to experts trained in the arts. This corporate form of  meddling reminds me of Sen. Jesse Helms' notions about what constitutes "good"  and "bad" art and recent moves to hamstring the National Endowment for the  Arts.  </P> <P> And to think that Orange County was just the place for imaginative design, that  we could have had our own Centre Pompidou or Menil Collection museum! Too bad.  Looks like we'll get a humongous soapbox instead.  </P> <P> UTE MARGARETE SAINE  </P> <P> Irvine  </P> <P> * MORE LETTERS: F4  </P></p>

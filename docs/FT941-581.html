			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (8): Europe's answer to CNN - Euronews Lyon has long been regarded as an important media centre thanks to the success of Le Progres, the local newspaper which is one of France's three best-selling dailies. But the city is playing its part in the multi-media revolution as the home of Euronews, the pan-European current affairs channel, Europe's answer to Cable Network News (CNN, the round-the-clock US news service). It was conceived by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)in 1986 and came on air on January 1 last year from headquarters in Ecully, on the outskirts of Lyon. The concept behind Euronews is to combine the live news and archive footage compiled by the EBU's members - which include France 2 and France 3, Italy's RAI, RTVE of Spain and the BBC - into a current affairs channel that covers world events with a European slant. The channel broadcasts simultaneously in five different languages - English, French, German, Italian and Spanish - all accompanied by the same visual material. The programming schedule, which runs for 20 hours every day, is dominated by regular news bulletins but includes regular magazine slots on fashion, travel and cinema. The footage from the EBU members is relayed to the Euronews headquarters at Ecully where it is remixed and edited by the 120-strong staff. The final transmissions are then sent via cable, satellite and terrestial television services to more than 40m homes all over Europe and the Mediterranean basin. Euronews' objective is to present events of European interest in an objective, apolitical style. It accentuates its self-effacing approach by using behind-the-scenes commentaries and graphics, rather than presenters, to accompany and explain its footage. It was set up as a joint venture owned by the EBU members supplying its footage. The share structure has been expanded to include the North African stations, Tunisia's ERTT and Algeria's ENTV. Earlier this month Euronews announced another restructuring plan: France Television, the state-controlled company which owns France 2 and France 3, will raise its stake and nurture closer operational links with Euronews. The station operated last year on a budget of Ecu50m. Just over half comes from its shareholders, with 20 per cent donated by public bodies (including the EU). The remaining 25 per cent is self-generated from the sale of advertising airtime and sponsorship rights. The future plan is to use the proceeds of the recent restructuring to open new editorial offices in Europe and to increase the number of languages in which Euronews broadcasts so that it can function more effectively as a truly international news and current affairs service.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Gains offset cost of cutting hours MORE THAN half the cost of the recent cuts in the working week for manual workers in engineering was absorbed by productivity improvements linked to the hours reductions, says an academic study published today. Wage settlements also tended to be lower to help pay for the cut in hours. Overall, the reductions of two hours, conceded by employers of at least 500,000 manual workers, added less than 1 per cent to the manual labour costs of the companies which took part in the survey. That figure shows that employers fell considerably short in their target of incurring no cost by conceding shorter weeks. The study, by Mr Ray Richardson and Mr Marcus Rubin of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, found that a significant minority of companies, about 10 per cent, did not negotiate productivity concessions linked to the hours deals. However, the study found that, for some companies, the two-hour reduction in the working week led to a fall, or at least no increase, in labour costs. This was because the negotiations for the reductions became the occasion for management to bargain hard for changes which improved efficiency. This tactic was particularly successful where unions were becoming less resistant to change. Nearly 80 per cent of managers replying to the survey said the shorter week had resulted in earlier agreement on changes, or agreement on changes which would otherwise not have been considered at the time. Among their conclusions, the authors say that 'however new and miraculous the 1980s were, a great deal of organisational slack and inefficiency remained in the UK engineering industry by the end of the decade. The shorter week campaign was an occasion for a further assault.'</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc rises after cuts in America LOW METAL prices are forcing more lead-zinc mines to reduce output but on the London Metal Exchange yesterday only zinc showed a substantial recovery on news of cuts in Canada and Mexico. Zinc for delivery in three months rose by nearly 1.5 per cent, or USDollars 13.75 to Dollars 1,020.25 a tonne, as the market absorbed analysts' estimates that the cuts would this year remove about 110,000 tonnes of refined zinc and 74,000 tonnes of lead. Empresas Frisco in Mexico has suspended operations at its Real de Angeles zinc-lead-silver mine and Curragh Resources has stopped producing concentrates at its Faro mine in the Yukon. This follows recent reductions by MIM, Pasminco, Cominco and Noranda. Mr Neil Buxton, analyst at Metal Bulletin Research, suggested that the lead market had reached a turning point and prices, which had fallen much further than most people expected, had reached bottom. (On the LME, three-month lead closed at Pounds 283.25 a tonne last night, up Pounds 0.50.) Mine production cuts and the fact that new mines produced more zinc and less lead were causing a shortage of lead concentrate (an intermediate product). Lead smelters would have to cut production because they were running out of raw material - 'but whether this will take one month or six months I can't tell.' Mr Buxton said zinc smelters were just about breaking even and had shifted the burden of low prices on to the mines. He said the smelters were acting 'from short-term self-interest which will prolong the mutual agony.'</p>

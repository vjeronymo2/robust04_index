			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 22, 1993, the Department of the Interior received a petition, dated September 17, 1993, from David Hogan, Silver City, New Mexico; Peter Galvin, Silver City, New Mexico; the Greater Gila Biodiversity Project, Silver City, New Mexico; the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity, Phoenix, Arizona; and the Biodiversity Legal Foundation, Boulder, Colorado. The petitioners requested the Service to reclassify the spikedace ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Meda fulgida <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and loach minnow ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tiaroga cobitis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), from threatened to endangered. On November 10, 1993, the Service informed the petitioners that their correspondence had been accepted as a valid petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These 90-day and 12-month findings are based on published and unpublished biological and commercial information, inter- and intra-agency communications, and communications with experts. All information used in these findings is on file in the Service's Arizona Ecological Services State Office in Phoenix.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spikedace and loach minnow are two small minnows which inhabit isolated stretches of stream in the upper reaches of the Gila River basin in Arizona and New Mexico (Minckley 1973, Propst  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1986, Propst  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1988, Propst and Bestgen 1991, Rinne 1991). Their historic range included most of the Gila River basin; however, both species have undergone dramatic declines since the late 1800's. These declines were due to water developments such as impoundment, diversion, channelization, and groundwater pumping; to watershed degradation and erosion caused by activities such as livestock grazing, timber harvest, road building, and recreation; and to effects of the introduction and spread of nonnative fish species. Both species live in relatively fast flowing water in perennial stream stretches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spikedace are presently known only from isolated stretches of the Gila River, Grant and Catron Counties, New Mexico; Aravaipa Creek, Graham and Pinal Counties, Arizona; Eagle Creek, Greenlee County, Arizona; and the Verde River, Yavapai County, Arizona. Loach minnow are presently known only from isolated stretches of the Gila River, Grant and Catron Counties, New Mexico; Aravaipa Creek, Graham and Pinal Counties, Arizona; the East Fork and mainstem White Rivers, Navajo and Gila Counties, Arizona; the San Francisco and Tularosa Rivers and Dry Blue Creek, Catron County, New Mexico; and the Blue and San Francisco Rivers and Campbell Blue Creek, Greenlee County, Arizona.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The spikedace was listed as a threatened species on July 1, 1986, and the loach minnow was listed as a threatened species on October 28, 1986. Critical habitat was designated for both species on March 8, 1994. A threatened species is defined by the Act as a species ``which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.'' An endangered species is defined by the Act as one ``which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1991, the status of spikedace and loach minnow were reviewed as part of the 5-year review of the status of listed species as required by section 4(c)(2) of the Act. That review showed that the status of the two species had become more precarious over the previous five years due to substantial increases in threats. As a result, the Service found that both species met the requirements for endangered status. The Desert Fishes Recovery Team and the Arizona Game and Fish Department have recommended reclassification to endangered for both species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time that threats to the species are increasing, new genetic information suggests a need to preserve each of the fragmented populations of spikedace and loach minnow in order to maintain as much genetic diversity in the species as possible (Tibbets 1992). Four of the five remaining loach minnow populations have been subjected to genetic analyses and each appears to be distinctive. Genetic analyses on the four remaining spikedace populations indicate that each of the four populations is quite different, with the Verde River population being most distinct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Petition Findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reviewing the petition and all other pertinent information, the Service finds that the petition presents substantial information to indicate that reclassification to endangered may be warranted for spikedace and loach minnow. A positive 90-day finding generally requires that a status review be conducted on the petitioned species. However, as previously mentioned, a status review was conducted in 1991, resulting in a finding that endangered status is appropriate, but that higher-priority listing actions precluded the rulemaking process to reclassify the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Benefits to the spikedace and loach minnow from reclassification to endangered status would include recognition of the more precarious status of the species and increased penalties for conducting activities prohibited under section 9 of the Act. However, these benefits would be incremental to the protection under the Act already applied to these threatened species. This incremental protective increase is of lesser priority than providing protection to species with no current legal protection under the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOUNTAIN VALLEY FORFEITS 3 VICTORIES AFTER USING AN INELIGIBLE PLAYER  </P> <P> Fountain Valley High School has forfeited two nonleague football victories and  a Sunset League victory over Huntington Beach for using an ineligible player  under the student eligibility rules of the Huntington Beach Union High School  District.  </P> <P> Rob Dubar, a starting running back who was injured most of the season, was  ruled ineligible for failing to apply for a transfer when his family moved from  Fountain Valley to an apartment in Huntington Beach's attendance area before  the start of the 1989 season.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley forfeited nonleague victories over El Modena and Mater Dei and  a victory over Huntington Beach that the Barons were awarded when Huntington  Beach forfeited eight victories for using an ineligible player.  </P> <P> "It's sad, but funny," said Mike Henigan, Fountain Valley athletic director.  "Nobody won the Huntington Beach-Fountain Valley game. We ended up forfeiting  their forfeit."  </P> <P> Fountain Valley, which finished third in the Sunset League, saw its overall  record drop from 5-6 to 2-9 with the forfeitures. Fountain Valley finishes tied  for third with Westminster in the Sunset League at 2-3.  </P> <P> "The principal (Gary Ernst) at Huntington Beach told us about the violation,  and we notified the schools involved within an hour," Henigan said.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley had replaced Huntington Beach in the playoffs.  </P> <P> David Roman, Huntington Beach's starting right tackle, was ruled ineligible for  living with his older brother, Tony, while his mother remained a resident of  Maryland.  </P></p>

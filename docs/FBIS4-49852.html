			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Respectable Master of the House"] </F>   [Text] Today, this newspaper carried a report entitled  "Aspirations Under the Wings" about the progressive deeds of Li  Guangnan, who behaved as a master. The report was aimed at  prompting people to consider this question: What should we do,  as we too are masters?    Li Guangnan was born to a peasant family of the Korean  nationality at the foot of the Changbai Mountains. From the  parent generation's bitter experience of being enslaved by the  Japanese invaders and from modern China's experience of being  bullied, humiliated, and carved up by foreign powers, Li  Guangnan -- while still a student -- began to have patriotic  thoughts and to aspire to render service to his motherland.  After growing up and joining the armed forces, his patriotic  consciousness was further enhanced, and he acquired a stronger  sense of responsibility as a master. He often said: The Army  is ours, and the country is ours; if we do not build them up and  love them, who will do this? Such love for the motherland added  inexhaustible wisdom and strength to Li Guangnan in rendering  service to the motherland. He is an ordinary member of the  ground crew in the air force, and has received only junior  secondary education, but he never feels that he bears no  responsibility for the motherland because of his humble  position. He is deeply concerned about the destiny of the nation  and has a strong sense of urgency for the times while working  hard and selflessly at his own post and performing first-rate  work for China's regeneration.    Li Guangnan is a respectable and laudable master. To learn  from Li Guangnan, we should behave like him in making  painstaking efforts to study modern science and technology, and  to master the skills needed for rendering service to the  motherland. Like him, we should work selflessly at our own  posts, thus turning our patriotic enthusiasm and aspirations for  rendering service to the motherland into concrete action. Of  course, the most important point is that, like Li Guangnan, we  should love our socialist motherland. This is the ideological  base for establishing the master spirit and increasing the sense  of responsibility as a master. The party central leadership has  pointed out that the ideology of patriotism, socialism, and  collectivism should be the main theme in our society as a whole.  Singing the main theme loudly and carrying forward patriotism  are of great significance for boosting our national morale,  increasing our nation's rallying force, deepening reform,  expanding opening, and promoting the vigorous development of our  work in all fields.    At present, the reform in our country is developing in  depth.  Beyond any doubt, the patriotic spirit of the master should be  reflected in the great practice of participating in the reform.  We must give top priority to the overall interests of the  reform; correctly handle the relationship between the interests  of the state, the collective, and the individual; consciously  resist the influence of money worship, hedonism, and extreme  egoism. We should share the concern of the whole nation and  meet the urgent needs of the whole nation as masters, and should  understand the difficulties the reform faces and join hands in  overcoming such difficulties by offering constructive  suggestions and making positive efforts. In short, we should  take reform as our own duty; only thus can we be worthy of the  glorious title of the state's masters.</p>

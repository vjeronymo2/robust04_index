			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Mikhail Zotov and Valeriy Rekuta from Moscow Radio </F> Technical Plant; from the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] [Zotov] This half-empty hall once housed a unit for  the installation of electronics in missiles. Now Grundig color  television sets are being assembled here in a remote corner.  And although the Moscow Radio Technical Plant still does not  have a signboard, this once-secret military facility is not  secret any more.    In the kingdom of defense agencies everything is topsy-turvy  nowadays. More than 70 percent of the plant's output consists  of civilian goods and only 30 percent is military output. The  military output includes the renowned electronics for the  super-modern air defense missile complexes which are superior to  Western counterparts.    Incidentally, the plant, which is now a leasehold  enterprise,  could end the production of all military output without any  financial or legal liability even if this were to the detriment  of the country's defense capability. After all, there is still  no law on state orders. There are other reasons, too. So, for  example the plant received nothing from the sale to China of  several air defense systems apart from down-filled jackets and  some bedding which the workers immediately dubbed "foot cloths."    [M. Milovanov, Moscow Radio Technical Plant general  director,  identified by caption] We want to survive and we are doing our  utmost to ensure that we do. The plant management is constantly  in an impossible situation as a result of Defense Ministry  defaulting on payments; 1993 is drawing to a close and we are  still owed 7.352 billion rubles [R]. We in turn owe our  suppliers R1.5 billion.    [Zotov] The work force of this plant, which posseses unique  military technologies, is barely managing to get by thanks to  the production of own "Yunost" color television sets and the  assembly of German TV sets. It could be that they will usher in  the next New Year minus missile complexes, but in down-filled  jackets and with Grundig television sets.

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Iran calls for Nagorno-Karabakh arms embargo IRAN yesterday called on the United Nations to impose an arms embargo on Azerbaijan and Armenia to force the former Soviet republics to settle their bloody dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter reports from Nicosia. In a letter to UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati expressed concern at the growing fighting near Iran's border and called for a 'halt to arm shipments to the two sides from neighbours and big powers'. His call came a day after Turkey, Iran's neighbour and rival for influence in the Moslem former Soviet republics, asked the US to get involved in peace efforts. Meanwhile, in Armenia yesterday, dozens of heavily armed Armenian militants surrounded a former Soviet anti-aircraft missile base, killing two soldiers of the Commonwealth of Independent States and taking the commander hostage. The militants, who surrounded the base at Artik, near the Turkish border, were demanding the handover of heavy weapons, according to the CIS military command. Elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, violence continued in the month-long civil war in Georgia. An explosion in the town of Zugdidi, in the west of the republic , killed three policemen and injured several others. In the republic of Moldova yesterday, peace talks were due to start after a week of clashes between ethnic Russians and majority Romanian speakers in which at least 10 people have been killed. John Lloyd, in Baku, Azerbaijan, adds: Nationalist leaders in Azerbaijan yesterday stepped up the pressure on the interim government of the republic to dissolve parliament and to form a coalition government with a strong contingent of nationalists and former opposition figures. The aim of such a coalition would be to pursue a more active prosecution of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, hitting back at the Armenian forces after a string of reverses. Mr Niazi Ibragimov, deputy chairman of the Azerbaijani Popular Front - the focus for opposition nationalist forces - called for the dissolution of parliament and the passing of more power to the 50-strong National Council, which is balanced between the opposition and former communists.</p>

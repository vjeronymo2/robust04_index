			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin has begun a meeting with the heads of the republics  which are component parts of the Russian Federation. Opening  the meeting, he said, "The system of meetings with the republic  heads is being renewed".    According to the president, such meetings with republic  leaders should be held approximately "five to seven times a  year". He noted that Thursday's meeting is the first since the  adoption of a new constitution and the elections to the Federal  Assembly.    "Much has changed in the country in the past few months,  political stabilisation is gaining strength, the disastrous  state of dual-power has been overcome", Boris Yeltsin pointed  out. He also informed the local heads about his work with the  chairmen of the Federation Council and State Duma, saying that  there "have been no disagreements so far".    On the topic of the recent local elections in Russia, the  president noted that "the elections were valid in 61 federal  regions. In only 17 was voter turnout too low". He expressed  the hope that all the local elections would be held by the end  of the current year.</p>

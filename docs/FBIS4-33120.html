			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said on 27 May that  Brazil's participation in the UN Security Council is "legitimate  and effective."    Amorim noted: "It is of growing importance for all  countries,  not only the rich countries or those with nuclear weapons, to  participate in this council."    The minister participated on 27 May in the First National  Meeting of Strategic Studies at the Strategic Affairs  Secretariat (SAE)'s Strategic Studies Center.    The SAE-sponsored meeting's goal is to promote an exchange  among the country's think tanks involved in "strategy" affairs  and demonstrate the government's interest in the scattered  studies conducted in Brazil in this area today.    Representatives from public and private organizations and  universities participated in the meeting.</p>

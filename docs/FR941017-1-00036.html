This action is necessary to protect areas of biological importance to certain crab stocks and to reduce interference with seabird and marine mammal populations. It is intended to promote the objectives of the FMP. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be submitted by November 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments may be sent to Ronald J.

The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ) (Magnuson Act), and is implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 675 and 676. General regulations that pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action proposes regulations to implement Amendment 21a to the FMP. If approved, this amendment would prohibit the use of trawl gear in specified areas of the EEZ surrounding the Pribilof Islands. A description of, and reasons for, the proposed measures are presented below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fishing for groundfish using trawl gear is authorized in the waters off St. Paul, St. George, Walrus, and Otter Islands (Pribilof Islands area) under regulations at 50 CFR part 675. In addition to providing habitat for commercially important groundfish, the Pribilof Islands area provides the necessary habitat for blue king crab, juvenile groundfish, Korean hair crab, marine mammals, seabirds, and their prey species. The rocky benthic habitat immediately surrounding the Pribilof Islands area provides essential food resources and protection for juvenile crab and fish species, which are prey species for marine mammals and seabirds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS trawl surveys indicate that during 1975, the historic estimated abundance of blue king crab in the Pribilof Islands area decreased significantly. During 1980&hyph;1992, the abundance decreased from 106 million animals to 10 million animals, according to the estimates obtained from NMFS trawl surveys. Unlike other crab species, blue king crab populations do not extend uniformly across the Bering Sea shelf, but are found in isolated populations located in waters surrounding the Pribilof, St. Matthew, and St. Lawrence Islands. As a result of the decrease in crab abundance, commercial crab fisheries in the Pribilof Islands area have not been authorized since 1987. Continued trawling under the current FMP for groundfish in the Pribilof Islands area could jeopardize the recovery of depressed blue king crab stocks and the productivity of marine resources living in this habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pribilof Islands area contributes an essential food resource of prey species that allows for optimal foraging and breeding opportunities for marine resources dependent on the habitat in this area. Fish, crab, seabird, and marine mammal populations are dependent on the habitat that the Pribilof Islands area provides. Although sea lions and red-legged kittiwakes are listed as a threatened species and as a candidate for threatened species, respectively, this action would further protect these species. The northern fur seal is listed as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. During the breeding season, approximately two-thirds of the northern fur seal population, and an estimated 88 and 92 percent of red-legged kittiwakes and Alaskan thick-billed murre, respectively, breed in the Pribilof Islands area. The Pribilof Islands area also provides the rocky habitat necessary to protect fish and crab populations during their juvenile stages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1989, the Central Bering Sea Fishermen's Association initiated a proposal to establish areas closed to trawling in the Pribilof Islands area. The intent of this proposal was to protect this unique habitat and ecosystem so that it could contribute long-term benefits to the fisheries surrounding the waters of the Pribilof Islands area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At its meeting in September 1991, the Council requested that an analysis be prepared to identify those areas needing protection. The State of Alaska Department of Fish and Game prepared a draft EA/RIR for that proposal. The Pribilof Islands habitat conservation area was determined by the Council at its April 1992 meeting, based on an analysis of the distribution of crab and groundfish species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (2): Workers face pressure - Plans to reform the economy MANY PORTUGUESE are still nostalgic about the 1950s. It was a time when they were arguably the richer of the two countries on the Iberian peninsula. Bankers and government officials in Lisbon remember how cheap it used to be to visit Spain and shop there. Now, say many, the main relief after crossing into Spain is that they feel safer driving on the Spanish roads. That says more about Portuguese driving than it does about Spain's. But it is astonishing how quickly the world has turned. In Spain, GDP per head is now nearly 80 per cent of the European Community average while Portugal's struggles at around 56 per cent. For while General Franco, Spain's late dictator, opened up his economy to foreign invest- ors and visitors in the 1960s, Portugal's ruler, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, bankrupted his country by fighting hopeless colonial wars in Mozambique and Angola. Franco's democratic heirs inherited a fundamentally sound market economy in the mid-1970s. Salazar left behind him a poisoned economy which the country only began to tackle seriously in the 1980s. Not to labour the Iberian comparisons, Spain saw EC accession (at the same time) as a opportunity to spread its wings and show off to the rest of the world. Portugal saw it as a salvation. Indeed, the results have been impressive. The escudo has managed to maintain a remarkable degree of stability in spite of the monetary turmoil unleashed in Europe in the last few months. A con- fident centrist government, in its third term, has clung deter- minedly to a strong exchange rate to force domestic indus- tries to become more compet- itive. More recently, it pledged itself to full liberalisation of capital movements in an effort to force down interest rate margins in a banking system revitalised by privatisation. In banking alone, investment last year rose nearly 40 per cent, with some 500 new branches being opened around the country. Imports of machinery rose 30 per cent in 1988 and 40 per cent in 1989. Volkswagen and Ford have set Portuguese hearts racing with a planned Dollars 3bn joint investment to build 'space wagons' near Lisbon. In the meantime, unemployment is only 4 per cent, the current account is in surplus (just), inflation targets (designed not to be too precise) are largely being met and two of the EC economic and monet- ary union (EMU) convergence targets - holding the budget deficit to 3 per cent of GDP and public debt to below 60 per cent of GDP - are within a whisker of being achieved. But the worldwide economic slowdown has not passed Portugal by, which some people in and out of govern- ment think is no bad thing. Yet, handled correctly, that could be the excuse to begin a drive for true convergence and competitiveness. Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, the country's forceful finance minister, couches what is about to happen in the measured tones of all governments about to shake up the economy. '1992 should be looked at as the beginning of a multi-annual adjustment process,' he says. That means policies which analysts say inevitably lead to higher unemployment. The process has already begun, with the government quietly implementing a far- reaching reform of the public service. 'It is just not working very well,' says the finance minister. His 1993 budget, presented last month will force ministries to cut recurrent spending by 5 per cent and the government is taking a deter- mined stand, in wage talks with unions and employers, to keep wage rises to a minimum. 'We cannot go on with wages rising at four or five times the EC average,' says Mr Braga de Macedo. 'We have to enforce greater wage discip- line.' Lisbon's initial target in these talks is 5.5 per cent, which, if 1993 inflation turns out at the top of its 5 to 7 per cent target band, would mean a real wage cut. Needless to say, the unions are threatening to strike and the government - which uses these talks to set public sector pay as a guideline for the private sector - may be pushed further up. But the point is being made. And it is already being supported by a sharp reversal of the country's growth projections for this year from 3.5 per cent forecast at the start of the year to 2.5 per cent now. At the same time, exports to Portugal's biggest trading partner, Spain, are stagnating and made even more difficult by the 5 per cent devaluation of the peseta in September. Mr Miguel Namorado Rosa, chief economist at Banco Com- ercial Portugues, says he believes the 1993 inflation tar- get is too optimistic, especially as there is great pressure to devalue the escudo. 'We are just not a low inflation coun- try.' An inflation target of 5 to 7 per cent for 1993 would, he feels, be credible if consump- tion were flat. But the govern- ment is also forecasting robust GDP growth of 3 per cent. The government may be intent on using public investment - forecast to grow 12 per cent - to maintain growth but it will need to be careful to avoid falling into the same trap as Spain did when it rushed into large project spending after EC accession only to find itself paying much more than it had anticipated. Investors have begun demanding much higher yields on the debt Spain issues to finance its deficits. The Portuguese may be cushioned from this, though. Private savings are high  -21 per cent of disposable income. The government is also planning a big drive to streamline tax collection (and thus collect more) and it still hopes that its richer EC partners will approve, from next year, the financing of a 'cohesion' fund established in principle at the Maastricht summit last year to help fund national projects in the Community's poorer margins. Mr Braga de Macedo's hope, of course, is to converge with Europe, even nominally, and hold prices stable at the same time. He scoffs at suggestions that he needs a recession to do it even though recent European money market turmoil might have put the brakes on a gentle slide in Portuguese interest rates in the summer. But what cannot be known now is how much unemploy- ment the government will need to create to make the country competitive. Perhaps the better question is: what level of unemployment becomes a serious electoral threat? The potential for job cuts may be enormous as current figures disguise widespread underemployment. In the private sector, there seems little hope that hundreds of inefficient textile, shoe and leather goods indus- tries will ever survive serious international competition and the country's farms, which employ nearly 20 per cent of the working population (compared to 13 per cent in Spain, 15 per cent in Ireland and just 9 per cent in Italy) are a constant source of worry to Lisbon. Nevertheless, it is probable that a two or even three point rise in unemployment is sur- vivable politically, and the gov- ernment will be careful to make a great fuss about its increased spending on infra- structure, health and social programmes. 'We are reform- ists,' says the finance minister, 'and a reformist is never worried. He is always tranquil. There is no alternative to what we are doing.'</p>

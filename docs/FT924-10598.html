			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Cash control criticised at Civil Service catering body SERIOUS FINANCIAL irregularities in the Civil Service catering group Forward were criticised by the National Audit Office, the parliamentary watchdog, yesterday. Sir John Bourn, the auditor general, has qualified the group's accounts because of 'significant failures in financial control and management' which may have led to the misappropriation of up to Pounds 200,000 from its Pounds 30m turnover. Forward, with 1,300 employees, is by far the largest provider of catering to government departments and public bodies. It was converted to a commercial trading agency last year as a prelude to full privatisation, for which a date has yet to be fixed. The irregularities came to light this year, leading the Treasury to suspend Mr Roy Wheeler, Forward's chief executive, in July. Discrepancies at the Forward-run restaurant in Marsham Towers, London, precipitated an investigation that found 'possible malpractice'. Ernst and Young, the accountancy firm, was commissioned to examine Forward's operations. Its report - which led to Mr Wheeler's suspension - concluded that the caterers' financial control was seriously deficient, its management ineffective, and its balance sheet inadequate and possibly manipulated. Records were found to have been destroyed, with evidence of fictitious employees included on the payroll. Mr Barry Bloxham, Forward's acting chief executive, said the troubles were being tackled 'urgently'. The organisation is still trading, although it now faces stiff competition for its contracts, which are subject to competitive tender.</p>

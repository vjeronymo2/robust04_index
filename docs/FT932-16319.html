			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: GM names worldwide purchasing chief GENERAL Motors yesterday unexpectedly named Mr Richard Wagoner, its chief financial officer, to replace Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who quit as head of worldwide purchasing last month and joined Volkswagen in Germany. Mr Wagoner, 40, who was only named chief financial officer last November, will continue to hold that position as well as taking on Mr Lopez's responsibilities. The move surprised some analysts, who questioned whether Mr Wagoner would be able to devote sufficient time to the purchasing job, and noted that he had spent much of his career on the financial side of GM, rather than in manufacturing. Reform of the purchasing system - including pressuring suppliers outside and inside the company to cut prices - forms a crucial part of GM's drive to turn its lossmaking North American car operations back to profit. Mr Lopez is believed to have saved GM more than Dollars 1bn in costs during his 10 months in the job; an important element of his success was his obsessive, idiosyncratic and energetic nature. Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, said yesterday that daily staff operations of the finance group would be overseen by Mr Leon Krain, a corporate vice-president, allowing Mr Wagoner to focus immediately on his purchasing responsibilities. Chrysler, the smallest of the 'big three' Detroit car makers, announced last night it would be taking a Dollars 4.7bn after-tax charge in the first quarter for the adoption of a new standard of accounting for retirees health benefits. The charge will have no cash impact. All US companies are having to adopt the new accounting standard and Ford and GM have already announced much larger charges.</p>

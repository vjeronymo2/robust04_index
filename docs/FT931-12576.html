			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Polish coalition under fire despite signs of recovery: The IMF conditions are spurring unrest after three years of recession POLAND'S coalition government, led by Ms Hanna Suchocka, the prime minister, is facing a parliamentary challenge to its stringent, IMF-approved budget policies just as the Polish economy is showing signs of recovery after three years of reform-induced recession. Last year, for the first time since 1988, industrial production grew by 3.5 per cent. Were it not for a drought-reduced harvest the Gross Domestic Product would also have registered a gain. The bad news is that parliamentary opposition is holding up the government's effort to push through a 1993 draft budget which sets a ceiling of 5 per cent of GDP on the public sector deficit. Successive votes on public sector pay, housing and VAT rates have already added 16,000bn zloty (Pounds 653m) to the proposed 81,000bn zloty deficit target. The gap could widen further as deputies, eyes fixed firmly on future election prospects, seek to cut personal income tax rates and minimalise the government's planned pension savings. The stakes are high, as the government is tied to its deficit target by a letter of intent linked to a Dollars 660m (Pounds 426m) IMF standby loan. Securing the loan is required to trigger a further 20 per cut in Poland's Dollars 31.7bn official debt to western governments after an initial 30 per cent reduction in 1991. Failure to keep spending within agreed limits would require new negotiations, delaying both the official debt reduction process and talks on Poland's Dollars 13.3bn commercial bank debt with Mr Krzystof Krowacki, Poland's newly appointed debt negotiator. Talks were stalled for 18 months after the sacking of Mr Janusz Sawicki over a scandal involving illegal secondary-market Polish debt sales. Given these high stakes the government is considering two contingency plans. One is to demand a vote of confidence to force the disparate parliamentary opposition to approve the budget as originally drafted. The risk is that such a gamble could fail, leading to the fall of a government which appears to have no obvious successor, apart from President Lech Walesa, who periodically repeats that he is ready to take on reponsibility for direct government should he be called on. The second course would be to accept a higher deficit and then raise new revenues using new decree powers, backed by the president, which the government has prepared but parliament still has to approve. Ms Suchocka, a 46-year-old former law professor from Poznan, has already surprised observers by her success in holding together a seven-party coalition ranging from free-market liberals to right-wing nationalists and her own group, the moderate Democratic Union. Her nerve has already held through two big strikes, that of car workers last summer and the recent strike by 300,000 miners, and the government is sensitive to the need to involve workers and unions in the difficult decisions facing it. Worker unrest has been spurred by growing income differences, rising unemployment and a 4 per cent fall in average real wages last year. But lower wage costs helped Polish enterprises to raise exports to western markets and restrained the growth in imports. Export-led growth in turn helped to slow the rise in unemployment, which nevertheless climbed to over 2.5m by the end of the year. The government's response to shop floor unease has been to propose an 'Enterprise Pact' with the unions. This policy seeks to involve workers in the privatisation process and guarantees some worker participation in management, even in the private sector. One of the aims of the pact is to ease wage controls and the tax burden on state-owned enterprises and shift broad economic strategy decisions to a national tripartite commission representing unions, employers and the government. It remains to be seen whether the pact will convince public opinion, which remains sceptical, especially among the unemployed and those, mainly with jobs in the public sector, whose incomes have fallen. President Walesa, who retains his instinctive feeling for the popular mood, has warned that the country could experience an 'economic August', a reference to the mass strikes of August 1980 which gave rise to the Solidarity movement. The economic achievements of the last year however appear to belie such pessimism. Inflation dropped to 43 per cent last year from 60 per cent in 1991, productivity has risen by 12 per cent, and Poland registered a Dollars 734m trade surplus over the first 11 months. However, enterprise profitability remains low, capital spending has yet to recover and public sector industries remain deeply in debt. The biggest surprise is that rapid growth in the private sector has been accompanied by improved efficiency among the remaining 8,000 state-owned enterprises. This combination has led the World Bank to conclude that economic improvement has 'a solid microeconomic foundation and will be sustained' despite the relatively slow rate of foreign investment and delayed sales of state-sector enterprises.</p>

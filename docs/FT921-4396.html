			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Brokers association expected to disband THE Sterling Brokers Association (SBA), a City of London trade grouping, is expected to disband, after a meeting later this month to vote on the issue. Mr Tony Alwright, of Tullet &amp; Tokyo, who chairs the association, declined to comment further. However, it is widely expected that the SBA will come under the umbrella of the Foreign Exchange and Currency Deposit Brokers Association after being disbanded. A representative of the SBA sits on the Bank of England's joint standing committee on the money markets. However, the Foreign Exchange and Currency Deposits Brokers Association also has representation on the committee, so the role as a conduit between the Bank of England and the market could be maintained. According to brokers, the SBA, which represents a small sector of the industry with only around half a dozen big players, has 'no real teeth', since it has no regulatory powers. The Bank of England supervises brokers.</p>

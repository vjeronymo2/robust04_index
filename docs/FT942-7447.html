			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: German metals group faces new risk provisions Metallgesellschaft, the German metals, mining and industrial group at the brink of collapse in January after running up massive losses in oil futures trading via a New York subsidiary, will have to make further provisions. The group said last night it would have to cover newly-identified risks in the US. It refused to say how big the provisions would be. However, the group made clear they were needed to cover risks arising in respect of special contracts between MG Corp, the New York subsidiary which nearly caused Metallgesellschaft's downfall, and Castle Energy, a small US oil refinery. Further risks arose because of contracts under which MG Corp agreed to supply oil and other energy products to industrial customers in the US. Metallgesellschaft said it would fund the provisions via the sale of its entire 80 per cent stake in Buderus, an engineering company considered one of the jewels in the Metallgesellschaft crown. It will also have to dispose of Lehnkering Montan Transport company and the group's head office site in the centre of Frankfurt. Based on the DM1.5bn (Dollars 909m) market value of Buderus, these sales are likely to raise well in excess of DM1bn. The shares in Buderus will be placed via a consortium of banks in a way which ensures they are widely distributed, Metallgesellschaft said. These revelations, contained in a statement issued after Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board met yesterday, are likely to shock investors today. Shares in Germany's 14th largest industrial group have risen dramatically in recent weeks, reflecting confidence that the worst of the group's problems have been dealt with by January's DM3.4bn rescue package. The disclosure that the 80 per cent stake in Buderus, which has a 25 per cent market share in the German heating equipment market, will have to go is likely to prove especially surprising. In February, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, Metallgesellschaft's chief executive, said there were no plans to sell the company. Buderus last year made net profits of DM69m and had turnover of DM2.77bn. MG Corp's relationship with Castle Energy was characterised by a series of refining contracts, the most remarkable of which was MG Corp's agreement to pay Castle a fixed rate of Dollars 5 per barrel above the standard market price for the benchmark west Texas intermediate crude oil to the year 2000.</p>

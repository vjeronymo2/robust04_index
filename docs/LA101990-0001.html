			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MRS. KEATING'S PLEA FOR HER JAILED HUSBAND  </P> <P> It is now 18 months since many of us investors found out that we have lost  $30,000, $40,000 or $50,000 through fraudulent representation by Keating.  </P> <P> First, I must say that Mrs. Keating is lucky she still has a husband; many of  us investors do not. We meddle along financially and investment-wise hoping  that what we do have will last for our lifetime.  </P> <P> Mrs. Keating, "good solid citizens" do not cheat other citizens out of their  life savings. Yes, I do believe you are very naive. If Charlie were "a loving,  caring and honest individual," I would still have my $30,000 investment intact  and earning interest. I wouldn't be worried about my future.  </P> <P> JEANNE MOSER  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy and Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China's top man on Hong Kong affairs yesterday  leveled a double-barrelled attack on Britain, criticising the  British side for moving "backwards" on democracy and "acting  like a child" in handling airport financing. Lu Ping of the  State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office made the  remarks to Hong Kong deputies at the National People's Congress  (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  (CPPCC).    He set out a rough schedule for the early months of the  first  Special Administrative Region government and legislature. There  would be no "through-train" arrangement for legislators elected  in 1995 to stay on, and the first SAR legislature would be set  up at the end of 1997 as preparation for the elections and  polling would take about six months. Members of Legco and  district organisations elected in 1994/95 would probably be  excluded by China's version of the Election Committee to return  10 legislators. Their places would be taken up by the delegates  to the NPC and CPPCC. The single-seat, single-vote election  method was not preferred, as it was a "backward step" in  democracy. The Preliminary Working Committee would have no say  in the selection of candidates for the first chief executive, as  the group was only helping with preparations. Neither the NPC  Standing Committee nor the chief executive would impose  legislation on the SAR.    The Chinese proposal on the composition of the Election  Committee was in stark contrast to Britain's position during the  failed Sino-British talks and the electoral bill being  considered by the Legislative Council. Britain had asked that  NPC and CPPCC delegates who were not elected by the people of  Hong Kong, be excluded from the committee. The electoral bill  tabled earlier this month proposed an Election Committee  consisting entirely of directly elected members of the district  boards.    China has yet to fix the size of the committee, but its  proposal would mean that the pro-China figures would have at  least a quarter of the votes in the committee, which is to  return 10 legislators in 1997. Beijing has proposed that the  committee be modelled along the lines of the 800 strong  committee stipulated in Annex I of the Basic Law for the  selection of the first chief executive. Thus, the committee  would consist of an equal number of members from the industrial,  commercial and financial sectors; professionals, labour, social  services, religious and other sectors, as well as the members of  the Legislative Council, representatives from the district-based  organisations and deputies to the NPC and CPPCC.    Due to the collapse of the talks, the last sector would  called "former politicians", including mainly local delegates to  the NPC and CPPCC, Mr Lu said. Mr Lu said the single-seat,  single-vote election method would reduce the size of the  constituency as the SAR legislature heads for more directly  elected seats. "This is not (a method) to promote democracy, it  is a backward step," he said. "Imagine when such a small area as  Hong Kong is divided into 60 geographical constituencies, the  size (of the constituency) will get smaller and smaller while  the number of voters will become fewer and fewer." Hong Kong  people had proposed the "double-seat, single-vote" method, and  proportional representation, both of which would be considered  carefully, he said.    Mr Lu made no specific reference to the Government's fourth  financing plan for the new airport, but cited three sets of  funding proposals which contained billions in debt. "They must  be kidding. They just cannot act like a child. It doesn't make  sense," he said. "We are not barring any discussion on the level  of debts (that exceeds the five billion ceiling). But that  cannot be too large. We thought that every thing would be fine  after the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). You  [the British side] can go ahead if you can stick to the  agreement. But later they told us the financing package has  greatly exceeded the provisions in the MOU. At first it was  HK$70 billion. Are they kidding? You (the British side) are  not a child. How can we accept it? How can you raise loans  from banks if the future government has no liability for the  debts. Will you give them loans, Huang?" Mr Lu jokingly asked  Huang Diyan, head of the Bank of China in Hong Kong. "That's  creating trouble again."    Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang yesterday dropped a  strong hint that Britain was ready to make further concessions  on the airport financing package. Although Britain had already  addressed all the Chinese concerns with the latest financing  proposal, Mrs Chan said, they were still happy to address new  Chinese concerns to pave the way for an early meeting to strike  a deal. "And it seems sensible to me that the sooner we can sit  down to talk about this and try to address them (their  concerns), the better it is for everyone. We do need to move  ahead quickly on this airport," she said. "I am not quite sure  what Mr Lu means when he refers to a gap," she said.</p>

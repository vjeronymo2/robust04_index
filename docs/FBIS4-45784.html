			<p>BFN     [Summary] Almaty has a great chance of becoming one of the  most polluted capitals in the world in the near future. This  sad fact was stated by Bulat Yesekin, the head of the city  directorate for ecology and bioresources in an interview with  our correspondent. The state has not allocated any money for the  improvement of Almaty's ecology either in the current or last  year. Even the external budgeting fund for protection of  nature, which used to finance several important programs, will  be used by the government for other purposes.    The city needs new roads and traffic controls because the  number of cars in the capital increases annually by a third.  The quality of gas leaves much to be desired. The life of  catalysts, which were used to purify car exhausts, expire very  quickly nowadays. The city has two power engineering units that  are very unsafe ecologically.    The president of the republic issued an edict last year on  urgent measures for the development of Almaty, in conformity  with which the Ministry of Power Engineering and Fuel Resources  was to provide its Almaty enterprises with low-ash coal and  low-sulphur fuel oil, but the only thing that the ministry has  done is to persuade the government to set flexible norms of air  pollution. This has only worsened the situation.    The city and the oblast do not have special sites for  storing  toxic waste. The recycling of garbage needs improvement.    These problems become even more topical in view of the  mountains surrounding the city. Our capital has no natural  ventilation. Currently, Almaty leads as a city with the most  polluted air in the republic, ranking second to Leninogorsk,  which is the largest industrial center. It is not by chance  that the population in Almaty ranks second to no one in the  number of diseases of the respiratory, cardio-vascular, nervous,  and urino-genital systems. Their health is also affected by the  fact that the soil in the city and subsoil waters are noxious.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA: IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> CIGARETTE BLAMED FOR FIRE THAT KILLED 4  </P> <P> Fire officials blame a smoldering cigarette for a fire that killed a suburban  family of four. Ironically, Ernest Troutman, 22, and his wife, Brenda, 22, had  taken down the smoke detector from their upstairs hallway just a few days  earlier and had failed to put it back, said Sacramento County Fire Marshal  Michael Dobson. The couple and their sons, John, 4, and Steve, 22 months, were  asleep when fire broke out in a living room chair of their two-story apartment  in Rancho Cordova. "They never had a chance," Dobson said.  </P></p>

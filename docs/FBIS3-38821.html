			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>   [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd spoke tonight of a  "turning point" in attitudes towards the bloody war in Bosnia  because of Saturday's [5 February] street market massacre in  Sarajevo.    He said the balance of "risks and benefits" of an allied air  strike to halt the carnage was now changing.    But, after talks between European Union foreign ministers,  he  said it would be "irresponsible" to take a military decision.    "These are not questions for diplomats but for soldiers. It  is for NATO now. NATO governments have to get it right."    He was speaking after the Prime Minister called for  immediate, effective and "more muscular" action to halt the  bombardment of civilians in Sarajevo.    John Major believes that action in the wake of the atrocity  which killed 68 people cannot wait for an overall settlement of  the civil war in the former Yugoslavia.    Mr Hurd had earlier endorsed an EU declaration expressing  "revulsion" at the brutal shelling of civilians and calling for  an early meeting of NATO ambassadors to consider the next step.    "The aim should be to bring about the immediate lifting of  the siege of Sarajevo, using all the means necessary, including  the use of air power."    The Foreign Secretary insisted the declaration was a step  forward after last month's NATO statement reaffirming the allies  readiness to use air strikes.    But there was no agreement today on French demands for an  ultimatum to be delivered to the warring factions -- pull your  heavy arms out of Sarajevo or face air strikes in 30 days.    Mr Hurd said the EU was not issuing any ultimatums today.  NATO would go into the "specifics" and come up with proposals.  There would need to be further consultation with the United  Nations Secretary-General and a final decision would be taken by  the governments of the 16 NATO countries.    Mr Hurd said it was a question of re-assessing the risks and  balances of military intervention.    "What we have asked NATO to do, in the light of arguments  and  information we don't have here today, is to strike the balance  anew. Up to now that balance has been against, but in my mind  the balance is moving."    Mr Hurd repeated his insistence that any use of force should  be "forward looking."    He went on: "It should not simply be retaliatory. It should  be aimed at actually improving the present situation. The test  of the use of force is whether it would do more good than harm,  that is a test which NATO will have to apply. Clearly this does  bring nearer a decision...to use force."    Mr Hurd said the lack of exact proof about the origins of  Saturday's devastating mortar bomb did not alter the fact that  the carnage was brought about because of the way the Serbs have  been harassing Sarajevo.    "They are no longer in a position to persuade the world of  the merits of their case."    Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind will also discuss tougher  action against the warring factions with the United Nations  military chief Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose in Bosnia  today and report back to the Prime Minister.    UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has asked NATO to  prepare for possible air strikes against artillery positions in  and aournd Sarajevo.    Representatives of NATO's members are set to meet in  Brussels  on Wednesday to discuss the request.    [Mr Hurd said the risks still had to be weighed up before  any  ultimatum could be approved or issued -- the risks to UN troops  on the ground, the risks to the continuation of the humanitarian  effort and questions about targeting.    He commented: "Lifting the siege is a worthwhile objective.  There is an overwhelming feeling now that this has to be  attempted, that the balance of risk and benefit has changed,  that proposals which when tested before were found wanting need  to be tested again with a view if possible of putting them into  effect."    British Government officials made it clear tonight that air  strikes would not go ahead if the military planners considered  the risks of failure too great, or that available targets were  inappropriate.]</p>

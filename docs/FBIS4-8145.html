			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Socialist Party Deputy Chairman Namik Dokle </F> by Erion Brace; place and date not given: "Fatos Nano's Sentence  Symbolizes the Violations of Human Rights, Press Freedom, and  the Independence of the Judiciary"]    [Text] [Dokle] The Socialist Party [PS] expected such a  sentence, and it does not matter whether it is of 12, 14, 11, or  seven years, because it is a political decision issued by what  Dritero Agolli has rightly called the supreme staff of state  policy, and is without legal grounds. It is a verdict that  conflicts with Albanian public opinion, with the opinion of the  European Parliament and of the Interparliamentary Union, and the  motion for a resolution proposed by deputies of the  Parliamentary Assembly. It is thus a verdict issued by the  Democratic Party [PD] in a tight fix, in an attempt to recoup  what it has gradually been losing since 22 March [1992  elections]. This is a disaster not only for the PD, but for all  Albania and for the solution of Albania's problems, which cannot  be settled by political trials but only by wise government for  the people, genuine democracy, tolerance, and cooperation and  understanding among the political forces. The PD normally makes  comparisons with the past when such things are mentioned.    Indeed, when one compares society today with totalitarian  society, one cannot fail to notice many improvements, but one  cannot make such comparisons. Comparisons should be made with  the kind of society we want to create, with the principles of  democracy, and the experience of European democracies today. In  this sense, there are extraordinary violations of human rights,  press freedom, and the independence of the judiciary. Fatos  Nano's sentence precisely symbolizes these violations.    To sentence Fatos Nano means to sentence the free press; to  sentence Fatos Nano means to sentence political pluralism; to  sentence Fatos Nano means to sentence democracy; sentencing  Fatos Nano means that the unemployed will remain out of work for  a longer time. People on welfare will remain on welfare, and  will then lose it. What do I mean here? I mean that the PD and  its government, instead of tackling the extraordinary economic  problems, are politicizing the economy and, being unable to  solve its problems, are involving themselves in trials such as  that of Fatos Nano.    Of course, the length of the sentence is quite unimportant  to  the PS. What is important for us is how long the 900 days until  the new elections that Mr. Berisha has announced will last. We  think that Albania must hold early elections as soon as possible  in order to realize the aspirations of those students who first  shouted, "Let us lead Albania to Europe" and "Let us lead  Albania to democracy." When Albania sets out on this path, it  will not have political prisoners such as Fatos Nano or any  other politician.    [Brace] What political action will you take?    [Dokle] Of course, we do not work in spurts, but have  concentrated political activities in every field. As I said  before, the sentencing of Fatos Nano means the sentencing of the  democratic path in Albania, the violation of human rights, and  the violation of the independence of the judiciary. Our future  work will therefore consist of a struggle for the respect of  human rights and basic freedom, because Aleksander Frangaj and  Martin Leka have been sentenced alongside Fatos Nano, and also a  struggle to restore the lost independence of the organs of the  judiciary. It is not simply the problem of one Fatos Nano, but  that Fatos Nano symbolizes something. He symbolizes the scope  for democracy in Albania, and the PS's struggle to defend Fatos  Nano symbolizes this party's struggle in the defense of fragile  Albanian democracy.    [Brace] Since you spoke about symbols, you mentioned that  Shefqet Beja was the first deputy to oppose the totalitarian  methods of the old regime, and that Fatos Nano was the first  deputy to oppose the totalitarian methods of Berisha's regime.  Shefqet Beja and Fatos Nano are brothers in a single democracy.  How would you comment further?    [Dokle] It is true that this trial, which lasted one month  and produced its verdict today, reminds you precisely of the  conviction of the earlier deputy in the years immediately after  World War II, because he was the first deputy to oppose the  totalitarian tendencies of the new Albanian state. Fatos Nano  was the first Albanian deputy to oppose the totalitarian  tendencies of Berisha's regime. These tendencies were  highlighted in the resolution of the European Parliament, which  explicitly states: "While the totalitarianism of the past  regime has been dealt a heavy blow, there is a temptation toward  authoritarianism that seriously imperils pluralism and the  development of democratic processes in Albania." This trial  resembled those of the past, and to my mind only the portrait on  the wall was missing, because in other respects this trial was  the spitting image of those that went before. What were the  similarities? For example, Mr. Bendo was the legal master of  ceremonies, and his entire verdict was rescued by the testimony  of Adil Carcani. He purposely forgot that Adil Carcani was the  man who, when the students asked him to remove the name of Enver  Hoxha from the university, steadfastly refused, and was  apparently obliged to sign the instruction by an order. Agim  Bendo takes this man as a witness, a man who amazingly seems to  have known nothing about the aid coming to Albania at that time.  However, the problem lies deeper, and is not simply that of an  individual. In Albania, the 1976 Constitution has been  abrogated, but, in the absence of a new constitution, the Civil  Code, Penal Code, and Penal Procedure Code all stem from the  Stalinist 1976 Constitution, and everything that takes place is  conducted in a totalitarian way. This is the greatest evil,  because political instructions and orders from above take  priority, rather than legal evidence, the evidence of a witness,  and the confrontation or arguments.    [Brace] Since you mentioned orders from above, do you think  that Berish kept his promise of an open and transparent trial,  with an independent verdict?    [Dokle] This promise, i.e. that Fatos Nano's trial would be  open and transparent, was broken when there was a telephone call  to Mr. Berisha about a delicate matter connected with the Nano  trial, and when the lawyer Sanxhaku, who was to travel to Paris,  was held by the police under an order from above.    I think that the trial was open but not transparent. It was  open because it was held in open court, but this trial lacked  transparency. It suffices to mention the fact that, in Fatos  Nano's defense session, the prosecutor's case was broadcast is  full, and Judge Bendo's verdict was also filmed in full today,  while not even 1 percent of Fatos Nano's defense was carried by  the radio and television, even when one knows that Fatos Nano  remained a deputy enjoying full rights until the day of the  verdict. However, the organs of justice and finally the court  systematically denied him this right and others that the law  guarantees.</p>

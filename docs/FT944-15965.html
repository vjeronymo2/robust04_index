			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Long View: Basildon misses out For the battle-hardened commentator on Britain's financial and economic affairs, the news seems just too good to be true. This week, underlying retail price inflation fell to a bare 2 per cent, the lowest since 1967 while, coincidentally, unemployment figures showed a continuing fall, reflecting an economic growth rate which may be close to 4 per cent. An unexpected export boom is, meanwhile, shrivelling the balance of payments deficit. The financial markets have certainly decided that they overdid the gloom temporarily in September. In the gilt-edged market, fixed interest yields have been falling while the real yields on index-linked gilts have scarcely changed - a sign that inflationary fears are receding. Indeed, powerful deflationary forces continue to grip the western economies (although inflation is not dead - it has just moved to Russia, where the rouble has plunged against the dollar and shopkeepers were reported to be writing up imported food prices by 50 per cent on Wednesday). In the UK, however, you have to be some kind of monetarist nutter fretting about M0 - which is rising at a slightly worrying 7.1 per cent year-on-year  -to be especially troubled about inflation. In fact, annual inflation has probably now bottomed out: wholesale raw material prices are rising at a more vigorous 5.7 per cent and it will be hard to repeat last year's trick of a stand-still in retail prices between September and February, so year-on-year inflation will tend to edge up. But the broad money measure, M4, is growing at only 4.7 per cent, so there is absolutely no prospect that any acceleration of inflation will be of great significance. No wonder Bank of England governor Eddie George was in a frustrated frame of mind this week when he spoke out against the pessimism of the financial markets - which appear to be expecting base rates and inflation to jump. That could have been an implied hint that interest rates will not rise any further this year. Yet, British economic management, for all its glow of achievement, is still a long way from becoming respectable. It is, after all, only just over two years since the ignominious exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. Since then, more by luck than judgment, the government has achieved the first half of a brilliant economic strategy. This was to trigger a highly successful devaluation, which has stimulated economic recovery without generating inflation. There is, however, a second stage of the transformation to be achieved, because the British economy remains seriously distorted. The outsized public sector deficit, a legacy from the recession and the public spending bonanza which won the 1992 election, is falling but is still likely to be about 5 per cent of GDP in the present financial year. The counterpart to that heavy public sector borrowing is the build-up of large surpluses in the private sector. The company sector, for instance, ran a financial surplus of Pounds 9.5bn in the first half of 1994, while the corresponding surplus for the personal sector was Pounds 10.8bn. The recent benign trends in the economy have depended upon restraint in the private sector's readiness to spend its wealth - aided, of course, by the higher personal taxes which are redressing the imbalances only gradually. All the same, a spending spree could yet give the economy a push along its familiar path towards inflation and a balance of payments crisis. Two factors seem important in restraining the personal sector. One is the continuing high level of unemployment - despite the overall decline from the peak - and the unusually high levels of insecurity in a hire-and-fire economy. The second is the chronic sickness of the housing market, which appears to have been dealt a nasty blow by the half-point rise in mortgage rates. According to the Halifax building society, house prices, after their attempt at recovery starting last winter, are now back to 1993 levels and are unlikely to pick up again before next spring. September house buying and selling activity, reflected in the Corporate Estate Agents' index was 5 per cent down on the same month last year. There is a positive way of looking at this: it might just go to show what an inflationary disaster the politically- motivated over-stimulation of the housing market has been for the British economy over 30 years. Some of the last subsidies and distortions are being removed (mortgage interest tax relief will be restricted to 15 per cent next April) and demographic factors are turning negative. So, we can hope that future economic growth will no longer necessarily lead to a credit bubble and consumer boom focused upon house prices and equity release (that is, mortgage money spent on consumer goods). Symbolically, the Nationwide building society has just sold 300 loss-making estate agencies for Pounds 1 the lot. Whether Basildon Man - that barometer of the nation from Essex - will see the positive side of this, as his prospect of escaping the negative equity trap retreats for another year or two, is another matter entirely. This is not the way the Tories won four elections in a row. They may soon worry that it is not the way they will win the next one. But if this economic upturn is to stay steady and well-balanced, George and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke will have to keep the housing market clamped down. Arguably, that was the primary aim of last month's interest rate rise. Clarke could calculate, however, that surely there would be no harm in a modest house price boomlet in, say, late 1995 and 1996. He will also want to cut personal taxes ahead of the next general election. Such manoeuvres would not help George to coax the money market and gilt-edged yield curves into shapes which he might regard as reasonable. But at least veteran columnists would find themselves back in familiar territory.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At their monthly meeting today, the Maronite bishops  stated that the continuing detentions and investigations since  the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church have done nothing to  reassure the public. They said that the focus is shifting from  the Sayyidat al-Najat Church file to other files, that this  crime has been removed from official attention, and that it has  been used as a means for political rather than criminal trial.    The Maronite bishops denounced what they called the pursuit  of many youths, which may harm Lebanon's reputation. They  stressed that media freedom is the basis of freedoms. They  noted that the issuing of the prospective media law will be a  healthy sign if it guarantees freedom of expression. They  called on officials to show serious attention to the people's  economic difficulties.</p>

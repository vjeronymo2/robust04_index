			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Accounting board retreats over asset securitising changes ACCOUNTING regulators in the UK have backed down on proposed rules that could have stopped banks and companies from securitising assets. However, the proposals from the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) still contain rules which some claim will put UK institutions at a disadvantage when trying to sell asset-backed bonds, and which could make it impossible to securitise credit card receivables. The ASB proposed last year that all securitised assets - where a bank or other entity passes assets to a special purpose vehicle, which then issues bonds against them - should remain on the originator's balance sheet, removing a significant attraction of such arrangements. The proposal caused particular problems for banks, since under EC rules they are assessed for capital adequacy purposes on all the assets that appear on their balance sheets. Yesterday, the ASB announced a change which, while still requiring companies to record securitised assets on their balance sheets, would allow them to show also the amount of non-recourse finance linked to the assets. This would leave them with a net asset figure reflecting only the residual risk left with the company from a securitisation. The ASB said it had received 60 submissions from interested parties, which had indicated strong views both for and against its first proposal. Barclays and National Westminster, whose securitisation plans had been thrown into doubt by the original ASB proposal, welcomed the change. Mr Malcolm Veale, head of securitisation at NatWest, said that the new approach would also make it easier for listed companies which have considered securitising their assets but been put off by the accounting treatment. However, the ASB's proposal would still require most issuers to show 10 per cent of the value as net assets on their balance sheets. This reflects the option that issuers usually retain to buy back the bonds when the amount outstanding shrinks to less than 10 per cent of the amount first issued, thereby reducing their administration costs. Also, the proposals for the way bonds backed by credit card receivables should be repaid will make it more cumbersome to administer such issues.</p>

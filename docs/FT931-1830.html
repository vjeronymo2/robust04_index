			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Business Law: Crime and the City solution - The American approach to tackling market misconduct may not work in the UK A central theme of the debate in the UK on reform of long fraud trials has been whether more white-collar 'offences' should be taken out of the criminal justice system and dealt with by City of London financial regulators. Advocates of making greater use of the administrative and regulatory regimes for tackling market misconduct base their case on the apparent success that the US has enjoyed in recent years with such an approach. However, research published last week by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, chaired by Lord Runciman, casts doubt on the benefits to be gained from adopting similar methods in the UK. The study, the first large-scale review of serious fraud since the 1986 Roskill Fraud Trials Report, concludes that there is considerable doubt in the City and elsewhere about whether self-regulatory organisations would have taken disciplinary action in recent high-profile cases, such as Blue Arrow and Guinness, unless put under political pressure. The report concedes, however, that there have been some cases, or parts of prosecutions, which could have been dealt with outside the criminal justice system. The author of the report, Professor Michael Levi of Cardiff University, also casts doubt on the notion that the US approach has been measurably better at tackling white-collar crime than the UK system. Allied to the suggestion that greater use should be made in the UK of regulatory bodies when dealing with market 'offences' is the notion that the UK has too many overlapping regulatory bodies and that some agency equivalent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission is needed to reduce inter-organisational rivalry, which may allow some white-collar 'offences' to slip through the net. Prof Levi points out, however, that the perceived superiority of the SEC when it comes to dealing with market misconduct is largely because it is underpinned by an extensive edifice of stock exchange and state securities regulators. Indeed, because most securities dealing is done under state jurisdiction rather than federal, most official action in the US is taken by state regulators, rather than by the SEC. In 1989, for example, the 1,258 state personnel involved in regulation initiated a total of 3,678 enforcement actions, including 335 criminal proceedings resulting in 253 convictions. This compares with 310 actions taken by the SEC over the same period, including less than a dozen criminal prosecutions initiated as a result of SEC referral. The reputation of the SEC was built in part on the spectacular junk-bond insider-dealing prosecutions of Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken in the late 1980s. But it should not be forgotten that for over two years before these successes the SEC had made 20 failed attempts at investigations into what turned out to be Levine's insider trades. It was an anonymous letter from Venezuela to Merrill Lynch, via the firm passing the file on to the SEC, that finally led to the successful prosecution of Levine. This in turn triggered the wave of plea-bargaining with him and Boesky which led eventually to Michael Milken. The fact that the UK insider-dealing prosecutions have produced nothing of an even remotely comparable status may be due to any number of reasons. It may show that the UK system is badly designed, or that such offences are inherently unprosecutable, or that no such important figures are involved in Britain. But it is difficult to say that an SEC-style system in Britain would have produced such spectacular results. For many people the SEC's attraction lies in its ability to combine civil and administrative remedies and the use of 'Wells submissions' - an informal bargaining process between the SEC and the 'accused' designed to filter cases which should not proceed to criminal prosecution. The ability to freeze assets held in America and overseas and to fine 'offenders' vast sums - such as the Dollars 250m fine imposed on Salomon Brothers for breach of the US Treasury bond auction rules (compare that with the largest UK insider-dealing fine to date of Pounds 25,000) - certainly has superficial attractions. But the US system is not without its critics. The American Bar Association has accused the SEC of using administrative actions as a way of evading constitutional safeguards for the accused and winning cases which they could not hope to prove to a criminal standard of proof. The failure of a number of recent securities fraud prosecutions in the US suggests that courts and juries are also beginning to react against the whole approach to tackling market misconduct. Prof Levi's point is that none of these facts or observations 'prove' the superiority of the administrative/regulatory approach over the criminal process or vice versa. If the UK was to move towards a regulatory approach to market misconduct it would need to be sure that a number of conditions would be met. Regulators would have to be able to show that they are capable of working more quickly, cheaply and fairly than the criminal courts. They would have to show they could handle the sort of heavyweight cases such as Blue Arrow that the SFO has been criticised by some people for prosecuting. The government would also have to be sure that the sanctions available to them were sufficient to satisfy the public that disciplinary action was not a soft option and that the regulatory bodies had the political will to act against leading corporate and professional figures. Prof Levi says it is difficult to be confident of any of these things. In particular he says it is hard to see which cases dealt with recently by either the fraud investigation group of the Crown Prosecution Service or by the Serious Fraud Office could plausibly have been dealt with by disciplinary means, although some complex parts involving market practice might usefully have been hived off. Many securities cases involve theft of assets and it would be a very big step to take them out of the courts. Even if people in the City agreed that something was 'a regulatory breach rather than a crime for gain, the public might not see it in quite the same light', he says. These views are echoed by Mr George Staple, director of the SFO. Writing recently in the Modern Law Review, Mr Staple asks whether it would be right for someone alleged to have committed fraud to go before a self-regulatory disciplinary tribunal which had no power to send him to prison and without the public opprobrium which attaches to being found guilty in a criminal court. 'Most people would take the view that the criminal justice system could not possibly abdicate responsibility for dealing with serious criminal conduct of this kind,' he said. There is a further problem with placing greater emphasis on the regulatory process - what to do with people such as Mr Roger Levitt, head of the collapsed Levitt Group, and Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck, both of whom are due to stand trial in September and who are not required to be members of any authorised body. Clearly it would be wrong for the method of dealing with those accused of white-collar offences to be determined by whether they belong to a regulatory body. The Royal Commission's views on long fraud trials will not be known until the summer. But it already seems clear that the scope for taking more white-collar offences out of the criminal justice system is limited.</p>

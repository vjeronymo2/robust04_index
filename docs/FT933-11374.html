			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs sector busy Drugs group Wellcome surged on news that it is to set up a joint venture with the US pharmaceutical group Warner-Lambert to market over-the-counter (OTC) versions of some of its top-selling prescription drugs. The US company, which specialises in OTC products, also unveiled a similar arrangement with Glaxo, although the longer development time for the particular products meant the latter's shares rose less sharply. They finished 10 ahead at 558p. Wellcome jumped 31 to 696p in heavy volume of 4.5m. While pharmaceutical analysts said the development was an important strategic move for the group, they added that it did not remove the underlying problems which have seen the shares underperform the market in recent months.

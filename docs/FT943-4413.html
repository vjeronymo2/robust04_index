			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Japan's trade union king-maker resigns Japanese politics yesterday lost an influential behind-the-scenes builder of coalitions when the head and founding father of the main trade union movement resigned. Mr Akira Yamagishi, 65, cited health reasons for his unexpected decision to step down as head of Rengo, the 8m-member trade union federation. Rengo is the most powerful supporter of the left-wing Social Democratic party, a member of the government coalition. Yet the union group has been in upheaval since the Socialists, led by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, a former union official, formed a government 2 1/2 months ago with the left's traditional opponent, the conservative Liberal Democratic party. Mr Kozo Igarashi, the Socialist chief cabinet secretary, yesterday voiced regret at Mr Yamagishi's retirement. Mr Yamagishi, a moderate trade union official throughout his career, became the most important figure in Japan's labour movement by increasing its influence in the traditionally closed circuit of business, government and political elite. He was instru-mental in bringing together private and public sector unions to form Rengo five years ago and is close to Mr Murayama and the moderate leadership of the Socialist party. As such, Mr Yamagishi was an influence in the Socialists' decision last weekend to scrap their traditional extreme pacifist policies to fall less out of line with the LDP on defence and foreign affairs. The policy switch has angered the left wing of both the Socialist party and Rengo, possibly a factor in Mr Yamagishi's resig-nation. He began a campaign to unify opposition parties in 1992 and played an important part in the creation of the eight-party coalition which succeeded last summer in pushing the LDP out of government for the first time in nearly four decades. However, Mr Yamagishi has never fulfilled his ambition of uniting the SDP with the Democratic Socialist party, a moderate offshoot of the original Socialists also supported by Rengo.</p>

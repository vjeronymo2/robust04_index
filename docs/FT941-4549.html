			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shephard backs call for poultry aid Mrs Gillian Shephard, the UK agriculture minister, is pressing the European Commission to allow poultry farmers in the European Union interim relief on grain prices to make up for the loss of export subsidies as part of the deal on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'I don't see any reason why we shouldn't help the industry bridge the gap between now and cereal prices coming down in the next two to three years,' she told a House of Commons select committee of MPs yesterday. Poultry producers receive no price support from Brussels but must buy their grain at artificially-high European Union prices. In the past they received export subsidies on sales outside the EU to compensate for high grain prices. Those export subsidies will be cut as part of the Gatt deal with the 600,000 tonnes of poultry meat eligible for the subsidy in 1993 falling to 291,000 tonnes by 2000. In place of the subsidies, producers are pushing to be allowed to buy world market grain to feed birds that will be exported. This will continue for several years until EU grain prices come closer to world levels as a result of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. The initiative has the backing of the French and British governments and Mrs Shephard said it was a very 'sensible' way of helping the industry. Mrs Shephard urged producers to improve their marketing and tackle the export market as a way of improving the 'unacceptably' wide UK trade deficit in poultry meat which had grown from Pounds 62m in 1988 to Pounds 194m in 1992. She was sympathetic to concerns from the industry that producers were being burdened with tighter enforcement of EU regulations than in other countries and acknowledged the need for a 'lighter hand'. However, she also stressed that the British public was much more concerned about animal welfare issues than in any other European country and the industry had to recognise that anxiety.</p>

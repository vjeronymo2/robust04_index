			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SMOKERS LOSE AGAIN  </P> <P> It seems that nonsmokers want to have it all their way. Twice, within one week,  my friend and I -- both smokers -- went to lunch and had to put in our names to  wait for a table in the smoking section.  </P> <P> When we were told there was a 10-minute wait, I commented that I didn't know  there were still that many smokers around. The hostess told me, "Oh, there are  nonsmokers who will sit in either section."  </P> <P> I told her that I felt the same say and that I'd sit in either section, too. Of  course, that didn't work. Why are nonsmokers able to sit in smoking areas while  smokers cannot sit in nonsmoking areas, particularly when they are the most  vocal about "second-hand smoke"?  </P> <P> My third incident of the week occurred in another restaurant where the smoking  section is in the back of the cocktail lounge. One of the two men who were  sitting in a back booth commented to me, "I suppose you're going to light up a  cigarette now, huh?" I answered that it was the smoking section and he then  told me, sarcastically, to wait until his food was delivered and then light up.  </P> <P> LESLIE TURNER  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

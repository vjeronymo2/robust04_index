The news agency on Tuesday, quoting Armenian sources,  claimed  that recently a delegation from NIGC travelled to Armenia and  held talks with the Armenian vice-president on building the  pipeline.    The agency further claimed that the preliminaries for  signing  an agreement over the issue has been concluded and that it will  be signed by the two sides by next April.    The NIGC added that it had discussed exporting Iranian  natural gas with some of the newly-independent Central Asian  republics including Azerbaijan and Armenia, but at at present it  has no intention of exporting gas to Armenia.</p>

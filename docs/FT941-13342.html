Or a misunderstood softy who would always give the girls in his home village what they wanted? Is there any difference between the two? Timewatch promises a revisionist version of the Siberian peasant who had, supposedly, such influence on Nicholas and Alexandra (8.00 BBC2). Even more sexually bizarre is American artist Jeff Koons who takes pictures of his wife, the topless Italian MP Cicciolina, doing the most amazing things to him with her tongue. He chooses the John Hancock Centre in Chicago in Building Sights USA (8.50 BBC2). The Day Today continues its appallingly accurate and consequently hilarious spoof of television news (9.00 BBC2). Dispatches tries to discover whether the agent causing BSE ('mad cow disease') could have passed into the human food chain (9.00 C4). In Middlemarch Ladislaw responds to Arthur Brooke's invitation to stay and the Vincys are more desperate than ever to discover the details of old Featherstone's will (9.30 BBC2).</p>

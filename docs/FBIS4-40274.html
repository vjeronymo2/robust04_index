			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Bakina] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- "North Korea does not have a  nuclear bomb. There might have been insignificant research  developments in this field which have most likely started the  conflict with the International Atomic Energy Agency," a Russian  top official said.    Speaking at a news conference at the Russian-American press  centre in Moscow on Wednesday, Lev Ryabev, first deputy minister  of nuclear engineering, denounced North Korea's decision to  withdraw from the IAEA.    He did not rule out the possibility that this step is North  Korea's response to the threat of sanctions made by other  members of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Ryabev  believes that the nuclear problem in North Korea could be solved  by peaceful, diplomatic means.    Speaking about the possibility of shutting down Russian  nuclear power plants which use Chernobyl-type reactors, Ryabev  noted that some of them will be modernised, others reequipped in  order to increase their safety.</p>

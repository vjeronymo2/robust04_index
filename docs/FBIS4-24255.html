			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Italicized passages recorded] </F>   [Text] The National Assembly has endorsed the program of  action presented by Prime Minister Edem Kodjo this afternoon  with an absolute majority of 41 yes votes, two against, and one  abstention out of the 46 members of parliament who took part in  the voting.    The program presented by the prime minister to parliament,  in  accordance with Article 78 of the 14 October Constitution, is in  line with a spirit of openness and reaches out a hand of  reconciliation to entire Togolese political class without  exclusion, as Mr. Edem Kodjo put it. This program is based on a  specific diagnosis of the social, economic, and political  situation of our country. So, Mr. Edem Kodjo's proposals cover  all aspects of our national life, notably, national unity,  construction of a law- abiding state, economic and financial  redress, security, socio- cultural development, and our  country's foreign policy.    Speaking on unity and national reconciliation, the prime  minister stressed the need for a sustained fight against  tribalism and ethnocentrism and said the aim is to renew  confidence in the various components of the nation by ensuring  that Togolese men and women realize they are brothers and  sisters.    [Kodjo] Democracy and law-abiding state cannot be  achieved in Togo without this necessary effort for  reconciliation, without reaching out a brotherly hand to  everyone. Reconciliation will not be possible either without our  making an effort to forgive and forget, without individual and  collective effort to make amends, without a firm renouncement of  unworthy acts committed by some countrymen who only see the sons  of the same country as enemies to be vanquished and as opponents  who must be eliminated. In short, reconciliation cannot be  achieved without a great general pardon, which is the best form  of a true amnesty. In order to make this reconciliation  possible, government will strive, through the adoption of  various legal and statutory measures, to help Togolese to  surmount their past and rise above their recriminations in order  to try and recreate harmony and again find the sense of common  destiny. Preference must be given to dialogue on a permanent  basis. Dialogue must be organized in order to stamp out rancor  and strengthen brotherhood and solidarity. This concern for  constant dialogue will be one of government's objectives.    From the economic standpoint, the prime minister first  stressed the current economic situation of Togo which is  presently facing a crisis aggravated in 1990 and worsened by the  devaluation of the CFA franc. He then went on to propose  government action in this area.    [Kodjo] Nothing is more urgent today than the need to  adopt rigorous measures aimed at rescuing Togo from the serious  financial and economic crisis facing it and whose effects have  particularly been aggravated in some areas following the  devaluation of the CFA franc. We must bear in mind that  democracy and misery do not cohabit. The people's aspiration  for democracy is an aspiration for a better life in a more open  and free society where everyone will be able to find greater  fulfillment and be more creative. Democracy is likely to be a  bitter disillusionment for our people who have suffered a lot.  Right now we do not strive to ensure a rigorous reorganization  of the situation and a good economic and financial posture of  our country.    The general economic situation, which was already  difficult in 1990 prior to the holding of the sovereign national  conference, seriously deteriorated later throughout the entire  transitional period. The gross domestic product fell from 445  billion CFA francs in 1990 to 354 billion in 1993, or a fall of  nearly 100 billion CFA francs over the three past years with an  external debt of 654 CFA francs. When the devaluation set in,  prices increased by 30 to over 150 percent according to the  products. The Togolese banking system is badly overstretched.  The economic slump resulting from the sociopolitical upheavals  led to heavy indebtedness of the bank thus making they less  capable of supporting the economy. These are some of the  factors that contribute to the bankruptcy of enterprises,  retrenchment of staff, increase in unemployment figures, and the  development of delinquency and misery. Government action aims  at achieving the following objectives: obtain a gross domestic  product growth rate of which is higher that the population  growth rate; maintain a low inflation rate; reduce trade balance  deficit, cut down on deficits resulting from government's  consolidated financial transactions. These goals can only be  achieved through the adoption of the bitter but unavoidable pill  of structural adjustment programs with the support of  international financial institutions and assistance from  friendly countries. However, foreign assistance cannot only  serve to complement internal efforts that all Togolese without  exception will be called upon to make in a general and sustained  solidarity move.    Mr. Edem Kodjo's action program is a comprehensive one  because it touches on all aspects of national life. But then no  program can reconstruct the country without security, the prime  minister further stated.    [Kodjo] We cannot build the future Togo in the absence  of peace and renewed security. Our country, Togo, is currently  experiencing a new type of crime. Heinous crimes have come to  bolster political crimes. Government will not spare any efforts  to restore security. It will take all the necessary measures to  discourage mounting insecurity in our country. A law-abiding  country will be empty words in the absence of an effective  public security personnel capable of controlling and containing  threats to public order and to reacting to violations of  citizens' rights and freedoms.    Government's proposed action to stamp out insecurity  will both be preventive and reactive. It will be necessary,  among other things, to improve the training of top executives of  the police corps and the Gendarmerie, and insist on the respect  of the hierarchy; create new structures for coordination and  monitoring of activities of security forces and reinject  confidence in the forces; strengthen the police force and the  Gendarmerie staff and equip them with modern communication  means; strengthen the criminal punishments currently provided  for by law to punish murders; strengthen antidrug programs; set  up a mechanism to fight against the illegal possession of arms  and work out a plan to dismantle arms caches in close  collaboration with the Army.    In fact, the Army must be one of the main pillars of  the new society. It must be in harmony with the nation in the  respect of the provisions of the new Constitution. In this  regard, the government, with the assistance of Army  headquarters, intends to organize detailed and thorough  workshops on the defense policy and on the role of the  Republican Army in national life. The specific and beneficial  role of the Army will be enhanced since Republican values will  be shared and respected by all.</p>

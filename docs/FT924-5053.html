			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Record high for Reuters SHARES in Reuters Holdings hit an all-time high yesterday as enthusiasm felt for some time by US investors spilled over into the UK, partly on the prospect of a share split. The electronic trading and news agency group broke through its previous barrier to close 37 up at 1331p on thin turnover. The US has been buying the stock since an international conference at the end of October removed any lingering doubts. The stock is appealing when set against a Standard &amp; Poors multiple but was beginning to look overvalued to UK fund managers. However, analyst Mr Brian Newman of Henderson Crosthwaite and a long-time bull of the stock said he had been recommending the stock strongly yesterday and that investors were responding to the possibility that the company would announce a one-for-one share split with the figures in February. While a split would make no difference to the fundamental value of the group it would leave the equity more liquid. Mr Henderson also argues that the new electronic dealing products - Dealing 2000-2, Globex and Istinet - were performing well and the group still had the benefit of a cash mountain. Nevertheless, agency broker James Capel, which has taken a bear view for more than a year, argues that the recent UK interest rate cuts will cost the company about Pounds 15m. SmithKline busy SmithKline Beecham was the most heavily traded stock in the London market yesterday after trustees of the company's Share Ownership Trust bought 14m 'A' shares at 560p per share. The stock was purchased in connection with the SmithKline Beecham share ownership plan. SmithKline shares closed 12 1/2 firmer in the A's on turnover of 22m. The Units, which tend to represent US interest, rose 9 to 488p. Savoy strength A second day's hefty rise in the share price of the Savoy hotel group again centred on the prospect of Forte renewing its interest in the luxury hotel chain. Sources close to Forte said that, although the two companies may forge closer ties, the share purchase moratorium agreed three years ago would be adhered to. Speculation has followed the death on Wednesday of Sir Hugh Wontner, the Savoy president and chief adversary of Forte which fought an eight-year battle for control of Savoy. Forte ended the fight with a 42 per cent share of Savoy's voting rights and two seats on the board and, under a peace agreement in 1989, agreed not to buy any more Savoy shares until 1994. But now, with the recent retirement of Lord Forte, the two leading protagonists have left the scene and speculation has been renewed. Savoy shares surged 103 to 588p, yesterday, although the volume was thought to be tiny. Forte was steady at 173p. A well-received presentation at County NatWest lifted Thorn EMI, the shares jumping 17 to 833p. Thorn's shares suffered a pre-results savaging as worries over the state of the music market knocked them back. However, impressive results last Tuesday renewed investor interest and Thursday's presentation added to the positive sentiment. Fund managers have been particularly reassured over the potential contribution forecast by Thorn for the Virgin Records group, the subject of disparaging pre-results comment from some quarters. Tour package group Airtours continued a steady run, adding 4 at 252p, ahead of interims early next month. Rank Organisation ran up 15 to 640p, although turnover was poor. The oil majors shrugged off volatility in the price of Brent crude which surrounded an Opec agreement and reflected the strength in the market. Shell firmed 2 to 548p and BP gained 1 1/2 to 231 1/2 p. Glaxo was held back following a meeting between the new finance director and analysts. The meeting was upbeat but there was some realism injected into the prospects for anti-migraine product Imigran. The shares eased 4 to 792p. Pharmaceutical company Medeva lifted 6 to 224p as it announced that it expected the final quarter of the year to produce a good performance and results to be in line with directors' expectations. The company reported a sharp increase in profits to Pounds 26.1m for the nine months to September 30 against Pounds 7.8m a year ago. EC approval of British Airways' purchase of a 49.9 per cent holding in TAT European Airlines of France helped BA shares rise 8 to 279p. US demand boosted British Steel, the shares climbing 3 1/2 to 57p. Smith New Court was said to be recommending GKN, up 9 1/2 to 402p. Smiths Industries gained 9 to 324p on the news that new Boeing production schedules would safeguard the 737 in which Smiths has a major interest. A feeling that the recent good performance of Cable and Wireless had been overdone left the shares short of support and they closed 5 off at 670p. Water and electricity stocks were mostly weak on the back of the move into recovery stocks. In waters, Anglian was one of the worst hit, tumbling 12 to 472p on additional worries over the costs of complying with this week's EC ruling on nitrates. Among other fallers, Yorkshire fell 14 to 516p, South West 10 to 488p and Severn Trent the same to 452p. US buying on the back of a firm Wall Street helped Grand Metropolitan add 11 to 447p. County NatWest moved to a short-term sell on Bass, the shares ended steady at 588p. Allied-Lyons retreated despite news that its joint-venture with Carlsberg had received approval from the UK authorities. Analysts are forecasting flat results in its interims next week. The shares ended a penny lighter at 642p. Selected food retailers were still buoyant on Thursday's comment from Northern Foods on the potential for food price inflation. Sainsbury jumped 8 to 517p, while rival Tesco gained 9 to 257p. A switch was said to have been recommended into the two from Argyll by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Argyll was off 2 at 371p, Northern lost 3 to 276p. Asda's relentless forward march continued, the shares added 3 to 55 1/2 p on turnover of 23m. A large buyer of Unilever helped the stock lift 15 to 1072p. A positive annual statement from Lloyds Chemist sent the shares forward 11 to 252p. Trading was particularly strong in the last 6 weeks, according to the group's chairman and chief executive. Packaging company Arjo Wiggins Appleton continued weak closing 3 off at 152p after investment bank BZW cut its forecasts for the group. Analyst Mr Tim Rothwell lowered his 1992 profit estimate to Pounds 167m and for the following year to Pounds 160m from Pounds 198m. The house also recommended selling the shares down to 126p arguing that the European carbonless paper business had seen a significant profit reduction over the past two and a half years. In its weekly review, SG Warburg Securities rounded up some of the recent evidence that it has identified of revival in the domestic economy. It believes that the recent stimulus to the UK economy should be sufficient to generate 'an anaemic recovery', resulting in GDP growth of 1 1/2 per cent in 1993, compared with the consensus forecast of 1 per cent growth.

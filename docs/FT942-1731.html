			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Beijing plans to double spending on telecoms China plans to spend Yuan450bn (Pounds 34bn) on its telecommunications network to the year 2000, double previous estimates and including Pounds 4.6bn in funds from abroad. Western experts in Beijing said the jump in projected spending reflected a recognition by the government of a need to accelerate provision of telecommunications services to match China's commercial aspirations. Mr Wu Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications, said the funds would be used to instal sophisticated switching equipment; provide 20,000km of optical cables and 15,000km of digital microwave lines; build land satellite stations and purchase sophisticated letter sorting equipment. Investment in telecommunications has been rising rapidly in the past few years with expenditures increasing from Yn40.4bn in 1993 to this year's budget of Yn53.6bn. Mr Wu said a 'small amount' of the telecommunications' funding requirements would be covered by capital grants from the state. The bulk would come from domestic and overseas loans. China plans to have 110m lines installed by 2000. This would be sufficient, according to telecommunications experts, to service 30 per cent of urban dwellers and 5 per cent of those living in rural areas. Mr Wu said China would be the world's largest telecommunications market next century. 'Foreign investment is encouraged in all areas except the direct management of telecommunications businesses or gaining control of a company through buying stock,' Mr Wu told the official China Daily. China is making determined effort to source most of its telecommunications requirements locally by 2000. It has entered a number of joint ventures to satisfy requirements. Western experts say China will be 'pretty well self-sufficient' in switching gear by the year 2000. They also expect the Chinese will seek more sophisticated items from the international market to build its electronic 'super highway'.</p>

At the meeting, principal leaders of prefectures,  autonomous prefectures, and cities exchanged their views on the  progress of last year's work, the experience they gained and  what they learned therefrom, as well as their plans for the new  year and their hopes and proposals for the autonomous region's  policy on macroeconomic regulations and control.    After hearing reports by leaders of various prefectures,  autonomous prefectures, and cities, regional party Secretary  Song Hanliang pointed out: Whether or not the reform, opening  up, and economic development carried out by Xinjiang can be  accelerated depends on the actual progress made by various  prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities; and also  depends on how the frontline leaders command and organize their  men to implement the policies.    He said: Our regional and border trade reflects that a  market mechanism is gradually taking shape in Xinjiang. Guided  by the principle of emancipating the minds, the government  formulated a series of essential policies, which played an  important role in providing services and improving  infrastructural facilities in various ports. If the same thing  is done in our industrial and agricultural sectors as well as to  our infrastructure, we can achieve development with great speed  and high-efficiency.    Leading comrades of Xinjiang Autonomous Region, including  Abulaidi Amudurexiti, Zhang Fusen, Wang Lequan, Keyum Bawudun,  Zhou Shengtao, and Hailiqiemu Silamu, also attended the meeting.</p>

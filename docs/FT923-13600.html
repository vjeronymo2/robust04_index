			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / People: Bodies politic Peter O'Keefe is the new national chairman of the INSTITUTE OF LOGISTICS AND DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT. ***** Andrew Ball, VAT partner at Touche Ross, has been appointed chairman of the VAT PRACTITIONERS GROUP. ***** Robert McDonald, chairman of Probus Housewares, has been appointed director of the STAFFORDSHIRE Tec. ***** Christopher Jonas, senior partner of Drivers Jonas, has been elected president of the ROYAL INSTITUTION OF CHARTERED SURVEYORS. ***** Peter Bottomley MP has been elected president of the WATER COMPANIES ASSOCIATION in place of Lord Elliott of Morpeth who was president for 17 years. ***** Brian Ellis, chairman of Richard Ellis, has been elected president of the LONDON CHAMBER OF COMMERCE &amp; INDUSTRY. ***** Brian Roddick, an underwriter with GW Hutton, has become chairman of The SALVAGE ASSOCIATION. ***** Glenda Davies has been appointed director, securities and investment of the BRITISH MERCHANT BANKING AND SECURITIES HOUSES ASSOCIATION. ***** Clare Connery, writer and broadcaster on food, has been appointed chairman of TASTE OF ULSTER. ***** Russian lawyer, Ksenya Solovyova, has left the Paris-based American law firm of Salans Hertzfeld &amp; Heilbronn to join City solicitors Lovell White Durrant as a member of its east west trade group. The daughter of the former Soviet Union's leading industrial designer, Solovyova studied international law in Moscow and spent 12 years at a government think-tank for developing the economy before joining Salans Hertzfeld in 1989. Her role at Lovells will be to advise western businesses on the conduct of large transactions in eastern Europe. ***** Sir Desmond Pitcher will be stepping down as chief executive of the Littlewoods pools and retailing group next March after completing 10 years in the job. He will be succeeded by Barry Dale, 53, currently finance director, who joined the Liverpool-based Littlewoods from London Transport four years ago. Sir Desmond, who will retain his links with Littlewoods by becoming non-executive vice-chairman, intends to devote his time helping to regenerate Merseyside. 'He will be 58 by next March and believes this will be an appropriate time to pursue the next step in his career,' Littlewoods said. During his time there, Sir Desmond has given Littlewoods a far harder commercial edge. Its retailing arm, which includes Littlewoods stores and the Index chain of catalogue shops, has sharpened its focus and benefited from the introduction of computer systems. Sir Desmond was fully at home with such technology, given his background working for Plessey, even if he was not the most intuitive of retailers. Dale has been appointed chief executive designate with immediate effect. 'I think there will be adjustments on the tiller but there will be not change in the overall direction,' Littlewoods said. It added its now-ritual coda that the Moores family, which owns Littlewoods, had no intention of taking the company public.</p>

Here is what Zurab  Dvali, correspondent of the independent agency IPRINDA reports  from Tbilisi by telephone:    [Dvali] This morning a Georgian Government delegation headed  by head of state Eduard Shevardnadze left by plane for a two-day  visit to Turkey.    In the course of this summit meeting, a large package of  economic agreements and also of cooperation in the sphere of  culture and tourism will be signed. The plane stopped over in  Batumi where the government delegation was joined by Aslan  Abashidze, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Autonomous  Republic of Ajaria.    Also today, a meeting took place between the Georgian  Government delegation and Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel.    Meanwhile, in the republic's parliamentary building, the  meeting continued between Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze and deputies  who are interested in his proposal regarding Georgia joining the  ruble zone. The parliamentarians listened with great interest to  the address by the republic's former Deputy Prime Minister Roman  Gotsiridze, who analyzed the situation regarding the Georgian  coupon. He stated that he is amazed by the statement by the  head of state that the introduction in the republic of coupons  has been a hasty and erroneous decision. Gotsiridze said that  he himself had taken a direct part in the talks with Russia and  that he is certain that Georgia would never receive Russian  money and would not be able to join the ruble zone. In this  way, according to him, putting the Georgian coupon into  circulation was the only way out of the situation that had  arisen. What is more, according to the former deputy prime  minister, Russia will never give Georgia the promised technical  credit. Gotsiridze stressed that in his view, Georgia is being  run by a technocratic lobby made up of party functionaries and  the armed mafia. It is they who have organized this  unprecedented hyperinflation, which in the final analysis will  result in the establishment in Georgia of an authoritarian  regime, the former deputy prime minister remarked at the end of  his speech.    The speeches made by the opposition-minded deputies were of  approximately the same content. The only thing that is amazing,  as local observers note, is the fact that for the time being no  one has asked Russia itself whether it would agree to Georgia  joining the ruble zone.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Lashch report: "Russian Intelligence Service as </F> Book Reviewer. The FIS Refutes Key Theses of a Book on Nuclear  Espionage"]    [Text] Last week, the Russian mass media started  publishing excerpts from the memoirs of Pavel Sudoplatov, a  grand master of Soviet espionage and sabotage in the  1930's-1950's. One of its main sections is devoted to the  intelligence service's involvement in the creation of Soviet  nuclear weapons and contains sensational revelations implicating  the world's key scientists of the time -- Enrico Fermi, Leo  Szilard, and Robert Oppenheimer -- in leaking Western nuclear  secrets to the USSR. Yesterday, your KOMMERSANT- DAILY  correspondent asked Tatyana Samolis, press secretary of the  Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] chief, to comment on  the allegations.    Ms. Samolis told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that  the  FIS chiefs have already worked out their stance on the matter.  They think that some passages in Sudoplatov's book are a  compilation of actual events, half-truths, and pure invention.  The FIS still holds the opinion that Soviet scientists made a  decisive contribution to the creation of nuclear weapons in the  USSR, whereas intelligence efforts, albeit important and  qualified, had only a secondary role to play.    The FIS director's press secretary did not deny that  starting  September 1941 the Soviet intelligence service did receive  truthful information on efforts to create nuclear weapons in the  United States and the United Kingdom, something which helped  solve a number of technical problems and accelerate the process  of nuclear arms development. But events related to intelligence  activity in that area and the roles of many players were  interpreted in too free, often even incorrect, a manner in Pavel  Sudoplatov's memoirs.    Although special services tend to avoid specific comments on  their methods and sources of information, this time Ms. Samolis  categorically denied allegations contained in the book that the  Soviet intelligence service received information on the nuclear  problem directly from as prominent scientists as Fermi, Szilard,  and Oppenheimer.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses weaken on lack of German cut The Bundesbank's refusal to cut key interest rates, and the high German December M3 growth rate which preceded it, had a progressively weakening effect on bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT began by threatening the 2,200 level for the second time this week, the Ibis-indicated Dax index peaking at 2,193.57 in the pre-bourse, but an 8.1 per cent growth in December M3 heralded the Buba interest rate decision and the slide began. The Dax closed 32.29 lower at 2,151.72 on the session, and just off its low for the day at 2,137.08 in the post bourse. Mr John Blackley of James Capel acknowledged that rate cuts were not expected a week ago but said that, this week, a number of German banks had changed their minds and forecast cuts of a quarter-point. Turnover was flat at DM9.4bn. Among interest rate-sensitive stocks, utilities reflected the Buba news with RWE down DM15.50 to DM475.50 by the end of the post-bourse, and Veba off DM15 at DM495. Elsewhere, Preussag dropped DM11.50 to DM451.50 although analysts said that its 56 per cent drop in 1992/93 net profits was a case for a buy recommendation. PARIS reflected disappointment at the lack of a German cut, even although this had largely been discounted by most analysts, while many investors decided that the time was ripe for profit-taking after Wednesday's record high. The CAC-40 index dropped steadily during the session, closing off 33.94 or 1.4 per cent at 2,321.99. Turnover was FFr5.2bn. The authorities confirmed yesterday that turnover reached a record level during January, with average daily transactions of some FFr6bn. Elf Aquitaine fell back FFr4.70 to FFr426.00 following the announcement after hours on Wednesday of the public offer price of FFr385 per share. The offer period lasts until February 10, with the institutional pricing to be set on February 14. Euro Disney remained under pressure, down FFr2.70 to FFr33.50, with further negative news being reported in the domestic media. The shares have lost some 8 per cent so far this week. Paribas dipped FFr8 to FFr581 ahead of its 1993 results which, after the close, were within expectations. AMSTERDAM saw a 5 per cent fall in Wolters Kluwer, the publishing house, on reports that subscribers to the group's specialised publications felt that prices were too high. There were further reports that some subscribers were calling for a boycott of the publisher's highly profitable legal publications. Wolters Kluwer's shares dropped Fl 6.20 to Fl 126.20, but off a session low of Fl 122.80. A broker at MeesPierson in Amsterdam remarked that he thought the reports were exaggerated, and considered the sharp decline more the result of institutions using this as an excuse to take profits: the shares had risen some 22 per cent since December before yesterday's fall. KLM was the day's other main story, as the airline announced plans to issue 20m new shares, and reported a rise in third quarter net profit. The shares lost 80 cents to Fl 48.20, but had been trading at Fl 49.30 during the day. The AEX index slipped 2.09 or 0.5 per cent to 435.27. MILAN was hit by profit-taking after its five session rally, and some of the best recent gainers took the biggest tumbles. The Comit index, calculated once a day, put on 4.55 to 672.85 but late weakness was reflected in a fall of 112 in the real-time Mibtel index to 10,693. Montedison shed L53 or 4.3 per cent to L1,190; its shareholder register showed that no outsider held more than 2 per cent, confounding speculation of stakebuilding. Against the trend, banking stocks continued to benefit from the success of this week's privatisation of IMI: the public offer sold out in two days and was heavily oversubscribed. Credito Italiano soared L76 or 3.2 per cent to L2,474. BCI, facing privatisation later this month, gained L46 to L5,115. ZURICH finished lower in line with other markets, the SMI index shed 17.2 to 3,159.9. Among blue chips going against the trend, Ciba bearers added SFr4 to SFr955 on the view that they were undervalued compared with Sandoz. Swiss Re, seen as having trailed the general market, put on SFr8 to SFr711. STOCKHOLM marched further into record territory before profit-taking left the Affarsvarlden index 11.6 lower at 1,591.2. Electrolux B added SKr19 to SKr400 in further response to Wednesday's better than expected 1993 results. ISTANBUL dropped 5 per cent, the composite index ending 975.68 lower at 18,487.74, well off its worst, for a two-day loss of 11.9 per cent.

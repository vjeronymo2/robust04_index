			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer] </F>   [Text] Over the weekend, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  underwent surgery somewhere around the eye area.    His doctors obliged him to wear an eye patch to cover the  treated area. Consequently, Peres decided not to appear in  public.    Peres did not participate in the cabinet session on Friday  [25 February] nor in the meeting Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  held yesterday with the heads of the diplomatic corps in Israel.    The foreign minister is working from his home in Jerusalem  and even granted an interview to Qol Yisra'el. It has been  learned from his office that he will return to work within the  next few days.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the EPA Regional office listed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Addresses <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20 DCMR Section 500, Subsection 500.4 requires all parties in the gasoline distribution network, including ``carriers'', to generate and maintain records detailing compliance. However, the definition of ``carriers'' is not found in 20 DCMR Section 199, entitled Definitions and Abbreviations, or any other section of 20 DCMR. Therefore, EPA is proposing to disapprove both Section 199, because it lacks a definition for the term ``carriers'', and Subsection 500.4, because the term ``carriers'' which is used in this section is not defined in the subsection or any other section of 20 DCMR. The lack of a definition of ``carriers'' compromises the enforceability of the regulation and is a deficiency under Section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's sampling procedures are detailed in Appendix D of 40 CFR Part 80. EPA has recommended that states adopt these sampling procedures. The District of Columbia has not adopted EPA sampling procedures or any other sampling procedure which would be acceptable to EPA. In addition, the District of Columbia has failed to include in its' regulation procedures for the calculation of oxygen content in the gasoline sampled. Both the lack of a sampling procedure and oxygen content calculation procedure compromise the enforceability of the regulation and are a deficiency under Section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act. Therefore, EPA is proposing to disapprove 20 DCMR Section 502, Subsection 502.18 because it lacks both a sampling procedure and a procedure for calculating the oxygen content in the gasoline sampled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the above deficiencies, EPA cannot grant full approval of this rule under section 100(k)(3) and Part D. Also, because the submitted rule is not composed of separable parts which meet all the applicable requirements of the Act, EPA cannot grant partial approval of the rule under section 110(k)(3). However, EPA may grant a limited approval of the submitted rule under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt regulations necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. The approval is limited because EPA's action also contains a simultaneous limited disapproval, due to the fact that the rule does not meet the section 110(a)(2) requirement because of the noted enforcement deficiencies. Thus, in order to strengthen the SIP, EPA is proposing a limited approval of the District of Columbia's submitted additions or amendments to 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Section 199; Chapter 5, Section 500, Subsections 500.4 and 500.5; Chapter 5, Section 502, Subsection 502.18; Chapter 9, Section 904, Subsections 904.1 and 904.2 under section 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, EPA is also proposing a limited disapproval of this rule because it contains deficiencies under section 110(a)(2) of the Act, and, as such, the rule does not fully meet the requirements of the Act. Under section 179(a)(2), if the Administrator disapproves a submission under section 110(k) for an area designated nonattainment, based on the submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the Act, the Administrator must apply one of the sanctions set forth in section 179(b) unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months of such disapproval. Section 179(b) provides two sanctions available to the Administrator: highway funding and offsets. The 18 month period referred to in section 179(a) will begin at the time EPA publishes final notice of this disapproval. Moreover, the final disapproval triggers the federal implementation plan (FIP) requirement under section 110(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the above stated reasons, EPA is proposing a limited approval/limited disapproval of the District of Columbia's SIP for an oxygenated gasoline program. In order to correct the deficiencies in 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Section 199; Chapter 5, Section 500, Subsections 500.4 and 500.5; Chapter 5, Section 502, Subsection 502.18; Chapter 9, Section 904, Subsections 904.1 and 904.2 which EPA is proposing as a limited disapproval, the District of Columbia must include a definition for the term ``carrier'', include a sampling procedure, and include procedures for the calculation of oxygen content in the gasoline sampled. If the District of Columbia submits a SIP revision which is deemed administratively and technically complete and corrects the deficiencies listed above prior to the time that EPA finalizes this action, EPA will propose full approval of the October 27, 1993 submittal and the subsequent submittal which corrects the deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Ballot at BBC on pay package Unions at the BBC will ballot their members on a compromise package on performance pay and conditions of service thrashed out at the Acas conciliation service last week, Raymond Snoddy writes. The issues led to a number of one-day strikes at the BBC earlier in the summer. Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the main technical union, will tell staff that on performance-related pay the offer is the best that can be obtained by negotiation. The unions say the BBC has modified its insistence that, after performance reviews, pay rises can be withheld from staff whose work is unsatisfactory. Under the new proposals a financial penalty of up to 4.5 per cent of salary could be imposed for six months, subject to a six-month delay before being imposed. There are also extra commitments on what salaries new staff and the newly promoted could expect to receive after initial training.</p>

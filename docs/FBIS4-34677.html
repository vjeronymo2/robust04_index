			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lastenia Murillo Munoz] </F>   [Text] Immigration Department Director Antonio Dominguez  announced yesterday the Panamanian Government has granted asylum  to 150 Haitians who are in Panama, provided they do not practice  voodoo.    "We have told them they cannot practice voodoo while they  are  in Panama; otherwise, I will be forced to revoke their visas and  deport them," Dominguez said.    Voodoo is an ancient practice, a combination of religion and  magic which African slaves had brought to Haiti and which is a  type of witchcraft that stirs apprehension in certain parts of  the world.    Dominguez said this group includes Haitians who arrived in  Panama from January to the present. Some of them have been  granted an extension while others have opted to hide.    According to Dominguez, these 150 Haitians are ineligible  for  political asylum; as a result, the National Organization for  Attention to Refugees cannot give them economic assistance, nor  can the Immigration Department.    Panama suspended commercial flights to Haiti last week, in  keeping with UN sanctions against the de facto regime, which has  ruled Haiti for three years.    The Central American governments, including Panama's, has  rejected a recent U.S. request to admit Haitian nationals into  their countries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Marwan Dudin,  member of the Jordanian delegation to the bilateral peace  negotiations with Israel, has revealed that there are clear  differences of opinion between the Jordanians and the Israelis  regarding the negotiations. He said: They talk to us as if  peace has already been achieved.    In an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Dudin said that the  Israeli negotiators' method of negotiation is completely  different from the Jordanian method, for whereas the Jordanians  are looking for a clear way of establishing a just, lasting, and  durable peace on the basis of the specific Jordanian and Arab  constant principles pertaining to the entire peace process, the  Israelis are following a completely different approach and  talking about matters and issues which are supposed to be  discussed in detail after full and comprehensive agreement is  reached on the main issues on the agenda of the  Jordanian-Israeli negotiation track, the same as on other tracks.    Dudin, who was talking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT after returning  to Amman with the other members of the Jordanian delegation to  the negoatiations, said: We believe that there is a clear and  specific agenda including major issues which should be  negotiated in depth. If we cannot reach full agreement on them,  the peace we aspire to and work for sincerely and with open  minds, will not be achieved.    He said that their method of negotiation is basically  focused  on what they call "Israel's security" irrespective of reaching  agreement on the issues on which specific agreements must be  reached.    The members of the Jordanian delegation had returned to  Amman  in implementation of the decision of the Arab parties to the  peace process to suspend the negotiations temporarily following  the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. Dudin said: To  us, the topics on the Jordanian-Israeli agenda are of paramount  importance. We well understand that it would be illogical to  discuss very advanced issues that are supposed to come as a  result of the peace process or of the peace agreements, before a  comprehensive agreement is reached on solutions for the main  issues still unresolved.... We are talking about the issues of  water and our right to it, the occupied Jordanian territory, and  return of the refugees. We cannot imagine any possibility of  signing a peace agreement or moving on to other details which,  in our view and in the view of the entire international  community, would be results of the peace agreement, before clear  and acceptable agreements are reached on all these issues.    Dudin also said: I believe that there is no agreement so far  between the Jordanian and Israeli views. The Israelis are using  a negotiating language and approach only to serve their own  interests without any clear inclination so far to discuss the  main issues on the Jordanian-Israeli agenda. For instance, they  say why should we not talk about tourism and combating natural  disasters, why should we not be allowed to visit Petra, and why  should we not discuss commercial issues, for your trade is going  to be with us and not with the Palestinians, and other such  issues which could only be tackled at later stages and can only  be discussed after peace is actually established through  agreement on the fundamental issues and topics, the most  important being water, and our full undiminished rights to it  must be fulfilled, our occupied territory where full Jordanian  sovereignty must be restored, and the issue of the refugee  problem which must be radically solved.    Dudin added: All I can say is that, in the negotiations, we  expressed our views strongly on the various issues and we told  them that all the matters they have been raising would come  after the establishment of a comprehensive, just, and durable  peace acceptable to us and to future generations. [passage  omitted]    Dudin further said: The negotiations are clearly at a  standstill now because of our different philosophies. We say  that we will not sign any peace agreement before full agreement  is reached on the issues on the agenda, but they clearly  concentrate on matters that would arise later on and that, in  our view, cannot be discussed before the main pending issues are  resolved.

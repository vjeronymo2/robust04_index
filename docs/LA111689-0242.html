			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: EATING OUT OF CARTONS -- IT'S AN ALL-TIME NO-NO  </P> <P> "NEVER, NEVER eat anything out of a carton, even if you are at home alone with  the shades drawn. Doing so is wicked and constitutes Miss Manners' one  exception to the generally genial rule about violations of etiquette not  counting if you don't get caught," writes Judith Martin.  </P> <P> So now we know why the Corleone family of "The Godfather" films has had so much  trouble in its dynasty. It all probably stems from "eating Chinese takeout"  from cartons in that famous scene from the first movie.  </P> <P> And that's nothing. Frank Sinatra's late mother used to rebuke him for drinking  from the milk carton while standing in the cool shadow of the refrigerator.  Dolly Sinatra knew her "Miss Manners" stuff, you see.  </P> <P> THE MOST coveted role in Hollywood for any young actor is the lead in Tim  Burton's next movie, "Edward Scissorhand," for 20th Century Fox. (It will be  Burton's first movie since the sensational "Batman.")  </P> <P> The star is to be Johnny Depp of TV's "21 Jump Street," and he'll do his acting  during a series hiatus.  </P> <P> WHEN DENNIS MET MEG -- The delightful Meg Ryan and the divine Dennis Quaid,  those co-stars of "D.O.A." and "Innerspace," are engaged -- formally. Their  long-playing off-screen romance seems to have reached a more serious phase.  </P> <P> NOW ABOUT "Steel Magnolias." My pal Pia Lindstrom insists it's a movie that  people will enjoy, provided they never saw the brilliant off-Broadway play by  Robert Harling. I'm not sure. I think it's the most overwrought cinema in  recent memory.  </P> <P> The movie is half way over before it settles down enough that you can  understand what the actors are saying. By then you have a terrible headache.  The actors don't interact; they seem each to be doing some individual thing. I  know Ray Stark, Herb Ross and writer Harling felt they had to "open up" the  play, but they've sunk it under big-screen, epic entertainment values.  </P> <P> The cast, however, is for the most part, fascinating. Dolly Parton rises above  everything; she is subdued, simple, believable and simply great as the beauty  shop owner. Shirley MacLaine is excellent once they let her quit screaming and  dragging a big dog around as in her chaotic entrance. Olympia Dukakis is  wonderful but seems to be in a Noel Coward drawing room comedy. Daryl Hannah  plays well against her sexy image as the "born again" beauty operator.  </P> <P> I was disappointed by the all-important relationship between the mother (Sally  Field) and the saintly daughter (Julia Roberts.) This is crucial to the plot,  but I felt the most they convey is the usual mother-daughter squabbling. And  Julia is more like a spoiled brat than a girl whose sweetness touches all  lives.  </P> <P> So, I'd say go see the play, one of the best ever of its kind. Then see the  movie, just so you'll be able to shake your head at how Tri-Star missed the  boat by a Louisiana country mile.  </P></p>

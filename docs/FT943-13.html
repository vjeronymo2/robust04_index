			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (56): Not growing, but recovering - Africa After a dismal decade of stagnation and decline, sub-Saharan Africa can, at last, see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. This is the result of firmer commodity prices, faster world trade growth, accelerating economic reforms in many countries, and the remarkably smooth political transition in South Africa. The IMF forecasts growth of 3.4 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent in 1995  -well above the average 2.2 per cent over the past decade. However, this marginally brighter prospect should be seen in perspective. Africa is not growing, but recovering. In the past 10 years, per capita incomes fell 0.8 per cent a year. Nor is the recovery solidly based. Events in Sudan, Somalia and Rwanda, ongoing hostilities in Angola and the uneasy mood in Mozambique ahead of the October elections underscore its fragility. Tensions in Nigeria and Zaire could any day spill over into serious regional economic disruption. A recent research paper by World Bank economists William Easterly and Ross Levine* explains the region's poor performance 'statistically' in terms of poor education, political instability, weak infrastructure and financial systems, overvalued exchange rates, ethnic diversity and 'troubles with neighbours'. This last effect is explained in terms of critical mass; the writers argue that if African neighbours act together to reform their economic policies, as indeed is happening increasingly now, there will be positive spillover and demonstration effects across national borders. This leads them to conclude, optimistically, that Africa's poor growth performance is 'very much reversible', even if some adverse factors, such as poor education and infrastructural decay, will have long-lasting effects. Factor into their analysis, a rejuvenated South African economy, and the potential for positive cross-border spillovers is considerable. At current exchange rates, following the 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA Franc in January, South Africa's GDP of Dollars 120bn falls not very short of that of the rest of sub-Saharan Africa - Dollars 135bn to Dollars 140bn. South Africa's economy, too, has stagnated for the past dozen years, and its return to growth of 4 per cent annually, which is not unrealistic, would be a significant boost for the regional economy, especially for southern Africa. There are two distinct schools of thought on this. On one side, it is argued that the South Africans will be so preoccupied with their own internal problems - especially the successful implementation of their social advancement programme, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), that they will pay little attention to the rest of the region in the immediate future. The alternative viewpoint holds that South Africa is on course to become the locomotive for much of sub-Saharan Africa, partly as a growing market for African primary products and some low-price manufactures, but more importantly as an exporter of capital, skills and services. It's no coincidence that South African firms are in the forefront of the privatisation of hotels and cement plants in Mozambique, the planned sell-off of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, involved in tourism in East Africa, manufacturing and mining in Botswana and Zimbabwe and the development of the region's financial infrastructure. While western banks are pulling in their horns in Africa, Stanbic, South Africa's leading banking group, has expanded by taking over the African operations of ANZ Grindlays. Fledgling stock exchanges being set up all over the continent will benefit from South African advice and expertise. There is enormous, largely untapped potential for integrated tourism programmes linking destinations in Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Botswana and Zimbabwe with South Africa. South Africa's Escom is becoming the hub of a regional energy grid, drawing on Pretoria's excess capacity but also electricity imports from Mozambique's Cahora Bassa, and South African investors may develop the Pande gas deposit in Mozambique. The 1992 drought was a reminder of just how dependent southern Africa had become on South Africa's transport system, in spite of ambitious donor-funded programmes which were intended to reduce that dependence. The bulk of the maize and wheat needed came in through South Africa. The trade numbers tell the same largely lopsided story. In 1992, South Africa had an estimated trade surplus of R13.8bn (Dollars 4.8bn) with the rest of Africa. Most of this was with its Southern African Customs Union (SACU) partners - Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia - which between them accounted for R9bn. But it also had sizeable trade surpluses with Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Mauritius and Mozambique. While such a one-sided trade pattern - African exports to South Africa were worth R2.6bn compared with imports of R16.4bn - is a cause of concern to both sides, it is likely to get worse rather than better. African countries are finding South African products to be cheaper (in some cases), often more appropriate, and frequently more readily available with shorter lead times. The Dollars 225m Hartley Platinum development in Zimbabwe announced last month will source much of its capital equipment from South Africa. At the same time, there is little appetite in South Africa itself for the rest of the region's goods, which are largely poor quality, and cannot compete with imports from Asia. The signs are that the existing south-north trade and payments gap will widen, despite increased purchases of African primary goods - Kenyan coffee, Malawian tea, Botswana soda ash, Angolan oil, Zimbabwean tobacco and Zambian copper - by South African firms and increased tourist spending by holidaymakers from the south. Southern Africa, in particular, has much to gain from closer co-operation in transport, energy, tourism and even education, but hopes of a regional free trade area and of broadening the existing rand monetary area to include other countries, are almost certainly premature. The hearts are willing, the rhetoric is there in spades, but harsh economic reality speaks otherwise. At the end of the day, few African leaders are prepared to surrender an ounce of what little of economic autonomy they have managed to salvage from bilateral and multilateral donors, and multinational corporations. Whether South Africa's re-emergence will be the catalyst providing the neighbourly spillover for the rest of the region is highly problematic. President Mandela and his largely untried team have to prove that they can break the African mould, delivering the east Asian cocktail of rapid growth with improved equity, that has eluded the often-feeble efforts of the rest of the continent. History, and hard economic numbers are against them, but at the tail-end of a decade of wasted aid and often-ineffectual policy reform in sub-Saharan Africa, the new South Africa is the region's best bet. * Africa's Growth Tragedy.

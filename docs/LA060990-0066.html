			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2ND TITAN 4 LAUNCHED; MILITARY KEEPS PAYLOAD A SECRET  </P> <P> A giant Titan 4 rocket thundered into orbit early Friday with what was believed  to be a military surveillance satellite.  </P> <P> Air Force officials said the early morning launching went smoothly.  </P> <P> It was the second launching of the nation's most powerful unmanned space rocket  and one of three planned for this year.  </P> <P> "Everything went very well. It was a beautiful sight to behold," Air Force Col.  Frank Stirling, director of the Titan program, said. "It was a great step for  us in the Air Force to get the second Titan 4 launched on time as planned."  </P> <P> The $173-million rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It  resembled a large ball of fire as it cut through clouds on its way toward an  undisclosed orbit.  </P> <P> The Air Force refused to discuss or even acknowledge the flight until it issued  a statement about 20 minutes after liftoff. The payload was not disclosed, but  civilian experts believe it is an electronic eavesdropping satellite or a  missile-warning spacecraft.  </P> <P> A Titan 4 successfully boosted a missile-warning satellite into orbit in June,  1989, even though an engine nozzle malfunctioned. Stirling said the problem was  corrected and did not occur in Friday's launching.  </P> <P> Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems has a $7.1-billion contract with the Air  Force to supply 41 Titan 4 rockets, with an option for eight more. The goal is  to have 75 by the end of 1997, which would put the cost of the program at $17  billion, Stirling said.  </P> <P> The Air Force ordered the rocket in 1985 to serve as a complementary launching  vehicle to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's manned space  shuttle.  </P></p>

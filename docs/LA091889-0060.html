Rozo Julio Navarro, chief of the national police force in the city, 180 miles  southwest of Bogota.  </P> <P> Navarro told Colombian radio that the bomb at the shopping center killed a  guard. He said another bomb was found at a bank and defused.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, police in Buenaventura, northwest of Cali on the Pacific coast, said  journalist Guillermo Gomez Murillo was shot to death Saturday night while  watching television in his parents' home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Editor Slain in 1986  </P> <P> Gomez Murillo was a correspondent for the Bogota newspaper El Espectador, whose  editor was slain by drug traffickers in 1986. The paper's offices were heavily  damaged Sept. 2 in a car bomb attack.  </P> <P> El Espectador said Sunday that Gomez Murillo was known "for having revealed  anomalies in the administration of this part of the country."  </P> <P> In other developments:  </P> <P>  -- A rocket or mortar was fired at the U.S. Embassy in central Bogota on  Sunday night, but it failed to explode, the embassy's Marine guard said. He  said the projectile knocked some concrete out of the wall but caused no further  damage.  </P> <P>  -- The current leading presidential candidate of the ruling Liberal Party,  Alberto Santofimio Botero, ortedly called for an end to extraditions during a  speech.  </P> <P> "I do not support giving up Colombians to be tried under someone else's roof,"  he said.  </P> <P> Under emergency measures imposed Aug. 18, President Virgilio Barco Vargas has  resumed extraditions to the United States of suspected drug traffickers.  </P> <P> So far, one person has been extradited to the United States, and extradition  proceedings are under way against two others.  </P></p>

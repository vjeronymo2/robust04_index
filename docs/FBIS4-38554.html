			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 30, BNS -- Latvian President Guntis  Ulmanis urged people to "assess the produce of various press  editions a bit more critically because they may be attempted to  blackmail us."    The president said this Monday in an answer to reporters'  questions about the publication of allegations of a parliament  member being a KGB informer dubbed Varis.    He also denied having received the letter containing such  information as suggested by its author, Viktors Alksnis, a  former Soviet Supreme Council deputy.    "More serious provocations may face the president and the  government in the future" because the Baltic states and Latvia  are still trying to gain international prestige, Ulmanis said.    The media were acquainted with the letter by the Interfax  and  Baltic News Service news agencies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "exclusive interview" with Jaques Matanda, member </F> of the executive bureau of the Sacred Union of Radical  Opposition, by Ruben G. Abelanda in Luanda, Angola; date not  given]    [Text] [no dateline as received] Zairian leader Mobutu Sese  Seko, who has been in office for nearly three decades, remains  in power thanks to the close ties he has maintained with the  U.S. CIA since taking power on 24 November 1965.    Jaques Matanda, a member of the Executive Bureau of the  Zairian Sacred Union of Radical Opposition (USOR), currently  Mobutu's major opposition force, made this statement during an  exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA in Luanda, the Angolan  capital.    During a lengthy discussion, Matanda charged that the ties  between the chief of the Kinshasa regime and the U.S.  intelligence service date back to before the military coup that  brought him to power.    The USOR leader and supporter of Etienne Tshisekedi, the  political figure heading the opposition in the former Belgian  Congo, stated that Mobutu was responsible for the murder of the  country's leader Patrice Lumumba.    At that time, the current Zairian president was Lumumba's  secretary and later became the chief of the Army's General  Staff, a position he used to work in favor of the interests of  the U.S. Government, which at that time was basically interested  in stopping liberation movements on the African continent and  preventing the installation of progressive systems, Matanda  recalled.    He added that Lumumba, who fought for the liberation of the  people of the continent, was a figure not to Washington's liking  because of his support for the region's political and economic  independence.    This happened at the time of the Cold War, the height of the  socialist community led by the now defunct Soviet Union, and a  period in which Washington struggled against what it referred to  as communist expansion, he added.    He noted that Mobutu undoubtedly appeared as an important  spearhead of U.S. administrations in Africa, a role he performed  to the letter and which reaped him countless benefits.    According to Matanda, Mobutu was given a green light to  control Zaire any way he wanted, despite the fact that he was  repeatedly accused of violating human rights, embezzling from  the national treasury, and using corruption as a means to  silence foes and win over supporters.    The USOR leader added that this is how Mobutu has managed to  maintain a regime that has not adjusted to the democratic model,  a model to be applied in Africa, as well as throughout the Third  World, according to speeches by politicians in Washington, and  how he has blocked attempts by his adversaries to install a  democratic regime in Zaire.    Matanda admitted that today, Mobutu lacks the open support  he  once had for nearly 30 years from the U.S., French, and Belgian  Governments, but, he added it is also true that conservative  sectors with abundant financial resources in those three  countries, primarily in Washington and Paris, are still  providing him with vital assistance.    Otherwise, in Matanda's opinion, the chief of the Kinshasa  regime would have been ousted by the strong pressure his  opponents have been exerting to create a democratic and  pluralist system in Zaire in line with those installed in almost  every African state since the beginning of the 1990's.    Since the start of the struggle for a transition toward  democracy in Zaire, USOR (which groups the country's major  opposition forces) has worked peacefully to pressure Mobutu into  accepting the challenge of multiparty elections, he added.    He said, however, that peaceful means do not appear to be  the  way to convince someone who is willing to kill to remain in  power and who continues to enrich himself at the cost of the  growing acute poverty suffered by the Zairian people.    In the interviewee's opinion, there will be no other  alternative left but to begin an armed struggle if Mobutu  insists on hampering the installation of a democratic system in  the country.    Matanda's remarks coincide with the views of African  political analysts who feel "times of war are looming over Zaire  unless the severe socioeconomic deterioration of that country is  halted. [no closing quotation marks as received]    According to various sources, the situation is already  explosive, but Mobutu's exit from the political scene could ease  the tension and prevent an armed conflict in the future.    Despite the disapperance of the alleged communist expansion,  Mobutu continues to be an important part of Washington's and  Paris' economic and political interests in Africa.    It is no secret that the United States and France are vying  for greater economic control in that region of the world.</p>

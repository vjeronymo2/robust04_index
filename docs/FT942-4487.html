			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Management digs in for north - Two executives are considering making bids / British Coal, The Bidders They cannot both fulfil their ambitions, but British Coal executives Mr Bob Siddall and Mr Alan Houghton, will take some persuading before they give up the fight. Mr Siddall and Mr Houghton, directors of Coal's opencast operations and northern group respectively, are leading two of three management buy-out teams considering bids for British Coal assets. The snag is that both want the central north region; Mr Siddall as part of a portfolio of three regions comprising the whole of England; Mr Houghton as a stand-alone company. A third management team is led by Mr Bryan Riddleston, who wants the south Wales region. As regional director for the south Wales opencast operations, he already runs what is on offer. His problem is that south Wales is thought to be one of the more popular regions in the privatisation. But at least there is no internal rival to divide the loyalties of managers and employees. Senior British Coal executives believe Mr Siddall and Mr Houghton should reach a deal and join forces. Some doubt the wisdom of either making a bid. After all, none of the five executive board members have thrown their hats into the ring in spite of the promise of funds from government to help managements wishing to stage a buy-out. A year or two ago, Mr Ray Proctor and Mr Andrew Horsler, now finance and commercial directors respectively, appeared obvious candidates to be MBO leaders. Both are in their 40s, both are widely respected within the industry and both have chosen to steer through the privatisation of British Coal as employees of the seller, the government, rather than resign and take the opportunity to become buyers. Neither will disclose their reasons but it is common knowledge that British Coal tried hard to persuade the government to privatise British Coal as one entity. Following their failure to win the argument Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, has warned repeatedly that there could be casualties after privatisation as companies compete with each other in buyers' markets. Mr Siddall's team, which also includes Mr David Brewer, British Coal's head of finance, is aiming to keep at least the largest part of the corporation in one piece. 'You need critical mass to manage the environmental and mining risks in this type of business,' said Mr Siddall. If his English Coal company were to bid successfully for all three English regions, it would take control of 15 of British Coal's 16 deep pits mines still in operation. Mr Siddall's company is also considering bids for five of the six pits which have been closed by British Coal in recent months and which are being offered as stand-alone pits. Such ambition is perhaps natural in the son of Sir Norman Siddall, who was considered one of the coal industry's more effective leaders in a career which culminated in the chairmanship of the National Coal Board, British Coal's predecessor, in 1982-83. Mr Bob Siddall, now 49, joined the industry 28 years ago after studying mining engineering at Nottingham University. Within three years he was an assistant pit manager and his subsequent career has included spells as director of north and south Yorkshire. He was appointed opencast director last September. He is said to be keen on people management skills. His peers and seniors consider him a good mining engineer who has yet to prove himself as a top flight manager. The number crunching role would be provided by Mr Brewer, 47, who started at British Coal as a management trainee and was appointed head of finance in 1993. He is highly regarded. Mr Houghton, whose company is called Northern Coal, and Mr Siddall are said to have an uneasy relationship. Mr Houghton, 56, made it to regional director from humble origins, having started as a miner at 15 in Lancashire. He became a pit deputy eight years later and an undermanager within another five. His subsequent career has included spells as chief mining engineer in south Midlands and director of the Selby group. He became northern director last September. He is known for his colourful language. 'He seems to have been trying to curb his reputation for effing and blinding recently but he is still known as an arse kicking engineer,' said a colleague. Critics see him as aggressive and dogmatic. Supporters say that that helps him to get things done. 'He fights his corner,' said one. 'He has kept pits open that others would have given up on.' In south Wales, Mr Riddleston is an enthusiast for the product, mainly high quality anthracite or 'black diamonds' as he calls it. In his six years output has almost doubled. Mr Riddleston, 46, is a chemistry graduate of Wadham College, Oxford. He joined the industry's operational research establishment in 1970 but later switched to accountancy within British Coal. He is admired by some of British Coal's senior executives but not by all the people who work for him. Neither Mr Peter Weavers, his projects development manager, nor Mr John Wooliscroft, operations manager, have joined the bid team. However Mr Riddleston's company, Celtic Energy, has attracted Mr Mark Thomas and Mr Eric Blank, regional accountant and marketing specialist respectively. 'It is the strongest team to win,' he says.

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Offsetting a loss OVER THE past three years I have made a substantial loss on investment bonds made with a life company, but gains on my own share portfolio. Can one be offset against the other for CGT purposes? We take it that, in your first sentence, you mean that you have surrendered single-premium life policies for less than the premium which you paid in each case. That being so, the answer is no (by virtue of sections 210(2) and 16(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

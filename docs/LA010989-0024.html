			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Veteran Hollywood photographer Murray Garrett can name drop with the best of  them: Marlon Brando, Gary Cooper, Bette Davis, Kirk Douglas, Joan Crawford,  Betty Grable, Tyrone Power, Jane Russell, Lana Turner and Loretta Young. He  photographed these and many other celebrities during a 27-year career  (1946-73), and his portraits of familiar faces will go on display today  (through Feb. 17) at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly  Hills. His first assignment in 1942 (when he was 16) was to photograph Eleanor  Roosevelt. "Things were different then and photographers weren't enemies," says  Garrett. "I had the good fortune of becoming friendly with these people and  they trusted me."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> MANDELA RELEASE: WHEN, NOT IF  </P> <P> The justice minister today said jailed black leader Nelson Mandela definitely  will be freed and might be asked to be a mediator between the government and  the outlawed African National Congress.  </P> <P> Hendrik J. Coetsee, in an interview with the newspaper of the governing  National Party, said the question no longer was whether Mandela would be  released, "but when and under what circumstances."  </P> <P> Coetsee was responding to widespread speculation that Mandela will be freed  within the next few weeks, but he gave no indication when the release would  occur.  </P> <P> The Cabinet is to meet Wednesday in Cape Town. South African political  correspondents said Mandela's release is certain to be discussed, as well as  the possible lifting of the 30-year ban on the African National Congress, which  Mandela led when he entered prison in 1962.  </P></p>

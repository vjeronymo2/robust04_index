Hata, speaking to the day's  session of the House of Councillors' Foreign Affairs Committee,  said "international society should take a firm stance in unison  against North Korea."    Hata also said, "It is necessary to leave a window for  dialogue with the North. I want to talk frankly about the issue  when Mr. Juppe comes."    Juppe is visiting Japan from Thursday through Sunday for  talks with Hata, the Foreign Ministry said.    It is his third visit since assuming the post last April.  Juppe will also pay a courtesy call on Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, the ministry said.    North Korea, which denies building a nuclear bomb, refused  to  allow experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  to freely inspect all its nuclear facilities. The IAEA  dispatched its team to the North earlier this month but it was  barred from inspecting one of the key sites.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Expanded Scope for Already Approved Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on expanding the analytical scope of these five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods were favorable. These methods, EPA Methods 200.8, 200.9,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 300.0, SM 4110B, and American Society for Testing and Materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ASTM) method D4327&hyph;91, were discussed in the 1993 proposal or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1994 NOA. Specific comments requesting that approved methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover additional analytes are described and answered below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter asked EPA to expand the scope of Method 200.8 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include additional metals that are not currently regulated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA. While EPA encourages laboratories to use any approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method for all contaminants that are within the analytical scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the method, EPA can only approve a method for contaminants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are regulated. One commenter asked why Method 200.9 did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the secondary drinking water contaminant, zinc. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes analysis of zinc with Method 200.9 is impractical,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the instrument and procedure used are very sensitive to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small amounts of lead. The analysis is subject to random  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination, and the concentration range of zinc that can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reliably measured is too narrow to be of use with typical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drinking water samples. EPA recommends more suitable methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (EPA 200.7, 200.9, SM 3120B and SM 3111B) for measurement of zinc  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in drinking water samples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters were concerned about expanding the scope of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ion chromatography methods to include fluoride. They believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that EPA did not have data to show that interference problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not preclude use of ion chromatography for the analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fluoride in drinking water samples. EPA's 1990 study (Bionetics)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which involved participation of seventeen laboratories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated that fluoride can be reliably measured in drinking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water samples with ion chromatography. Thus, EPA has no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hesitation in approving the three proposed ion chromatography  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods for the analysis of fluoride in drinking water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Updated Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment on updating earlier versions of six methods to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current versions was favorable. These methods, EPA Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 504.1, 515.2, 524.2, 525.2, 548.1 and 549.1, were discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1993 proposal or the 1994 NOA. Problems were reported by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter with the use of trimethylsilyldiazomethane (TMSD) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derivatization of the analytes in Methods 515.1 and 515.2. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that EPA also allow the use of diazomethane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for this purpose. EPA agrees with the commenter and, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in the 1993 proposal, EPA allows use of either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derivatizing reagent. However, because dalapon is not adequately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derivatized by TMSD, the use of TMSD in Method 515.1 is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved for analysis of dalapon. Procedures for using TMSD with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methods 515.1 and 515.2 are described in the document  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notes on Drinking Water Methods  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (EPA, 1994d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Updates to Methods by Reference to Most Recent Manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments were favorable on approving versions of previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved methods that are now contained in the eighteenth edition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Standard Methods  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (APHA, 1992) and in five new EPA manuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (EPA, 1994a, 1991, 1990a, 1992b and 1993a). These publications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were described and discussed in the 1993 proposal or the 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NOA. Questions or requests from commenters about some of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods contained in these publications are described and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> answered below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994 EPA Metals Manual (EPA, 1994a)&blank;Three commenters asked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to add other regulated metals to the scope of Method 200.7,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because use of a new axial configured inductively coupled plasma  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) instrument improves the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitivity of the method to the required regulatory limits. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not approve this request in today's rule, because Method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 200.7 as written allows use of other types of ICP/AES instruments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that cannot meet the regulatory limits for the additional metals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To extend the scope of Method 200.7 as suggested by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters would require either a formal ATP approval (EPA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993c), or publication of a new AES method that allowed only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments with an axial configuration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian, </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. V. Ovcharenko, G. P. Sumkin, V. V. Sulima; </F> UDC 621.397.13:629.783]    [Abstract] A rotation mechanism with two rotation axes is  normally required for rearranging the pattern of satellite TV  antennas which would provide independent setting of azimuth and  the axis' angle. Thus, the antenna can be directed in two stages  to the selected satellite using its angular coordinates.  However, the construction of the directing mechanism can be  simplified, if the limits of the receiving antenna pattern are  taken into account. Methods are described in this paper for  computing accurate angular coordinates of optimal rotation axis  of a single-rotation satellite communication receiving antenna,  and the estimates are made of the maximum angular error in  directing such antenna at specified locations, and coordinates  of the satellite range of longitudes.

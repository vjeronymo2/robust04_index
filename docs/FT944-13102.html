			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI lower Chemicals giant ICI came up with some very solid figures yesterday but the market wanted something extra and reacted accordingly when it didn't get it. Analysts had expected the profits between Pounds 120m and Pounds 145m. The final figure was Pounds 143m accompanied with a meeting generally acknowledged to be positive. Analysts upgraded forecasts but marketmakers had generally been long of stock and the surplus saw the shares fall 12 1/2 to 786 1/2 p with 4.6m traded. The reaction was much as anticipated following strong outperformance against the broad market over the past six months. But there were divided views afterwards. James Capel, which has a top of the range forecast of Pounds 520m for the full year, reiterated its view that 'the market is already discounting very strong profit growth'.</p>

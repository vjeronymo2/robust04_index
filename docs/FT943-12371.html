			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Kuwaiti deal for South Korea South Korea's Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Company has won the civil works contract to build a 2,400MW power station at Subiyah, in a remote area near Bubiyan Island on the northern side of Kuwait Bay, for Kuwait's Ministry of Communications, Electricity and Water. Hyundai's bid of KD125m (Dollars 422m) was about Dollars 45m less than the second lowest, submitted by the UK's Wimpey in a joint venture with the Greek-headquartered but locally registered Consolidated Contractors (CCC). Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is supplying and constructing the turbines and boilers under a Dollars 1.3bn contract awarded last March. Poland's Polymex is to supply the oil and water tanks. Local Kuwaiti companies are to benefit from other subsidiary work, an important factor in an economy where state contracts outside the petroleum sector are scarce. CCC has a contract worth Dollars 100m to supply the fuel lines from Doha power station to Subiyah, and Kuwait's Gulf Dredging Company is to build the offshore water intake cooling system. Consultant at Subiyah is the UK's Merz &amp; McLellan. Subiyah is due to be completed in 2000, although the first two units, providing 600MW, will come on stream in 1997. This additional generating capacity will be more than sufficient to satisfy Kuwait's power needs over the next four years. Total generating capacity is estimated to be almost 7,000MW, with water desalination capacity of more than 200m gallons a day, compared with peak summer consumption levels of some 4,000MW and 160m gallons a day. Plans to build a power station - and indeed an entire city - at Subiyah pre-date the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2 1990. Since the end of the war, the population of Kuwait has fallen by nearly 30 per cent, raising questions about the need to develop areas in the north, especially at a time of chronic budget deficits, cuts in government spending and plans to introduce personal income taxes. Diplomatic and industry sources suggest there are two reasons why the government is willing to spend Dollars 2bn on Subiyah. Subiyah will be linked with the rest of the national grid, so its additional capacity can compensate for the demands that will come with building the proposed petrochemical complex at Shuaiba, south of Kuwait city. This Dollars 2bn plant is to be a joint venture between Kuwait's Petrochemical Industries Company and the US's Union Carbide. Also, the government's development of the northern part of Kuwait, including Subiyah and neighbouring Bubiyan Island, would be a clear statement of intent to Iraq that the Kuwaiti government is consolidating its presence in the north by proceeding with its pre-war development plans. With the fourth anniversary of Iraq's invasion a week away, such a statement from Kuwait is symbolic, as Iraq has refused to recognise either Kuwait or the new United Nations boundary between the two countries.</p>

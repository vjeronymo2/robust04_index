			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Not accountable yet Norman Lamont's Mansion House speech was a meatier document than usual. Most of the new material was logically second level. That is, it did not contain policy decisions but information on how decisions will be taken. This, however, has its importance, especially in view of the widespread and justified disquiet about how decisions relating to ERM membership and departure were taken. Far and away the most important announcement is that the governor of the Bank of England is to provide a regular report in the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin on progress towards the inflation target. It will be made by the Bank rather than the Treasury in the hope that this will increase public confidence in the objectivity of the analysis, although the chancellor and his Treasury team will still see prepublished drafts. A toenail is thus being put into the bowl marked 'independent central bank'. The inspiration has clearly been New Zealand, where the Reserve Bank has a contract with the government to pursue a given rate of inflation which it can only override in carefully pre-stated circumstances. In the UK, however, there is still to be neither contract nor independence of action. To provide an incentive for improved policy, a specific person or group, preferably at one stage removed from the political process, needs to be personally accountable for monetary policy - and not for other subjects such as financial regulation. Indeed the move may turn out to be a retrograde one if it is treated as a substitute for a new Bank of England Act, giving the Bank specific tasks. A simple reshuffle of responsibilities among the team who gave us Black Wednesday, with all decisions supposedly coming as acts of judgment fully grown from the chancellor's head, like Athene from the head of Zeus, will not meet the bill. The curse of the British establishment is that everyone is jointly responsible for everything and no one is responsible for anything in particular. Another innovation, to which I can give only a tepid welcome, is the proposed forecasting panel of between six and 12 outside experts which will publish a report three or four times a year. The idea goes back to a paper entitled Disarming the Treasury, written by Alan Budd - now the Treasury's chief economic adviser - in the late 1970s. But a big difference is that, in the original Budd paper, the Treasury would cease to be a forecasting organisation, which would make a big difference to its whole outlook and ethos. I supported Budd's original proposal, not because I was enamoured of forecasting but because, as the title suggested, it might reduce the role of an official Treasury which then did not accept that inflation was a monetary phenomenon and based its hopes on incomes policy. But the proposal in which I had my heart was for a Council of Economic Advisers which would be concerned primarily with policy analysis and which was proposed jointly by Peter Jay and myself to a parliamentary committee in the early 1970s. My fear about the new forecasting panel is that it will strengthen the preoccupation with short-term forecasts, held even more by the Treasury's critics as by the Treasury itself, and the profoundly misguided view that making such forecasts is what economics is all about. Something might be rescued from the idea if, contrary to present intentions, there were one or two members of the panel who did not operate a forecasting model and made up their minds on some other basis. One such basis is suggested by Nigel Lawson in his forthcoming book, The View from Number 11 (to be published on Thursday by Bantam Press at Pounds 20). It does not appear in the conclusions, but almost as throwaway remarks in a chapter on the background to the 1988 Budget: Repeal the 'absurd 1975 Industry Act requirement that the Treasury must maintain a forecasting model'. Meanwhile adopt a conventional assumption that the immediate future will be a repetition of the immediate past - in the present instance that the recession will continue to deepen. Never forecast a turning point because it will probably not occur in the year in question. Efforts should concentrate on establishing what in fact has happened in the recent past. Decisions 'should be based as little as possible on short-term forecasts or even on the suggested conventional assumption'. These off-the-cuff ideas are fallible and imperfect. Improving them would make a more useful task than poring over yet more sets of futuristic numbers. Best of all would be if all members of the proposed panel had to pass an examination in Sir Karl Popper's Poverty of Historicism, from which they would learn the difference between genuine social science and crystal-gazing dressed up with numbers.</p>

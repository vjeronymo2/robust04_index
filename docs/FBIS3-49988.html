			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tuzla Mayor Selim Beslagic by Salih Brkic in </F> Tuzla on 19 January -- recorded]    [Text] [Brkic] It has been 15 months now since Dubrave  Airport near Tuzla was completely upgraded so as to be able to  receive even the largest of aircraft, but nothing has happened,  and the world community is still giving in to chetnik threats  that they will shell it continuously with heavy artillery if it  is opened. So politics is still what is preventing the lifting  of the 10-month-long blockade of Tuzla and this region, even in  this way. This is what Selim Beslagic, Tuzla city mayor, says:    [Beslagic] The military officials of UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] have visited the airport in the presence of a U.S.  officer, who said after the visit that they could equip Dubrave  Airport to receive aircraft within two and a half hours. This  means that international experts believe that Dubrave Airport  can under these conditions and without [word indistinct]  elements receive these (aircraft). I think that the airport is  in the hands of politics, primarily in the hands of the  blackmailing policy of the fascist aggressor -- when I say  fascist, I mean the Serb-Montenegrin bandits -- and it seems to  me that NATO, Europe, and the United Nations must bare their  teeth and finally show whether they are for or against fascism.  If they are for fascism, they will not open the airport. If  they are against fascism, I think that the airport will be  opened. I personally hope that it (will be the latter).    [Brkic] This winter some 635,000 people in this region have  been living a nightmare when it comes to the delivery of food  and survival. Mr. Beslagic, what would the opening of this  airport mean?    [Beslagic] The opening of Dubrave Airport has two functions.  The first one, I believe, is psychological, to lift the  blockade, the psychological blockade, as we are simply blocked  here and if aircraft [words indistinct], it would mean that  there is a way out. The second is humanitarian, which again  [words indistinct] the delivery of food, a regular flow of food,  and I can tell you immediately that [words indistinct] and part  of the European blackmail.    [Brkic] Over the last few days the world has been saying  that this airport near Tuzla will after all be opened. It  remains to be seen whether this is just another game.</p>

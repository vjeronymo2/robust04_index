Nikolaus S. (29) from  Vienna-Hernals is said to have smuggled 80 to 100 kg of the  "Tscharas" type of the drug from India to Austria in the past  eight years. The man is currently in India. Alfred H. (37) and  Wilhelm B. (38) from Vienna-Fuenfhaus were imprisoned. It is  assumed that they distributed the drugs.    During a search of Wilhelm B.'s apartment, 2,850 grams of  cannabis resin were seized. Alfred H. is suspected of having  sold heroin daily to between five and seven for several  distributors in 1992 and 1993. [passage omitted]</p>

The article  examines possible radiation effects of releases of Novovoronezh  AES on forest planting, because in the AES vicinity there are  forests with various tree species, including coniferous species  (at a distance of about 2 km from the AES). Estimates of the  spectrum of probable AES effects on the forests can be  considered typical for the majority of AESs in Russia and  Ukraine, as well as in other countries. Dose loads on forest  biogeocenoses located within a 30 km zone were calculated. The  calculations took into account the forecast of changing  radionuclide content in the near-ground atmospheric layer near  the AES due to scheduled decommissioning of its 2nd, 3rd, 4th  and 5th power units and several other engineering facilities and  commissioning of the 6th and 7th power units. It was concluded  that at present the Novovoronezh AES meets ecological safety  requirements during normal operation. Effects of ionizing  radiation from the maximum possible accident under the design  conditions and the heaviest accident exceeding design conditions  are analyzed. It is concluded that under certain AES accident  scenarios radiation damage of adjacent forest planting is  possible. This calls for conducting appropriate assessment  during the design and construction of new AESs and for  ecological control of operation of the existing AESs.

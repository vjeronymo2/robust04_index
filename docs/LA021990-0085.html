			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS / ALLAN SLOAN: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> THERE ARE PLENTY MORE STILL TRAPPED IN ROACH MOTEL  </P> <P> Just because the world didn't end in a puff of smoke last week when Drexel  Burnham Lambert went belly-up, you shouldn't make the mistake of thinking that  things have settled down in the junk bond market. Far from it. There is plenty  of carnage yet to come. The apparent calm is deceiving.  </P> <P> The absence of a collapse wasn't because the market calmly absorbed the bad  news about Drexel, which invented the modern junk bond market and was then  consumed by its own creation. The reason the market didn't blow apart is that  regulators and junk bond holders were trying to keep the market rising by the  power of talk alone -- and because there weren't very many actual transactions  taking place.  </P> <P> To understand why things in the junk market are actually worse than they look,  you have to understand that the junk bond market isn't a real market. At one  point, when Drexel Burnham and Michael Milken were flying high, parts of the  market were probably real. But that was a long time ago.  </P> <P> In a real market, you can buy or sell sizable blocks of securities at something  close to the quoted prices. In today's junk market, you can buy as much as you  want at the quoted prices, or even lower. But except for a few issues -- such  as some of the bonds issued in the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout last year --  it's virtually impossible to sell significant numbers of bonds without driving  the price way down. And even then, it's iffy.  </P> <P> Think of the junk market as a financial Roach Motel: You can check in, but you  can't check out. Why has this happened? It's a chicken-and-egg problem. When  people have faith in the junk market, the market functions, and the fact that  it functions reinforces the faith. When people lose faith -- which has been the  case for months -- the market doesn't function. When the market doesn't  function, no one has faith.  </P> <P> Junk boomed in the early 1980s because Drexel Burnam Lambert, under the  inspiration of Milken, the now-deposed junk bond king, brought new believers  into the tent. Before Milken, who in his prime was a marvelous analyst and  possibly the world's best salesman, junk bonds were shunned as being too risky  and too tacky for most investors.  </P> <P> But as the gospel according to Milken gained adherents, normally conservative  investors -- pension funds, traditional insurance firms, mutual fund buyers,  even the occasional bank trust department -- began putting money into these  strange, complicated securities. Because the supply of junk buyers expanded  more quickly than Milken and his imitators at other brokerages could spew out  more junk, the prices of these securities kept rising. While the occasional  bond issuer might crater, a mania set in and everyone just had to put junk  bonds into his or her portfolio or be laughed out of the bars where money  managers go to drown their sorrows. Unlike the stock market, where brokers  match sellers and buyers, the bond market is one in which the broker typically  buys the bonds from you and resells them to someone else.  </P> <P> To make this go smoothly, brokerage houses had to carry very large inventories  of bonds. They didn't mind doing this, even though they had to borrow billions  of dollars on a short-term basis to carry the inventory.  </P> <P> The beauty of this, for the brokers, was that the interest rates on the bonds  they carried in their inventory was higher than the interest rates that the  brokers paid on their short-term borrowings. What's more, since junk prices  were heading upward, the value of their inventory rose. A double profit. Pretty  neat.  </P> <P> But what happens when junk prices begin to head downward? Funny you should ask.  </P> <P> When bonds are heading down, no one dares to hold a lot of them in inventory.  Even if you are making a spread of four points a year by carrying Texas Air  notes yielding 15% a year with borrowed money that's costing you 11%, you can  get killed in an eye blink if the bonds fall five or 10 points in a day, which  is the kind of thing that's been happening. Because there's not much inventory  at the brokers, the market gets choppy. When the market gets choppy, everyone  wants to sell -- but there's no one to sell to. Just as the cycle feeds on  itself going up, it feeds on itself going down.  </P> <P> The most prominent victim of this downward death spiral is Drexel itself. One  of the major reasons the firm went busto is that the value of its bond  inventory rotted out and nervous lenders cut off credit. Even though Drexel  tried to protect itself by cutting down its inventory, it got killed anyway.  </P> <P> The current collapse of junk prices was started last summer when Integrated  Resources, one of Drexel's stranger creatures, announced out of the blue that  it was defaulting on its debts. It seemed only fitting that Drexel and  Integrated -- the creator and the creation -- filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy  petitions the same day.  </P> <P> The fall of Drexel and Integrated is part of a historical process. The junk  bond explosion of the 1980s is being replaced by the junk bond implosion of the  1990s, as the market collapses in on itself. Unless you are a professional  willing to spend a lot of time and take a lot of risk, you will do well to take  your money off the table and go home. Some junk bonds may, in fact, be so cheap  that they're bargains now. But if history is a guide, they'll be a lot cheaper  a year from now.  </P></p>

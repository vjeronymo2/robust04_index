			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- ROSSISKIYE VESTI on President  Boris Yeltsi's working trip to Tatarstan: the newspaper  believes that special attention during the tour will be devoted  to problems connected with the rebuilding of the motor engine  making plant, after it was gutted out by fire last year, at the  kamaz, one of russia's largest autoworks in Naberezhnyye Chelny.    ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA singles out a statement by Vice-Premier  Sergey Shakray that the purpose of Yeltsin's trip to Tatarstan  is to work out a mechanism to monitor compliance with the treaty  between Russia and Tatarstan "plus an economic agreement".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries and article headlined "How Much  Sovereignty Did Tatarstan Gain? boris Yeltsin Decided To See  That for Himself". The newspaper recalls that it was precisely  in Tatarstan when Yeltsin as Russian praliament chief running  for the presidency, uttered his famous phrase: "Take as much  sovereignty as you can chew".    President Yeltsin can now make a real assessment of what has  been done in this respect by the republic "which through  persistent efforts over the past two years has gained, perhaps,  the greatest independence from Moscow", the newspaper noted.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) focuses on the discussion of a  bill "on a state-placed defence order" at the State Duma  committee for industry, construction, transport and power.  Drafters of the bill are of the opinion, the newspaper points  out, that such a law will make it possible "more fully to enact  Russia's military doctrine, enhance the material interests of  all those who fill a state-placed defence order, raise the role  of state contracts and agreements, and guarantee material and  technical resources for defence industry needs". The first  reading of the bill is to be considered in the state Duma at the  end of June.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, in connection with the current exhibition  of weapons in Vladimir, writes that "our country,  notwithstanding a first-class defence potential, has not even  approached the main sale counters of the arms market". "The  spheres of influence at the market have long been divided, and  it is not easy to get there now. But the country must get  there", for even individual specimens of the most effective  small arms cost hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars," the  newspaper points out.    TRUD on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's homecoming: The return of  the great writer and citizen, who was forcibly expelled from the  country twenty years ago, was awaited by many with impatience  and hope, if only because they saw that as the restoration of  historical justice".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the death of former East German  leader Erich Honecker: "Honecker was a staunch romanticist of  the communist idea. Unlike his fellow leaders in Eastern  European countries, not a single reproach connected with an  abuse of official position for personal gain was flung at him."    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA maintains that the package of  presidential  decrees, signed on May 23, which cancels export quota-fixing and  licensing, plunges the country into a new phase of a "democratic  revolution". The newspaper writes that the decrees considerably  ease the tax burdern of enterprises with foreign capital and  "obligingly fling the gate to the west inordinately wide open".    PRAVDA on the 95th birthday of writer Leonid Leonov: "There  is no precedent in the history of world culture when a writer, a  national classic, would mark his 95th birthday with the  publication of a new novel summing up the philosophical and  ethical results of a whole stage in the history of world  civilisation. The novel in question is The Puramid,  the publication of which has been started by Nash Sovremennik  (our contemporary) literary journal".    ROSSIISKIYE VESTI reports, referring to a statement by  Ukrainian first Deputy Interior Minister Valentin Nedrigailo,  that "there will be no war in the Crimea". An article to this  effect, headlined "Partnership for Peace: Realities and the  Interests of Russia", propounds the idea that it is possible to  maintian stability in Europe "only in active cooperation with  Russia".</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Travel: Mexico's Chichen Itza - 'Fantastico, no?' / In the Yucatan, Nicholas Woodsworth tackles Mayan maths and astronomy and takes a turn around the square in Merida 'Now this,' said Senor Gomez pointing, 'is called El Castillo in Spanish. It means the castle. But it is not a castle. It is a highly accurate multi-purpose calendar.' WE TURNED in the direction he indicated, but saw neither a castle nor a calendar. Instead, set in the middle of a vast grassy area where guided tourist groups scurried to and fro, we saw a broad terraced pyramid rising 75ft into the air. Built of grey stone, it was the exact colour of the heavy storm clouds that hung in the sky behind it. On each of its four sides a steep flight of steps led up to a flat-topped temple at its summit. Like ants on an antheap, the stairs and temple-top were crawling with hundreds of figures dressed in bright red-and-yellow nylon rain-jackets. Rain threatened. Our own party was a large, mixed group - mostly German, Italian and Japanese  -and few of us had an easy command of English. But this did not stop Senor Gomez from delivering his guided commentary in a succession of rapid, jerky bursts that left little time for reflection on what it all might mean. This, after all, was a busy day at Chichen Itza, the most famous of the Yucatan's Maya Indian ruins, and it looked as if the weather might break at any minute. 'Now why do I say El Castillo is a multi-purpose calendar?' A Japanese lady lifted a video camera to her eye and began filming him. 'Well, the Mayas were very interested in measuring time. There are 91 steps on each of the four faces of the pyramid. That makes 364. Add one more for the platform at the top and that makes 365, the exact number of days in one year.' He beamed at us as if this explained it all. But there was more. 'Also, the staircases on each of the pyramid's nine levels show the 18 months of the Maya solar year, and the 52 panels on each side show the 52-year periods of the Maya calendar cycle.' Senor Gomez was getting into his stride. 'How did the Mayas combine their ritual calendar of 260 days and their solar calendar of 365 days so the same calculations were possible on both? Easy - they found a common divisor. Both numbers are divisible by five. By multiplying five times 52 cycles of 365 days by 73 cycles of 260 days, they obtained 18,980 days, or 52 years, permitting perfect computations within the Maya 52-year calendar cycle.' We stared at him, speechless. 'Fantastico, no?' Senor Gomez glared around him, as if waiting to be challenged on the clarity of his explanation. Nobody challenged him. The Japanese lady stopped filming. 'Say again,' she said. 'No time,' shouted Senor Gomez over his shoulder as he strode off across the grass, perspiring in the warm and muggy air. 'Now follow me to the Ball Court. It is a very interesting game. Under Maya rules, the captain of the team that won was sacrificed to the gods. It was a great honour. Funny, no? Come. I have many, many things to show you.' I had had enough and wandered off to climb El Castillo. A puffing 91 steps later, I was standing on the top and looking out over the endless, dull green, table-flat jungle of the Yucatan peninsula. How odd that in the midst of this great expanse of nothing a people more than 1,000 years ago should have built great cities. How much odder that they developed a high theocratic culture with advanced mathematics and astronomy at its pinnacle. It was scarcely surprising, I thought, that in a tour lasting barely two hours Senor Gomez found himself hard put to explain the complexities of Mayan civilisation. Its subtle yet exacting combination of science and spirituality has baffled trained minds ever since ruined cities began re-emerging from the Yucatan jungles a century ago. Together, Mayan culture and Senor Gomez had certainly baffled my mind. But the complexities of pre-history have not stopped Yucatan from becoming one of the most popular regions for visitors to Mexico today. Almost everyone who comes to the peninsula that divides the Caribbean from the Gulf of Mexico is attracted by the lure of the ancient Mayas. They end up enjoying it not just for the ruins of the Mayas of the past  - which tend to be over-crowded, commercialised and difficult to understand - but for a special atmosphere created by the Mayas of the present. Rain began to splatter in heavy, warm drops. Straggling crowds streamed through acres of monuments to seek shelter in refreshment stands and tour coaches. On the way home to our hotels, a long, dreary drive through low tropical bushland, the rain continued to fall in heavy sheets. By the time we reached Merida some two hours later, water had flooded the narrow streets of the town, stalled cars at intersections, and was lapping over the sidewalks. Unable to stir out, I spent the afternoon watching the rain fall onto the lush vegetation of the inner courtyard garden of the Grande Hotel. A long, cool drink at hand, I lay back in a rattan-woven planter's chair, the kind in which colonials in every tropical outpost from Calcutta to Kumasi have taken their ease. Surrounded by pillastered columns, etched-glass windows, tropical hardwood furniture and slowly-whirling fans, I felt like a Merida sisal king. In the mid-1850s, some 300 years after the Spanish conquistadors had virtually enslaved the Mayas, Spanish landowners discovered sisal. Used for making rope and matting, the fibre found a ready market in Europe and the US. By the late 19th century, the great plantation owners had made Merida a gracious colonial city boasting more millionaires per capita than any other in the world. They sent their children to the best schools in Europe, imported treasures from all over the world, and led the luxurious life of an aristocracy. To the baroque cathedrals, governors' palaces and colonial plazas built by earlier generations of Spaniards in Merida, they added scores of French-inspired mansions and the Paseo Montejo - a miniature Champs Elysees. The boom in sisal is long over but Merida's traditions and independent spirit, like its architecture, food, music and language, remain. For centuries Yucatecans have lived isolated lives on their southern peninsula. Cut off from the rest of the country by vast swamps and jungles, they have always been a group apart, and proud of it. And what of those Yucatecans who are descended from the builders of the pyramids? Present-day Mayas - many of them remain pure-blooded - may have lost political independence and the ability to calculate precise dates 90m years in advance, but they remain gentle, intelligent, good-humoured people. To anyone coming from other large Mexican cities where traditional machismo is so much part of the culture, Merida's 500,000 inhabitants seem an unusually relaxed and friendly lot. By the time darkness fell, the rain had stopped, the streets had dried, and I was able to venture out for that favourite Merida past-time, the evening paseo. Crowds of strollers had gathered on the Plaza Mayor, and Christmas, only days away, had brought to the square a special atmosphere. Trees, lamp-standards and statues were festooned with coloured lights and paper. At wheeled streetside stalls, dark-haired women in embroidered blouses were selling snacks of fried plantain, roasted corn and refreshing glasses of sweet, almond-flavoured horchata. From long poles balanced on their shoulders, ambulating hawkers sold children's toys: balloons, horns, masks and flutes. Dressed in their holiday best, enormous families piled into horse-drawn carriages for an idle tour of the town. There was no lack of entertainment. Outside the door of the Grande Hotel, a sidewalk marimba band was floating hot Latin rhythms out into the night. Up the street in the cathedral, a choir was singing Mozart's Requiem. And on the square itself, tiny children with dark, bright eyes were re-enacting the Nativity. In 80'F heat, four-year-old Wise Men in silver paper crowns and cotton-wool beards led a sad-looking Mexican donkey loaded with gifts to a manger in a mock-up Bethlehem. But I contented myself with just a turn or two around the square. I had work to do. By my bedside table lay a complex tome by the learned Prof Demitrio Morales. Its title: The Maya World. Tomorrow I would be visiting Uxmal, another of the Yucatan's great archaeological sites. I was determined this time, with the professor's help, not to be taken by surprise by a certain Senor Gomez. There are no direct flights between the UK and Mexico. Nicholas Woodsworth flew to Yucatan with American Airlines (London tel: 081-572-5555), which flies via Miami to the Yucatan resort city of Cancun. Car hire in Mexico is expensive - about Dollars 80 a day - but many local companies organise tours of Mayan archaeological sites. The best time to visit Yucatan is between September and April, when rainfall is at its lowest. Expect, nonetheless, a warm and humid tropical climate, and take rainwear.

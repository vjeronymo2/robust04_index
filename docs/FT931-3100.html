			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Jobs: Those who pay the managerial piper .. - Rude awakening for victims of decades-long refusal to face up to a fundamental question 'STOP them making that noise,' ordered the Jobs column's wife, elbowing it out of sleep in the early hours. Unable to hear anything - it was before we had children - I asked which noise she meant. Her reply was my first introduction to the experience of a haunting mystery. 'They're playing that tune Oldham on the tins,' she said. She then lapsed into coma, leaving me lying there twitching. After all, my failure to hear any untimely music-makers might have been simply because I was too deeply asleep. Nor was the momentary quiet any guarantee that they wouldn't strike up again as soon as I nodded off. So deciding street rowdies must be responsible, since all of our neighbours were old, I went and got a bucket of water and put it by the window. Their next number was going to be 'Stormy weather', I vowed . . . until the mystery took me in its grip. What bugged me was not the unconventional instruments they had reputedly been playing - a scaled-down steel band, perhaps - but that I couldn't remember how the tune called 'Oldham' went. As it was named after a town, I reasoned, it must be a hymn-tune on a par with 'Aberystwyth' ('Jesu, lover of my soul . . .'). And I was just pondering whether it would be Christian to pour cold water on people performing sacred music even at an ungodly hour, when sleep supervened. Although next morning the tins-players had gone without trace, I was soon at the church consulting hymnals. But neither then nor since have I managed to come any nearer to my quarry than 'Warrington' ('O son of God, eternal love . . .'). Hence the mystery of the tune called 'Oldham' continues, and all the more hauntingly because it has now been joined by the equally bewildering quest for the book called 'The New Geo-Economics'. Once again there is a clue. The Times Literary Supplement recently named not just the book, but the author at the foot of an article he'd written. He is Edward H. Luttwak of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. But there was no mention of the book's publishers which, wanting to read it, I needed to know. Nor was there any reference to it in the FT's compendious database, and the Literary Supplement was unable to help since the article had come in by fax and the publishers' name had apparently fallen off the bottom. I therefore telephoned the Washington Center, which referred me to another number. When I called it, an answering machine referred me to a further number. It turned out to be a second answering machine which referred me to a third. And all it would say was that Dr Luttwak 'is out of town until May' which comes across as barely plausible, sounding a bit like 'he's in the bath until a week on Saturday'. So here I am stranded, not even as near as the equivalent of Warrington, which is a pity because his article suggested that his elusive book sheds light on a problem now bedevilling a great many young people. While by no means confined to Britain, it was graphically depicted by one Sha Wylie of Southampton who, after graduating last year and applying for many jobs only to receive rejections, has suffered the final indignity of having a request for an application form rejected. Understandably angry, Sha Wylie - like a lot of others similarly jobless - puts the blame squarely on the current British government's handling of the economy. My suspicion, however, is that the problem is rooted much farther back, with today's unemployed graduates hit by the cumulative effects of successive governments' neglect of a question which should have been cleared up 30 years ago. Worse, if I twig Edward Luttwak aright, standard economic measures are not going to provide an effective answer. Now, unlike 'Oldham', the long neglected question will strike enduring readers as an all too familiar tune, having last been on the order of service only five weeks ago. The question is how an education system increasingly focused on getting youngsters through academic-type tests and exams is going to arrest economic decline, let alone generate Britain's renewed prosperity. The point was glossed over by the committee of inquiry headed by the late Lord Robbins which in 1963 recommended the first post-war expansion of higher education. It was apparently just assumed that enriching the workforce with a larger share of folk educated to what is deemed a higher level, would somehow of itself make the nation more productive as well as civilised. That assumption can hardly be said to have been justified by events, which have rather borne out doubts voiced at the time by a few dissenters. They argued that increased concentration on academic pursuits would lead youngsters with at best middling talent for them to continue with scholarly studies in preference to practical training more suited to their mix of abilities. The result would be twofold. Fewer and fewer teenagers would join the workforce motivated to learn to do skilled jobs. More and more graduates would join it at the age of 20-plus, believing that their degrees entitled them to enter at a higher level even though all that most of them were practically equipped for was clerical and administrative work. True, that may have been sustainable as long as such work was plentiful. But things have changed - which brings Edward Luttwak back into the act. To judge by his article, his thesis is that while conventional macroeconomic theories might work perfectly well in a world run by economically rational people, the rationality of those who actually run same is less economic than political. Hence in their urge for power, those in the developed world have as their goal 'not the highest possible standard of living for a country's population, but rather the conquest or protection of desirable roles in the world economy.' 'The winners will have those highly rewarding and controlling roles,' he adds, 'while the losers will only have the retail business and assembly lines - if their home markets are large enough, or if fully assembled imports are kept out by trade barriers. We have already seen that when 'transplants' replace domestic production, the local employment of manual and semi-skilled labour may continue, but finance and all higher management, as well as much research and development and design, are transferred back to the country of origin.' At which point, if he's right, it is not only the Sha Wylies of Britain who will rudely awaken to their own sad role in the drama. The same may well apply to older Brits whose executive-type jobs have disappeared to places with earnings enough to pay numerous managerial pipers. Moreover, if it is true such jobs are plentiful only in the countries of origin of important productive enterprise, then supplies are unlikely to return to Britain until it has a workforce with the practical skills to do the originating. So it would seem time for the politicians to stop vesting more costly hope in the failed academic experiment, and re-engineer the education system from top to bottom. Failing that, all I can suggest is that fellow-Brits join me in a hymn - named not after a town, but for St Anne - which goes: 'O God our help in ages past . . .'</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARTNERSHIP WITH DEVELOPER TO NET DOWNEY SCHOOLS $10 MILLION  </P> <P> The Downey Unified School District has entered into an agreement with a  development company that plans to build and sell single-family homes on the  11.3-acre site of a closed elementary school.  </P> <P> The Board of Education voted in September to sell the property to M. J. Brock  &amp; Sons Inc. for $9.1 million, Supt. Edward A. Sussman said. The company  also offered to give the district 35% of its profit from the home sales, which  would be about $1 million. The district's total income would be about $10.1  million.  </P> <P> The old Edith Unsworth Elementary School, 9001 Lindsey Ave., which was closed  in 1972, will be demolished, Sussman said. The sale will not be final, however,  until Downey city officials approve the plans for the homes.  </P> <P> The development company expects to submit a formal proposal to the city at the  beginning of the year, said Les Thomas, the Orange County division manager for  M. J. Brock, headquartered in Los Angeles. "We have entered a limited  partnership with the school district to develop and sell single-family homes to  earn profits," Thomas said.  </P> <P> He said his company obtained the property through a sealed bid submitted in  September. If everything goes as planned, construction will begin sometime next  year.  </P> <P> If the city does not approve the new homes, the school district is guaranteed  the $9.1-million price for the property, Sussman said.  </P> <P> But, Sussman said he is confident that the city will grant approval, because  the property is zoned for R1-5000 single-family homes -- one house per 5,000  square feet -- and the company's preliminary presentation was for single-family  home construction.  </P> <P> "A joint venture between a school district and a developer is a new concept  that school districts have been involved in the last five years," said Eric  Bathen, legal counsel for the district for 10 years. Although the 65-35 split  of the profit is common, he said the ratio can vary.  </P> <P> Bathen has arranged a similar deal between a developer and the Fountain Valley  Elementary School District, and has heard of more arrangements of this type in  Huntington Beach and Northern California.  </P> <P> Such deals are becoming more attractive, he said, because they have tremendous  profit potential. "They work well because they benefit both parties," Bathen  said. "The developer acts as the general partner and manager of the property  and shares the profits with the school district."  </P> <P> Sussman also said that these contracts are common and that districts enter into  these agreements to gain credibility in dealing with the public, plus a share  in the profit.  </P> <P> He said that $5 million of the sale price would be used to refurbish four  buildings at Downey High School, and the rest of the money would be used to  renovate other schools in the district. "The buildings at Downey High School  are more than 30 years old and in dire need of repair," Sussman said. "There  has not been any major work done on the school since 1939."  </P> <P> Because of the need, Sussman said that construction would begin on the high  school first. The plans for renovation are complete, and work should begin in  June.  </P> <P> In April, 1988, voters rejected a bond issue to generate $11.4 million to  renovate school sites in the Downey Unified School District, Sussman said.  </P> <P> The district then applied for other state bonds, he said, but found that there  was no money available at the time. He said that even though the district  qualified for funding, it would have to wait several years.  </P> <P> The Downey board voted this year to sell one of its three vacant schools. He  said Unsworth was chosen because there are not many students in the northeast  section of Downey where the school is located, and no major growth is  anticipated. Sussman said Unsworth would not be one of the schools reopened if  overcrowding ever became a problem in the district.  </P> <P> Deputy Supt. Donna Boose said that Unsworth was the first elementary school in  Downey to be closed due to a decline in student enrollment. She was principal  of Unsworth when the district voted to close the school after enrollment fell  to 400, with projections of further decline.  </P></p>

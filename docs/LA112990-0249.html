			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 HORSES, 2 DIFFERENT ROUTES TO A REMATCH;  </P> <P> HORSE RACE: TOOTER SCOOTER BASKED IN FLORIDA SUN WHILE DIE LAUGHING WORKED OUT  UP NORTH.  </P> <P> Tooter Scooter and Die Laughing have taken different paths to their rematch  Friday in the Breeders Crown.  </P> <P> When the two colts last met, Tooter Scooter tailed Die Laughing from start to  finish in a stakes pace at the Red Mile in Lexington, Ky.  </P> <P> While Tooter Scooter has been basking in the warmth of South Florida since that  loss in October, Die Laughing has been put through a rigorous prep program in  the cooler North. The different schedules could weigh in Tooter Scooter's  favor, Joe Holloway, the colt's trainer, said.  </P> <P> "My horse has been down here lying on the beach and sending out post cards,"  Holloway said. "Die Laughing has been up North running in four or five tough  races."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Die Laughing has been made the 9-5 morning-line favorite to win  the $605,870 Colt and Gelding Pace, one of four Breeders Crown races Friday  night at Pompano Harness Track. The card for 2-year-olds is the last of 12  Breeders Crown events for 1990.  </P> <P> Artsplace, who has won 10 of 14 starts this year, was made the second choice at  5-2. Tooter Scooter is the track handicapper's 6-1 third pick.  </P> <P> "I think the track handicapper is about right," Holloway said.  </P> <P> Die Laughing, after all, has earned more than $1.1 million while winning eight  of 11 starts this year. He won the Presidential at Maryland's Rosecroft in  early November and was second by half a length to Artsplace in the Nov. 17  Governors Cup at New Jersey's Garden State Park.  </P> <P> By comparison, Tooter Scooter has earned just $388,000 while winning six of 16  starts. But he has finished no worse than second in any of his last eight  starts, including a victory in the Kentucky Pace Derby at Louisville Downs in  September.  </P></p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / German opposition claims election result still open The opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) ranged its biggest guns in front of the Bonn press yesterday, arguing that the outcome of tomorrow's election was completely open, writes Michael Lindemann in Bonn. Mr Rudolf Scharping, party leader, said it was time to modernise Germany, technologically and environmentally. Mr Oskar Lafontaine, shadow finance minister, warned voters of further tax increases if Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) won a fourth term. And Mr Gerhard Schroder, the state premier of Lower Saxony, carried on doing all he could to charm industry, saying the SPD had to learn to think about production and not just about sharing out the fruits of production. All three did their best to look as relaxed as possible, even though a final poll by the Allensbach institute shows the SPD on 35.5 per cent, up 0.6 points since Wednesday but 5.5 points behind the CDU on 41 per cent, with its coalition partners the FDP on 7.5 per cent. The Greens are on 8 per cent, and the PDS, the former communists, on 4. Whether the party could ever have won the election once Mr Kohl's bandwagon got rolling is questionable. Either way, Mr Scharping's performance has lacked conviction. The party stumbled over the question of taxation. There has also been confusion about the party's policy on motorway speed limits, a matter of considerable importance to German voters.</p>

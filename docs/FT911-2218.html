			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Salmon farmers pour oil on troubled water / A look at an environmental controversy in Chile's Lake District WHEN a group of angry Mapuche Indians and hotel owners attacked a truck in the idyllic surroundings of Chile's Lake District last winter it was time for salmon farmers to take stock of the effects of the unbridled expansion of their business. Chile's salmon exports have been doubling every year since commercial production started in 1984. Last year 18,000 tonnes of the fish was flown abroad, netting almost Dollars 100m. The salmon business is one of the success stories of Chile's efforts to diversify exports away from copper, but that success has at times run roughshod over the sensitivities of local inhabitants. Southern Chile is ideal for salmon farming. The eggs are hatched in the crystalline rivers that spring from the Andes, the young smolts grow in unpolluted lakes and the salmon mature in the relatively warm waters of the south Pacific. But the people of the Lake District fear their budding tourist industry might be endangered if the lakes become contaminated by intensive fish farming techniques. Last year a colony of Mapuche Indians living on an island in the huge and breathtaking Lake Ranco began to complain that the water was no longer safe to drink. Hotel owners around the lake noticed a brown slime on beaches close to where salmon cages had been installed. Their alarm grew on learning that one salmon farming company planned to increase the number of cages on Lake Ranco from 30 to 180. When appeals to the authorities failed the locals took the law into their own hands, setting up roadblocks to prevent feed trucks from reaching the salmon cages. After two drivers were attacked last August a truce of a kind was declared. Eicosal, the Arab-owned company at the centre of the dispute, agreed to scale down its expansion to 50 cages. It also asked university scientists to investigate the impact on the lake of their salmon cages and the high-protein fishmeal used as nutrient. The study showed that phosphate levels in Lake Ranco had increased four-fold, but that the young smolts were not its primary cause. The main polluting agents appeared to be the fertilisers that drained into the lake from the pastures of nearby dairy farms. Mr Eduardo Espinoza, the mayor of Lake Ranco, accepted the findings of the report. 'But the problem is only half solved. He would like measurements to be taken regularly, over a longer period. 'Lake Ranco is one of the purest lakes in Chile. If we allow it to deteriorate we will also be destroying our livelihood.' Mr Espinoza says part of the ill feeling towards the salmon farmers was caused by ignorance of this new activity and poor communication. This is gradually being redressed. Salmon farmers argue that it is in their best interests to keep the lakes clean. Mr Pablo Achurra, director of operations of Marine Harvest International, says: 'If the lakes became polluted, the young salmon would be the first fish to die.' He says the Chilean authorities have imposed far more stringent environmental standards on the salmon business than on dairy farmers. Marine Harvest International, a Scottish subsidiary of Unilever, has invested Dollars 25m since it launched its Chilean operation in 1987. It runs two hatcheries, four lake sites and 12 sea-water sites, which last year produced 4,700 tonnes of salmon - more than three times the catch in 1989. Mr Achurra says Marine Harvest and other companies have decided to put a brake on this frenzied expansion. Overproduction in other countries, particularly Norway, which is facing dumping charges in the US, have led Chileans to reasses their marketing strategy. Mr Achurra says: 'We no longer want to grow at exponential rates. We now have to consolidate the industry, refine our techniques and aim for consistent high quality.' The success of intensive salmon farming has brought a fall in prices. Five years ago a kilogram of salmon was fetching Dollars 10 in the US and Japan. Last year prices hovered around Dollars 5.50. Mr Rodrigo Infante, markettion of Chilean Salmon Exporters, believes this will lead to a shake-out in the industry. The high profit margins attracted a lot of cowboys to the business, but it is really an activity which favours big companies with access to the latest technology and the benefits of economies of scale. The association forecasts exports will grow 11 per cent this year to 20,000 tonnes in spite of lower prices. Profit margins are narrower, but they are not about to wipe out the business. Chilean salmon has three advantages over its competitors in Canada, Scotland and Norway. It supplies the US and Japan in winter, when fresh salmon is out of season in the northern hemisphere, Chilean salmon grows faster and to bigger sizes than its northern brethren, and its deep pink flesh is particularly prized in Japan.</p>

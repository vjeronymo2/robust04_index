			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke goes to Number 11 NORMAN LAMONT departed from Number 11 Downing Street yesterday, rather than last autumn, because the prime minister needed first to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Kenneth Clarke replaced him because of his political skills. Yet the reshuffle still looks the fruit of frailty rather than of foresight. Mr Lamont had to go. Mr Clarke is as credible a replacement as any. But the prime minister and his new chancellor have a mountainous task to demonstrate that the change means an improvement. Pity Mr Lamont, a man who has genuine achievements to his credit. The new unified Budget is one. Since sterling's exit from the ERM, he has also set an explicit target for inflation, established a new panel of outside forecasters, commissioned the Bank of England's inflation report and given an explicit counter-inflationary mandate to the new governor. Among a number of imaginative fiscal policy reforms is this year's multi-stage Budget. Above all, when Mr Lamont became chancellor of the exchequer underlying inflation was running at an annual rate of 8 per cent. Now it is 3 per cent. But this welcome change was the fruit of the longest recession since the 1930s. The recession was as unpopular as the chancellor's prattling about 'green shoots' was ill-judged. ERM membership, a policy that Mr Lamont inherited from Mr Major, made the government persist with disinflation. As such, it was the source both of the government's principal success and Mr Lamont's downfall. Ritual of reshuffles The ex-chancellor's fate has elements of irony. Since he had no choice but to reiterate his commitment to the ERM parity, sterling's exit from the ERM, which brought forward the desired recovery, inevitably destroyed his credibility. But it also damaged that of the man who had chosen both policy and chancellor. For Mr Major to be forced to drop a chancellor for damage done by the collapse of the prime minister's policy, only to replace him with a rival for the premiership, shows how badly he too has been damaged. The ritual of reshuffles can too easily be an alternative to serious policy-making. It ensures, among other things, that ministers are around long enough to do damage, but not long enough to learn from experience. The suspicion that this has been true of Mr Clarke cannot easily be stilled. The new chancellor has many merits. He is, for example, an excellent advocate for his policies. He is also prepared to take on powerful interest groups. But he sometimes seems to like upsetting people almost for its own sake. Judged by what he left behind him in health and education, he may also lack the meticulous attention to detail and intellectual rigour required of a great reforming minister. Rare opportunity Mr Clarke has, in short, much to prove in taking on the second most important job in government. A good chancellor must be both prudent and tough. He must master an exceptionally complex brief and combine broad economic vision with interest in the details of financial and fiscal reform. Not least, he must have the diplomatic skills to deal with his peers in the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and the European Community, often from a position of weakness. Above all, the chancellor must be able to work closely with the prime minister. So long as the structure of British government remains as centralised as it is, this relationship will be the pivot of politics. Important decisions have to be taken. One is whether the UK is soon to rejoin the ERM. Ideally, as Mr Clarke himself has stated, this should be postponed. If it is, however, he will be in charge of a discretionary policy, subject to huge pressures to choose another inflationary dash for growth. Nothing in British experience suggests those pressures will be resisted. But posterity will judge Mr Clarke by whether he does. He will also be judged by how imaginatively he tackles fiscal and institutional reform. Mr Clarke has at least the good fortune to inherit an economy standing on the brink of sustained recovery. He must show himself capable of combining with the prime minister to exploit that rare, if fragile, opportunity.</p>

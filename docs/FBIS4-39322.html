			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>   [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] 6 June TASS -- Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev has completed a draft document outlining  the mechanism for establishing a Eurasian union, the KAZTAG news  agency said on Monday [6 June].    The full text of the document will be published in the local  mass media on Tuesday.    The news agency said that the document does not bury the  idea  of the Commonwealth of Independent States and offers yet another  scheme of integration which will function alongside the CIS.    The union is expected to bring together only those republics  of the former Soviet Union which are ready for this kind of  cooperation and integration.    The principles of and mechanism for establishing the union  must be based on their results of "national referendums or  parliamentary decisions on joining the Eurasian union" as well  as "equality, non-interference in internal affairs of each  other, territorial integrity and inviolability of state borders."    All this will "provide the legal and organisational  framework  for furthering integration in order to set up an economic,  currency, and political union."    The draft does not provide for associative membership.  Decisions will be considered adopted if they are supported by  four-fifths of the total number of member countries.    The admission to the union is strictly conditioned. The  terms include "strict observance of the signed inter-state  agreements, mutual recognition of the existing political and  state institutions in the union member states, recognition of  territorial integrity and inviolability of borders, denunciation  of economic, political and other pressure in inter-state  relations, as well as cessation of fighting with each other."    For the union to function effectively, Nazarbayev suggests  setting up a number of supranational bodies, including the  council of heads of state and heads of government which will  have the supreme authority. Each country will preside in the  council for six months and will take turns in alphabetical order.    The union's parliament will be the highest consultative  body.  The council of foreign ministers will coordinate foreign  policies of the member countries.    Nazarbayev believes that Russian should be made the official  language of the union, which will be headquartered in a city  lying on the border of Europe and Asia, for example Kazan or  Samara.    The idea of a Eurasian union proposed by the Kazakh  president  is not the return to the past. It draws on the experience of  the European Union, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting  Countries and other international alliances, which have proved  viable.    This opinion featured prominently at a news conference in  the  Kazakh capital of Alma Ata on Monday. The participants in the  press conference said that Nazarbayev's idea is often distorted  by the mass media, which causes inadequate reaction from some  political circles considering the union as the return to Soviet  rule.    The idea is based on world experience, the existing economic  ties between the CIS countries and the effective use of their  economic potential, they said.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (10): A good deal even if RPI should fall - Inflation-proofing INFLATION IS the great enemy of savers. Even an annual rate of 5 per cent, modest by modern standards, halves the value of money in 15 years. A generation of German savers was ruined by hyperinflation in the 1920s, and British savers had a pretty rough time of it in the 1970s. In the 1980s, by contrast, high real interest rates, lower direct taxes and lower inflation helped savers to prosper. But this prosperity may have lowered savers' defences. It has been simple and secure to deposit one's cash in the building societies and enjoy the interest. It is difficult to imagine the same conditions prevailing through the 1990s. There will not be much UK economic growth if base rates remain at 10.5 per cent and inflation at 4.5 per cent - a real rate of 6 per cent. According to Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the historic average for real returns on gilts (1919-91) is 1.2 per cent and for Treasury bills (1946-91) 0.5 per cent. The likelihood is, therefore, that either inflation will rise, or interest rates will fall, to narrow the current gap. In either case, savers will suffer. The nominal value of their income may fall; the real value certainly will. Index-linked investments offer security against these dangers. There are two main types: gilt and National Savings (see letters G and N). Each guarantees to keep pace with inflation, with a cushion on top. The gilts are the more complex of the two. They will be repaid at a level that depends on the increase in the retail price index between the issue and maturity. So if the RPI on issue is 100, and at maturity is 200, the gilt will be repaid at double its issue price. That sounds simple enough. Complications start with the fact that the gilts also pay a small income, 2 to 2 1/2 per cent, which is also index-linked. The second complexity is that the actual RPIs used for indexation purposes are the ones eight months before issue and maturity. This means that the buyer is at risk from inflation in the last eight months of the life of the gilt. The result of this is that, when one buys an index-linked gilt, one cannot be sure of the nominal, or even the real, return to redemption. The convention is to quote the real yield on two assumptions - 5 and 10 per cent inflation. In late January, the real yield on the longest dated gilt (which matures in 2024) would have been 4.2 per cent (if inflation till maturity averages 5 per cent) and 4.1 per cent (if inflation is 10 per cent). These real yields are very attractive in historical terms, especially since the bulk of the return will come in the form of tax-free capital gains. If one expects inflation to be 5 per cent, then the long-term nominal return on index-linked would be 9.2 per cent. That translates to around 8.7 per cent net for the basic rate taxpayer and 8 per cent net for those on the top rate. For a building society to match these net returns, it would have to offer gross returns of around 11.6 and 13.3 per cent respectively. The former level might be available in the short term, but would be highly unlikely over the longer term. Equities (see letter E) are often touted as a hedge against inflation; and indeed, over the long term, BZW figures show they have produced gross real returns well in excess of those currently available from index-linked gilts. There are snags, however. The first is tax. BZW shows that the real return on equities between 1960 and 1991 has been 5.3 per cent per annum, with gross income reinvested; but for the investor on the top rate of tax, the real return has been just 1.2 per cent. Admittedly, top tax rates were very high during part of that period. The second snag is that the BZW figures are based on the equity indices, and there is no guarantee that the portfolios of private investors will match those indices. So index-linked gilts could offer a very attractive long-term alternative to equities for private investors, especially those who pay top rate tax. A shorter-term alternative is index-linked National Savings. The current issue of certificates offers a return of inflation plus 4.5 per cent tax-free, if held for five years (the returns are significantly lower if cashed in early). Again, this return is highly attractive. Those who bought an earlier issue of these certificates in January 1987 would have achieved a return of 64.6 per cent. That beat the average unit and investment trust, and a top-rate building society account, over the same period. The disadvantage with these certificates is that they do not provide any income. The low coupon on the index-linked gilts is also a problem for income-seeking investors. But do not dismiss index-linked investment just because you think inflation is going to fall. If you do believe in the depressed, low-inflation 1990s, just look at the US. Thanks to attempts to revive the economy, US savers are receiving rates of only 4 per cent. Even if US inflation were expected to average 2 per cent, a real yield of 4.5 per cent would be pretty attractive to them.</p>

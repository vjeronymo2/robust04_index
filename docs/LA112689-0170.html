			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG WEST ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LONG BEACH WINS ONE FOR DEPARTING REISBIG  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach won a football game Saturday for outgoing Coach Larry  Reisbig, defeating Utah State, 31-18, at Veterans Stadium.  </P> <P> "It was a nice way to end it," said Reisbig, who was hoisted by his players  after finishing with a three-year record of 11-24. He announced his resignation  two weeks ago.  </P> <P> The 49ers, who built a 21-0 lead in the first quarter on three touchdown passes  by quarterback Paul Oates, snapped a five-game losing streak and ended the  season with a 4-8 overall record, 2-5 in the Big West Conference.  </P> <P> Utah State (4-7, 4-3) trailed, 24-18, late in the game, but Kirk Johnson's pass  was intercepted by Greg Svitenko of Long Beach and returned 51 yards for a  touchdown with 3:36 left.  </P> <P> Oates, who had season passing totals of 2,621 yards and 19 touchdowns, threw a  50-yard pass to Sean Foster in the end zone on Long Beach's first play from  scrimmage. On the 49ers' second possession, he connected with Derek Washington  for an 18-yard touchdown. The third time Long Beach got the ball, he threw a  47-yard scoring pass to Michael Newsome.  </P> <P> Johnson brought Utah State back with scoring passes to Rod Moore and Tracey  Jenkins. And he narrowed the deficit to 21-18 when he hit Patrick Newman for a  two-point conversion.  </P> <P> But when it looked as if a victory might elude them again, the 49ers turned to  running back Jeff Fassett, who gained all of his 110 yards in the second half.  His 30-yard run set up a 29-yard field goal by Kenneth Allen that increased  their lead to 24-18 with 4:36 left in the game.  </P> <P> Long Beach, which had been giving up an average of 35 points a game, had one of  its best defensive efforts. The 49ers were led by senior linebacker Gene  Lemmers, who had 20 tackles. DICK WAGNER San Jose State 38, UNLV 28 -- Sheldon  Canley ran for 102 yards and the Spartans defeated the Rebels in at San Jose.  Canley had 221 all purpose yards and moved into fifth place on the NCAA  single-season all purpose running list. Ralph Martini threw three touchdown  passes, two in the second quarter, to Doug Hooker as the Spartans (4-7, 3-4)  took a 24-0 lead at halftime. UNLV (6-5, 5-2) scored three touchdowns in the  fourth quarter to cut San Jose State's lead to 31-28, but Jim Francis put the  game away on an 18-yard touchdown run with three minutes left.  </P></p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / International Company News: Ferfin and Montedison show operating profits The clean-up costs of the June 1992 collapse of the Ferruzzi family's business empire have reached over L2,400bn (Dollars 1.5bn) - the biggest write-down of a private group's assets in recent Italian history. But the industrial interests formerly controlled by the Ferruzzi family and now in the hands of banks, which last year agreed to swap debt for equity, have begun to show healthy operating results. This emerged from the 1993 results of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the listed holding company of the group now 55 per cent controlled by foreign and Italian creditor banks, which were announced on Friday and those of Montedison, the chief industrial subsidiary, which were released yesterday. The losses are bigger than originally expected but essentially reflect the need by Mr Guido Rossi, the special administrator brought in last year, to write down inflated assets that massaged Ferfin and Montedison accounts. Ferfin's consolidated losses totalled L2,419bn, against a 1992 deficit of L1,519bn. These two losses in effect represent the cost so far of the mismanagement of the Raul Gardini era at Ferruzzi which was perpetuated after his divorce from the family business in 1991. Of the losses at Ferfin, L2,079bn was attributable to a thorough revision of the value of the holding company's assets - both fixed assets and share portfolios. At Montedison, extraordinary 1993 losses were L1,300bn while total net losses reached L1,611bn. Ferfin debt stock was reduced by L1,382bn to L21,951bn, largely as a result of asset sales. Debt restructuring and recapitalisation helped reduce financial charges. Since the collapse last year, L5,400bn of fresh capital has been pumped into Ferfin and Montedison. The holding company's consolidated net turnover was up 15 per cent to L22,804bn, generating an operating profit of L1,373bn up 28 per cent. In the case of Montedison consolidated net turnover was up 20 per cent from L16,969bn to L20,415bn with an operating profit of L1,485bn. The improving trend in operating performance has continued this year and in the first two months the gross operating margin was up 26 per cent at L431bn.</p>

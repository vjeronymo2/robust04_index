			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The complex business of residence - Expatriates THE BUDGET proposal by the chancellor of the exchequer to eliminate the 90-year-old 'available accommodation' rule has spotlighted the whole concept of tax residence. What is its effect? And just how do you become, or cease to be, resident? Put briefly, residence - together with domicile, for which legislative changes also are pending - determines the scope of your liability to UK tax. There are, in fact, three important statuses - residence, ordinary residence and domicile - none of which has a detailed statutory definition. This void has, therefore, been filled by a mass of case law, Inland Revenue practice and concession. This makes it difficult for the individual to know, without seeking specialist advice, his precise situation in any particular set of circumstances. Even without the available accommodation rule, you can become resident: By going to the UK for permanent residence or with the intention of staying for at least three years. By being in the country for more than 182 days in a tax year (ie, April 6-April 5). By visiting the UK for periods which exceed 90 days a year on average over any four consecutive tax years. The first and third of these rules will make you ordinarily resident, too. Domicile, by contrast, cannot be defined in such 'mechanical' terms since it depends on so many disparate factors - such as where you were born, where you have lived since, where your home(s) is situated, and the location of your family, business and social contacts. Its essential purpose is to connect individuals with the legal system in the country or state in which they live permanently or indefinitely. If you were born in the UK of British parents and have lived there all of your life, clearly you will be resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled there. As such, you will be liable to income tax and capital gains tax on global income and gains. When you die, inheritance tax can be levied on your estate by reference to world-wide assets. Conversely, a person who was born and has lived all his life outside the UK will have none of the three statuses. His exposure to British tax will be limited to that on income derived there (and not even all of that) plus IHT on UK assets so far as they exceed the exempt amount (at present, Pounds 150,000). All this is simple enough. But it is when your life falls somewhere in between these extremes that complications start to arise. Say that you decide, after being a life-long British resident and domiciliary, to take a job overseas. From the day after you leave the UK, you will be regarded as not resident and not ordinarily resident - provided your period of employment extends beyond a complete tax year and your visits to the UK do not exceed six months in a year or 90 days a year on average. Once that happens, liability to capital gains tax ceases altogether (with the sole exception of gains arising from assets used in a UK business). Nor need you pay tax on overseas income, even if you send it to the UK. But most UK income remains taxable although there are some exceptions; for example, the interest on holdings of British government securities. And most British expatriates remain liable to pay IHT; only those emigrating permanently escape this particular impost (but not until 36 months after changing domicile). Expatriates returning to the UK will face considerations that are very largely the opposite of those explained above, but with the important difference that their resources - and their problems - are likely to be greater than when they left. On the other hand, the treatment given to foreigners coming to the UK temporarily - for, say, short-term employment - will be different again. For while they might well become resident and ordinarily resident, typically, they will keep their overseas domicile. They will be eligible for reduced IHT and will not have to pay UK income tax and CGT on overseas income and gains except for sums received in the UK. Be warned, though. This is a complex area of the law where much can be gained or lost, particularly when your position in the residence/domicile spectrum changes. So, if you are planning such a move, specialist advice is desirable. Donald Elkin is a director of Wilfred T. Fry Ltd of Worthing, West Sussex.</p>

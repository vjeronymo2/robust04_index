			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> TOSHIBA BORROWS PAGE FROM PEPSI IN MARKETING 'NOTEBOOK' COMPUTER  </P> <P> At prices ranging from $2,700 to $4,000, the new "notebook" computers from  Toshiba America Information Systems are hardly in the same consumer product  category as 75-cent cans of Pepsi. But that hasn't stopped the Irvine-based  subsidiary of the Japanese electronics giant from borrowing a page from the  annals of soft-drink marketing.  </P> <P> When Toshiba launched its miniature personal computers last week, it also  unveiled a sales campaign dubbed "The Toshiba Challenge." Like its counterpart  in the cola wars, the Toshiba Challenge asks consumers to compare the merits of  its product with that of the larger, more established competitor -- in this  case, Compaq Computer Corp.  </P> <P> Bill Johnson, vice president and general manager of Toshiba's computer systems  division, says that nearly 200 people in eight cities have taken a "blind"  comparative test so far, and the large majority have preferred the Toshiba  products. Toshiba said it has hired an independent research firm to conduct the  tests, in which computer users are asked to compare the features of two  unidentified notebook computers.  </P> <P> The Toshiba machines are better, Johnson says, because they offer a screen  that's much easier to read as well as a full-size, sculpted keyboard.  </P> <P> So confident is Johnson of the products' merits that he is predicting that  Toshiba will capture more than 50% of the notebook market, which he says now  stands at 40,000 to 50,000 units per month and is growing at 60% a year.  </P> <P> But even if Toshiba wins the short-term challenge -- and critics say one of the  Toshiba models will be hurt by the lack of a floppy disk drive and all suffer  from a shorter battery life than their rivals -- it won't be able to rest on  its laurels. Johnson said NEC Corp.  </P> <P> and Compaq are preparing new entries in the category.  </P></p>

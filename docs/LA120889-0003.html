			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY SPRAYING CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Please allay the worries of the people under the spray for the Medfly.  Malathion was chosen as the ideal insecticide for control of mosquitoes in the  city of New Orleans in 1965. Assuming the formula hasn't been altered, it is  quite harmless.  </P> <P> I flew the stuff for seven years over the suburbs of New Orleans on an almost  daily basis and have heard nothing of harm to humans or pets. Please halt this  unseemly panic by the citizens of Los Angeles County. It is not worth thinking  about.  </P> <P> We used the chemical in the strength of 4% on a routine basis. The application  was constantly monitored by the health department and we, in the crews who  handled this stuff, were subjected to monthly blood tests which were found to  be negative in all those years.  </P> <P> Stamp out the Medfly with confidence and impunity.  </P> <P> TERRY HAYES  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

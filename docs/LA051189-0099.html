			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORK TO BEGIN ON REGRADING 2 POST OFFICE LOTS  </P> <P> A contract to correct deficiencies in an Eagle Rock post office that is still  unopened six months after its scheduled completion date has been awarded to an  El Monte firm by postal officials.  </P> <P> The $914,686 contract calls for regrading two parking lots built at a 10%  grade, twice as steep as city ordinances allow. The contract was awarded to  Extra Builders, which postal officials said submitted the lowest of four bids.  </P> <P> The parking lots will serve the sleek, new Eagle Rock post office, a  $7.9-million building that postal officials say will improve mail service in  Eagle Rock and Highland Park. Work on the project has been stalled since  September when, the U.S. Postal Service says, it discovered that the lots were  too steep.  </P> <P> Under the contract, workers will regrade the lots and move gasoline pumps for  postal vehicles. Workers will also install a $3,900 fence around the parking  lots.  </P> <P> Postal officials attributed the grading problem to flaws in the building's  design. Since the problem was discovered, they have replaced the architectural  company, McCulloch Architects of Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Postal Service officials said construction on the lot will begin this week.  They said they expect work on the post office to be completed in July.  </P></p>

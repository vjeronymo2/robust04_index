			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Emanuele Gazzo: "The Greek Commitment to </F> Presidency"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE database]    [Text] The Presidency of the Council moves to Greece on 1  January for a six month period. You will recall that the  Presidency does not "lead" the Community, as public opinion  often has it. It is a "public service" to the Community and  cannot nor should be "nationalized." It is, for six months, a  question of organising the work of the Council of Ministers,  that is to say the Institution, which, in the current system,  takes the decisions (but on proposals by the Commission and in  agreement with the European Parliament). Greece inherits a  presidency, that of Belgium, which no doubt was exemplary and  which had to manage at least two dossiers of capital importance.    The first was the completion of the ratification process and  thus the entry into force of the Treaty on the Union; all was  done for the transition to take place smoothly and, in the  fields of competency of the three "pillars," for the  Institutions to play their roles. The second dossier concerns  the follow-up to the Copenhagen Summit and notably the  presentation of the White Paper (growth, competitiveness,  employment) and organising its passage to its operational stage.  The Greek presidency has let it clearly be known, through Mr.  Pangalos that it was assuming this inheritance in perfect  awareness of the effort that will be required to advance without  hesitation along the path set out, and to reach tangible  results. It is important to know that Greece's commitment is  total, without mental reservations or "opt outs" and with a very  clear vision of the "political" scope of the role it has to  play. Which, moreover, is in accordance with its belonging to a  culture which brought an exceptional contribution to the  civilization in which we live. This is why Mr. Pangalos'  declaration on the need to begin already in preparing the 1996  institutional reforms, and to move towards the creation of a  "European Constitution," and more precisely a "federal"  constitution, deserves to be stressed.    We can of course discuss the modalities and procedures, but  it is important to open the debate quickly (which should already  have been done at the extraordinary Summit of 29 October). The  suggestion of rapidly setting up an "Ad Hoc Group" with the  participation, as observers, of the countries candidates for  accession, shows the will to succeed as Twelve Member States  first: which shocks the partisans of "dilution," and obliges  them to come out into the open.    This leads us to recall that Mr. Papandreou, who for the  first time chaired the European Council in December 1983, in a  letter to his colleagues at the time, wrote: "We must know what  kind of Europe we want to move towards." What is more topical  than this question? Well, the Athens Summit ended in total  failure and Mr. Papandreou's merit was not to have tried to  disguise this. Despite pressures from his entourage, he blankly  refused to make public the traditional "Conclusions" which  should have spoken of totally nonexistent progress. At the time,  in the face of a Commission manifestly weakened by national  egotisms over-excited by the demands of Mrs. Thatcher, the  Community was almost paralysed by the demand to assure its  long-term funding, to develop new policies in future fields, to  end the interminable negotiations over accession by Spain and  Portugal. But nobody dared assume the responsibility of a  crisis, and preferred navigating with land in sight. The logic  of despair (as Jacques Delors called it at the time) risked  prevailing. It took the shock, provoked some months later, of  the massive vote by the European Parliament in favour of the  Spinelli project for European Union, to provoke a chain-reaction  ending in the relaunch based on the Single Act. The task of the  Greek presidency will not be easy at all. So be it! The line  chosen and based on the very substantial work load it has  presented, will no doubt be supported by the founders of the  European Community who -- geographically situated in the North  and South of the Continent -- share in the inspiration.</p>

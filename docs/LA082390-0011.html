			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> LATINO TUTOR COURSE TRIES TO RAISE ESTEEM  </P> <P> For Latino students in an Oxnard tutoring program, the study of Mayan temples  offers more than a lesson in Central American culture.  </P> <P> The Semillas del Futuro (Seeds of the Future) Project teaches mathematics using  calculations employed in building the temples.  </P> <P> Volunteer tutors also use Latino culture to teach science, reading and English.  </P> <P> "We try to raise self-esteem, confidence and knowledge of their background  along with academic skills," said Luzmaria Espinosa, youth services coordinator  for El Concilio del Condada del Ventura, which established the project six  years ago.  </P> <P> Chevron Corp. recently contributed $4,000 to the program, designed to stem the  high school dropout rates among Latino children in the Oxnard area.  </P> <P> Between 30 and 45 elementary and junior high students were tutored the last  school year. The students' parents are required to participate by leading  informal lessons or arts and crafts projects, serving on an advisory committee  or doing administrative work.

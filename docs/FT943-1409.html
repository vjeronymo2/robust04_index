			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Strategy to ease concerns of business sector outlined The Scottish National party is to concentrate on convincing Scots that transition to independence, the party's goal, would be simple and painless. It also aims to lay to rest widely held misgivings about the reality of an independent Scotland. It will particularly focus on persuading people in the business community that independence would be advantageous. The party yesterday unveiled a strategy for the two years before the next general election which entails building on the successes gained this year in the regional and European elections. It is currently second to Labour in the Scottish opinion polls with 24 per cent of the vote compared with Labour's 55 per cent. Its next electoral target will be winning as many councils as possible in next April's elections to Scotland's new unitary local authorities, which are to replace the two-tier system of councils in 1996. The party is to establish a committee under Mr Allan Macartney, who became MEP for north-east Scotland in June, to devise a detailed exposition of the transition to independence. The SNP's opponents have argued that if Scotland seceded from the UK it could not become a separate member of the European Union with-out difficult negotiations and several years' delay. A second group will devise arguments and initiatives to reassure sections of Scottish society about both the transition and the reality of independence. Few senior figures in the Scottish business community publicly support the SNP although the party has support among people in smaller businesses. Mr John Swinney, the party's publicity director, said: 'We want to create confidence in the business community that the SNP has a message for them that can be delivered. We may also be able to tailor our policies to their needs on the basis of what they tell us.'</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Earnings plummet at Japanese brokers JAPANESE brokerages yesterday reported a sharp fall in consolidated earnings generally in line with their poor parent company results, while Kokusai Securities, a medium-sized broker, announced that it would close a Singaporean subsidiary today. The decision by Kokusai to close Kokusai Singapore Merchant Banking, which reported a pre-tax loss of Y127m (Dollars 1.2m) last year, reflected the attempts of most of the securities houses to reduce their costs. Kokusai has already closed offices in Geneva, Vienna and Frankfurt. Each of the 'Big Four' houses - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - turned in bleak consolidated results for the year ended in March. The companies blamed the results on weak turnover and prices on the Tokyo stock market. Nomura announced an 87.7 per cent decline in net profit to Y3.6bn. Daiwa had a particularly bad year, reporting a pre-tax loss of Y6.5bn, compared with a profit of Y20.3bn in the previous year. While Nomura's revenue fell 12.2 per cent, Daiwa's revenue slumped 27 per cent. Nikko reported a pre-tax profit of Y1.9bn, down 77 per cent, and a net loss of Y8.1bn, which was an improvement on the Y26.7bn loss of a year earlier. Yamaichi reported another large pre-tax loss of Y32.6bn, compared with Y30.5bn in the previous year, but managed to reduce its net loss to Y42.3bn from Y51.9bn. Its revenue during the year fell 19.6 per cent to Y267.8bn. The poor results highlight the pressure on Japanese houses to cut costs and streamline or close unprofitable operations. The pressure is particularly acute on the second-tier brokerages, which rapidly expanded their operations during the bubble years of the late 1980s.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Trade War Fears: . . . but there's always France THE more he feels buffeted around on the European stage, the more Mr Jacques Delors must feel comforted by his continued high standing in the French opinion polls. This took a slight dip during the referendum campaign, but two polls in the past week, for instance, put him back in first place over all other possible contenders for the French presidency, from he left and right. Mr Delors, of course, gains what he himself refers to as a prime d'eloignement - he looks better for being outside the immediate snakepit of French politics. If he were to enter the fray by making a run at the Elysee Palace in 1995, or earlier if President Francois Mitterrand's health fails, then his poll standing would surely drop in a country where some regard him as a 'Belgian' for his years in Brussels. But there are certain factors working for him. Mr Mitterrand may never have thanked Mr Delors for being so obviously and publicly right as finance minister in moving France towards economic austerity in 1983. But the president is even less keen on Mr Michel Rocard, the man whom Socialist party leaders want to succeed him. Indeed, Mr Delors's great strength is that he draws almost as much backing from the centre-right as from the left. This is largely because he combines Socialist credentials with a Catholic concern for the unity of society in one of the few European countries not to have a sizeable Christian Democrat party at its centre. This is particularly relevant in the current row over European, and especially French, agriculture. He has repeatedly railed against Anglo-Saxon 'ultra-liberalism' of the kind that he claims would lead to the 'desertification' of the French countryside, as happened to the countryside of Britain in the 19th century and of America in the 1930s. Such a philosophic stance, of course, would do him no harm at all, if he came to try to put together a presidential bid. Whether he has the organisational base to do so is another matter. Certainly, he is keeping his hand in. This September he set up a discussion club with the neutral name of Temoins (Witnesses) which gathered a number of younger Socialist leaders and even ministers to debate their party's 'renewal'.</p>

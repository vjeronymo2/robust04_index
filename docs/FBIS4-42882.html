			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Writing in the 28 May Lisbon weekly  SEMANARIO, commentator Antonio Pinto Leite formulated a series  of scenarios on the possible results of the 12 June European  Parliament elections. The first scenario presupposes a rate of  abstention of over 50 percent, not an impossible outcome, Pinto  Leite commented, given that European issues "have lost their  potential for drama" and that 13 June is a Lisbon holiday. Good  weather could also aggravate the situation, he added. In this  case, elections would lose their political-partisan meaning and  highlight the gap separating Portugal from European issues. Both  the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Socialist Party (PS)  would bear the brunt of abstention, according to Pinto Leite,  because of the affirmative vote they are asking their  constituents to cast. In contrast, the Communist Party (PCP) and  the Center Social Democratic Party (CDS) would gain because of  the anti-European feelings they are attempting to arouse.    A second scenario would have the PS slightly overtake the  PSD  by 4 or 5 percentage points, a near-tie not of excessive concern  for the PSD. In fact, Pinto Leite pointed out, a "thin" PS  victory would last no more than a few weeks in the political  debate and be "consumed by the summer season." A third scenario  envisions a clear PS victory over the PSD, an outcome to which a  number of polls lend credibility, which would "consecrate" an  Antonio Guterres now under fire from President Mario Soares'  entourage as the uncontested PS leader. Moreover, it would "set  in stone" Guterres's strategy of a "PS without the PCP" for the  1995 parliamentary elections. On the other hand, according to  Pinto Leite, a clear-cut PS victory would push the PSD into a  "mobilizing mood" for the last quarter of 1994, as it is always  more difficult to "invert a logic or a tendency" than "manage an  advantage." In spite of poll-induced indications; however, Pinto  Leite commented, a PSD electorate that averted political defeat  in the last municipal elections because it feared instability  would wish to protect itself against this eventuality and would  flock to the polls.    A fourth scenario is a PSD victory, which would cause  sharper  difficulties for the PS and Guterres, whose strategy would be  questioned. The PCP is betting on this scenario, Pinto Leite  asserted, for it alone allows the party to "dream" of an  alliance with the PS. For its part, the CDS "ardently wishes"  that such a scenario not come true, given that a clear-cut PS  victory over the PSD would allow the CDS to maintain that the  PSD "does not deserve an absolute majority," and that,  consequently, a useful "vote of the Right for this party makes  no sense," Pinto Leite contended.    While the previous scenarios presuppose that the CDS and the  PCP obtain "reasonably good" results--perhaps 10 to 15  percent--it is necessary to also take into account a bad outcome  for the CDS, which would have "important" repercussions, as it  would enshrine the idea that the party and the way it conducts  policy are erroneous. In contrast, satisfactory results would  return the party to the "heady first days" of Manuel Monteiro's  leadership, Pinto Leite concluded.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: MESSING AROUND WITH A CLEAN LIFE  </P> <P> Erma Bombeck is on a book tour. This Best of Bombeck release originally  appeared on Sept. 28, 1982.  </P> <P>  Some of the best fiction being written today is never serialized in the slick  magazines and never makes it to the New York Times list. They're messages  between the working wife/bachelor and the woman who comes in to clean their  house/apartment.  </P> <P> Sometimes they never even see each other. They communicate only by notes left  on the refrigerator door. The following is a series of written communiques  between Wilma and her employer, Mrs. Rutledge.  </P> <P> Mrs. Rutledge: There is a cat mess at the end of the sofa. -- Wilma  </P> <P> Wilma: I know. -- Mrs. Rutledge  </P> <P> Mrs. Rutledge: What do you want me to do with it? -- Wilma  </P> <P> Wilma: You are limited on options. You can surround it with sand and use it as  a putting green, gift-wrap it and amaze your friends, or clean it up. I prefer  the latter. -- Mrs. Rutledge  </P> <P> Mrs. Rutledge: I was going to clean up the you-know-what, but the sweeper  smells funny and sounds strange and won't pick up anything. Can you fix it? --  Wilma  </P> <P> Wilma: The cat is missing. I suggest you check the sweeper bag. -- Mrs.  Rutledge  </P> <P> Mrs. Rutledge: The cat was not in the bag. Maybe the cat mess is not a mess at  all. It looks just like something in a green bowl in the refrigerator. Is it  what I think it is? -- Wilma  </P> <P> Wilma: What do you think it is? -- Mrs. Rutledge  </P> <P> Mrs. Rutledge: I knew once, but I forgot. The sweeper works just fine. What did  you do to it? -- Wilma  </P> <P> Wilma: I emptied the bag. -- Mrs. Rutledge  </P> <P> Mrs. Rutledge: You know that little problem I told you about two weeks ago  about the cat? I think I solved the problem. I moved the sofa over it and you  can hardly notice it now. -- Wilma  </P> <P> Wilma: You're fired! -- Mrs. Rutledge  </P> <P> Mrs. Rutledge: There is another cat mess I didn't tell you about. It's hard to  find. I'm the only one who knows where it is. Goodby. -- Wilma  </P></p>

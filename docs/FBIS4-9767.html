			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a news conference by Government Minister Danilo </F> Parinello with unidentified reporters in Guatemala City on 31  March; from the "Telepress" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] At a news conference this afternoon, Government  Minister Danilo Parinello addressed the issue of a possible  state of emergency.    [Begin recording] [Parinello] We cannot rule out that  possibility. We have given this issue broad discussion, and we  cannot discard it.    [Unidentified reporter] The government communique states  there are groups instigating all this commotion. Do you believe  any specific group is responsible?    [Parinello] At this specific moment, no, but we are  investigating. We have several investigation teams working all  over the country trying to determine who might be responsible  for this and initiating the appropriate legal action.    [Reporter] Is there any relation between this case and the  incidents at Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa due to the instigation  factor?    [Parinello] This could be part of a collective psychosis  that  stems from this campaign, which is not spontaneous, including  graffiti in cities, along highways, walls, and so on. Things  such as this have happened all throughout history and all over  the world whenever someone manages to agitate the people enough  to create a type of collective psychosis. [end recording]</p>

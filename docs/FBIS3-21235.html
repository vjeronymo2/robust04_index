			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Professor Daiichiro Sugimoto and his group at the  Department of Liberal Arts Education, University of Tokyo, have  developed a parallel processing computer exclusively for  high-speed simulation of the birth of galaxies in space. Its  computational speed of 36 gigaflops exceeds that of general  purpose supercomputers. They claim that the new computer could  be used for simulating fluid dynamics and electromagnetic fields  in addition to astrophysics.    For now it will be used exclusively for analysis of  many-body  problems, as it is known in mathematics, including simulation of  shape changes and unity of galaxies. The computation is done  through a workstation by connecting 6 substrates in parallel,  which were developed for solving this particular problem. Each  substrate contains 8 LSIs (large-scale integrated circuits)  which were developed jointly with Fuji Xerox.    An astronomical amount of computation is required to  calculate the gravities among many stars when it comes to  simulation in cosmic science. Computation time increases twice  squared with an increase in the number of the stars. Therefore,  accurate analysis using general purpose supercomputers has been  difficult.    The new computer is able to handle complex calculation such  as gravity using LSIs, while the workstation can handle the  remaining processing such as display. As a result, its  computation speed exceeded the maximum speed of 32 gigaflops  attained by general purpose Japanese supercomputers. The LSI is  especially structured with a combination of operational units  which accommodates the computation procedures of gravity. Thirty  calculations per each operation made the high speed computation  possible.    At 3 watts per gigaflop power consumption is minimal and  requires no cumbersome coolant. The new computer set is small  enough to be easily placed on desks, measuring approximately 25  cm long, 25 cm wide, and 40 cm deep.    They plan to produce a 1-teraflop capacity set by about  April  1995. An LSI designed exclusively for that purpose is already  under development.</p>

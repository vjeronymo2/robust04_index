			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The Food Agency said Friday  [27 May] it will sell about 50,000 tons of Australian-produced  rice throughout Japan in July.    The sale of the 1994-crop rice is intended to increase  Japan's rice supplies and reduce market prices in order to  facilitate auctions of Japanese-produced rice for free marketing  outside government channels, agency officials said. The  auctions are to be resumed in July.    For the same purpose, the agency will also sell a total of  100,000 tons of Japanese-produced rice from its emergency rice  stockpile in July and August, the officials said.    The agency earlier announced a plan to supply 150,000 tons  of  Japanese-produced rice in each of the two months, and the total  supply of such rice in the period is now expected to amount to  400,000 tons.    The domestic rice market is heating up following the 1993  rice crop failure that forced Japan to resort to emergency  imports.    The government controls production and marketing of most  Japanese-produced rice, but 40 percent is marketed freely  outside government channels.    Medium-grain Australian rice is similar to Japanese rice and  is likely to be popular among Japanese consumers, the officials  said.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: IDLE TALK WHEN THE MIND'S SET ON IDLE  </P> <P> For years, while carrying on a conversation with my husband, I have watched him  shift from reality to automatic pilot.  </P> <P> I can tell the exact moment he switches over. Usually, it's when I am telling  him something important, such as how Marge always changes the batteries in her  smoke alarm on her birthday because it makes it easier to remember. That's when  I see his eyes glaze over and his lips form a thin line. It's a cross between a  smile and the look he gets when he cuts himself shaving.  </P> <P> The man has paid a big price for not paying attention to me when I talk. He  didn't hear my story about the Hawkins' dog, which earned the neighborhood  "Mutt Slut" title by escaping through a mail slot at night. And he was tuned  out the entire time I was telling him about this woman on "Wheel of Fortune"  who could have solved the puzzle for $25,000 but she picked the wrong vowel.  </P> <P> A lot of women might be sensitive about being ignored. Actually, I have turned  it into a cream center in the Whitman Sampler of life.  </P> <P> I can say to him, "Aren't you dressed yet? We're meeting Phebe and Ray at  7:30."  </P> <P> He will look shocked and say, "You didn't tell me we were going out tonight."  </P> <P> Of course, I didn't tell him, but I shake my head and smile a maniacal little  smile. "I told you two weeks ago, but you were probably in cruise control  again."  </P> <P> Please don't try this in your own home if you're an amateur. But if you really  know your subject, you can drive him crazy by timing him carefully, and when  you see his mind returning to the planet Earth, say, "Then it's all settled.  I'll withdraw the money in the morning."  </P> <P> He was alert the other day when I said to him, "Have you seen my checkbook?"  </P> <P> "I destroyed it and closed your account," he said, flipping through the paper.  </P> <P> "You did what?" I asked.  </P> <P> "Don't you remember?" he said. "A couple of days ago you told me you had lost  your checkbook five times in one week and were so disgusted with yourself you  didn't deserve to be treated as a responsible adult. You told me to flat-out  close your account, and if you needed to write a check you could use one from  the joint account. So, I did it."  </P> <P> I sat there numb. "Was that the same day I suggested you set a trap for the  mouse in the woodwork that I knew for a fact was 'with child'?"  </P> <P> He didn't remember.  </P></p>

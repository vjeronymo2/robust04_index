Hospital home care visits doubled between 1980 and 1990, from 6.2 million to 12.3 million.5 Compared with smaller hospitals, larger ones had more visits.6 The percentage of community hospitals operating home care programs, however, is not growing as rapidly as the use of home care services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the 1970s and 1980s, many hospitals expanded their outpatient departments and added ambulatory surgery centers. On average, 37 percent of hospital equipment is devoted to meeting outpatient demand.7 This expansion has had a major impact on hospital revenues. About 25 percent of hospital revenues, on average, now come from out-patient services (see Table 1&hyph;6). While inpatient admissions have declined by about 14 percent since 1980, nonemergency outpatient visits have more than doubled (see Table 1&hyph;7). Similarly, more than half of hospital surgical procedures in 1992 were performed on an outpatient basis, compared with only 16.3 percent in 1980. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Along with expanding their service capacity, hospitals have also increased their labor pool to administer the new services. The number of full-time equivalent personnel (FTEs) per patient has grown steadily since the 1970s (see Table 1&hyph;8). In part this reflects the surge in outpatient hospital services, since FTEs employed by hospitals may work in either inpatient or outpatient departments. Nonetheless, labor costs as a percentage of total hospital costs have been decreasing, while capital costs are increasing as a percentage of total costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Attempts to Control Growth in Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Financial pressures on hospitals have spurred the growth in services to augment revenues and have fostered a greater reliance on cost shifting. As a result of these efforts, in aggregate, hospitals have maintained positive total revenue margins. In 1991, the total margin was 4.3 percent_higher than at any time before the introduction of PPS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, as government and private insurers have stepped-up their cost-containment efforts, hospitals are less able to compensate for losses. Therefore, hospitals must increase efforts to reduce costs and indeed have done so. After peaking at 5.0 percent in 1992, annual real growth (above general inflation) in hospital costs per case dropped to 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 1993 and to 1.0 percent in the third quarter. Whether this is a one-time phenomenon or the beginning of a trend is uncertain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L2,i1,s50,10,10,10 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  1&hyph;6._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Community Hospital Revenues, by Type of Service, Selected Years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=96 g=1 f=4 --> [In Percent] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Year <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Inpatient <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Outpatient <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Other <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> 1980 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 83.2 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 12.5 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 4.3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1985  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 79.3 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 16.1 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 4.6 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 72.5 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 22.5 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 5.0 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 69.8 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 25.3 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 4.9 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> Source: American Hospital Association National Hospital Panel Survey <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Arrangements With Other Hospitals, Facilities, and Insurers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Hospitals have adopted a number of organizational strategies to respond to changes in their operating environment. They have, for instance, merged with, acquired, or contracted with other hospitals and providers. They have also developed more complex relationships with insurers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the 1980s, hospitals tended to diversify by acquiring facilities or businesses (such as parking lots or non-health care businesses) that often were unrelated to their basic mission. Many of these investments were unprofitable, partly because hospital administrators lacked the skills to manage non-acute care ventures.8 In the 1990s, however, hospital diversification efforts have focused on reducing costs and offering a wider range of services to large employers and purchasing coalitions through managed care contracts.9 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Extensive mergers and acquisitions during the 1980s led to the growth in the number of multihospital systems and in the percentage of institutions that belonged to these systems (see Table 1&hyph;9). Between 1979 and 1992, the proportion of hospitals that were members of multihospital systems increased from 27.1 percent to 43.2 percent. These systems were thought to produce economies of scale and scope, but whether they are more efficient is debatable.10 The fact that the number of formal multihospital systems actually declined between 1990 and 1992 may reflect a trend toward the use of less formal contractual arrangements, as well as mergers of existing systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

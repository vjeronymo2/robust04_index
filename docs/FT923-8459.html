			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Leading clearers still stand by their machines LEADING clearing banks speak with a single voice about phantom withdrawals. They all follow the same line as Barclays, the largest issuer of payment cards in the UK. 'Our contention is that phantom withdrawals do not occur in the way it is popularly believed,' it says. 'We have every confidence in the complete security of our system.' National Westminster, the second-largest UK bank, says: 'It is not possible to take money out of an account without access to both the information on the magnetic stripe and the personal identification number (PIN). We do not believe that spontaneous transactions by the computer systems are possible.' It says 'categorically' that it is not possible to make a working credit card from a NatWest receipt, even if the PIN is known. Lloyds says: 'So far as we know, there has never been a cash-machine withdrawal without the PIN number being used.' All the banks acknowledge a stream of complaints from customers who believe they have suffered from phantom withdrawals. Some banks privately admit making ex gratia payments to some customers. 'There are cases when customers genuinely forget having taken out money from a machine and we cannot take matters forward from that,' one says. 'We are not prepared to say to good customers that we are accusing you or your family of dishonesty.' All the banks are adamant that checks on suspect transactions suggest that phantom withdrawals never take place. 'We sometimes find that the audit may not balance, but there is always a clear-cut explanation, for example two Pounds 10 notes being stuck together in the machine,' says Lloyds. In spite of such unanimity, customers have gained the whip hand in the last year in one important respect. The code of banking practice places the onus of proving what has gone wrong in disputed transactions on the banks and limits the customer's liability on losses to Pounds 50 where the customer is not clearly to blame. So even if you cannot prove to your bank that there are such things as phantom withdrawals, if one should befall you, most of the losses will be footed by your bank.</p>

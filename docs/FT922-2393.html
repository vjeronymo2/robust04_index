			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (10): Reaching out to the world - The future of the free trade zone looks more positive WHEN the first phase of development of Madeira's free trade zone and manufacturing park is completed this summer, an important milestone will have been reached in the island's efforts to establish itself as an international business centre. After three hesitant years during which growth was hampered by bureaucracy and outdated legislation which required almost as much effort to overcome as developing the necessary infrastructure, the future looks more positive. 'It's a turning point for us,' says Mr Francisco Costa, chairman of the Madeira Development Company (SDM) which is responsible for developing and promoting the trade zone and the offshore financial centre. Since the offshore centre was established, 21 banks and more than 500 trading and services companies have set up offices in and around Funchal, the regional capital, but the most visible signs of offshore activity can be seen at the free trade zone near Canical, a small town on the south-western coast about 8km from the island's international airport and 30km from Funchal. Some 38 hectares of rocky hills have been levelled for factories, industrial plots and access roads. A new deep-sea port is starting to take shape, and is set for completion by September. The port is seen as crucial for the future as it will permit direct shipping in and out of the zone, cutting costs and time involved in transporting goods by road. It will be under private management - an international tender for the management contract will be issued this summer. With only 10 companies registered for manufacturing so far, growth has been modest, but Mr Costa is convinced conditions are ripe for much faster development. Several companies have recently put in applications to operate in the zone, and he expects many more. Those already established have come from Portugal, South Africa, Brazil and Hong Kong, attracted by fiscal incentives - no taxes until 2011 - the prospect of European Community subsidies for training, low labour costs, access to EC markets, and political stability. They produce clothes, plastics, cigarettes, jewellery, optical and electrical equipment and food products. Mr Stanley Lam, of Sheenotto Industries of Hong Kong, manager of a clothing factory, says low labour costs, good incentives and Madeira's location between Europe and the US were deciding factors. The factory has 114 employees, including five from Hong Kong, and it exports to the US, Canada and Japan. Access to the European market is limited by textile quotas and the need to buy materials from the EC. The company would like to expand its production capacity, now at around 60,000 items annually, but this will depend on winning EC approval for an exemption to the quota system as the additional production would be aimed primarily at Europe. All production workers are young women from the nearby towns of Canical and Machico, Madeira's second largest city. 'There are no problems finding workers here,' Mr Lam says. The company received Esc54m from EC funds for the training. A few buildings away, the Empresa Madeirense de Tabacos, the local tobacco company which has moved production from Funchal to the zone, produces 36m Portuguese brand cigarettes monthly. Mr Egidio Andrade, production manager, says the move has helped to raise profits, and has led to a marked improvement in production and work conditions. The factory is spacious if noisy - a new ceiling is to be fitted to dampen the noise - and new equipment has been installed. Mr Andrade says working conditions for the 75 employees - up from 65 in Funchal - are much better than before the move. Employees work a four-day week. Access to the zone has been improved, and the tunnel on the only road to Canical and Funchal is being widened. By 1996, the airport runway will be extended to 2,800 metres to enable bigger aircraft to land, and to allow air cargo services. A new international shipping register was established to add to the range of facilities, but its development has been slow because of inadequate legislation. Social security provisions for crews have had to be changed, and other legal problems are expected to be resolved by the summer when a new law comes into force. Registered ships sail under the Portuguese flag, and according to Portugal's law, at least half of the crew has to be Portuguese, making the register unattractive for most ship-owners. The new law will abolish that requirement except for ships calling regularly at Portuguese ports which will have to have 50 per cent of their crew of EC nationality. Until then, the authorities are waiving the requirement on a case-by-case basis. The law will also allow lenders and borrowers to choose the country of jurisdiction applicable for a mortgage. The offshore banking and service sectors have grown fastest, and the centre has attracted financial institutions and companies from Europe, Latin America and the Far East, as well as from other offshore centres. Mr Costa says he is satisfied with the rate of growth in Madeira's offshore business. 'The forecast that offshore centres were set to decline has not materialised. Business has continued to grow.'</p>

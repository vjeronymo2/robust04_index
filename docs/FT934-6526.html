			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: ASX urged to extend voting debate The Australian senate's joint statutory committee on corporations and securities has called on the Australian Stock Exchange to extend the deadline for submissions on differential voting rights until the end of February. The issue has arisen in the context of a controversial plan by Mr Rupert Murdoch to issue News Corp shares with 'super voting rights' on a pro rata basis to existing shareholders. The ASX has asked the investment community to submit views on the principles underlying the scheme by November 29, and has indicated that it will make a decision on the issue before Christmas. However, Senator Michael Beahan, who chairs the committee as well as a recently-announced inquiry into the role of institutional investors, said the ASX procedure on the super shares matter was 'not acceptable to the committee', and called for the longer timetable.</p>

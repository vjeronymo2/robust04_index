			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] Today marks the start of the alarming  count-down of the 10-day ultimatum which representatives of the  North Atlantic Alliance have given the Serbs. If the siege of  Sarajevo is not lifted, NATO will begin bombing Serb positions.    [Commentator F. Tavrovskiy] This is far from the first  ultimatum that has been given. One can cite similarities with  the years of the Cold War when China gave the United States its  547th serious and final warning for violating its territorial  waters. Things are different here, and the most important  difference in this ultimatum is the existence of a strictly  defined 10-day period. Moreover, now NATO does not need to  spend a long time seeking consent from the large UN bureaucracy.  The decision to start bombing will be taken directly with the  participation of Butrus-Ghali.    Now there is only Russia which can lift the threat from the  Serbs. Today Russia called for the urgent convening of the UN  Security Council to discuss the crisis. As Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Adamishin stated, Russia is calling for a  settlement of the Bosnian conflict by means of demilitarizing  Sarajevo and handing over the city to UN control. Adamishin  expressed disagreement with the view that Butrus-Ghali has given  NATO authority to carry out bombing strikes. Butrus-Ghali has  only asked whether the North Atalantic Alliance is ready, if  necessary, to make its aviation available but he did not hand  over UN functions to NATO, Adamishin stressed.    The deputy foreign minister said that in the near future  Boris Yeltsin will have telephone conversations with the leaders  of Western countries on the question of Bosnia.    [Announcer] All the same, it should be noted that the  statement made by Russia today puts it in a rather complicated  position. In the first place, the decision by the North  Atlantic Alliance is already based on a UN Security Council  resolution which allows military force to be used in extreme  cases. Therefore, the attempts of the Russian leaders to  transfer the discussion of the Bosnian question to the Security  Council will, most likely, not be successful. This dissenting  position by Russia, perhaps for the first time in recent years,  is putting it on the path toward confrontation with Western  diplomacy.</p>

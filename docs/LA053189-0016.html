			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL REVIEW / SCOTT MILLER;  </P> <P> ARMSTRONG IS NAMED ST. AUGUSTINE COACH  </P> <P> Jeff Armstrong has been named the new basketball coach at St. Augustine High  School.  </P> <P> Three years ago, Armstrong took over a Granite Hills team that had gone 1-21  the previous season and proceeded to build a 43-29 record. But he wasn't a  full-time teacher, and the St. Augustine job, vacant since Dick Hardick  resigned after last season, offered a teaching position as well.  </P> <P> "The fact that I will have an opportunity to teach, plus the fact that it  sounds to me like the school really supports building the athletic program, are  basically the two reasons I decided to take the challenge," Armstrong said.  "They're building a new weight room, a new track, and they hired a new athletic  director and football coach (Marty Martin) last year. They're basically  rebuilding the athletic program."  </P> <P> The Saints' basketball team was 2-18 last year.  </P> <P> Add coaching changes: Tim Meinert is leaving as baseball coach at Christian  High for a teaching job La Jolla Country Day, where he will likely assist Peter  Ogle with the baseball team.  </P> <P> "I'm going for the teaching job," Meinert said. "I was offered a job as the  head of the math department and teaching three classes. It's a lighter load and  more money. My wife just had a baby two weeks ago and quit work, so our income  was cut in half. I knew then I'd have to look around. I know Peter wants me to  work with him, but we haven't worked out the details yet."  </P> <P> Meinert's replacement at Christian has not been named.  </P> <P> In another baseball coaching change, Dave Heid has resigned at Fallbrook. His  replacement has not been named, either.  </P> <P> In basketball, Chip Holmes is replacing Jan Chapman at Hilltop, and Steve Milke  will not return as head coach at Bonita Vista.  </P> <P> And Shawn Wirth, athletic director at Torrey Pines, is giving up some of her  day-to-day responsibilities as the school's gymnastics coach and will hire two  more coaches.  </P> <P> "The principal (Nancy Giberson) didn't want me to coach, because it took away  from my primary job as athletic director (during the spring)," Wirth said.  </P> <P> Torrey Pines gymnast Tasha Taylor finished 22nd out of 60 gymnasts Friday at  the National High School Gymnastics Meet in Rolling Meadows, Ill.  </P> <P> Her best event was the uneven parallel bars, where she was 11th with an 8.85.  </P> <P> "She had to compete two days in a row, so she just didn't do very well," Wirth  said.  </P> <P> Indeed, it was an accomplishment that Taylor even arrived at the meet. She won  the San Diego Section optional all-around title Thursday -- her second in two  years -- and then flew all night to get to the national meet, which began at 11  a.m. Friday.  </P> <P> Left-hander Scott Karl threw a three-hitter Saturday as Carlsbad beat Crawford,  9-0, in a San Diego Section 2-A baseball playoff game.  </P> <P> But while Karl handed Crawford its first shutout this season, he didn't help  the Carlsbad offense much: He was the lone Lancer to go hitless. And he bats  fourth.  </P> <P> "If I can pitch like this, I don't care about batting," Karl said, smiling.  </P> <P> Karl has pitched Carlsbad into this afternoon's championship game against  Grossmont after recovering from a broken ankle. He broke it playing soccer this  winter, and three screws were inserted during surgery on Jan. 16.  </P> <P> After a late start, Karl has made a pretty good recovery. He is 5-1 with a 0.00  earned-run average in 38 innings pitched.  </P> <P> Mt. Carmel second baseman Ed Cornblum hit a two-run home run in the third  inning of Mt. Carmel's 5-4 victory over Mira Mesa in a San Diego Section 3-A  baseball semifinal game Saturday at the University of San Diego.  </P> <P> What have Cornblum's teammates called him all season? "Shortage," as in power  shortage.  </P> <P> Kendall Webb is attending a City Council meeting this morning to ask the city  to help subsidize the section football championships in San Diego Jack Murphy  Stadium.  </P> <P> A five-year agreement to use the stadium for the 2-A and 3-A championships,  during which the city contributed as much as $8,700 each year, has expired.  Webb is negotiating a new two-year deal.  </P> <P> The fee for last year's games was $17,787. That covered the cost of rent,  lights, sound system and scoreboard.  </P> <P> Three San Diego athletes own the top marks in the state going into this  weekend's state track meet: Orange Glen's Lenny McGill in the triple jump  (50-4), Fallbrook's Brent Noon in the shot put (69-8 1/4, state record) and  Rancho Buena Vista's Kira Jorgensen in the 1,600 (4:53.66).  </P></p>

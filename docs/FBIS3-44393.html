The great motherland is ushering in  1994, a year with plenty of struggles and plenty of hope.    With deep feelings, we are extending New Year  congratulations  to the people of all nationalities of the country; to our  compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao; and to compatriots  living abroad.    In the year which has just gone by, the entire party and the  people of all nationalities throughout the country -- continuing  to firmly and resolutely implement the guidelines of the  important talks made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his south  China tour and those set by the 14th CPC National Congress --  have seized the opportunities and deepened reform, thus making  an important stride toward establishing a socialist market  economic structure. Throughout the country there is a bumper  harvest, industry grew, foreign trade was active, the market was  brisk, and the people's living standards improved further.  Taking a broad view of the great motherland, we saw the economy  develop rapidly; social and political stability was achieved;  unity and harmony among nationalities was achieved; and new  progress was made in various fields of undertakings, all of  which presented a scene of vitality and vigor. Initial results  were achieved in the fight against corruption. The building of  a spiritual civilization was constantly strengthened. Marked  results were achieved in diplomatic work. Successful visits to  foreign countries by Jiang Zemin and other party and state  leaders enhanced China's friendship with the governments and  peoples of various countries and created a more favorable  international environment for China's modernization  construction. These achievements have further enhanced the  prestige of the party and the government, the prestige of our  people's republic, and the prestige of socialism in China; they  have strengthened the confidence of the people across the  country in advancing victoriously along the road of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics.    The year 1994 will be a crucial year for us to advance on  the  crest of victories to accelerate reforms and development. In  the new year, we must implement in an all-round manner the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; while  focusing on the central task of economic construction, we must  advance the socialist market economy, socialist democratic  politics, and the building of a socialist spiritual  civilization. This year we should accelerate the pace of  building a socialist market economic structure and open wider to  the outside world. Party and government leaders at all levels  must make meticulous arrangements for implementing the plans of  the central authorities. In the process of reform, it is  necessary to earnestly grasp two important matters. First, it  is necessary to strengthen the position of agriculture as the  foundation of the national economy in order to ensure the steady  growth of agriculture and the rural economy as a whole. Second,  it is necessary to improve state-owned large and medium  enterprises as well as increase their vitality in order to  enable them to play the dominant and leading role in economic  development. It is necessary to strengthen and improve  macroeconomic control; vigorously adjust the economic structure;  and heighten economic results in order to maintain the  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy. This year our tasks of reform and development are very  arduous. We should allow reform to promote development and  allow development to support reform. The increasingly stronger  integration of these two principles is very important to the  realization of our objectives by the end of this century.    In order to fulfill the tasks for 1994, we must first make  greater efforts to arm all party members, particularly leading  cadres at all levels, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Theory comes  from practice, and it also guides practice. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is a powerful ideological weapon to guide the  Chinese people to realize their grand ideal of invigorating the  Chinese nation. In the new year, leading cadres at all levels  must conscientiously study volume three of the "Selected Works  of Deng Xiaoping" to have a more thorough understanding of basic  points of view contained in the volume, particularly those on  emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. They should  vigorously promote the revolutionary spirit of exploring new  paths and putting forward new ideas which was seen in the past  decade or so; they should improve their leadership skills in  carrying out reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.  We must build a contingent of cadres capable of going deep into  the realities of life, maintaining ties with the masses, putting  the general interest above all else, and honestly performing  their official duties so the vast ranks of party cadres will  serve the people wholeheartedly and be good pacesetters in  accelerating reform and development.    The interests of the people and their happiness are the  starting point and foundation for all our work. Reform and  construction are the cause for thousands upon millions of  people. As long as we steadfastly rely on the vast number of  workers, peasants, intellectuals, and cadres at various levels;  mobilize all positive factors; and unite with all forces which  can be united with, then there will be no difficulties which  cannot be surmounted. In the new year we must carry forward in  a better manner the fine tradition of maintaining close ties  with the masses and do a good job in guiding, protecting, and  utilizing their zeal for reform and construction. When new  reform measures are introduced, we must do a good job in  publicizing and explaining them. We must pay attention to  methods of work and be good at analyzing and handling various  kinds of contradictions arising within the people under the new  circumstances. We must always care for the people, do  everything within our power to protect their interests, and do  more practical things for them so their living standards and  initiative will keep rising.    Acceleration of reform and construction represents a grand  and complex feat of social systems engineering. We must be good  at grasping and applying Marxist materialist dialectics; we must  correctly understand and handle various evolving relationships,  especially those between reform, economic growth, and stability  as well as between local and national interests. Reform and  development furnish a solid foundation for social and political  stability, while the latter in turn provide a major guarantee  for the former. As reform and opening up increase the pace, we  must firmly bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important idea  that "stability is of overriding importance," persist in the  policy of attaching equal importance to both the material and  spiritual civilizations, and be careful not to emphasize one and  neglect the other. While continuing to increase the  establishment of a socialist democracy and legal system, as well  as the socialist spiritual civilization, we must constantly  consolidate and promote a political situation marked by  stability and unity. As reform deepens by the day, it is even  more important to take the overall situation into account and  properly handle the relationship between local and national  interests. In a large country like ours where conditions vary  in a thousand ways from region to region, difficulties and  contradictions are multitudinous. It is not easy to run such a  country well, and we must depend on the entire nation and the  entire party to work together with one heart. This is also one  of our major advantages. In thinking over a problem or in  undertaking work, leading comrades of all localities and  departments must take the overall situation into account and  conscientiously subject local interests to national ones.    The future of our motherland is splendid; the sons and  daughters of the Chinese nation have heavy responsibilities on  their shoulders. The new year beckons us to create more  brilliant successes. The entire party and the entire nation  must unite more closely under the leadership of the Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core; must uphold  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line; and must  work hard with a pioneering spirit of the new period so as to  achieve new progress and greater success.</p>

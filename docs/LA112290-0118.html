			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POMONA COLLEGE HEARS CALL FROM ASIANS FOR MORE ETHNIC PROGRAMS;  </P> <P> MINORITIES: CAMPUS OFFICIALS MEET WITH STUDENTS, PROFESSORS AFTER STAGING OF  'THE MIKADO' SPURS LATEST IN SERIES OF PROTESTS FOR CULTURAL RECOGNITION.  </P> <P> When "The Mikado," Gilbert and Sullivan's look at Imperial Japan, came to the  Claremont Colleges recently, it drew protests from scores of students and  faculty members who considered it an example of the colleges' insensitivity to  Asian-Americans.  </P> <P> The show went on, but the protests didn't go unheard.  </P> <P> Monday, about two weeks after the demonstrations outside the Claremont  Colleges' Bridges Auditorium, Pomona College officials met with Asian  professors and students to address the needs of that campus's largest and  fastest-growing ethnic minority. Asians make up 14% of the student population  of 1,350, while blacks are 5% and Latinos 12%. Two-thirds of the private  campus, the largest of the Claremont Colleges' six schools, is white.  </P> <P> However, Asians are far behind blacks and Latinos when it comes to special  services and programs -- a discrepancy campus officials said they intend to  correct. Although the Claremont Colleges have offered courses in  African-American and Chicano history since the early 1970s and have  professional counseling centers for black and Latino students, no such programs  exist for Asian-Americans.  </P> <P> "There is a problem on campus that Asian-Americans are not feeling adequately  recognized," said Associate Dean Elizabeth Crighton, who met with several Asian  professors and student leaders Monday evening. " 'The Mikado' was a symptom of  that."  </P> <P> Pomona College history professor Sam Yamashita, one of the "Mikado" protesters,  contended that the operetta promotes Asian stereotypes, through portrayals of  "submissive . . . mindless" females and use of "racist" language. He argued  that it should not have been performed on campus.  </P> <P> The Nov. 2 demonstration was the latest in a series of Claremont Colleges  protests in the past several years, in which students and faculty members  staged rallies, wrote letters to deans, and even wore yellow armbands at  graduation ceremonies to demand courses in Asian-American history, counselors  for Asian-American students, and more Asian faculty members.  </P> <P> Crighton said the college is considering the demands but she expects change to  come gradually.  </P> <P> However, Yamashita and Dorinne Kondo, another professor lobbying for the new  programs, said the slow pace of change is causing students to suffer.  </P> <P> Tammy Ho, a senior at Pomona who coordinates The Re-View, an Asian women's  publication, said college counselors have been insensitive to Asian-Americans.  </P> <P> "I was having problems with my parents," she said. "The counselor said, 'If  your parents are such a problem, why don't you move out? Stand up to your  father and tell him off.' "  </P> <P> Ho said the counselor's response indicated a lack of knowledge about  traditional Chinese families. "I looked at her in disbelief. If I moved out of  my parents', I might as well declare that I'm breaking away from my family."  </P> <P> Pomona officials contend that they never ignored the Asian community.  Asian-American students at Pomona have become politically active only recently  when compared with blacks and Latinos, said Scott Warren, acting dean of  students. For years, he said, they were reluctant to view themselves as  minorities with special problems and needs.  </P> <P> Now, there is a proliferation of Asian student organizations on campus --  everything from an Asian women's group to a club for Southeast Asians to a  student publication geared toward Asian-Americans. In response, Warren said,  the college has hired Asian staff members and helped set up a student-run  mentor program for Asian freshmen.  </P> <P> "The black and Chicano centers were created largely out of concerns of student  movements" in the late 1960s, Warren said. "The consciousness of Asian-American  students as a minority with particular common interests and needs is relatively  recent compared to the civil rights movements of the 1960s. It's a matter of  historical development."  </P></p>

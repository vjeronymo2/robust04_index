			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (9): Instead of a miracle, try management / A look at how the cost of running a fleet can be controlled STEWART WHYTE holds up a small, brightly-coloured box which he claims is the 'miracle switch' that car companies are incorporating on many vehicles. This simple device, he says, enables a car which can travel only 27 miles to a gallon of fuel when on business to cover 40 miles to the gallon when the car is being driven privately by the same driver. A careful inspection reveals the miracle switch to be an empty cigarette carton covered in crepe paper. That is how Mr Whyte, managing director of Fleet Audits, a vehicle fleet consultancy, injects some humour into the serious subject of controlling fleet costs during his training courses. He points out that, if a company urgently needs to reduce the cost of running its fleet, a memo to all company car drivers saying that their fuel consumption is being carefully monitored and that fiddles will not be tolerated 'will reduce fuel costs that week.' Petrol and diesel pump prices have not risen at anything like the rate of inflation for some years but that might be change in the next UK budget. The government has hinted that it may recoup the income lost in removing special car tax by lifting vehicle fuel duties. There is also the prospect of a 'carbon tax' being levied on petrol as part of the government's environmental policy. Mr Whyte says fuel already constitutes an important part of total fleet costs and, from Fleet Audits' experience, too many companies ignore abuses such as blatant fiddling, aggressive driving styles which produce high fuel consumption or a lack of journey planning to minimise the distances covered. There are some indications that the recession is making an impact in this area. Latest research by the Monks Partnership remuneration consultancy, to be published in its annual 'Company Car Policy in the UK' survey later this year, shows that 62 per cent of the companies questioned now issue drivers with fuel credit cards which can be used only for buying fuel and limited quantities of associated products such as oil or windscreen cleaning liquid. A year ago only 53 per cent of companies were using these cards. However, the latest estimates also reveal that the number of companies which simply reimburse their car drivers for receipted bills has gone down only slightly, from 49 to 47 per cent, and this is a method which lends itself to fiddling. Fuel is just one element in the cost of running a company car fleet. With each new car today costing on average between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 12,000 and annual running costs of between Pounds 4,000 and Pounds 7,500, a relatively modest fleet of 50 cars has a capital replacement cost of at least Pounds 500,000 and an annual operational budget of more than Pounds 250,000. Yet the harsher economic climate of the past two years does not seem to have encouraged companies to improve the monitoring of their car fleets. Company Secretary's Review magazine's 1992-93 survey of company car schemes, published by Tolley, showed that 28 per cent of the companies questioned do not monitor costs at all. This is precisely the same percentage as reported in the previous survey. Furthermore, 34 per cent of the companies monitored running costs merely by checking petrol consumption figures against expenses claims. Only 54 per cent said they kept detailed records of the cost of each vehicle. Fleet Audits' Mr Whyte suggests that many companies never bring all cost elements together - the accountant deals with depreciation in the balance sheet; fuel, insurance and maintenance are lost within 'salesmen's expenses;' funding costs are the finance director's responsibility. 'With no overall picture of how the costs build up, or what the total annual expense is, there is no basis of proper and effective cost control.' It is essential, he says, to have correct information about business mileage covered by the fleet but it took the recent change to employers' National Insurance contributions to shake some companies out of a lethargy about mileage information. 'Mileage recording is not difficult and is a pre-requisite of almost every cost factor,' says Mr Whyte. For example, it is needed to make a balanced judgment about moving the fleet from petrol-engined to diesel cars, something which many companies might have to consider if a carbon tax on fuel is introduced. It was not so long ago, when big price premiums were charged for diesel cars and the cost of maintaining them was perceived to be greater than for petrol vehicles, that it was necessary for a car to cover 17,000 to 20,000 business miles a year to break even. Today, Mr Whyte suggests, the annual business mileage could be as low as 7,000 to 9,000. Companies are also using out-of-date methods of car allocation, he says. 'Most managers accept the principle that vehicles in the same class can have widely different cost and reliability profiles. Most then fail to follow this through and allow vehicle selection on the most unreliable indicator of all - the list price.' Most companies still own their car fleets outright, so residual value is a key ingredient in fleet costs. Too many do nothing to maximise residual values - Mr Whyte points out, for example, the cost of a decent valet at Pounds 30 will usually increase residual value by Pounds 100 to Pounds 250 - or to encourage employees to look after their vehicles. According to the Company Secretary's Review survey, 42 per cent of the companies they polled sold their cars directly to employees, which Mr Whyte suggests is highly cost-inefficient. The survey continues to show that very few companies offer employees an incentive to maintain their company cars in good condition - only 4 per cent. Too many companies have not changed their car replacement policies for decades even though vehicle technology has improved tremendously while at the same time, given the state of the jobs market, employees have become less demanding, Mr Whyte points out. 'It is important that the responsible director examine all the issues rather than slavishly continue an outdated tradition.' Once again the recession seems to be having an impact in this area. For example, the Monks Partnership found that in the past year the percentage of companies keeping their cars for between 60,000 and 70,000 miles had risen from 34 in the 1992 survey to 38 this year and those keeping their cars for more than 70,000 miles was up from 27 to 35. Also, those companies keeping their cars for between three and four years had risen from 27 to 29 per cent while those keeping cars for four years was up from 2 to 3. Mr Whyte says another common theme in company car fleets is a lack of driver discipline. Management fails to set standards or to take sanctions against those who breach the rules. One way this impacts costs is that fleet insurance charges are generally increasing by more than 25 per cent a year. Mr Whyte says that Fleet Audits regularly identifies savings in annual costs of between Pounds 300 and Pounds 1,200 a vehicle simply by applying the same management disciplines and controls to the company car fleet as are applied elsewhere in the organisation. The bottom line is that 'businesses simply under-manage their fleets. A competent fleet manager with adequate resources to deal with the fleet operation and manage it pro-actively is undoubtedly an expense. But in most companies that expense is likely to be repaid many times over by the savings generated by effective control.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 CAR ALLOCATION (figures in percentages)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Size of fleet                (Total)   6-9   10-19   20-49   50-99  100+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Representatives                65       47     61     65       71    76 Middle management              63       32     50     63       81    90 Senior management              90       73     91     89       97    98 Directors/partners             89       85     89     88       92    93 Engineers, maintenance/tech     9        2      5     11       14    12 Other office staff              2        2      3      1        3     2 Others                          4        2      4      2        4     8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company Secretary's Review Survey of Company Car Schemes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           CRITERIA IN ALLOCATION (figures in percentages)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Size of fleet                (Total)   6-9   10-19   20-49   50-99  100+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Seniority                      84       83     84     85       86    81 Mobility need                  70       65     67     76       59    75 Recruitment need               26       16     13     25       35    44 Work incentive                 17       10     19     18       18    16 Minimum annual mileage          9        -      4      6        8    27 Minimum salary                  4        1      1      1        3    13 Others                          2        -      1      3        6     3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company Secretary's Review of Company Car Schemes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

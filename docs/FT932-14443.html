			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Arts: Dramatic talent, step forward / Review of the Humana Festival of new plays, Louisville The 17th annual Humana Festival of New Plays at the Actors Theater of Louisville looked and sounded, to its credit, more like America than the fare of theatres in many of this country's major urban centres. Its nine playwrights, including four women and three writers of colour, took on some of contemporary society's most pressing issues in productions that upheld the high standard of acting and design that we have come to expect from America's best-known new plays festival. Though not all of its risks paid off this year, its unceasing commitment to producing work that pushes the boundaries of traditional playwriting keeps the Festival vital. Humana's most conventional play this year was also its most successful: Joan Ackerman's Stanton's Garage, a two-act comedy set in an auto repair shop in rural Missouri. It is a big, overstuffed sofa of a play: too long, but comfortable, packed full of interesting characters and witty dialogue. Car failure maroons Lee (Priscilla Shanks), a successful but uptight doctor, at Stanton's Garage with her fiance's bookish teenage daughter, Frannie (Jessica Jory), who is so involved in caring for her father that she has not developed a life of her own. Lee and Frannie never get to their destination  -needless to say the mechanics in the garage have never seen a Volvo before  -but two sweaty midsummer days in Stanton's Garage thaw these frosty, defensive women. Frannie gets her first kiss from the garage's junior mechanic, in a charming scene sensitively played by Jory and Rob Kramer, and Lee realises that she has spent her life defining herself by outside standards and decides to leave Frannie's father. Local colour transcends any cliche through the actors' excellent performances, particularly Adale O'Brien as the garage's wisecracking receptionist. In Steven Albrezzi's adept production the play's potentially confusing plot lines crack along with perfect clarity. Scenic designer Paul Owen matches the naturalism of Ackerman's writing with a garage perfectly observed. This year's most talked-about offering was Keely and Du, a play about abortion by one of the Festival's most prolific and mysterious writers, Jane Martin. Jane Martin is a pseudonym, and it is widely believed that 'she' is Actors Theater Artistic Director Jon Jory, who directed Keely and Du. Keely and Du is similar in its spareness to David Mamet's recent two-hander about sexual harassment, Oleanna; but unlike Mamet, Martin's pared-down style does not expose the heart of the debate he tries to dramatise. The play opens in a barely furnished cell in which a young woman, Keely (Julie Boyd), is handcuffed to a bed. Impregnated when her former husband raped her, Keely was on her way to an abortion clinic when she was abducted by a radical anti-abortion group. Walter (Bob Burrus), the evangelical pastor responsible for Keely's capture, tells her that they plan to force her to carry the baby to term. Supervising Keely is an elderly woman, Du (Anne Pitoniak), whose growing fondness for the younger woman leads her to deviate from her orders. Keely and Du is so well-plotted and the Humana production so tightly directed and intently played that its build up is inexorable and gripping, its denouement at once inevitable and shocking. But Martin's technical writing skills and this strong production cannot make up for Keely and Du's failure to talk about what it is really talking about: a political issue. Humana's presentation of ten-minute plays this year was almost a non-event: one-idea situations the writers have tried to stretch, unsuccessfully, into plays. Deadly Virtues, a collaborative creation of its five-person ensemble that was adapted and directed by Brian Jucha, was Humana's most non-traditional offering. Though well-performed, painstakingly choreographed and gorgeously produced, this collage of movement, song and text came off as pretentious and meaningless - the kind of thing that gives performance art a bad name. Another interesting idea gone awry was Shooting Simone, Lynne Kaufman's investigation of the ambiguities in feminist Simone de Beauvoir's relationship with Jean-Paul Sartre. Kaufman's reductive treatment of her subject matter was matched by a shallow production - Paul Owen's unimaginative set, Lazlo Martin's scattershot direction, and the actors' brassy performances - that played like a bad TV movie. Far more exciting were works by two talented young writers testing the bounds of the traditional narrative play. Kevin Kling's Ice Fishing Play is an intriguing overlay of situational comedy, memory play, and meditation on mortality. Kling's convoluted storytelling calls out for a clarity of production that it did not receive from Michael Sommers, but the freshness of this writer's voice is indisputable. Any disappointment in Jennine's Diary, a jumbled travelogue/memory play that was the first of Regina Taylor's brace of one-acts billed as 'Various Small Fires', was quickly eradicated by the second, Watermelon Rinds. In Novella Nelson's production, Taylor's hilarious and harrowing reinvention of the family drama for contemporary urban Black life exploded with imagination and verbal dexterity. We should be hearing more from Taylor, who is an accomplished stage and television actress as well as playwright.</p>

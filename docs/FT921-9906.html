			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Caterpillar to end lock-out CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earth-moving and construction equipment, announced it would end its lock-out of 5,600 workers in an attempt to resolve its labour dispute with the United Auto Workers, writes Barbara Durr. The company asked the union to return to the bargaining table during the week of February 17. Formal talks broke off over three months ago. The lock-out occurred on November 7 in retaliation for a partial strike involving 2,400 UAW members that began on November 3. Caterpillar said it will put 'important modifications' to its contract proposal on the table. The UAW has demanded Caterpillar match its recent contract deal with Deere &amp; Co, heavy equipment maker.</p>

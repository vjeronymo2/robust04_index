			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Construction Contracts: Maintaining military bases ACER CONSULTANTS has been awarded a maintenance contract, worth Pounds 23m per annum, by the UK Ministry of Defence for works services management of bases in Cyprus. Britain has been in Cyprus since 1851 and the bases are a vital operational and logistics base for Nato in the eastern Mediterranean, with Royal Navy, Army and Air Force installations at Episkopi, Dhekelia and Akrotiri. An initial contract award of three and half years, the work begins in June after a three-month handover period. Acer will be responsible for managing both the annual maintenance and minor works budget for the bases. Offices will be established at each of three bases and a fourth office will be set up at Nicosia. A new company has been set up by Acer and Charilaos Apostilades, one of the largest contractors in Cyprus, specifically for this project.</p>

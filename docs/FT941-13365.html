			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Arms link to dam aid deal admitted British and Malaysian ministers signed a protocol in 1988 tying defence sales to civil aid projects, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said last night, Kevin Brown and James Blitz writes. Mr Hurd told the Commons in a written answer that the protocol was signed by Mr George (now Lord) Younger, the then defence secretary, at the request of the Malaysian government. Mr Hurd said Lord Younger wrote to the Malaysian finance ministry in June 1988 to say that aid could not be linked to defence sales. As a result the issue was not taken up in a memorandum of understanding on defence procurement signed by Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher, the then prime minister, in September 1988. However, the admission that a formal link between defence sales and aid was agreed between the two will add to the controversy over British aid to Malaysia's Pergau dam project in the late 1980s. The Commons foreign affairs committee is expected to decide today to go ahead with an investigation into the project, which has cost the Exchequer about Pounds 300m and has been described as a 'very bad buy' by Whitehall officials. Members of the committee said last night that an investigation would certainly take place, and that the body simply had to decide how and when to proceed. The Commons public accounts committee has recently examined the project and is due to release a report this year. Its findings will criticise the government for spending more money than was necessary on the project, which is expected to lead to a rise in Malaysian electricity prices.</p>

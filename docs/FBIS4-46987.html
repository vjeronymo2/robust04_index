			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marina Grigoryan: "To Live for the Sake of </F> Living or To Live for the Sake of Survival?"]    [Text] Does anybody in Armenia think about peace?    I admit that this question which has been asked of me (and I  think not just me) outside the republic puzzles me. Indeed, do  we think about peace? Or have we fully reconciled ourselves to  our continued existence under absolutely absurd conditions  caused by war in the habitual belief that nothing depends on us  and that the war will be over only when the powers that be wish  it? In the latter case, which is the closest to the truth we  must acknowledge that, sad as it might be, Ashot Bleyan alone is  the one who proposes his concept for achieving peace. We may  brand him with infamy and call him a traitor all we want, but  this does not change the crux of the matter: In the greater  scheme of things, no alternative to Bleyan's approach has been  proposed. More precisely, the continuation of the war is  subconsciously expected--a war that has never done anything good  for any nation. We do have enough common sense or sense of  dignity to angrily reject Bleyan's ideas, but unfortunately so  far we have lacked the courage and honesty to ourselves needed  to publicly acknowledge that he is right on one score: We need  peace. What price peace--this is another issue, perhaps the  principal one for us.    ...I am fully aware of how slippery and delicate the topic  is. At present it is not a very accepted practice to talk about  peace because it is conjectured that it may be achieved in one  way only: by surrendering Karabakh to Azerbaijan. I will venture  to state that this is the easiest path toward peace; something  else is considerably more difficult: to try and break out of the  captivity of stereotypes which dictate to us this alternative to  the war only, and to try taking a different view of the  situation. Bleyan is not at all to blame for proposing this way  out--no, he has a right to do so, just like any other citizen.  His fault, and our woe, is that he has discredited and profaned  the idea of pacifism to such a degree that he has simply turned  the people off to it. Indeed, such an unacceptable "new path"  was proposed that it was absolutely clear from the very  beginning: The people would never go for it. Burying in oblivion  the historic past, the thing that actually makes Armenians who  they are, in the name of physical survival--could something more  shameful have been offered to the people? The calculation was  accurate: Bleyan became a bugaboo, but at the same time the  thought became deeply embedded in the minds of the people that  only Karabakh may be the price of peace, and therefore nothing  else remains but to continue the war.    Our stereotypes have indeed struck powerful and deep roots.  The conviction that the continuation or discontinuation of the  war does not depend on us is one of the stereotypes. It is  difficult to counter this in any way: The interests of strong  powers indeed intertwine in our region, and as always we are  mere cogs in this mighty machine. The thought that a small  nation depends wholly and entirely on the whims of large nations  and has few ways to possibly influence its own fate has been  powerfully established in our consciousness for a long time.  Therefore, we do not have a choice: We must just ask to be taken  under the wing of the least cruel patron and throw ourselves on  his mercy. Actually, this is precisely what we have been doing  over at least the last few centuries. I think I do not have to  explain what we got as a result: the year 1915 and Aydat.    However, if everything is so simple and nothing depends on  us, why do we reject "Bleyanovism" so angrily? After all, it is  clear that if it is up to the strong powers to solve the  problem, for now they are not inclined to agree to the redrawing  of existing borders. This is point one. Second, such a passive  position would be more or less acceptable if carnage were not  going on over there, in Karabakh, in which Armenians, too, are  cannon fodder.    We think that only one conclusion is possible. If we are  unable to stop the war because someone needs it today, could we  try pursuing a policy under which peace in our region will be  more advantageous for this "someone?" So far we have been  playing the role of mere gladiators, making no attempts to be of  any interest to others outside of this role--outside of the war.  This is worth trying because too much is on the line for us. I  repeat that to this end we should abandon traditional  approaches, reject the historical inertia of hemming ourselves  in, and take a fresh view of the situation and our role in it.    It is no secret that the array of forces in the region  hinges  to a tremendous degree on Russia's presence or absence from it.  A glance at the historical past easily convinces us that the  policy of Russia in Transcaucasia and its mechanism have always  been quite integral, and all manner of deviations in various  periods of time have been merely different phases of this whole  policy. The traditional attitude of Armenians toward Russia is  that toward our savior from the Turks. This is hard to deny;  however, it is equally hard to unambiguously maintain that the  very arrival of Russia in the region will by itself bring  happiness to the Armenian people.    This shines through with absolute clarity in the situation  that has now emerged on account of Karabakh. If we dispense with  everything extraneous, with the smokescreen of hollow discourse  and meaningless documents, the main point will take shape:  Russia is seeking to introduce its armed forces into the region.  Such is the price for stopping bloodshed to which we agree, at  least outwardly. We agree in the secret hope that Azerbaijan  will refuse yet again. We agree, although deep down we  understand that quite possibly this augurs nothing good for us.  In other words, we choose the lesser evil. But is it the lesser?    I will specify right away that pro-Russian or pro-Western  orientation is not at issue. At issue is the revision of the  existing practice of mutual relations with both our neighbors in  the region and external forces. So far, such practice has boiled  down to two extremes: either throwing ourselves on the mercy of  the neighbor in order to physically survive, or striking a deal  with external forces in order to fight our neighbors with  assistance from these forces. As history shows, both extremes  have resulted in disasters. A way out is found in creating a  harmonious mechanism for mutual relations with all which would  rule out the necessity of selling out to someone solely in order  to survive. This is extremely difficult; however, by all signs  there is no other way. Otherwise, we have to either agree with  Bleyan or--as is being done at present--go with the flow while  being clearly aware that this may be very well fraught with a  recurrence of the tragedy from the beginning of this century. Is  this cruel? However, history clearly indicates what the tactic  of political flirtation has done to Armenia. Besides, that same  history teaches us that it is better to perceive and  overestimate the danger than underestimate it. We cannot allow  the mourning procession on 24 April toward the memorial  commemorating the dead to become the only result of the 1915  tragedy for us, after all.    Naturally, all political concepts presuppose certain givens,  a foundation from which we need to proceed. To stop being a  nation which is continuously sacrificed we must be of a certain  value as far as our activities are concerned for both our  immediate neighbors and external forces, and make sure that they  reckon with us instead of accomplishing their tasks with our  blood. We cannot be the bet of just one force; we must seek many  bets on us. In this case we would not be needed solely for war.  In this case we would embark on a path toward peace because we  would become a component of the policies of several forces at  once rather than the policy of one force. If we agree to get  away from the carnage by way of bringing in Russian troops, we  will cease to be a factor of any consequence in the region  because this task will already have been solved, and further on  we will be used to achieve other goals.    Therefore, the conclusion is that the further away from us  Russia is, the more it will support us. The less of Russia there  is in the region, the more interest Russia will have in Armenia.  As it withdraws from this region, Russia is compelled to have a  force here which is an extension of its force. Russia's coming  would mean that in this sense we would no longer exist for  Russia. Israel's struggle against American presence in the Near  East is a classical example. Plainly speaking, when your master  is not present in your region, you become his representative  there; when your master appears, you just disappear. The essence  of the mechanism is simple: to fight the force thanks to which  you exist. A paradox? This may be so, but what has the orthodox  way of thinking and actions accomplished for us to date?    As I see it, the flexibility and correctness of a policy are  found in behaving adequately in each specific situation,  adhering to one tested concept. In our case, each of Russia's  moves in the region changes the array of forces in it and  necessitates an adequate response. After all, it may very well  happen that in one situation one's interests and the interests  of a traditionally opposed neighbor may coincide. Of course,  there is nothing new about this: One uses the contradictions of  other parties to one's own benefit in the event the interests of  one of these sides coincides with one's own interests. Applying  this well-known theoretical consideration to the situation  existing at present, we get the following: Azerbaijan resists  the introduction of Russian troops to the region; this, shall we  say, does not hold the promise of special dividends for Armenia,  either. Why not become an ally of Azerbaijan on this issue? We  thus become a policy component, and therefore are of interest to  both sides. Consequently they will not strive to subjugate, use,  or destroy us. However, this is the case on only one issue; on  all others we oppose Azerbaijan together with the powerful force  we represent in the region.    This may seem to be merely yet another look at the array of  forces in the region which does not at all guarantee us peace.  However, first, nobody is in a position to guarantee peace on an  issue so complex. Besides, if the statement that war is an  extension of politics is correct, it is all the more logical to  consider peace to be an extension of politics.    Finally, we can hardly deny the fact that the policy we have  been pursuing has not resulted in any particular success toward  a peaceful resolution of the conflict to date. Moreover, against  the background of interminable negotiations and statements about  "dedication to a peaceful resolution of the conflict" the flames  of war are fanned ever stronger, claiming still new lives.  Indeed, stopping the war does not depend on us alone. However,  we must be interested in peace more than anyone else; that is,  we must increase the peaceful component of our card as far as  possible.    EDITORIAL NOTE: Laying no claim at all to covering the  entire range of issues related to this important problem, to say  nothing of possessing the ultimate truth, we would like to  invite for discussion all those who have something to say on  this point. Anyone who cares about the fate of the Motherland  and its people cannot help pondering what we are going to  bequeath to our children on this land--the eternal necessity of  purely physical survival or an opportunity to live lives worthy  of people and build a new Armenia?</p>

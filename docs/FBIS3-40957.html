He  described as very important the fact that the three presidents  reached an agreement on procedures for transportation to Russia  of nuclear warheads deployed in Ukraine based on compensation  and security assurances. Ukraine will receive 100 metric tons  of uranium for its nuclear power plants as compensation for the  removal of the warheads.</p>

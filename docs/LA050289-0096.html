			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> W. GERMAN AGAIN REJECTS NEED TO UPGRADE MISSILES  </P> <P> West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher rejected again Monday the  warnings Bonn has received from Washington and London that NATO needs to  upgrade its short-range nuclear missiles, rather than negotiating to cut their  number.  </P> <P> Washington and London say it is essential to update the aging Lance short-range  nuclear weapons, which are based in West Germany, rather than negotiate a low  East-West ceiling on them.  </P> <P> The issue is not new -- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had discussed  the possibility of East-West talks on reducing the weapons in 1987 and 1988 --  and should be dealt with now, Genscher told the Frankfurter Rundschau  newspaper.  </P> <P> "The point . . . is to give reality to the intention stressed in two important  alliance decisions," Genscher said. "It should be possible to find a way to do  this.  </P> <P> "I do not doubt the good will of all the alliance partners involved," he said  in the interview released by the Foreign Ministry ahead of newspaper  publication today.  </P> <P> British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher spelled out her interpretation of NATO  policy to Chancellor Helmut Kohl during a daylong visit to West Germany on  Sunday, insisting on updating the Lance and avoiding the negotiations issue.  </P> <P> The question of the weapons, which have a range of up to 300 miles, is expected  to be the main theme at NATO's 40th anniversary summit in Brussels on May  29-30.  </P></p>

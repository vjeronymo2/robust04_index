			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / International Company News: Paribas may sue over Ciments Francais losses PARIBAS, the French investment bank, is considering taking legal action following the discovery of off-balance sheet losses at Ciments Francais, the cement company in which it is selling its controlling stake to Italy's Italcementi Paribas, which faces a possible compensation claim from Italcementi for part of the purchase price on the Ciments Francais stake, yesterday confirmed it was planning to lodge a legal suit. But it has not yet decided on the final form of the action, or whether it would mount the case alone or together with Italcementi. Paribas would have to decide whether to mount a case against the Ciments Francais board, or against Mr Pierre Conso, who resigned on Wednesday as chairman of the company on the disclosure of the losses. The losses are believed to have arisen from share repurchase agreements undertaken between Ciments Francais and a variety of third parties, in offshore financial centres such as Guernsey and the Bahamas. In the deals, the French company is thought to have sold stakes in foreign subsidiaries under its control and in other companies in which it was a minority shareholder on the basis that it would buy back the securities at a pre-established price later. Many, if not all, the companies concerned were quoted. Subsequent falls in their share prices left Ciments Francais facing extraordinary losses on the deals. The French group is also believed to have promised to pay its counterparties interest on the funds provided against the shares. The Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the watchdog of the Paris stockmarket, has opened an investigation into the Ciments Francais controversy. Italcementi's auditors, KPMG, are still trying to discover where the money has gone. It could then establish the purpose of the transactions. French press reports estimate the likely level of the losses at between FFr400m (Dollars 83.7m) and FFr500m. Paribas has started discussions with Italcementi over the implications of the losses for their deal. Italcementi's agreement to buy control of Ciments Francais from Paribas was announced in April, but is not due for completion until the year-end. The terms of the agreement are thought to include reference to exceptional circumstances, which could include the discovery of off-balance sheet losses. However, the two sides have not yet been able to assess the full implications of Ciments Francais' losses for their agreement. While Italcementi might try to negotiate a lower acquisition price, a simpler solution would be for Paribas to make up the losses once their full extent is known.</p>

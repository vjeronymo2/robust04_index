			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, 2 Feb (DPA) -- Cuba will probably not be able  to reach an overall aid agreement with the European Union [EU]  until it is able to reach an understanding with the United  States, German officials who met with Ricardo Alarcon de  Quesada, president of the National Assembly of the People's  Government [ANPP], stated.    Alarcon began today in Bonn the most important part of his  five-day official visit to Germany at the invitation of German  National Assembly (Bundestag) President Rita Sussmuth. Alarcon  spent the first two days of his tour in the northern city-state  of Bremen. Alarcon, a former foreign minister, will meet with  top officials during his stay. Minister Bernd Schmidbauer, who  is from the office of Prime Minister Helmut Kohl and is the man  in charge of coordinating Germany's secret services, will be one  of Alarcon's interlocutors. These gestures, however, do not  represent an opening on the German side, Alarcon's interlocutors  indicated. "To do that, we would need to see a decision to  change from Cuba, something we are not seeing," highly placed  sources stated in Bonn.    The German Government would like to help Cubans with broader  bilateral cooperation programs, "but so far we have not seen the  conditions necessary to do that," German authorities stated.  "Cuban-German relations are therefore marked by a certain  sentiment of ambiguity."    The ANPP president met first with Bundestag Vice President  Hans Klein (of the co-ruling Christian Social Union), and later  with members of the Christian Democratic Union bloc.    Klein told DPA about a Cuban-German "joint venture" in  tourism. He noted, however, that "the realization of decisive  German-Cuban bilateral cooperation projects depends  fundamentally on the legal system and economic conditions in  Cuba."    A group of Bundestag deputies in charge of relations with  Central America and the Caribbean will host a lunch in Alarcon's  honor at the headquarters of Bonn's Parliamentary Society.  Earlier the Cuban official met with Deputy Gregor Gysi, chief  of the Party of Democratic Socialism bloc, the political  successor of the East German Communist Party.    Alarcon told DPA that Cuba "must make a series of changes in  its economy but does not seek to change the basic elements of  its political project, which is socialism."    On relations with the EU, Alarcon said he was convinced that  "they are headed in the right direction at the bilateral level,  as well as with Europe as a whole, and we hope to conclude soon  an overall cooperation agreement with the EU."    For the German Government and legislature, however, the  ideas  of the EU Executive Committee about Cuba "do not constitute an  opening, either."    Europeans are convinced that Cuba must first reach an  agreement with the United States before the EU doors are opened.  Meanwhile, "these will be the only gestures of support that  Cubans will receive from us. Those gestures, however, will not  manage to resolve the catastrophic situation that the nation is  experiencing."    Tourism will not solve Cuba's problems, either. The German  authorities are not opposed to any kind of increase in the  number of tourists to Cuba or investments by German companies in  hotel or vacation centers, "but capital does not flow to places  where there is no guarantee of stability," Klein added.    Over 60,000 Germans went to Cuba on vacation last year. For  Cuba, German tourists constitute the second largest group of  visitors in the world and the first in Europe. "But all of this  is not going to save the country," Bonn government sources  stated.    Cubans are "nice, welcome, highly qualified, and seeking  cooperation, but deep down that cannot happen so long as they  maintain their same policy," the sources concluded.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Telecoms licence may be extended MILLICOM Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of the US communications group, is likely to become the first telecommunications operator in the UK authorised to offer entertainment services over a national network, Alan Cane writes. The company said yesterday that the government had provisionally agreed to extend the scope of Millicom's proposed public telecoms licence to include the delivery of radio and television programmes. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, said that such a substantial change to the terms of the licence would require a further period of public consultation. The government made a clear distinction between carrying entertainment services - within the scope of the proposed licence - and providing programmes, which would require separate authorisation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio </F> by unidentified reporter at the Supreme Electoral Tribunal  facility at the Industrial Park in Guatemala City; from the  "Telepress" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Reporter] Mr. De Leon, do you believe the  country's institutional problem has been resolved with the  victory of the yes vote?    [De Leon] I think the yes vote has resolved the  institutional  problem we had been experiencing since 25 May. The very fact  that a popular consultation was held is an advantage for the  Guatemalan people. The very fact that it happened in spite of  the obstacles [word indistinct] and terrorist acts consolidates  the process, because in the eyes of the Guatemalan people and  the world, we resolved a problem that had existed since 25 May  through peaceful, constitutional, and democratic means. What  events? The people wanted a purge, and with the victory of the  yes vote over the no vote, they managed to purge three branches  of state. The deputies will go and there will be a new Congress  and a new constitution. Therefore, the branches of state will be  reorganized.    But to answer your question, I say yes, the institutional  problem has been resolved because there was an impasse. The  solution came late, because the people wanted this situation to  be resolved earlier. But today the Guatemalan people can have  peace of mind because we have turned this page of Guatemala's  history and we can now deal with profound issues such as the  country's economic and social problems.    [Reporter] Did the abstention say anything to you?    [De Leon] Yes, of course. First I must point out that  today's electoral event was marked by some very special  characteristics that led to abstention. I am not making  excuses, but the situation must be examined. This was a very  special, unprecedented event in Guatemala. From the electoral  standpoint, no local authorities were being elected. Residents  of municipalities, for example, are interested in electing their  mayors, deputies, and president. In this election they were  voting for something that was not clearly understood by  everyone. There was a lot of confusion, misinformation, or a  shortage of information. In other words, the circumstances  surrounding the event were adverse. If we couple that with the  terrorism, blackmail, and numerous obstacles confronted by the  voters, abstention was to be expected. In any electoral event  anywhere in the world, abstention is natural and was to be  expected in Guatemala. Nevertheless, the Guatemalan people  should acknowledge the high rate of abstention and should be  concerned about it because, in my opinion, it shows that the  democratic system is somewhat exhausted.    [Reporter] Do you dismiss the possibility that it was a form  of protest against the format of the consultation?    [De Leon] I do not think it was precisely against the format  of the consultation. I tend to think that on one hand it shows  the Guatemalan people's exhaustion, and on the other their  rejection of the (?democratic) system. The Guatemalan people  are tired and indifferent, and that is dangerous. That is why I  say we should all be concerned about the democratic system's  failure to give the people the answers they wanted. We have had  this system since 1986 when the first constitutional period  began following a constituent assembly, and Guatemalans still  have not seen an improvement in the situation. On the contrary,  in some ways the situation has grown worse. Herein lies the  danger, and that is why I believe we should be concerned over  today's abstention rate. We must think about the congressional  elections that will be coming up within five months and the  general elections within a year. I don't think we should have  such a high abstention rate.    [Reporter] From now on, taking for granted the victory of  the yes vote, of course, do you believe the deadlines  established in the reforms will be respected?    [De Leon] Of course. They must be. First, Article 33 of  the constitutional reforms states that the reforms will go into  effect 60 days after being confirmed by a popular consultation.    These measures correspond to the government agenda for 1994  and 1995, the present circumstances, and the government policy  to meet the goals proposed for 1994 and 1995. I cannot give  details ahead of schedule, but I can say that they are of a  monetary, fiscal, political, and economic nature.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [De Leon] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] enjoys full  credibility. It is about the only institution enjoying the full  faith of the Guatemalan people and the international community.  The TSE does its duty. The constitutional reforms will go into  effect 60 days after the referendum. The TSE then has 120 days  to convoke congressional elections; that is, the TSE could hold  the elections for a new congress around 30 July. All the  executive has to do is enforce the law and defend the Guatemalan  people's interests. But the law cannot be mocked. The  Guatemalan people know about the TSE's principles and commitment  to duty and that the TSE will do what it must within the  deadline. I don't think we have any reason to worry about this.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [De Leon] In the first place, it is their right to use any  legal instrument or resource and to take any actions to oppose  the event for this or any other reason. I can tell you in  advance, however, that such a move does not stand a chance  because the law is very clear. Approval does not require a  specific and greater percentage. This was a relative majority.  The yes vote won over the no vote by approximately 100 to one.  There is no doubt. The high abstention rate is the  responsibility of those who did not cast their votes. Those who  did represented the rest, therefore there can bae no challenge  from a legal viewpoint.</p>

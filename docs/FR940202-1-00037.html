			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At present, California red-legged frogs are known to occur in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 190 streams or drainages from 15 counties in central and southern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California. Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support the greatest amount of currently occupied habitat. The most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secure aggregations of California red-legged frogs are found in aquatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites that support substantial riparian and aquatic vegetation and lack  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exotic predators (e.g., bullfrogs, mosquitofish, largemouth and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smallmouth bass). The majority of aggregations are threatened, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by expansion of exotic predators, proposed residential development,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water storage projects, and other factors. For example, within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Central Valley hydrographic basin, only six drainages, all on the Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range slope of the San Joaquin Valley, are known or likely to support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California red-legged frogs, compared to over 60 historic locality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records for this basin. Two of these drainages, known to support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant numbers of California red-legged frogs, are sites of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed large reservoir projects. Also, in southern California,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California red-legged frogs are known from only 4 locations south of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tehachapi Mountains, compared to over 80 historic locality records for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this region. Only three areas currently support more than 350 adults.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Federal Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 29, 1992, the Service received a petition from Drs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mark R. Jennings, Marc P. Hayes, and Dan C. Holland to list the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California red-legged frog ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rana aurora draytonii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified endangered or threatened status by distinct drainages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (watersheds) within the range of the species. On October 5, 1992, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service published a 90-day petition finding (57 FR 45761) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial information had been presented indicating the requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action may be warranted. Public comments were requested on the status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this species. The California red-legged frog had been included as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Category 1 candidate species in the Service's November 21, 1991, Animal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of Review (56 FR 58804). Category 1 candidates are species for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the Service has substantial information on biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vulnerability and threat to support proposals to list them as endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or threatened. On July 19, 1993, the Service published a 12-month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding on the petitioned action (58 FR 38553). This finding indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that listing of the California red-legged frog was warranted and that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule would be published promptly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

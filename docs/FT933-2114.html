			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Labour to join attack on A-levels LABOUR IS expected to launch a debate today aimed at abolishing A-level examinations and introducing some form of payment by graduates for university education. The announcement, as part of the launch of the third part of party's 'green paper' on education policy, adds heat to the debate over university funding two days before university vice-chancellors announce which extra source of funds they favour. Last month vice-chancellors said they were considering options including loans for tuition and an additional income tax for graduates. Labour's document is consultative, and so no definite plans will be announced. Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow education secretary, has strongly signalled, however, that Labour should reject the present system of funding where non-graduates in effect subsidise those who have had the benefit of a university education. Labour - like the university principals, who made it clear they welcomed the party's change of direction - is considering either a system of loans which would be repaid through the tax system, or a full graduate tax. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, plans to announce his thinking on funding in a speech to vice-chancellors at Leicester University tomorrow. He is expected to offer further expansion in the sector if additional sources of funding can be found. Labour is expected to call for the abolition of A-levels, described last week by Mrs Taylor as 'too restrictive and too narrow', in favour of a broad restructuring of further education and the integration of more vocational education. In the last month A-levels have come under attack from employers and from Mr Robin Wilson, chairman of the Headmasters' Conference, a group of independent boys' schools.</p>

Turkish warplanes are regularly intercepted by Greek  fighters  in Greek national air space, but the sources said Turkish  sorties over the Aegean were now being flown in attack  formations and planes armed with air-to-air and air-to-surface  missiles had buzzed Greek navy boats patrolling Greek waters.  They added that two Turkish naval vessels had also strayed into  Greek waters off the island of Milos, 77 nautical miles from  Pireaivs.</p>

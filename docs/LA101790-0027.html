			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> WILSON IN SENATE; FEINSTEIN STILL ATTACKS;  </P> <P> ADS: THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE PRESSES ISSUE OF HER OPPONENT'S ATTENDANCE RECORD  IN REVISED TV COMMERCIALS.  </P> <P> Even though Sen. Pete Wilson returned to Washington for critical votes on the  federal budget, Dianne Feinstein continued to pursue him with the Senate  absenteeism issue by adding a new tag line to three gubernatorial campaign ads:  "Dianne Feinstein: She'll be there for California."  </P> <P> The three 30-second commercials which began running Tuesday are revised  versions of ads that Feinstein ran during her spring primary campaign against  fellow Democrat John K. Van de Kamp. They include the "grabber" ad that  campaign experts said propelled her into contention in the governor's race.  </P> <P> The commercial opens with news footage from Nov. 27, 1978, of Feinstein  announcing the shooting deaths of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and  Supervisor Harvey Milk. As chair of the Board of Supervisors, Feinstein became  mayor upon Moscone's death. That came only hours after she had announced plans  not to run again for city office.  </P> <P> The second ad is another version of the same commercial, opening with the  announcer's line, "Forged from tragedy, her leadership brought San Francisco  together."  </P> <P> The third, running on today's anniversary of the Oct. 17 earthquake, touts  Feinstein's "foresight and common sense" in backing the reinforcement San  Francisco's Candlestick Park to protect it from earthquakes.  </P> <P> The primary election messages have been removed. In the new versions, Feinstein  emphasizes her positions on growth management, early childhood education and  health care.  </P> <P> Feinstein campaign director Bill Carrick said Tuesday the timing of the three  ads was not linked to Republican Wilson's decision Monday to return to  Washington for this week's Senate sessions on the budget deficit and other  issues. Wilson had campaigned steadily in California since Labor Day but was  heavily criticized by Feinstein for missing votes in Washington.  </P> <P> Carrick also raised the possibility that a new commercial focusing on Wilson's  voting record in the Senate would run soon.  </P> <P> The commercials aired Tuesday in all major markets of the state are aimed at  undecided voters who are just beginning to focus on the governor's race,  Carrick said.  </P> <P> "We're returning to basics. This is a refresher course on who Dianne is," he  said.  </P> <P> Carrick has believed that about 40% of the likely voters are confirmed Wilson  supporters, about 40% are Feinstein backers and the remaining 20% are "still up  for grabs." He said the undecided group consists largely of blue-collar  workers, older women and suburban voters.  </P> <P> Otto Bos, Wilson's campaign director, charged that portions of the commercials  are misleading, including a newspaper headline that says "Feinstein Backs  Police" and a statement that she is the only candidate with a plan for early  childhood education.  </P> <P> Bos said that the headline ran above a story reporting disarray within the San  Francisco Police Department and that Feinstein was supporting the police  chief's plan for stricter supervision of line officers.  </P> <P> As to the early childhood education plan, Bos said, "Wilson was in favor of  that before she was, in December." But Carrick said Feinstein is the only  candidate with a specific proposal for paying for the expanded education  program. She has proposed doing this by increasing the share of lottery  proceeds going to education along with additional money from Proposition 133, a  Nov. 6 ballot initiative that would increase the state sales tax by a half-cent  for anti-drug education and other drug-fighting programs.  </P></p>

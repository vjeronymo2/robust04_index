			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CAPITOL TREE TOPPLES WRONG WAY  </P> <P> Residents watching the cutting of a 90-foot spruce selected as the U.S.  Capitol's Christmas tree went scurrying for cover when the falling tree twisted  out of control and crashed across a road.  </P> <P> The giant spruce toppled onto a truck-mounted crane that was waiting to haul  the tree away Saturday. Ten feet broke off the top of the tree when volunteers  tried to move it at the Kootenai National Forest in northwestern Montana.  </P> <P> Afterward, woodcutters felled a nearby tree deemed acceptable by the Capitol's  landscape architect when he visited the forest in June.  </P> <P> "We'd like to say it went perfect the first time, but it didn't," said Bill  Crismore of Libby, who had been given the honor of cutting the tree.  </P> <P> Only about 61 feet of the tree can be shipped to Washington because that is the  length of the enclosed rail car that will carry it. The 41-year-old spruce will  be erected on the west front lawn of the Capitol.  </P></p>

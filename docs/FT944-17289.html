			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Books: Identity crisis in the US DIVIDED WE FALL: GAMBLING WITH HISTORY IN THE NINETIES by Haynes Johnson WW Norton Pounds 19.95, 431 pages The best way to find out what people are thinking is to go out and ask them. Haynes Johnson, a journalist on the Washington Post, has applied this simple maxim - too often forgotten by those who work in the metropolis - to build up his portrait of an America bewildered by decline and wracked by pre-millennial tensions. His wide-angle lens captures a middle class defending past gains behind security gates while city services and schools collapse, medical costs soar, crime, guns and drugs proliferate and jobs are lost to overseas competition and post-Cold War defence cuts. The citizens of the US are suffering an identity crisis, Johnson finds, in a society where race and gender are overwhelming the sense of American-ness. 'At present the forces that divide America are greater than those that unite us.' Yet, he concludes, he is not writing the obituary of the American Dream, only describing an interlude in its reclamation. Their testimony suggests that Americans are no longer seeking scapegoats for their ills. They are finally waking up to the fact that they have been spoilt by post-war prosperity and must now take a cut in living standards. They are waking up to the consequences of their tax-strike and credit binge while the budget deficit exploded; to their strike against a federal government they had been taught to despise as wasteful and malign; and to their regicidal treatment of their own presidents. Johnson details the early pratfalls of Bill Clinton's administration but seems to find this president very much in tune with middle America, with ordinary folk who have been chastened by the gung-ho market worship of Ronald Reagan and his business backers and who now yearn for old community values. They talk less about their rights, more about their duties. A judge in Oakland, California, says of the homeless: 'We used to recognise that we have a moral responsibility to these people. Now the idea seems to be, if I can make it, they can make it.' A woman welfare officer in Maine who resigned in protest at cuts says: 'I've always seen myself as a public servant, and now I don't have that any more, so I'm not sure what I am. That brings tears to my eyes.' Americans, the rest of us, may derive morbid pleasure from wallowing in their own problems and no doubt Johnson, in this sequel to his book on the 1980, Sleepwalking Through History, found it all too easy to gather the testimony he wanted. Yet his interviewees' comments are too striking, their message too persistent to be dismissed as mere grumbling. There is a danger of repetitiveness as well as bias in this form of instantaneous history. But the author's knowledge of the political and economic story, his command of supporting facts and the doggedness of his quest add up to a convincing and by no means uniformly depressing snapshot of the American mood. If these citizens are typical, Americans have learned to express what it is they need, not merely what they want. Perhaps they will now persuade Congress to banish the lobbyists and let a reforming president get on with the job of providing it.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Springtime in Paris sees no sign of renewal - Equities are languishing There are times when equity markets seem to move without rhyme or reason and, at first glance, that certainly seems to have been the case for the Paris stock market this spring. The economic data emanating from the French government's army of highly trained statisticians has been getting better and better over the past few weeks. Even the more cynical of economic commentators have been forced to admit that France now shows every sign of hauling itself out of recession and have adjusted their forecasts accordingly. Yet the CAC 40 index has fallen steadily since its historic peak of 2,360.98 on February 2, to dip down below the 2,000 mark last Wednesday. The index rallied on Thursday, closing above 2,000, and yesterday finished at 2,041, little changed on the week. 'It's clear that the French economic outlook has improved considerably over the past few months,' says Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French economist at Salomon Brothers. 'Unemployment is still high, but demand has improved faster than we expected and inflationary fears have receded. So why is the stock market doing so badly?' The quick answer is that investors' attitudes over the past few months have been influenced less by the prospects of the French economy and of the CAC-40 stocks themselves, than by continued concern about the outlook for US interest rates and for German money supply. Some analysts also suspect that the market has fallen prey to a widespread re-rating of equities, reflecting the weakness of the bond market and instability of global sentiment since the February increase in US interest rates. 'There has been a general re-rating, equities have fallen to much more realistic levels and French stocks are now fairly cheap,' says David Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel in Paris. 'But the bond market is so weak that bond yields are still very attractive compared with equities.' In the meantime the fundamentals of the market have been improving. The economy is still in a fairly fragile state. Unemployment rose to yet another record level in April of 3.33m, or 12.3 per cent of the workforce, and consumer spending is still erratic. This spring has seen an encouraging increase in sales of manufactured goods, notably cars which have benefited from special government incentives, although expenditure on other items has remained sluggish. However, the corporate sector has shown a sharp rebound. The latest surveys conducted by Insee, the state statistics institute, and the Bank of France have shown significant increases in business confidence which have already filtered through to increased production in manufacturing, particularly for intermediate and capital goods. This increase seems set to continue during the course of 1994 and to accelerate in 1995. French companies cut back sharply on investment last year and also ran down their stocks to very low levels. This means that any increase in demand should have an immediate effect on production. 'The convalescence of the French economy has turned out to be more rapid than expected,' says Ms Patricia Lormeau, an economist at Paribas in Paris. 'Attention is now focusing on the degree of vigour which can be expected of growth in 1995.' Other observers agree. Insee last month raised its growth forecast for the first half of 1994 to 0.9 per cent from 0.7 per cent. Salomon's Mr Mercier has revised his forecast to 1.5 per cent in 1994 and 2.5 per cent in 1995. 'Until recently there was a lot of scepticism about the French recovery,' he says. 'But now we've seen enough positive economic data to be convinced.' The recent round of statements from company chairmen has been more upbeat, too. Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman of the Paribas banking group, last week confirmed that it was on course for an increase in profits this year. A few days later FNAC, one of France's largest retailers, announced that it had begun its recovery with a return to interim profits growth. Even Euro Disney, the stricken leisure group which has seen its shares plummet during months of negotiations over a FFr13bn rescue package with its banks, gave investors a welcome piece of good news on Wednesday with the announcement that Prince Al-Waleed, a member of the Saudi royal family, plans to buy up to 24.5 per cent of its equity following a pending FFr6bn rights issue. There was no such luck for Schneider, the electrical engineering group, which started the week with the news that Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, its chairman, was being held in custody in Belgium pending investigations into fraud allegations. For other companies the critical question is when France's improved economic performance will be reflected in equities. James Capel anticipates a healthy increase of 48 per cent for the CAC-40 companies' earnings in 1994 - ending four successive years of decline - followed by 38 per cent growth in 1995. 'In theory this is a great time for investment in French equities,' says Mr Harrington. 'The market should have bottomed out. But who knows when the rally will start?'</p>

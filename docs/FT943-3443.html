			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Arts: Return of 'Turandot' - Opera At Covent Garden the seasons come and go. Turandot is back yet again after ten years' good service and almost as many opening nights have passed since the Royal Opera House launched its development plan, which by now must rank as another of the company's longest running shows. With the arrival of the National Lottery in the autumn, that drama looks set to reach its final climax; Pounds 20.5m has already been spent on architects' plans and other preparatory work, which would be enough to provide spectacular new opera productions for years, so if the big push in this crucial season comes to nothing there will be red faces all round. Fortunately, none was necessary for artistic reasons on the opening night. The Royal Opera's production of Turandot is one of its fail-safe successes. It has been around since 1984, when Andrei Serban (the original producer) unveiled what has turned out to be his most striking achievement for the company's tour to the Los Angeles Olympics, but little of its vivid theatrical colour has faded over the years. It is a still a splendid evening's entertainment - and more. It is perhaps worth recalling what Turandot used to be like before: garish, fairy-tale Chinoiserie, dressed up in the mode of the day, at its worst like a cross between Aladdin and the Tiller Girls in Peking. (Try the photo of the 1947 tableau in the programme.) This production changed all that, emphasising the cruelty and the oppression as a downtrodden people gather in expectation of the latest public execution. There is often the same bloodthirsty spirit among the audience, too. The leading roles of Turandot are killers to sing and no opera offers more ringside excitement. On Monday night Sharon Sweet was both making her Royal Opera debut and singing the title-role for the first time, a double challenge which she surmounted with ease. Her voice is big, bright and free where it matters, namely at the top, where Puccini stretched his soprano's vocal capacity to new heights. As Turandots go, she is formidable rather than fearsome, not a Chinese tiger on the prowl like some others in this production, but the role should suit her well. When she and Giuseppe Giacomini's Calaf join in duet, ringing unison top notes peal into the auditorium. Giacomini is a known quantity here, but that does not make the strength and musicianship of his singing ('Nessun dorma' generously phrased over the bar lines) any less welcome. Giorgio Giuseppini was a gravel-voiced Timur; Simon Keenlyside's handsomely-sung Ping led the tumbling trio of ministers. Ideally, one would like more flesh on the tone of Elisabeth Norberg-Schultz's Liu if the character is to acquire human depth, but her brightly-focused, light soprano was pleasing as far as it went. In the postlude after her first aria every note was drawn out, symptomatic of conducting from Daniele Gatti that likes to make a meal of the music. He does, however, have the panache to drive home Puccini's biggest climaxes. All told, this was a decent Turandot all-round, but beware: cast changes during the run are many and varied. Performances until November 5.</p>

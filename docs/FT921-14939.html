			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / BR chief moves to clarify position on privatisation SIR BOB REID, chairman of British Rail, last night moved to counter speculation that the British Railways Board is opposed to privatisation and wants to see the railway system sold as a single unit. Speaking at the Chartered Institute of Transport in London, Sir Bob said those two 'propositions' could not both be right, and in fact were both wrong. 'I have never expressed a desire to see the railway sold off as a whole,' Sir Bob said. 'Our wish is to see preserved both the safety and integrity of operation and access to a national network for the customer.' The board could see no objection in priciple to the involvement of the private sector in the rail business. Much of what was once part of BR - ferries, hotels, manufacturing - had already been privatised. Sir Bob said he wanted to see more joint operations with the private sector. Open access  -for other companies to use the rail network - was an aim of government policy and the privatisation debate had to bear in mind the implications of that. Sir Bob said the board had a responsibility to advise the government on what was practical and workable for the railways. The options for privatisations should be tested against five criteria, he said. Privatisation should: Build on the board's success in pursuing value for money. Lead to improved services for customers and ensure a national network remained open to them. Allow a railway to compete vigorously within the domestic and international transport markets for passengers and freight. Meet the needs of operational integrity and protect safety of operations. Provide for the necessary investment in the railway to continue without a damaging hiatus. Sir Bob said the industry was at a crucial point in the investment cycle and the privatisation proposals had to address that. He warned that care would have to be taken in finding the right formula and the right pace of change.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a ceremony opening the Kiev commodity exchange  attended by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, journalists  asked the president numerous questions. Following is the  Ukrainian president's reply to a question of major concern for  the entire Ukrainian society -- What are the relations between  the president and the Ukrainian Supreme Council in the wake of  the tripartite agreement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament signed  in Moscow?    [Begin Kravchuk recording] We have satisfied parliament's  reservations. This is a very important fact that could no  longer be undone. The executive branch was proceeding down the  path of implementation and not of obstruction of the  parliament's decisions. Yes, we made some compromises and  concessions. But how else could you handle this? All of us --  Russia, the United States, and Ukraine -- compromised. That's  how it is in politics.    Generally speaking, I did expect to meet with the  opposition.  You see, they were making reports from papers, and then they  called me and the entire executive branch so many names that I  could hardly be seen from under them. They said Traitor! [word  indistinct] Sold out national interests! However, none of them  read the document. I know there always are people like this.  But you have to be very careful if you want to be a serious  politician, and be a part of big politics.    I want them to know that first, politicians draw conclusions  only after they have read a document; second, they always reckon  with the overall situation, possibilities, and [word indistinct]  of Ukraine.    Let me tell you the following -- those who propose or call  for not bringing nuclear weapons out of the country for Ukraine  to become a nuclear country [words indistinct] They want to make  Ukraine a hostage and sentence its people to death. Everyone  must realize that. And no requests or slogans can change  anything, because Ukrainian television has recently shown  ministers, [word indistinct], scientists, and other people.  They revealed facts proving that Ukraine had made the only  possible correct step. [words indistinct] we have to do, we  will do without losing our power and [words indistinct] But this  [words indistinct] overcome [words indistinct] This might be  [word indistinct] wish. (?These are the first steps) Those who  so strongly voice their demand that Ukraine remain a nuclear  state and keep its nuclear weapons -- whether they want to or  not -- turn Ukraine into a hostage, with its people sentenced to  death.

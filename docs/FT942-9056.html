			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / IMF ready to back Turkey A standby loan agreement between Turkey and the International Monetary Fund seems imminent after the head of the Fund's negotiating mission to Turkey yesterday publicly endorsed the Ankara government's austerity programme. Mr Thomas Reichmann, concluding a two-week mission to Turkey, said he was recommending the programme to the IMF board. Agreement on a letter of intent could be in place in early July, paving the way for immediate disbursement of up to Dollars 250m to support the balance of payments. The one-year standby, which depends on Turkey's quota with the Fund, is likely to be up to Dollars 500m. Turkey's austerity programme envisages slashing the budget deficit by half to TL93,000bn (Pounds 1.87bn) in 1994, through wage restraint, official commodity price rises, new taxes, and faster privatisation. Turkey will repay around Dollars 9.1bn in 1994 on its medium and long term debt, in principal and interest. It is looking for Dollars 3.7bn in new drawings in 1994, according to the State Planning Organisation. A Fund accord is vital to restore international confidence in the Turkish economy, allowing a return to commercial debt markets, and is a precondition for World Bank structural adjustment loans, now under negotiation.</p>

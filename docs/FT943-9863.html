			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Argument rages over holes in the ground: The wider implications of Nottinghamshire's quarrying debate Nottinghamshire is searching for the impossible - an agreement between industry, politicians, residents and environmentalists on quarrying sand and gravel. At county level the outcome of the search will settle the location of big holes in the ground, the conditions under which they may be dug and how the land will be reclaimed. All of this will be written in the county council's minerals local plan. At national level the search has a wider implication. It reflects the environmental price which has to be paid for economic development. The competing parties are polishing their arguments for a public inquiry in October. The arguments will swirl around the proposals of the county council, embodied in a draft minerals plan. The council is the planning authority for minerals, granting or refusing permission for quarries. It is trying to settle what will be worked during the next 10 years, and where. It is a testing role because Nottinghamshire has extensive mineral resources, and the greater the desire to exploit them, the more acute the tensions. The main deposits of sand and gravel - which are vital raw materials for the construction industry - are in the Trent and Idle valleys. Nearly all recent extraction, running at 2.5m to 3m tonnes a year from 10 big and several small quarries, has been confined to these valleys. Quarrying companies are drawn to the county's deposits because they offer high yields and hard material, meeting most specifications for concrete. As the draft plan noted: 'This factor can give Nottinghamshire's deposits a premium above those found elsewhere.' The county council draws its authority to settle which deposits will be worked from the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. But the council is caught between its own voters, who would tend to wish all quarries were elsewhere, and instructions from Whitehall that control the tonnage of aggregates to be mined. The Department of the Environment has a national co-ordinating group of officials and industry executives which looks at aggregates supply and demand, and forecasts future needs. This group gets its information from regional committees, which in turn tell the counties what they expect each should produce. For Nottinghamshire County Council the key group is the East Midlands Regional Aggregates Working Party. Based on the calculations of this government-industry working party, which itself has been influenced by national forecasts of rising demand, Nottinghamshire council has been planning for annual production of 3.2m to 3.4m tonnes. Too little, argues the industry. Too much, say local groups such as parish councils with quarries in their midst, and national environmental groups such as the Council for the Protection of Rural England. Nottinghamshire can meet the rising demand at least until the end of the century. But the county council hopes to be let off the hook. By the end of the century, it said, 'it is hoped that government guidance will have successfully promoted the fundamental changes in supply and demand need, if an environmental crisis is to be avoided'. The government has eased the political pressure. It decided, in a planning guidance note to mineral planning authorities, that it would not be necessary to make provision for 10 years of aggregates extraction. Seven years would be enough. This had two effects. First, it meant that Nottinghamshire could largely meet expected production levels for seven years from existing quarries, although some would open up adjacent workings. It avoided any need to make provision for the opening of a new quarry at Stapleford Woods. Wimpey Minerals, in the face of spirited opposition from the Stapleford Wood Action Group, local MPs and the district council, has for more than a year been looking at the environmental implications of a quarry on Forestry Commission land near Newark, on the Lincolnshire border. That struggle has faded away. Mr Des Whicher, secretary of the action group, said: 'Wimpey thinks we'll go away more quickly than they'll go away. And they're probably right in that. Local people think the campaign is won.' Second, the government decision has served to switch local discussion away from new quarries to issues such as reclamation after quarrying. For example, at Hoveringham, south west of Newark, where Tarmac Quarry Products has the biggest quarry in the county, there are fears about the use of holes for waste tips. There are worries at Collingham, on the Trent north of Newark, about the spread of water areas as former quarries become lakes. Such local argument is part of a wider national debate about the use of mineral resources and the abuse of nature that sometimes implies. For industry there is a demand which has to be met - economic development needs construction materials. Mr Val Shields, publicity manager at Tarmac Quarry Products, said: 'The needs don't go away and the customers - society at large - who want things built would have to be satisfied elsewhere, wherever 'elsewhere' is.' That is too simple for environmental groups. Mr Tony Juniper, senior campaigner of Friends of the Earth, said: 'We must look at ways of stimulating long-term growth apart from digging holes in the ground.'</p>

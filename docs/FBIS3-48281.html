The basic principles  concerning the chapter entitled The State are:    1. Myanmar is a sovereign independent state;    2. The state shall be called the Union of Myanmar;    3. The sovereign power of the state which stems from the  citizens shall reside in the entire state;    4. The territory of the state is the territory on the day  the constitution is adopted.    These basic principles will be included in the chapter The  State. Moreover, if there are any other suitable fundamental  principles to be added, the delegates are encouraged to present  their suggestions.    Mr. Chairman, the basic principles concerning the chapter  State Structure are:    1. The state shall be established as a union system;    2. The existing seven divisions shall be prescribed as  seven regions [preceding word in English] and the existing seven  states will remain as states [preceding word in English]. The  said seven regions and seven states are equal in status;    3. The seven regions and seven states shall retain their  current names;    4. If a region or a state wishes to change its name, a  law shall be promulgated on a name change after the wishes of  the citizens of the region or state concerned are obtained;    5. Self-administered areas [three preceding words in  English] are to be prescribed for national races other than  those who already have state status as either a region or state,  if they have the appropriate population and have existed as a  united group in a continuous territory;    6. Self-administered divisions [three preceding words in  English] or self-administered zones [three preceding words in  English] shall be prescribed as appropriate based on the  population and the extent of the territory, and the state shall  form a commission to prescribe such divisions and zones;    7. The territory of the state in the regions, states, and  self- administered areas shall never secede from the state.    These fundamental principles constitute the main essence  concerning the state constitution. In discussing the chapter  State Structure, if any other suitable detailed principles lying  within the fundamental principles are to be added, the delegates  should present their suggestions.    Mr. Chairman: In the principles concerning state structure  it has been prescribed that the existing seven divisions will be  prescribed as seven regions and the existing seven states will  remain as states. The said seven regions and seven states are  equal in status. The seven regions and seven states will retain  their current names. In accordance with the basic principles, a  fundamental principle should be adopted in naming the regions  and the states as follows;    1. The state is divided into seven regions [preceding word  in English] and seven states [preceding word in English]:  Kachin State, Kayah State, Karen State, Chin State, Sagaing  Region, Tenasserim Region, Pegu Region, Magwe Region, Mandalay  Region, Mon State, Arakan State, Rangoon Region, Shan State, and  Irrawaddy Region.    2. The various regions and states are equal in status.    Mr. Chairman: Regarding the principles concerning state  structure that I presented earlier, the following fundamental  principles for self-administered areas have been prescribed;    Self-administered areas [three preceding words in English]  are to be prescribed for national races other than those who  already have state status as either a region or state, if they  have the appropriate population and have existed as a united  group in a continuous territory;    Self-administered divisions [three preceding words rendered  in English] or self-administered zones [three preceding words  rendered in English] will be prescribed as appropriate based on  the population and the extent of the territory and the state  shall form a commission to prescribe such divisions and zones.    Mr. Chairman: In accordance with the prescribed fundamental  principles on self-administered divisions and self-administered  zones, conditions exist for the formation of such divisions and  zones. In the regions and states, there are national races  other than those who already have state status as either a  region or state. Some national races have the appropriate  population and have existed as a united group in a continuous  territory. The national convention has already adopted a  fundamental principle prescribing self-administered divisions or  self-administered zones as appropriate for those national races  based on the population and the extent of the territory.    Mr. Chairman: The national convention delegates should  present suggestions on how to determine the self-administered  divisions and self-administered zones. Since the  self-administered divisions will have the legislative,  administrative, and judicial powers in accordance with the  constitution, they should include districts and townships.  Although the status of a self-administered division is not as  high as a region or state, it is higher than the districts from  the regions or states. A self-administered zone should be  prescribed for the national races that have resided in unity in  that zone. A fundamental principle that the state should form a  commission has been adopted to determine a self-administered  division or a self-administered zone, if conditions exist, and  the formation of a commission concerns procedural matters. The  intention for brother national races to quickly receive due  privileges is unanimous in the minds of convention delegates.  Instead of the state forming a commission to determine which  deserving national races should be granted either  self-administered divisions or self-administered zones and to  determine the places and zones, it will delight the concerned  national races and will further strengthen national unity if the  delegates prescribe them after discussions and deliberations.  The delegates should present their proposals on whether it is  feasible to prescribe outright the self- administered divisions  or self-administered zones for national races other than those  who already have either a region or state that meet all the  requirements of the fundamental principles.    Mr. Chairman: There will be a need to prescribe the basic  principle for the chapter on state structure for the structure  of the Union of Myanmar including the self-administered  divisions or self-administered areas. In accordance with the  1974 constitution, villages are combined into village tracts;  wards are classed together as towns; village tracts, wards, and  towns are put together as townships; townships are combined into  divisions or states; and divisions and states are organized as  the state. Since the State Law and Order Restoration Council  [SLORC] took the responsibilities of the country, there are ward  and village level, township level, district level, and state or  division level state organizations for easy and speedy  communications and effective administration. A fundamental  principle should be prescribed regarding state structure where  villages are combined into village tracts; wards are classed  together as a town or township; village tracts, wards or towns  are put together as a township; townships are combined into a  district; districts are organized into a region or a state; in a  self-administered zone, self-administered townships are combined  as a self-administered zone; in a self-administered division,  self-administered townships are combined as a district and these  districts are organized as a self-administered division; if  there is a self-administered division or self-administered zone  in a region or state, the self-administered division or  self-administered zone and the districts are organized as a  region or a state; and the regions and states are organized as  the state. The basic principle on territory of the state in the  regions, states, and self- administered areas will never secede  from the state has already been adopted and these must be  presented in the chapter concerning state structure.    Mr. Chairman: The fundamental principles to be prescribed  in the chapter on state structure are:    1. How will it be done when the need arises to change the  national territorial boundary?    2. How will it be done when the need arises to change a  region or state boundary?    3. How will it be done when the need arises to change or  form boundaries, or change the name of a village, village tract,  ward, town, and township in a region, state, self-administered  division, or self-administered zone?    These must also be put into consideration and discussed.  Delegates should present suggestions in view of the country's  benefit, on how to solve above mentioned boundary matters if the  need arises. The National Convention Convening Work Committee  [NCCWC] based on the overall study would like to present some  suggestions.    Mr. Chairman: If the need arises to solve boundary matters  in view of the country's benefit, suggestions will also include  some legislative matters. So, some principles concerning  legislative affairs will also be included in the suggestions.  In prescribing fundamental principles for legislature, there  will be a bicameral Union Parliament with one elected chamber  based on population representation and another chamber with  equal representation from the regions and the states. There  will also be persons to head those parliaments.    Mr. Chairman: When the need arises to change the national  territorial boundary, the president should first inform the head  of the Union Parliament to get the approval of the Union  Parliament. The Union Parliament should then take the vote of  the members of parliament as follows to change the national  territorial boundary:    1. More than half the vote of representatives of the  parliament made up of equal number of representatives from  regions and states;    2. More than half the vote of representatives of the  [Union] parliament elected on the basis of population;    3. More than half the vote of representatives of the two  parliaments in the concerned region or state.    The convention is to discuss and suggest on whether a basic  principle should be prescribed to enable the president to alter  the national territorial boundary after receiving the stipulated  support vote. If either one of the parliaments or  representatives of the two parliaments in the concerned region  or state decide to disagree to change the national territorial  boundary according to the methods mentioned above, the president  can change the national territorial boundary if the matter  received more than three fourth of the vote in the Union  Parliament. The convention is to discuss whether such a basic  principle should be prescribed.    Mr. Chairman: I will explain measures to be taken when it  becomes necessary to alter the territorial boundary of a region  or a state. When the need arises to change the territorial  boundary of a region or a state, the consent of the voters  residing in the region or state should first be obtained. The  changing of territorial boundary is not to be carried out if it  does not receive more than half of the vote of the eligible  voters in the concerned region. If more than half of the voters  vote to change the territorial boundary, the vote of the  representatives of the region or state concerned is to be  obtained. If more than three-fourths of the vote of the  representatives of the region or state concerned vote to change  the territorial boundary of a region or a state, the president,  with the consent of the Union Parliament, can change the  territorial boundary of a region or state. The convention is to  discuss whether such a basic principle should be prescribed. If  either the regional or state parliament decide to disagree to  change the boundary, the decision of the Union Parliament should  be obtained. If more than three-fourths of the total  representatives of the Union Parliament vote to change the  boundary of a region or a state, the president can change the  territorial boundary of a region or state. The convention is to  discuss whether such a basic principle should be prescribed.    Mr. Chairman: There is an indication for reasons to appear  to change or form boundaries, or change the name of a village,  village tract, ward, town, township, and district in a region,  state, self-administered division, or self-administered zone.  The convention should present suggestions on how to act when  the need arises for such a change. This matter to change or  form boundaries, or a name change, is solely a regional concern.  If a need occurs, the administrative authority of the region or  state concern should recommend to the president and the  president should take action as needed. The convention is to  discuss whether such a basic principle should be prescribed.    Mr. Chairman: A basic principle has been adopted if the need  arises to change the name of a region or state by passing  legislation with the consent of the citizens residing in the  region or state. This basic principle should be included and  prescribed in the chapter concerning state structure. The  convention is to discuss whether a basic principle should be  prescribed if the need arises to change legislation of  self-administered divisions or self- administered zones by using  similar methods as outlined above.    Mr. Chairman: During the panel discussions by national  convention delegate groups, a delegate group suggested a basic  principle that the state capital be put under a separate  administrative zone and not under the administration of a region  or a state. This suggestion should be seriously considered in  the discussions concerning the chapter on state structure.  Since the basic principle has been adopted regarding the seven  regions and seven states in the state structure, if the state  capital is to be considered as a separate administrative union  zone, then there is a need for it to be included in the basic  principles. Although matters relating to the state capital are  to be discussed in the state flag, state seal, national anthem,  and state capital chapter, there is a need to discuss it in the  chapter on state structure. According to international practice,  the seat of the central government is considered as the state  capital and in some countries, those capitals are directly  governed by either the president or the central government. In  Myanmar [Burma], if Yangon [Rangoon], where the central  government resides, is considered as the state capital, the  delegates should discuss and decide whether to adopt a basic  principle to have the administration of the state capital,  Yangon, directly under the president as a union zone rather than  having it under the administration of the Yangon Region. If the  administration of the state capital, Yangon, is put directly  under the administration of the president, then there will be  basic principles to be discussed in the concerned chapters on  legislative, administrative, and judicial powers regarding the  capital, Yangon. Moreover, special places like the Cocos Islands  Township should be considered as union zones and should be put  under the direct control of the president. The convention is to  discuss whether such a basic principle should be prescribed. In  future, zones with special conditions concerning state defense  and security, administration, and economics, should by  legislation be put under the direct supervision of the president  and should be considered as union zones. The convention is also  to discuss whether such a principle should be adopted.    Mr. Chairman: I have presented detailed explanations of  basic principles on the chapters on the state and the state  structure. Continuing, I would like to present the basic  principles on the chapter on the Head of State as prescribed by  the National Convention Plenary Session. They are:    1. The president is the head of state;    2. The president will be elected through the Electoral  College.    Based on the prescribed principle that the president is the  head of state, detailed discussions on the status, qualities,  duties, responsibilities, election by electoral college, term of  presidency, and (?accusations and blame), should be made whether  such principles should be prescribed. Based on the prescribed  principle that the president will be elected through the  Electoral College, detailed discussions should be made on the  formation of the electoral college, who should be included, and  how the president should be elected, whether such principles  should be prescribed. I will continue to present some points  for discussions concerning the president.    Mr. Chairman: The president, who is the head of state, is a  figurehead in some countries while he is just an administrative  head in others. In accordance with the basic principles  concerning the head of state, the state president of our country  will have full administrative powers. The state president, who  is like a shining star for the country, should also be a  national leader whom the people rely upon. There is a need to  fully and precisely specify the qualifications of the president  to elect the person who is going to take a very important  position in the country. That is why, apart from prescribing  the basic principle that the president is the head of state, the  convention is also to discuss whether principles should be  adopted on the president representing the state, the president  as the national leader of all national races, and the president  assuming the paramount position of all national races in the  entire Union of Myanmar. Next, I would like to present some  suggestions regarding the qualifications of the president.  Since the state president is a national leader, the president  should be the person who can diligently work for the  nondisintegration of the union, nondisintegration of national  solidarity, perpetuation of national sovereignty, and the  wellbeing and development of the country. The president should  also be well versed in state matters like politics,  administration, economics, and military and be able to make  experienced, effective, and concise decisions. Therefore, the  basic qualifications of the president should be prescribed as  another basic principle. Moreover, the president, who will be  leading the country, should be especially loyal to the state and  the people. Thus, another basic principle should be adopted  citing the president to be loyal to the country and the people.    Mr. Chairman: Studies show that constitutions of most  countries clearly state that the person who is to be president  should be born of two parents who are citizens of that country.  The Constitution of the United States of America requires that  the U.S. president be born to two parents who are U.S. citizens,  must attain a minimum age of 35 years, and reside in the United  States for at least 14 years.    The Constitution of the Philippines states that those  running election as president of the Philippines should be a  Philippine citizen born of two parents who are Philippine  citizens. The Constitution of Indonesia that those running for  election as president of Indonesia should be an Indonesian  citizen born of two parents who are Indonesian citizens.    Mr. Chairman: The constitutions of some countries clearly  state that the place of birth of the person running for  president should be within the concerned country. In our  country, too, the basic principle on the citizenship of the  president should be adopted such that the person running for  president and their parents should be citizens born within the  legal boundaries of the country. Regarding age limits of  presidents, the Constitution of Bangladesh stipulates that the  minimum age of the president should be 35 years old, according  to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China the  president should be more than 45 years old, according to the  Constitution of Egypt the age of the president should not be  less than 40 years old, the Constitution of India stipulates  that the president must be older than 35 years, and the  Constitution of Pakistan requires the president to be at least  45 years old.    The president should have rich experience in the political,  adminsitrative, economic, and military affairs of the country.  The person elected as president should be at least 45 years  old. Therefore, the delegates are to discuss whether to lay down  a basic principle prescribing that the president should be at  least 45 years old. Furthermore, in addition to meeting the  requirements for running in the parliamentary elections, the  president should meet separate qualifications set for the  president. Similar provisions can bee seen in the state  constitutions of Bangladesh, the PRC, India, Pakistan, the  Philippines, and Sri Lanka.    Article 49-B of the 1947 State Constitution of the Union of  Myanmar stipulates that no person is be eligible for election to  the office of president unless he or she is qualified for  election to the Parliament. Therefore, discussions should be  held to prescribe separate qualifications in addition to  qualifications for contesting in parliamentary elections.    The constitutions of some countries contain provisions on  continuous length of residence in the country. As the president  is the national leader and the head of state, it is necessary  for the president to be well-informed on political,  administrative, economic, social, and indigenous national  affairs to provide effective leadership to the nation.  Therefore, a basic rule should be made to stipulate that the  president should have continuous residence for at least 20 years  prior to the time of election as president.    Mr. Chairman: Myanmar was under the servitude of the British  imperialists for over 100 years because of traitors, and the  people suffered a bitter experience. Furthermore, there were  instances after independence when the nation's independence and  sovereignty were almost lost because of these traitors and the  Defense Services had to defend the nation in time. Therefore,  the president, who is to serve as the national leader and the  head of state, should have allegiance to the nation and  citizens. To ensure that the people have full trust in the  president without any suspicion, it is especially necessary for  members of the president's family to have allegiance to the  nation and citizens. Therefore, the president himself, one of  the president's parents, the spouse of the president, any one of  the president's legal children, and the spouse of any one of the  president's children must not owe allegiance to a foreign power,  not be the subject of a foreign power nor be a foreign citizen.  Especially, they must not be entitled to the rights and  privileges of a subject of a foreign power or foreign citizen.    Mr. Chairman: Section 1-A of Article 74 of the 1947 State  Constitution contains the provision to prevent foreign  interference in our internal affairs. It states that any person  who is under any acknowledgment of allegiance or adherence to a  foreign power, or is a subject or citizen or entitled to the  rights and privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign  power shall be disqualified for being chosen as and for being a  member of either chamber of Parliament. Similar provision is  included in Article 10-E of the 1989 Parliamentary Election Law.    Therefore, a basic principle should be laid down on  qualifications for the president as I have presented above.  Other qualifications can be also added.    Mr. Chairman: All tasks, other than legislative and  judicial affairs, concern administration. The president is to  carry the heavy burden as the national leader, head of state,  and chief executive. A basic principle has been laid down to  elect the president through an electoral college. Therefore,  discussions should be held on organization of the electoral  college and procedure for electing the president.    It is found that when an electoral college is formed the  country's history, political affairs, and other conditions are  taken into consideration. Among the countries that practised  the election of a president through an electoral college are the  United States, Indonesia, India, and Pakistan. These countries  elect their presidents through the electoral college, which was  formed under the constitution according to the concrete  conditions in their countries.    Mr. Chairman: We are to elect a president according to our  country's course of history and political and other conditions  and the six objectives of the National Convention. The  electoral college does not have to be elected separately, but it  can be prescribed that all members of the Union Parliament are  members of the electoral college, which should be divided into  three groups. The first group will be formed with  representatives of the parliament made up of equal number of  representatives from regions and states. The second group will  be formed with representatives of the parliament elected on the  basis of population. The third group will be formed with  representatives from the Defense Services from the two  parliaments mentioned above and who are nominated by the  commander in chief of the Defense Services.    As our president will be a national leader as well as the  chief executive, the responsibility of the president is huge.  Many countries elect deputy chief executives to assist the  chief executive in his work. Likewise, we should appoint vice  presidents to assist the president in our country. Therefore,  the three groups in charge of electing the president should  first select vice presidents from among the members of  parliament or those who are not members of parliament.    The vice president is a potential president. Therefore, a  body composed of the heads and deputy heads of the Union  Parliament and the two parliaments will clear candidates to see  if they meet the qualifications set for president. Members of  the electoral college or members of the Union Parliament are to  cast a vote to elect the president out of the three vice  presidents. The person who receives the most votes becomes the  president. Suggestions should be made on whether this method  should be adopted.    If this system is practiced, we will have a president and  two  vice presidents in our country, and they will be able to  effectively carry out their duties. It will be also necessary  to lay down a basic principle to enact a law necessary for  election of the president.    After the president and vice presidents are elected, matters  concerning these persons, such as tenure of office, oath of  allegiance, salary and privileges, responsibilities, liaison  with the Union Parliament, and impeachment of president and vice  presidents should be considered.    Mr. Chairman: Our country plans to practice the  administrative system with president as chief executive. Hence,  it will be necessary to stipulate the suitable term of office  for the president and vice presidents to enable them to  discharge their duties effectively. Limitations on terms of  office should be also considered.    I would like to present constitutional provisions in some  countries that stipulate limitations on term of office for the  president. Under the PRC Constitution, the term of office for  the president is five years and only two consecutive terms of  office are allowed. The term of office for president in Egypt  is six years, and there is no limit for right to reelection.  The term of office for president in Indonesia is five years,  and there is no limite for right to reelection. The term of  office for president in India is five years, and there is no  stipulation on reelection. The term of office for president in  Pakistan is five years, and there is no more than two  consecutive terms of office. The term of office for president  in the Philippines is six years, and reelection is not allowed.  The term of office for president in Sri Lanka is six years, and  the term of office is limited to two consecutive terms. The  term of office for president in the U.S. is four years, and  reelection is limited to two terms. We are to consider the  suitable term of office for the presidency in our country.    We are to work very hard for the country's economic,  administrative, and social affairs to catch up with other  countries. Therefore, term of office of president and vice  presidents should be five years to allow time to carry out the  tasks that benefit the nation and the people. Discussions  should be held to consider whether a basic principle should be  laid to allow the president and vice presidents to serve until  the new president is elected and to limit the term of presidency  to two terms.    Furthermore, discussions should be held to consider whether  to lay down a basic principle stipulating that the person  replacing the vacant position of the president or vice president  is to serve until the end of the original term of office.    Mr. Chairman, I have already explained the election of the  president and vice presidents by the electoral college, as well  as the requirements for the offices of president and vice  president. One point should be taken into consideration in  electing a member of parliament as president or vice president:  the convention put forward a principle on the separation of  executive, legislative, and judicial powers. Therefore, if a  member of parliament were to be elected president or vice  president by the electoral college, it would contravene the  principle of separation of the three state powers. Furthermore,  the president and vice presidents are national leaders who  should work for the national interest rather than political  parties. They should not have to be involved in the affairs of  their political party.    Section 1, Article 47 of the 1947 Constitution states that  the president cannot be a member of either chamber of  parliament. Section 2 states that if a member of either chamber  of parliament is elected president, they will be deemed to have  vacated their seat in that chamber. Therefore, neither the  president nor the vice presidents will be members of parliament.  If the president or vice presidents are either members of  parliament or public servants, they will be deemed to have  resigned or retired from that position upon the date of their  election to office. If the president or vice presidents are  members of a political party, they will cease their involvement  in the affairs of that political party upon their election to  office. A basic principle to this effect will have to be  discussed.    Mr. Chairman, the president and vice presidents have to take  the oath of office before assuming their positions. The  president and vice presidents can only perform their duties  after they have been sworn in before the members of the Union  Parliament. Constitutions usually contain provisions on how the  oath of office will be administered to the president and vice  presidents. Therefore, discussions should be held and  suggestions presented regarding the oath of office for the  president and vice presidents.    The president and vice presidents have to shoulder the heavy  burdens of the state. As such, they wield power. There should  be a prohibition against organizations influencing the president  or vice presidents by giving them salaries or positions.  Therefore, discussions should be held on whether there should  be a basic principle forbidding the president and vice  presidents from accepting salaries and positions from outside  organizations.    Mr. Chairman, the president is fully empowered as chief  executive. The vice presidents will have to discharge heavy  duties. As such, they should have the respect of the people.  Discussions should be held on a basic principle requiring the  president and vice presidents to declare their family assets --  such as land, houses, buildings, economic enterprises, savings,  and other valuables -- to the head of the Union Parliament.    The president and vice presidents should be entitled to  salaries, allowances, and privileges as prescribed by law.  Furthermore, they should have appropriate official residences.  Therefore, discussions should be held on whether to lay down a  basic principle outlining the salary, allowances, privileges,  and official residences of president and vice presidents.    The rights and responsibilities of the president and vice  presidents will be included in the constitutional provisions and  other laws. Therefore, a basic principle should be laid down on  the rights and responsibilities prescribed by the constitution  and other laws for the president and vice presidents.    Mr. Chairman, so far I have explained the election of the  president and vice presidents as well as some of the president's  responsibilities.    Although executive, legislative, and judicial powers will be  exercised separately, there should be legal provisions for  checks and balances. It is necessary for the president -- who  is the chief executive -- and the vice presidents to conduct  themselves in a manner befitting their positions. Basic  principles should be laid down for impeachment procedures  against the president and vice presidents if they commit a  breach of conduct.    Under the U.S. Constitution, the president and vice  president  can be impeached for betraying their country, corruption, and  other serious offenses, as well as a breach of conduct. The  Bangladesh Constitution provides for the impeachment of the  president for violating the Constitution or misconduct.  Impeachment requires that a minimum of three quarters of the  signatures of the members of parliament be submitted to the  parliamentary president. The Egyptian Constitution provides for  an impeachment motion against the president for betraying the  country or any other offense. Such a motion requires the  support of a minimum of one third of the members of parliament.  Impeachment cannot proceed if the motion is not approved by two  thirds of the members of parliament.    Discussions should be held on laying down a basic principle  providing for the impeachment of our president and vice  presidents for any of the following offenses: betraying the  country; violating constitutional provisions; or misconduct.    Procedures for impeaching the president and vice presidents  should also be considered. In order to bring impeach  proceedings against the president or vice presidents for one or  all of the offenses I have mentioned, the signatures of at least  one quarter of the members of one of the chambers of the Union  Parliament must be obtained and submitted to the head of the  parliamentary chamber concerned. The impeachment procedure can  continue only if it is supported by at least two-thirds of the  members of the parliamentary chamber concerned. An impeachment  motion submitted by one parliamentary chamber will be  investigated by a team from the other. The president, vice  presidents, or their representatives will have the right to make  a defense.    Once the charges have been investigated, if at least  two-thirds of the members of the parliamentary chamber that  investigated the charges or that caused the investigation decide  that the charges are correct and that the offense makes the  president or vice president unsuitable to carry out their  duties, the parliamentary chamber will make a submission to the  head of the Union Parliament to terminate the accused president  or vice president's term of office. As soon as the submission  is received, the head of the Union Parliament will announce the  accused president or vice president's termination from office.  Basic principles to this effect should be discussed.    The president and vice presidents are national leaders as  well as heads of state. Other than impeachment conducted  according to constitutional provisions, the president and vice  presidents should be protected from being sued during their  terms of office. Only if such protection is given will the  president and vice presidents be able to discharge their duties  courageously. Therefore, other than the president and vice  presidents being impeached according to constitutional  provisions, they should be protected from being sued during  their terms of office, and a basic principle to that effect  should be discussed.    Mr. Chairman, the president and vice presidents should be  allowed to resign before their term of office expires if they so  wish. A basic principle should be laid down to deal with a  situation whereby the presidency becomes vacant because the  president resigns from office, dies, becomes permanently  disabled, or any other reason before the term of office expires.  If the presidency becomes vacant, an acting president should be  chosen to continue the work of the president. The acting  president should be whichever one of the two vice presidents  received the second highest number of votes in the presidential  elections.    If there is a vacancy in the presidency, a new president  will  need to be elected. If a vacancy develops while the Union  Parliament is in session, the acting president should inform the  head of the Union Parliament as soon as possible so that the  vacancy can be filled within seven days. When this information  is received, the head of the Union Parliament should take the  necessary steps for the electoral panel to choose a new vice  president. When the respective electoral panel has chosen a new  vice president, the Union Parliament members should elect a new  president as they see fit from among the three vice presidents.  If a vacancy arises when the Union Parliament is not in  session, the head of the Union Parliament should convene a  special parliamentary session within 21 days of receiving the  information from the acting president and carry out the  above-mentioned process of choosing a new president. Therefore,  appropriate discussions should be held by the delegates to lay  down a basic principle on the election of a new president when a  vacancy arises.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to make some basic suggestions on  electing a new vice president if a vacancy occurs because one of  the vice presidents resigns from office, dies, is removed from  office before their term of office expires, becomes permanently  disabled, or any other reason. If the position of vice  president becomes vacant while the Union Parliament is in  session, the president should inform the head of the Union  Parliament as soon as possible so the electoral panel can fill  the vacant office within seven days. If a vacancy arises when  the Union Parliament is not in session, the head of the Union  Parliament should convene a special parliamentary session within  21 days of receiving the information from the president, so that  the electoral panel can elect a new vice president. Thus, the  delegates should deliberate on whether to prescribe a basic  principle on the election of a new vice president if a vacancy  arises.    Mr. Chairman and National Convention delegates, the  presentations I have made on the chapters concerning the state,  the structure of the state, and the head of state are just some  suggestions for the delegates to consider in trying to prescribe  the basic principles. When presenting suggestions for adoption  as basic principles, the delegates should present them  separately in accordance with their respective chapter headings,  just as I have done. I have presented some abstracts of the  facts the National Convention Convening Work Committee studied  concerning the chapters on the state, the structure of the  state, and the head of state, so that the delegates will have a  wider scope in their discussions on proposing basic principles.  If there are any suitable and appropriate additions to be made,  the National Convention delegates should do so in accordance  with the six National Convention objectives, the  previously-prescribed basic principles, and the National  Convention convening procedures. The National Convention  delegate groups, after studying my suggestions, will begin panel  discussions on 21 January regarding the chapters on the state,  the structure of the state, and the head of state. It is  requested that they present a paper compiling their  chapter-by-chapter suggestions to the work committee in  accordance with the National Convention convening procedures.    I thus conclude my address. [applause]</p>

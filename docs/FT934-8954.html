			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: SAS seeks to reduce costs by up to SKr2.5bn SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) yesterday announced plans to cut costs by between SKr2bn and SKr2.5bn (Dollars 304m) in an acceleration of its drive to improve profitability and strengthen its financial position. The airline, which disclosed a SKr1.13bn pre-tax loss for the first nine months on Wednesday, said it aimed to be back in profit by 1995 at the latest. The cuts, which amount to about 16 per cent of the airline's controllable costs, centre on the closure of 12 unprofitable routes and the disposal of non-core businesses. The group wants to avoid enforced job losses among its 39,000 staff, hoping instead for a reduction in numbers through natural attrition. SAS said the cuts took into account its plans to merge with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines in the so-called Alcazar project, but added they would go ahead even if the proposed tie-up collapsed. 'It's important to Alcazar that we get our costs under control, but it's even more important if we end up standing alone,' SAS said. The group said its fleet had too many aircraft types, and it had an excessive amount of capital employed. It did not disclose which non-core businesses would be sold. Candidates likely to be considered include its hotel, tour, catering and credit-card operations. Among the routes to be closed between December 1993 and September 1994 are Copenhagen-Los Angeles, Bergen-London and Gothenburg-Amsterdam. The 17 aircraft made redundant are likely to be sold. SAS said it was responding to the market situation. 'The airline business remains in a state of crisis worldwide. The global recession, coupled with deregulation, has brought about wide-spread overcapacity and put intense pressure on fares,' it said.</p>

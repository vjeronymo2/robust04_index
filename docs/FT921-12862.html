			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Ready to stamp on the world stage - Donald Gordon, S Africa's leading insurer, talks to Philip Gawith WHEN Mr Donald Gordon visits London next week after a break in South Africa, he will do so firm in the knowledge that 1991 was the year he emerged into the big time in international insurance. It was a watershed year in the fortunes of a man who has left an indelible stamp on the South African insurance industry, and he wants to do the same on the world stage. Two developments did much to enhance the status of Mr Gordon and Liberty Life, the largest proprietary life insurance company in South Africa, which he founded in 1958. First, the tie-up between Transatlantic Holdings - the UK holding company for the Liberty group's offshore interests listed in Luxembourg  - and UAP, France's largest insurer. Under the deal, the two pooled their holdings in Sun Life of the UK into a new vehicle, Rockleigh Corporation. Rockleigh holds over 95 per cent of the issued share capital in Sun Life. UAP paid Pounds 140m for a 16.8 per cent strategic stake in Transatlantic. Second, an international issue of 12m shares by Liberty Life. The issue, which raised Dollars 140m, was the first in London by a South African company since the early 1980s. One of Mr Gordon's top issues is the future of Sun Life, whose de-listing seems imminent. Once Rockleigh's stake reaches 96 per cent it will be able to acquire compulsorily the balance of the shares. Although any strategy will first have to be agreed with UAP, Mr Gordon feels there are a number of advantages to de-listing. He cites not being constrained by financial year-ends, being able to restructure the capital or the company more easily than when minorities are involved and not being curbed by the restrictive rules of the London Stock Exchange. The bottom line is what Rockleigh can do to improve Sun Life's performance. Although Mr Gordon describes Sun Life's most recent results as exceptional, he says 'we can make some contribution that will improve those numbers.' He argues that having large shareholders 'is a great advantage. We (Rockleigh) now have a much greater incentive to make Sun Life really productive. We cannot allow it just to remain a passive investment.' Specific plans for Sun Life await clarification on a de-listing and talks with UAP. But Mr Gordon will want to take to Sun Life some of the techniques which made Liberty successful. Apart from growing quickly to become South Africa's third largest insurer, with assets of over R30bn - behind the much older Cape-based mutuals, Old Mutual and Sanlam - Liberty has chalked up an impressive performance record. Its rise in dividends has only once been less than 20 per cent a year since its listing in 1962, and its average annual combined rate of growth (increase in net asset value and dividend distribution) has been 44 per cent per share over the last decade. How has this been achieved? One feature has been product innovation. Another has been successful staff training. Recruiting and retaining high quality staff is reflected in productivity per agent that is three times the industry average, low lapse ratios and high average premiums. Liberty is well known for its policy of taking high-quality strategic investments. At June 30 1991, Liberty's top 20 equity holdings constituted 84 per cent of total group equities. These include dominant stakes in two premier companies, South African Breweries and the Standard Bank group. Mr Gordon says that UAP has a similar approach to taking strategic stakes and adds: 'Sun Life has recently looked more at this approach.' The convergence of thinking between Mr Gordon and Sun Life goes further. He believes the acrimony between the two following his unsuccessful attempt to gain control of the company in 1987 is past. 'The relationship with Sun Life and its management has not only improved but has become far more collaborative.' He says this may be related to the arrival of some senior Sun Life managers after 1987. Can Mr Gordon replicate his South African achievements in the European environment? He believes so. 'The expertise we're reflecting in the South African market is, in my view, more sophisticated than anything I've seen anywhere in the world.' Local opinion backs him. Ms Janet Mills, analyst at stockbroker Martin &amp; Co, observes: 'If he gets it as right as he's got insurance in South Africa, then Sun Life will go from strength to strength.' The UAP link will be of great assistance to Mr Gordon. Not only do close ties with Europe's second largest insurer confer the stamp of respectability which the City of London has been slow to offer - in spite of his being on the board of Guardian Royal Exchange since 1971 - but they provide an important bridgehead into Europe for Transatlantic. UAP is a potentially powerful source of finance for Mr Gordon's ambitions. The chances of Transatlantic making acquisitions in the insurance field, strengthened by UAP's shareholding, must be considered good. Mr Gordon will not make predictions, but he does note that the 'international insurance industry has never been more depressed' offering opportunities for cash-rich companies such as Liberty and Transatlantic. The share placement, which breached an international capital market drought that had applied against South African companies for most of the 1980s, was important in confirming Liberty and Mr Gordon's stature in the City. Mr Oliver Baring of SG Warburg, the merchant bank which managed the share issue, says the 'whole exercise went extremely well', the shares being placed with a 'very blue chip institutional list'. Mr Gordon notes: 'We may want to use shares for acquisition purposes in the international market and thus wanted to establish the integrity of Liberty's paper.' Although some of the shares flowed back to South Africa, Mr Gordon maintains that 'the calibre of the shareholders remains fundamentally intact and there is some evidence of new UK and continental shareholders acquiring shares.' Further down the line,is achieving a London listing for Transatlantic which would make future capital raising easier and represent the sort of tangible recognition he desires. 'There is an understanding between ourselves and our major shareholders that we would move towards a listing in London at the appropriate time. The fundamental reason would be if this assisted in creating a more liquid market in the shares and whether it would be in the interests of the company and shareholders.' He questions whether the timing is right but believes this is probably the correct path to follow.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan cast adrift by political crisis WITH a cut in German short end rates yesterday the expectation is for a further easing in European interest rates next week, writes Our Markets Staff. Amsterdam was closed for a public holiday. MILAN went on a rollercoaster ride as the spectre of political instability returned to haunt the market. Private domestic investors began the day with a sell-off of blue chips which left the broad market about 5 per cent lower. But around lunchtime institutional investors returned as buyers and prices recovered some of the lost ground. The Comit index ended 12.83 or 2.4 per cent lower at 526.30, down 1 per cent on the week. Trading was extended on the screen-based telematic system to cope with the unusually high turnover. An analyst at Intersim in Milan said: 'After the early sell-off, institutions - both foreign and domestic - could not believe their luck that they were able to buy at the lower levels. 'The situation in the later part of the day changed dramatically from the emotions that were seen earlier as a more rational attitude appeared. If, over the weekend, the political situation can be put in order, I think that we could see the index resuming its upward trend on Monday.' Mr John Stewart of Pastorino in Milan said: 'It was a remarkable turnaround after the early panic. This is a volatile situation but I believe the financial markets had already discounted the likelihood of political problems along the way for Mr Ciampi.' Among the blue chips, Fiat fell L292 or 4.2 per cent to fix at L6,557 but picked up to L6,720 after-hours. BCI which was marked 5.8 per cent down early in the day recovered to end L46 lower at L4,938 with 5 1/2 m shares traded. Generali, down 4.5 per cent at an early L35,800, picked up to fix at L36,500 before L37,000 after hours. Olivetti bucked the weak market on Thursday's news that Digital Equipment was bringing forward its purchase of a 4 per cent stake and was underwriting part of Olivetti's rights issue. Montedison added L28 to fix at L1,178 before L1,188 after hours as the EC approved the sale of its pharmaceutical division to Procordia. PARIS suffered a temporary breakdown in its bourse computer as turnover swelled to a record FFr5.2bn on expiration of futures and options contracts. The CAC-40 index ended 18.48 higher at 1,939.03, a gain of 1.2 per cent on the week. The market is now looking ahead to next Wednesday when Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is due to reveal his budget proposals. Michelin lost 6 per cent as the shares dipped FFr9.10 to FFr143.50 on expectations of heavy losses in 1993. Euro Disney, FFr2.10 ahead at FFr73.50, picked up some of the ground lost earlier in the week on the appointment of a new chief financial officer. Among financials switching was noted out of CCF, down FFr7.80 to FFr236.20, and into SocGen, up FFr17 at FFr619. FRANKFURT closed higher for the first time since April 19 on short covering and light bargain hunting. The DAX index rose 3.25 to 1,627.19, down 1.8 per cent on the week. Bayerische Vereinsbank, which announced a 4.4 per cent rise in first quarter operating profits, gained DM7 to DM444 while Lufthansa rose DM2.3 to DM106.8 on rumours of a tie-up with American Airlines. STOCKHOLM firmed in thin trading due to the half-day holiday session. The Affarsvarlden index gained 7 to 1,030.5 up 0.3 per cent on the week in turnover of SKr572m. SE-Banken closed up SKr2.5 at SKr12. Mr David Longmuir at James Capel said that some investors were switching from other bank stocks which had advanced earlier in the week, but the issue could see profit taking in the near future. HELSINKI continued its rally on lower money market rates and reports of an ore mine discovery in northern Finland. The HEX index rose 14 to 1,187.1, adding 6.1 per cent from the previous week. OSLO was also strong on a spate of earnings announcements. The All share index advanced 5.45 to a high for the year of 477.29, up 5.6 per cent on the week.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 30                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open       10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1140.38     1140.94     1141.55    1142.81 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1202.16     1203.37     1203.73    1204.30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1143.39     1143.18     1143.91    1144.33 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1204.38     1205.25     1208.62    1206.79  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Apr 29    Apr 28    Apr 27    Apr 26    Apr 23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1143.23   1154.98   1149.08   1152.81   1156.50 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1199.62   1212.69   1213.85   1218.66   1223.66  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1144.88; 200 - 1209.59 Low/day: 100 - 1140.34 200 - 1202.11.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

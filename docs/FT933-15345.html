			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley seeks broad debate on rise in social security spending SOCIAL SECURITY spending is set to increase 19 per cent in real terms by 2000 even if unemployment falls by a quarter, according to projections released yesterday by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. The projections are included in a compendium of statistics published by Mr Lilley to stimulate debate on the growth of social security spending, which last year cost Pounds 74bn. The publication of the figures immediately led Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, to accuse ministers of 'softening up' the public for big social security budget reductions. The Labour leader highlighted remarks made in Tokyo on Wednesday by the prime minister, that the UK, with other Group of Seven nations, would have to take unpopular but necessary steps to keep social security budgets in check. As Mr Lilley is fond of pointing out, however, the Labour party has itself recognised the need for a detailed review of the social security budget in setting up its own social justice commission. Mr Lilley said yesterday: 'We need an informed public debate on the reform of social security to ensure that it becomes a better, more focused system which protects the most needy and vulnerable in our society without outstripping the nation's ability to pay.' If there were no fall in unemployment between now and the end of the century the social security bill would reach Pounds 93m by 2000. The proportion of GDP it would swallow would rise from 12.3 per cent to 13.5 per cent. However, economic growth would do much to reduce the scale of the problem. If unemployment fell by a quarter the social security bill would rise to Pounds 88bn, a real increase of 2.6 per cent a year. If unemployment were halved social security spending would fall as a percentage of GDP. A third of the increase in social security in the next seven years will come from sickness, invalidity and disability benefits. A quarter will come from housing benefit and a fifth from payments to one-parent families. Most of the rest comes from the build-up of state earnings related pensions. Steps have been proposed to curb the growth of invalidity benefit by imposing tougher medical tests. A cross-departmental review led by the Downing Street policy unit is examining housing benefit as part of a review of housing policy. Mr Lilley expressed contentment yesterday over the emerging debate on the increase in one-parent families. While there are no plans to cut their benefits, he believes that a debate could help in changing attitudes which have encouraged the increase. However, Mr Smith's attack in the Commons yesterday gave notice of the opposition's intention to harry the government on the social security issue in the weeks running up to the Christchurch by-election on July 29. Conservative MPs fear that a Labour onslaught intended to show pensions are under threat could prove electorally damaging in what already promises to be a hard-fought contest. Short-term political considerations could make it difficult for Mr Lilley to launch the long-term debate he wants. The growth of social security. HMSO. Pounds 9.50.</p>

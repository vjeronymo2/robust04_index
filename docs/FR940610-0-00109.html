			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (C) If an annuity is payable at the beginning of annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods for a term of years, the value of the annuity is computed by multiplying the aggregate amount payable annually by the annuity factor described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A) of this section; and the product so obtained is then multiplied by the adjustment factor in Table J at the appropriate interest rate component for payments made at the beginning of specified periods. If an annuity is payable at the beginning of annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods for one or more lives, the value of the annuity is the sum of the first payment plus the present value of a similar annuity, the first payment of which is not to be made until the end of the payment period, determined as provided in this paragraph (d)(2)(iv).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Annuity and unitrust interests for a term of years or until the prior death of an individual. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  See &sect;25.2512&hyph;5(d)(2)(v) of this chapter for examples explaining how to compute the present value of an annuity or unitrust interest that is payable until the earlier of the lapse of a specific number of years or the death of an individual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transitional rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) If the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, and before June 10, 1994, a taxpayer can rely on Notice 89&hyph;24, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 660, or Notice 89&hyph;60, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 700 (See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of this chapter).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If a decedent dies after April 30, 1989, and if on May 1, 1989, the decedent was mentally incompetent so that the disposition of the decedent's property could not be changed, and the decedent dies without having regained competency to dispose of the decedent's property or dies within 90 days of the date on which the decedent first regains competency, the fair market value of annuities, life estates, terms for years, remainders, and reversions included in the gross estate of the decedent is their present value determined either under this section or under the corresponding section applicable at the time the decedent became mentally incompetent, at the option of the decedent's executor. For example, see &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Publications and actuarial computations by the Internal Revenue Service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many standard actuarial factors not included in paragraph (d)(6) of this section are included in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457, ``Actuarial Values, Alpha Volume,'' (8&hyph;89). Publication 1457 also includes examples that illustrate how to compute many special factors for more unusual situations. A copy of this publication may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. If a special factor is required in the case of an actual decedent, the Service may furnish the factor to the executor upon a request for a ruling. The request for a ruling must be accompanied by a recitation of the facts including a statement of the date of birth for each measuring life, the date of the decedent's death, any other applicable dates, and a copy of the will, trust, or other relevant documents. A request for a ruling must comply with the instructions for requesting a ruling published periodically in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see &sect;&sect;601.201 and 601.601(d)(2)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of this chapter) and include payment of the required user fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. Remainder payable at an individual's death. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The decedent, or the decedent's estate, was entitled to receive certain property worth $50,000 upon the death of the decedent's elder sister, to whom the income was bequeathed for life. The decedent died in February 1990. At the time of the decedent's death, the elder sister was 47 years 5 months old. In February 1990, the section 7520 rate was 9.8 percent. Under Table S in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the remainder factor at 9.8 percent for determining the present value of the remainder interest due at the death of a person aged 47, the number of years nearest the elder sister's actual age at the decedent's death, is .11352. The present value of the remainder interest at the date of the decedent's death is, therefore, $5,676.00 ($50,000&times;.11352).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. Income payable for an individual's life. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  A's parent bequeathed an income interest in property to A for life, with the remainder interest passing to B at A's death. At the time of the parent's death in October 1989, the value of the property was $50,000 and A was 30 years 10 months old. The section 7520 rate in October 1989 was 10.2 percent. Under Table S in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the remainder factor at 10.2 percent for determining the present value of the remainder interest due at the death of a person aged 31, the number of years closest to A's age at the decedent's death, is .03753. Converting this remainder factor to an income factor, as described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the factor for determining the present value of an income interest for the life of a person aged 31 is .96247. The present value of A's interest at the time of the parent's death is, therefore, $48,123.50 ($50,000&times;.96247).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3. Annuity payable for an individual's life. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  A purchased an annuity for the benefit of both A and B. Under the terms of the annuity contract, at A's death, a survivor annuity of $10,000 a year payable in equal semiannual installments made at the end of each interval is payable to B for life. A died in September 1989. For September 1989, the section 7520 rate was 9.6 percent. At A's death, B was 45 years 7 months old. Under Table S in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the factor at 9.6 percent for determining the present value of the remainder interest at the death of a person age 46 (the number of years nearest B's actual age) is .11013. By converting the factor to an annuity factor, as described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, the factor for the present value of an annuity payable until the death of a person age 46 is 9.2695 (1.00000 minus .11013, divided by .096). The adjustment factor from Table K in paragraph (d)(6) of this section at an interest rate of 9.6 percent for semiannual annuity payments made at the end of the period is 1.0235. The present value of the annuity at the date of A's death is, therefore, $94,873.33 ($10,000&times;9.2695&times;1.0235).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4. Annuity payable for a term of years. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The decedent, or the decedent's estate, was entitled to receive an annuity of $10,000 a year payable in equal quarterly installments at the end of each quarter throughout a term certain. The decedent died in February 1990. For February 1990, the section 7520 rate was 9.8 percent. A quarterly payment had just been made prior to the decedent's death and payments were to continue for 5 more years. Under Table B in paragraph (d)(6) of this section for the interest rate of 9.8 percent, the factor for the present value of a remainder interest due after a term of 5 years is .626597. Converting the factor to an annuity factor, as described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, the factor for the present value of an annuity for a term of 5 years is 3.8102. The adjustment factor from Table K in paragraph (d)(6) of this section at an interest rate of 9.8 percent for quarterly annuity payments made at the end of the period is 1.0360. The present value of the annuity is, therefore, $39,473.67 ($10,000&times;3.8102&times;1.0360).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Actuarial Tables. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Except as provided in &sect;20.7520&hyph;3(b) (pertaining to certain limitations on the use of prescribed tables), the following tables must be used in the application of the provisions of this section when the section 7520 interest rate component is between 4.2 and 14 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

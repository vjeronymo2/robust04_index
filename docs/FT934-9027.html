			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television Not so long ago motor racing was widely seen as a noisy and dangerous pastime (scarcely a sport) for the sort of overgrown boy who went 'vroom, vroom' under his breath when a car with a broken silencer went down the road. Now it is part of the global hype which sells everything from cameras to condoms. The Team (BBC2, 9.30) is a seven-part series about McLaren and their efforts to recapture the Formula One World Championship. In last week's news quiz, Have I Got News For You (BBC2, 10.00), Paul Merton, the quickest and most dead-pan of the contestants, ridiculed question master Angus Deayton for the complexity of his carefully prepared 'funny' answers. He has a point. Deayton is becoming more verbose and less funny as his contributions expand. Time to forego the autocue and push Deayton back on his own resources. It is hard to know when the daily 'documentary soap' Sarajevo - A Street Under Siege will be on air since it lasts only two minutes and is tacked on the end of programmes, but you should catch it on BBC2 at 10.25.</p>

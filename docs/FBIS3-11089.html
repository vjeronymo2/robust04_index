			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Attorney General's Office and Ministry of  Defense have joined forces to draft a new Military Penal Code.    The code will include forms of illicit conduct not  previously  classified as crimes or simply viewed as disciplinary problems.    Experts from the two institutions say that consideration is  being given to the inclusion in the code of such crimes as  forced disappearances, torture, and other illicit acts falling  into the category of sexual abuse.    Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta has appointed two  assistant prosecutors to work with the Ministry of Defense on  the joint undertaking.    They are Mauricio Fajardo, assistant prosecutor for the  military forces, and Manuel Corredor, first assistant prosecutor  for criminal matters.    Sources within the Attorney General's Office said yesterday,  for example, that forced disappearance is prohibited by the  Constitution, but not classified as a crime in either the Penal  Code or the Military Penal Code.    For that reason, both prosecutors argue that it must be  included in the new code, harshly penalized, and used as a  deterrent to law enforcement officers who might commit such  abuses.    The same sources said that torture had to be classified as a  crime because proven cases can only be penalized as personal  injuries, when such is the case, or as abuses of authority.    The objective is to ensure that these and other issues are  studied by the joint commission of the Attorney General's Office  and Ministry of Defense, whose prosecutors would be officers  from the criminal jurisdiction and members of the general  inspectorships of all the Armed Forces.    Last week Arrieta sent a letter to General Ramon Emilio Gil,  acting minister of defense, informing him that the Attorney  General's Office expects a revision, not only of new crime  classifications, but also of all matters relating to  competencies and procedures in force under the existing Military  Penal Code.    In the opinion of the attorney general, the letter says, the  success of the revision "will not only determine the credibility  of military criminal justice. Rather, the military institutions  themselves would in addition reap incalculable benefits, in  terms of the morale of their members and the trust which civil  society has in them, from having an effective administration of  justice that deals swiftly and rigorously with the punishable  conduct of those who do not deserve to be in their ranks."  <H5>  Scarcity of Attorneys </H5>   Arrieta explained in his letter to Gil that his Office has a  special interest in such a reform, based on a clear policy aimed  at guaranteeing respect for human rights.    The Office of Attorney General believes that with respect to  procedure, for example, the Code should fill vacuums created by  a recent ruling of the Constitutional Court eliminating the  possibility of naming officers who are not attorneys to defend  the accused.    The Court ruling, which basically deemed [it] a violation of  the right to an adequate defense, forced the military criminal  jurisdiction to seek emergency solutions.    The courts and the Military Criminal Tribunal, for example,  were forced to call upon attorneys from the Public Defender's  Office and the legal offices of universities.    Even so, the backlog and lack of defense counsel rendered  the  plan practically inoperative. The Attorney General's Office  believes that the military jurisdiction should begin by drawing  up a complete record of performance.</p>

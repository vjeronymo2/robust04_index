			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / States act to stem flow of plutonium Efforts to stem the flow of plutonium being smuggled from Russia into the west intensified yesterday. President Boris Yeltsin has written to Chancellor Helmut Kohl promising Moscow's willingness to work with Bonn to fight the trade in nuclear contraband. And Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, said he was intending to propose to his European Union colleagues that plutonium smuggling was a suitable case for Europol, the Union's fledgling crime fighting agency. Mr Kohl said earlier he would telephone President Yeltsin in the next few days to discuss nuclear smuggling from the former Soviet Union, which German officials believe is the source of four seizures of weapons-grade material in the past four months. Bonn and Moscow have crossed swords over the suspected origins of the highly radioactive plutonium-239 and enriched uranium seized since May - the first time that smuggled weapons-grade material has cropped up on German soil. The German government said it saw no reason to change its assumption that the nuclear contraband came from Russian or Soviet nuclear facilities, despite Russian accusations of a smear campaign by the west. In another development, German police yesterday raided flats in Berlin and found evidence suggesting smugglers were planning or had shipped contraband plutonium to Pakistan. A justice ministry spokesman said one Pakistani national, two Poles and a German, believed to be the ringleader, were under investigation. Mr Kinkel, in addition to pressing the case for Europol to become involved in investigating plutonium smuggling, is also planning to suggest that funds from the EU's programme of technical assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States be used to develop effective recording and control systems for nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. The EU is already a partner in a massive programme to help the countries of the former Soviet Union stem the drain of nuclear scientists to potentially dangerous countries Last March, the EU, Japan, Russia and the US set up the International Science and Technology Centre in Moscow as an 'insurance policy against nuclear proliferation' to channel Russian nuclear engineers and scientists into more peaceful pursuits. So far, the centre has approved 54 projects to employ 3,000 scientists over the next three years. But Mr Glenn Schweitzer, the ISTC's executive director, estimates that there are tens of thousands of scientists and engineers in Russia with knowledge useful to anyone intent on building a nuclear bomb. 'There are a lot of poor and disillusioned nuclear scientists wandering around the streets of Russia. If we've got 10 per cent of them then we're doing well,' he says. Mr Vladimir Kruchenkov, a Russian nuclear scientist and deputy executive director of the ISTC, says he has heard of several cases where foreign powers have tried to recruit Russian nuclear and military expertise. 'We have heard that the North Koreans are interested in rocket technology and the Syrians are interested in the electrical area,' he says. Russian scientists would find it difficult to leave the country. 'They may also wonder about the long term career prospects in a place like Iraq,' according to Mr Schweitzer. But he suggests that foreign joint ventures operating in Russia could easily serve as front organisations. Mr Kruchenkov suggests there is a greater likelihood that guards or minor bureaucrats who control nuclear stockpiles could be seduced by foreign powers or terrorist groups.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Cha-su: "Inspection of Nuclear </F> Facilities in North Korea and Types of Inspections"]    [Excerpt] The ordinary [tongsang] inspection of nuclear  facilities in North Korea by the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] will begin on a full scale on 2 March. A  seven-member inspection team arrived in Pyongyang on 1 March  afternoon.    The targets of its inspection are 16 nuclear facilities,  including an experimental atomic reactor and critical facilities  [imgye sisol], a nuclear fuel rod manufacturing plant and  storage facilities, a uranium mine and uranium smelting plant,  and two atomic power stations.    However, North Korea refused an ad hoc ordinary [imsi  tongsang] inspection by putting forward its specific position in  which its withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  [NPT] is being withheld. As a result, the IAEA team's inspection  will be conducted in such a manner as to only confirm whether  the nuclear material is diverted for military purpose.    Therefore, during the forthcoming inspections, examination  of  the equipment and work log, and confirmation of the status of  the seals will be conducted in seven major facilities out of 16  declared facilities, including an experimental atomic reactor,  critical and semi-critical facilities, a nuclear fuel rod  manufacturing plant, a nuclear fuel storage facility, a  5-megawatt atomic reactor, and a radiochemical laboratory.    North Korea ratified the Nuclear Safeguards Accord in April  1992, and following this, it forwarded for the first time a list  of 16 nuclear facilities to the IAEA on 4 May. North Korea then  reported to IAEA in 1992 that it extracted 90 grams of  plutonium. However, the result of the inspection revealed that  North Korea seemed to have extracted more, possibly several  kilograms, thus showing a discrepancy.    In a bid to inquire into this discrepancy, the IAEA demanded  a special inspection of two sites in Yongbyon, which have been  suspected of being nuclear waste storage facilities. However,  North Korea rejected the demand, and declared its withdrawal  from the NPT in 1993. Thus, the North Korean nuclear issue  became an international problem.

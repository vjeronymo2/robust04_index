			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Toyota Motor priced to ensure strong demand YESTERDAY'S Dollars 250m three-year deal from Toyota Motor Finance, which was arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston, was priced attractively to ensure strong demand, according to dealers. The pricing of the deal was said to have been influenced by the disappointing performance of General Electric Capital Corporation's Dollars 200m three-year deal, which was launched at 16 basis points over the comparable US Treasury yield last week. This level was considered too aggressive. Yesterday, the deal traded as wide as 23 basis points, according to several traders. By comparison, the Toyota Motor Finance deal appeared attractively priced at 33 basis points over the three-year US Treasury yield. Although Toyota Motor would typically need to be priced at a wider spread than GECC, even though both have triple-A ratings, the 10 basis point differential favoured the Toyota deal, according to traders. By the end of the day, the Toyota spread had tightened by a basis point or two. In the floating-rate note market, Credito Italiano launched a Dollars 75m issue, increased to Dollars 100m, using the popular collared structure, incorporating minimum and maximum coupon levels. The minimum coupon of 6 per cent, the highest seen on a collared floater, encouraged strong retail demand, even though the debt is subordinated. Two UK building societies, the Nationwide and the National &amp; Provincial, had their AA3-rated long-term debt placed under review for possible downgrade by Moody's yesterday. A downgrade would take both borrower's debt below the AA threshold applied by a number of investment managers, and could increase their funding costs. Moody's cited concerns about asset quality and core earnings in the current competitive environment. Mr Alastair Lyons, N&amp;P's finance director, said the building society has no requirement to access the medium-term market this year, and will concentrate on the short-term market. Mr Richard Lassen, treasury director of Nationwide, which had its debt placed under review lat year, but was not downgraded, said that the society will be a net repayer of debt this year. Both had their Prime-1 commercial paper ratings confirmed.</p>

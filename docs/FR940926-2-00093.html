In 1978, the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) was created to partially fulfill this requirement. NCAP test results evaluate the degree or crash protection provided front seat occupants by the vehicle's structure and the occupant protection devices provided for those occupants. NCAP crash tests, through model year 1994, have evaluated frontal crash protection only. In this test, vehicles are crashed into a fixed barrier at 35 mph, which is equivalent to a head-on collision between two identical vehicles each moving at 35 mph. Instrumented dummies register forces and impacts during the crash. That information is, in turn, used by NHTSA to predict potential head, chest and femur injuries. Approximately 35&hyph;40 passenger vehicles are tested each year in the NCAP and the test results are made available to the public through the periodic issuance of news releases, through the agency's Hotline, and through other means. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NCAP is NHTSA's most popular vehicle safety consumer information activity, as witnessed by the volume of calls to the agency, media attention to program results, and the use of NCAP data by numerous consumer and insurance organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recent years, the travelling public has increased its concern about motor vehicle safety. Increased safety belt usage, reduced levels of alcohol-impaired driving, and attention to vehicle safety attributes such as air bags and antilock brakes are evidence of this trend. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To take advantage of this heightened consumer awareness of safety, and to address technical and other issues associated with NCAP, the agency believes it is timely to convene a Public Meeting to discuss future activities under NCAP as well as how NCAP and other safety information activities conducted or required by NHTSA can best be integrated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Report to Congress <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 8, 1993, in response to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the agency submitted a report to Congress on NCAP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This report, which is in the docket, provides: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The results of an 18-month study to assess consumer and media needs and preferences for better understanding and more effective use of NCAP data. This included a summary of several consumer focus group and media studies. These studies indicated that consumers and the media desire comparative safety information on vehicles, a simplified NCAP format to better understand and utilize the crash test results, and expansion of NCAP to include other crash modes, such as side crashes and rollovers. Plans for implementing the findings of these studies are included in that report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Studies of real-world crashes versus NCAP crash tests. These studies tentatively conclude that NCAP test conditions approximate real-world crash conditions covering a major segment of the frontal crash safety problem. NHTSA also tentatively concludes that there is a significant correlation between NCAP results and real-world fatality risks for restrained drivers. In high speed frontal crashes, fatality risks to restrained drivers of cars that perform well in NCAP may be as much as 30 percent lower than fatality risks to restrained drivers of cars that do not perform well in NCAP. A more detailed report on this subject titled Correlation of NCAP Performance With Fatality Risk in Actual Head-On Collisions has been published by the agency, and is available in the NHTSA docket, and public comments were separately sought on that report (see 59 FR 1586, January 11, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues Chamberlain Phipps, the shoe component and footwear group, is set to return to the market after a six-year absence with a placing and offer to brokers which values the company at Pounds 73.6m, writes Peggy Hollinger. The company is placing 22.9m shares at 165p, of which 7.7m will be subject to clawback for applications from brokers. Chamberlain was bought from Evode in 1992 by US investor Dan Sullivan and Legal &amp; General Ventures for Pounds 12m. The business has been rationalised and reinforced its strong hold on the UK market by snapping up competitor Larkhill Polymer. More recently, Sullivan has led Chamberlain into shoe manufacturing through the acquisition of two French companies. The shares on a p/e of 10.5 times appear to have been reasonably priced, given the risk surrounding the group's move into footwear manufacturing. There is, however, some discomfort over Sullivan's plans for aggressive equity-based expansion. There is also caution regarding the earnings incentives being offered to Sullivan, who already has a 25 per cent stake as a result of his initial investments. Nevertheless, Chamberlain has room to improve margins. The offer closes on Tuesday and trading is due to start on August 15. The offer is sponsored by Samuel Montagu.</p>

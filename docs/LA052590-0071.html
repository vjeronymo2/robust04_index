			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH COMMENT IRRITATES TAIWAN  </P> <P> President Bush's assertion Thursday that Taiwan supports an extension of trade  benefits for China embarrassed Taiwan's Nationalist government, which issued a  quick denial.  </P> <P> At his press conference, Bush twice said that in the last few weeks, Taiwan has  been among the Asian governments urging the Administration to continue China's  most-favored-nation trading status.  </P> <P> "Korea, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, even Taiwan made clear that MFN should be  retained," Bush said.  </P> <P> Not so, said Taiwan's government.  </P> <P> Within a few hours, Ding Mou-shih, the head of Taiwan's unofficial embassy  here, called a press conference to say that he and his government had not in  any way endorsed the trade benefits for the Communist regime in Beijing.  </P></p>

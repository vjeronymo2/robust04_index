			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Korinenko] </F>   [Text] Wuensdorf, 15 Feb -- An international inspection  team has begun work at the positions of the Western Group of  Forces [WGF] to check that the Russian Federation is complying  with the provisions of the treaty on conventional armed Forces  in Europe. The commision will comprise representatives of  Canada, Italy, France, and Great Britain. As is known, the  treaty which was signed in Paris on 19 November 1990 provides  for each participant country to have certain quotas of armaments  which can be achieved only by reductions in its existing combat  equipment.    The main object of attention for the foreign inspectors who  will be staying in the WGF's positions until 18 February will be  the former tank repair works in Wuensdorf which since August  1992 has been turned into a base for destroying armored  equipment.    As the ITAR-TASS correspondent was told in the WGF press  center, before the final withdrawal of the Russian forces from  Germany, it is planned to reduce the armored combat vehicles by  2,632, which represents 42 percent of the total number of these  vehicles due to be reduced by the Russian Federation. To date  2,279 have already been reduced including 1,679 armored  transports (BTR-60) and 600 infantry combat vehicles.    Over the period that the base for the destruction of combat  equipment in Wuensdorf has been in operation, representatives of  the states which are signatories to the treaty have carried out  six inspections. There have been no complaints from the  inspectors.</p>

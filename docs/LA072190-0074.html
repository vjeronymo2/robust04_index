			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISNEYLAND TO PAY HUGE FINE IN EPA TOXICS CASE  </P> <P> Disneyland, world-famous for its sparkling-clean park, agreed Friday to pay the  largest toxic waste fine ever assessed by the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency for hiring a company that illegally disposed of its hazardous materials  for two years.  </P> <P> The $550,000 fine settles a complaint filed by the EPA under which the Walt  Disney Co. was charged with 38 violations of federal toxic waste laws during  1988 and 1989.  </P> <P> EPA officials said Disneyland hired a company that illegally hauled 14,000  gallons of paint thinner, cleaning solvents such as acetone and other toxic  materials to two disposal sites, in Wyoming and Utah.  </P> <P> Thirteen separate shipments were trucked to a Wyoming oil-disposal plant and  one to a Utah plant -- neither of which have the authority to handle the types  of waste sent by Disneyland, according to the EPA.  </P> <P> Disney officials acknowledged the illegal disposal and said they are extremely  embarrassed by it. They said they did not know that their contractor, Ken's Oil  Co. Inc. of Garden Grove, was handling the waste improperly until they were  notified by the EPA last year.  </P> <P> "We were guilty of naivete to an amazing degree," said Kym Murphy, corporate  vice president of environmental policy for the Disney Co., based in Burbank.  </P> <P> "We had a good working relationship with the contractor, and we thought it was  all being done with the appropriate procedures and permits."  </P> <P> Federal law, however, says a company that produces the waste is the party  responsible for ensuring it is handled safely from creation to disposal.  </P> <P> "We take these violations very seriously," said David Janik, an enforcement  attorney in the EPA's Denver office who handled the case.  </P> <P> "These facilities need to follow strict procedures and safeguards, or we can't  ensure that the materials aren't going on the ground or someplace else unsafe."  </P> <P> The $550,000 fine is the largest in the nation paid by a company for improper  disposal of toxic waste since the EPA began enforcing the federal laws 14 years  ago, Janik said.  </P> <P> A larger fine, $2 million, was paid a few years ago by Chemical Waste  Management for violations at its toxic waste landfill in Kettleman City, near  Fresno. But that was a disposal facility, not a company that generates waste,  and the penalty was assessed through the U.S. attorney's office, not the EPA,  officials said.  </P> <P> The EPA originally sought $950,000 in the Disneyland complaint, based on  $25,000 per violation. The settlement took several months of negotiations.  </P> <P> Murphy said that even for a company as large as Disney, the fine is "very  substantial."  </P> <P> "Being a first offender, we could have been treated a little more cordially,"  he said. "I thought we should be given probation, not a fine."  </P> <P> He said he believes that the EPA is using Disneyland to set a tough and visible  example for other companies.  </P> <P> "It certainly will get industry's attention," Murphy said. "They picked a  company that really showcases their seriousness. When the general public hears  this, they think 'My gosh, Disneyland, how could Disneyland even have hazardous  waste?' "  </P> <P> Hundreds of thousands of U.S. companies generate hazardous waste, with more  than 5,000 of them in Orange County alone.  </P> <P> EPA officials said they are not picking on Disneyland. The size of the fine is  appropriate for the large number of shipments that went to the plants  illegally, Janik said.  </P> <P> Four other Southern California companies and the city of Fontana, which all  used the same two plants, are being fined $75,000 to $150,000 apiece. The fines  are smaller because fewer shipments were involved, Janik said.  </P> <P> EPA inspectors discovered the violations while checking the Wyoming plant's  records, he said. EPA officials are trying to track down what happened to the  paints and solvents at the plants, which are in La Barge, Wyo., and near Salt  Lake City. The plants have EPA permits to recycle or burn only oil, not other  wastes.  </P> <P> "We still don't know what happened to the waste, or whether there was harm to  the environment or public health," Janik said. "If it was burned, there could  have been improper emissions."  </P> <P> Janik said the EPA has filed a complaint seeking to shut down the plants, both  owned by a company called Mountaineer Refining.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Disney filed suit in Orange County Superior Court against its  contractor, Ken's Oil Co. Inc. Ken's officials were unavailable for comment  Friday.  </P> <P> Ken's had been a Disney contractor for eight years, until its dismissal last  year after the EPA told Disney of the violations, Murphy said.  </P> <P> EPA officials said that Disney was cooperative in the investigation and that  they have no evidence indicating that company officials knew of the violations.  But they said Disneyland officials signed the federally required forms that  show where the shipments are going.  </P> <P> "They should have checked into this facility," Janik said.  </P> <P> As part of the settlement, Disneyland is conducting an environmental audit at  the park and beginning an employee training program.  </P> <P> The penalty is especially ironic because Disneyland, which celebrated its 35th  birthday Tuesday, takes great pride in its cleanliness. Its streets are  steam-cleaned daily, and its attractions are repainted almost continually.  </P> <P> But many of the same products that keep the park so clean -- solvents, paints  and varnishes -- are toxic materials that must be disposed of only at special  hazardous-waste sites. The theme park uses about 20,000 gallons of paint per  year.  </P> <P> "It's an extremely difficult lesson for us to learn this way," Murphy said.  "The amount of waste was small, and it certainly wasn't malicious."  </P></p>

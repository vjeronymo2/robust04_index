			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading The latest futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index generated the same enthusiasm as its predecessor and pushed the underlying stock market to new highs, writes Peter John. The new contract, which expires in March, has replaced the December contract that ended its life on Friday as the most heavily traded futures instrument linked to the Footsie. It has a fair value premium calculated at between 14 and 18 points above the cash market, but after opening at 3,367 it steamed forward to hit a high of 3,403 in the afternoon. At those rarified levels it was trading some 35 points above cash. Dealers are beginning to worry that the stock market is at a frighteningly high level unjustified by economic fundamentals. But the independent futures traders known as locals, unconcerned that the stock market has risen 1,000 points since the UK left the European exchange rate mechanism, continued to lend their support. The locals were said to have bought March at around 3,385 and taken their profits at the high levels to bring it back to 3,396 by the official close, with turnover of 10,737 lots. Dealers expected the squeeze on the March contract to continue until the end of the year, with a liquidity shortage increased by imminent expiry of a number of tailor-made OTC Footsie options. In contrast, options activity returned to desultory levels, with total volume of 31,594 lots and only 14,600 index options. Fisons, which has seen the return of bid rumours, was the most active stock option with 1,864 lots dealt. Trafalgar House, Ladbroke and BP also attracted business.</p>

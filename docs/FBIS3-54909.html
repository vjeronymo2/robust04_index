			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A RID correspondent has received this sensational  information from CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korotchenya: On  New Year's eve Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav  Shushkevich officially notified the CIS Executive Secretariat  about Belarus joining the CIS collective security treaty, signed  at the CIS heads of state conference in Tashkent on 15 May 1992.  Thus, Stanislav Shushkevich made a difficult step, because he  had categorically opposed joining the treaty. The official  notification of the CIS Headquarters was probably prompted by  statements made by CIS officials demanding that Belarus  precisely determine its standpoint with regard to the collective  security issue. With this step Stanislav Shushkevich removed  the trump card of his opponents periodically pressing for his  resignation from the post of Supreme Soviet chairman.    However, the speaker believes that the Belarusian  legislature  has a right to introduce amendments in the process of  ratification, regulating both the use of the Belarusian Armed  Forces on CIS territory and the CIS Armed Forces on the  territory of Belarus.</p>

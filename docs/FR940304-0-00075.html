			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Portulaca sclerocarpa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of the purslane family (Portulacaceae), a perennial herb with a fleshy tuberous taproot which becomes woody, has stems up to about 7.9 in (20 cm) long. The stalkless, succulent, grayish-green leaves are almost circular in cross-section, 0.3 to 0.8 in (8 to 21 mm) long, and about 0.06 to 0.1 in (1.5 to 2.5 mm) wide. Dense tufts of hairs are located in each leaf axil and underneath the tight clusters of three to six stalkless flowers grouped at the ends of the stems. Sepals are about 0.2 in (5 mm) long and have membranous edges. Petals are white, pink, or pink with a white base, about 0.4 in (10 mm) long, and surround about 30 stamens and an 8-branched style. The hardened capsules are about 0.2 in (4 to 4.5 mm) long, have walls 0.01 to 0.02 in (0.18 to 0.5 mm) thick, open very late or not at all, and contain glossy, dark reddish-brown seeds about 0.02 in (0.4 to 0.6 mm) long. This species differs from other native and naturalized species of the genus in Hawaii by its woody taproot, its narrow leaves, and the colors of its petals and seeds. Its closest relative,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Portulaca villosa,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> differs mainly in its thinner-walled, opening capsule (Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Portulaca sclerocarpa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was found on an islet off the south coast of the island of Lanai and on the island of Hawaii in the Kohala Mountains, on the northern slope of Hualalai, the northwestern slope of Mauna Loa, and near Kilauea Crater. There is one extant population on Poopoo Islet off the coast of Lanai which contains about 10 plants (R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). On Hawaii, 11 extant populations extend over a distance of about 54 by 32 mi (87 by 51 km) and are located on 3 cinder cones in the Nohonaohae area; at PTA near the Multi-Purpose Range Complex (MPRC); at Puu Anahulu; and near Puu Keanui and Puu Lehua on privately, State-, and federally owned land. The 11 populations on the island of Hawaii contain a total of approximately 72 to 122 individuals (Cuddihy  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1983, HHP 1991s1 to 1991s12; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992; R. Shaw,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 1993). This species typically grows in Montane Dry Shrublands, often on bare cinder and even near steam vents, at elevations between 3,380 and 5,340 ft (1,030 and 1,630 m) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). Associated species include mamane and 'ohi'a (HHP 1991s1, 1991s8 to 1991s10, 1991s12, HPCC 1991i). The major threats to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Portulaca sclerocarpa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are competition from alien grasses such as fountain grass and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Andropogon virginicus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (broomsedge); trampling and habitat disturbance by feral goats, pigs, and sheep; habitat disturbance and damage to plants as a result of military exercises; and fire (HHP 1991s2, 1991s9, HPCC 1991i; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on collections by Rock on the island of Hawaii, Beccari named  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pritchardia affinis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and three varieties: Var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> halophila <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (misspelled as ``holaphila''), var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> rhopalocarpa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> gracilis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Beccari and Rock 1921). In the current treatment of the genus (Read and Hodel 1990), no subspecific taxa are recognized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pritchardia affinis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the palm family (Arecaceae) is a fan-leaved tree 33 to 82 ft (10 to 25 m) tall with pale or pinkish soft wool covering the underside of the petiole and extending onto the leaf blade. The wedge-shaped leaf has a green and smooth upper surface and a pale green lower surface with scattered yellowish scales. The branched, hairless flower clusters are located among the leaves. Each flower comprises a cup-shaped, three-lobed calyx; three petals; six stamens; and a three-lobed stigma. The spherical fruit is about 0.9 in (2.3 cm) in diameter. This species is distinguished from other species of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pritchardia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by the long, tangled, woolly hairs on the underside of the petiole and the base of the lower leaf blade; the stout hairless flower clusters which do not extend beyond the wedge-shaped leaves; and the smaller, spherical fruit (Read and Hodel 1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

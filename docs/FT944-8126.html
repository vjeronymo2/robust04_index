			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Pay rise pressures grow in France Workers at the Belfort site of GEC Alsthom in eastern France will today vote on whether to end a strike which has halted production at four subsidiaries of the Anglo-French engineering group this month. It is one of a spate of industrial disputes over the past few weeks which have prompted concerns about a deterioration in labour relations and higher wage demands from trade unions. It follows a stoppage at Pechiney, the aluminium and packaging company, and comes amid a call by unions for industrial action in the public sector later this week. Union officials say industrial action in support of wage claims is justified by the fact that salaries have not kept pace with improved company results and the recovery in the French economy after the recession of 1992-1993. Industrialists and economists play down the risk of widespread industrial action. 'It is a situation of sporadic rather than general unrest,' said Mr Francois Morin, director of Lerep, the economics research institute, citing the declining trend in the number of strikes and in union membership. However, employers express concern about the demands for higher wages. This is prompted by the rise in such demands as a cause of industrial disputes. For the first time since 1990, pay demands have become the most common factor in stoppages and strikes in French industry. At Pechiney, the strike at the company's Dunkirk smelter was ended after management agreed to increase monthly pay by between FFr450 (Pounds 54) and FFr600 (Pounds 72). At GEC Alsthom, unions are demanding that salaries for the 7,400 workers at the Belfort site be increased by FFr1,500 a month. They are helping to organise today's vote, but are urging a rejection of the management's offer to award pay rises of between FFr100 and FFr500.</p>

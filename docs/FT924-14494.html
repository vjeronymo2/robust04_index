			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Hard man at the head of South Korea's steel revolution bows out - John Burton examines the political manoeuvres in the run-up to presidential elections that prompted the chairman of Posco to resign IT has been a momentous week for South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel Company (Posco), the world's third-largest steelmaker. Mr Park Tae-joon, founder chairman, last Friday celebrated the completion of the company's production facilities and the 25th anniversary of Posco's creation by the Korean government. But Mr Park this week stunned the company when he suddenly announced his resignation, as Posco was preparing to offer shares next week to foreigners for the first time. Whoever is selected from among the company's top management to succeed Mr Park will have a hard time matching his reputation as one of South Korea's best corporate leaders. When Mr Park, a retired general with limited industrial experience, was asked by Korea's former military government in 1967 to create a steel industry that would support the country's rapid push to industrialise, international advisers said the project was doomed to failure. Korea lacked the technology, capital and even the iron ore deposits to support the costly setting up of a steel company. Nevertheless, Posco today ranks third in world steel production at 21m tonnes, behind Nippon Steel of Japan and Usinor-Sacilor of France. Its facilities at Pohang and Kwangyang are among the largest and most productive steel mills in the world. The efficiency of the plants has meant that Posco has enjoyed a consistent record of profitability in spite of pricing its steel below world rates. Posco is South Korea's fifth-largest company in terms of sales, at Won5,820bn (Dollars 7.4bn) in 1991, and ranked third in profits at Won145.6bn. It is also the second-largest capitalised company on the Seoul exchange. But the departure of Mr Park, who resigned due to a power struggle with other leaders of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), has cast a shadow over the company's otherwise bright future. The immediate concern is that Posco will suffer a leadership vacuum after Mr Park's resignation, which dealt a blow to company morale. The demonstrations staged by both Posco managers and workers to protest Mr Park's resignation reflected the revered status he enjoyed within the company. He had built up a corporate personality cult that reflects the strongly paternalistic role that Korean corporate leaders normally play in Asia's most Confucian society. Although Posco's management is considered among the best in South Korea, there are worries the company may no longer enjoy the beneficial ties forged by Mr Park with the government, which has a 35 per cent shareholding in Posco. Posco will closely monitor the reaction of international investors to this week's developments as up to 8 per cent of its shares are offered to foreigners. One Korean securities analyst said foreign investors were already cautious about Posco's prospects since it is considered a 'smokestack' company. The management turmoil has coincided with a slowdown in the South Korean economy. Posco's biggest domestic consumers - the car, construction and electronics industries - report only modest growth. Lucky Securities estimates that Posco sales will increase by only 6 per cent this year, against a 21.3 per cent rise in 1991. Net earnings are forecast to grow by 3 per cent against a 84.3 per cent jump in profits a year ago. The earnings performance has also been harmed by financial costs associated with the completion of the Kwangyang facilities, as well as increased competition in export markets. Although Posco's debt/equity ratio of 127 per cent is high by international standards, it is modest for a Korean company. The Ministry of Finance's 20 per cent shareholding in Posco has meant that the company has received preferential treatment in being allowed to tap overseas capital markets, where interest rates are lower. The ministry normally keeps a tight control on Korean corporate borrowing abroad. Posco believes domestic demand will rebound strongly next year due to expected higher car sales and the construction start of new infrastructure projects, including a high-speed railway and a new airport for Seoul. Posco sells 70 per cent of its steel output in the domestic market. The company, which accounts for 70 per cent of Korean steel production, is still unable to satisfy the growing domestic appetite for steel despite the completion of new production facilities. South Korean steel demand exceeds domestic supply by around 5m tonnes. Indeed, the percentage of Posco's total production going for export, mainly to Japan and south-east Asia, has fallen over the past decade. Meanwhile, Posco is attempting to increase profit margins by producing higher quality speciality steel, although 95 per cent of its production remains basic steel. Predictions that Korean steel consumption will peak by the year 2000 has forced Posco to begin diversifying its activities. It wants 30 per cent of its sales to come from non-steel operations within the next 10 years. It established a research institute in 1977 and opened a private technical university a decade later to develop expertise in semiconductors, speciality chemicals, genetic engineering, ceramics and factory automation, all of which are considered potential areas for expansion. But its diversification strategy suffered a setback in August when it failed to win the licence to operate the country's first private mobile telephone network. Posco made a bid for the licence through its three-year-old information and telecommunications subsidiary, Posdata, in co-operation with Pacific Telesis of the US and Mannesmann of Germany. The contract was awarded, instead, to the Sunkyong group, Korea's seventh-largest conglomerate, although it was later withdrawn after the political opposition charged that nepotism was involved in the selection. The Sunkyong chairman is an in-law of President Roh Tae-woo. Although a new competition for the licence is scheduled for next year, Posco's chances of winning the contract appear to have been harmed by the departure of Mr Park and his feud with Mr Kim Young-sam, the DLP president and the next likely president of Korea. But Mr Park may still have his revenge. There is talk that he may break his ties with the DLP, of which he is a co-chairman, and stand as an independent in the presidential election in December. If that happens, there is a good chance that he could win, since he now heads the majority faction of the DLP and could attract many of its supporters away from Mr Kim. In spite of this week's upheaval, Posco may be about to see that its best days lie ahead under a possible Park presidency. THE Posco directors yesterday approved the resignation of Mr Park Tae-joon as chairman. Mr Park rejected an offer to become honorary chairman. The change is linked to a dispute between Mr Park, also co-chairman of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), and other party leaders about the forthcoming presidential election. Mr Park has refused to support the party's candidate, Mr Kim Young-sam. Mr Kim, DLP president, has threatened to expel Mr Park from the party.</p>

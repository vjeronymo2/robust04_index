			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Companies 'rethink strategy' RECESSION in Europe and the threat of protectionism world-wide are forcing companies to reappraise strategies adopted in the 1980s, according to a report published today by a group of European economic research institutes, writes Peter Norman, Economics Editor. The ERECO consortium of research institutes from Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and the UK said niche market strategies designed to position European companies in less price-competitive markets had backfired as recession had hit demand for luxury products and forced big price cuts on industries. The strategy of globalisation, highlighted by a five-fold increase in foreign direct investment between 1981 and 1991, could be imperilled if the world economy fragmented into trading blocks centred on the EC, Japan and the US, it added. The report said European companies should strengthen their position in high-quality production rather than push further upmarket. It pointed out that Mercedes, the German car maker, has already decided to design new models to fit pre-defined price brackets rather than aim for the highest engineering standards.

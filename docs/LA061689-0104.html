			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: NEWS COVERAGE HIGHLIGHTS CHINA'S VIDEO REVOLUTION  </P> <P> On the screen Wednesday night was Ted Koppel in Beijing.  </P> <P> Watching the screen Wednesday night was Steve Futterman in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Only recently, it had been almost the reverse: Koppel was doing ABC's  "Nightline" from his usual New York base, and Futterman was grabbing occasional  glimpses of America on the television set in his Beijing hotel room when he  wasn't on the streets covering one of the major stories of the decade.  </P> <P> What a difference 48 hours made.  </P> <P> "There was a little bit of surrealism as I saw the latest footage from Tian An  Men Square," said Futterman, a reporter for NBC/Mutual Radio, who had just  returned from three weeks of intense China duty that included witnessing the  military's bloody repression of protesting masses.  </P> <P> Most of all, Futterman was happy to be back in the United States with his wife  and young son. On another level, however, he sat in his suburban home watching  "Nightline," feeling the immediate past merge with the present and thinking: "I  was there. The story was five minutes away from me on a walk. I'm on the 11th  floor. Let me go outside the hotel. Let me take a walk through the city. The  story is still going on and I should be there."  </P> <P> But now others were there. Reflecting the increasing difficulty in transmitting  from China these days, Wednesday's "Nightline" was glitch-ridden. Koppel's  interview of two American journalists expelled by the Chinese -- supported by  still pictures of himself and them transformed from videotape -- was  prematurely halted when the audio went dead.  </P> <P> Switching to a phone, Koppel then interviewed syndicated columnist Anthony  Lewis, who was on camera in Boston. ABC had Forrest Sawyer standing by to  conduct the Lewis interview from New York had communications with Koppel failed  completely.  </P> <P> If not smooth, it was an interesting program, noting at once the limits -- and  amazing powers -- of TV. There were, of course, the latest chilling revelations  that the Chinese government was using foreign TV footage to track down student  leaders. There was also the latest on Chinese TV's present role as a  revisionist historian, either softening or obliterating the awful truth of  recent events in China.  </P> <P> In a very different way, however, TV's influence had been evident much earlier.  As Lewis pointed out, "The very fact of the world watching (pro-democracy  demonstrations by students in China) was having an impact on the reality."  </P> <P> Futterman agrees. "The students were so clever and so media-savvy," he said.  "Many of the leaders had been to the U.S. and had seen the media machine work,  and they knew the game. They knew we were there, and they knew exactly what  they were doing."  </P> <P> He recalled the night, about a week before the crackdown, that the students  erected the "Goddess of Democracy" in the square. "There was a whole gang of  reporters there, and none of us spoke Chinese. So they had this girl doing all  this stuff on the P.A. and speaking English just to keep us aware of what was  happening. And after each line, she would add, 'Thanks a lot,' as if she were  saying, 'Have a nice day.' "  </P> <P> The students announced the start of their final hunger strike by issuing two  press releases, moreover. One in Chinese, the other in English.  </P> <P> It's true that media awareness is ever expanding, giving birth to a generation  of video commandos who become the unofficial eyes of TV in places where access  is restricted.  </P> <P> "The video revolution has made the world so much smaller that you now have  these amateurs taking their little video cameras everywhere, and then leaking  stuff to the press," said Futterman, who may be right in attributing growing  media consciousness worldwide largely to the global reach of CNN.  </P> <P> "They seem to have given the world a certain mindset about news," he said.  "When I go to Poland, my brother-in-law wants to know about (CNN Headline News  anchor) Bobbie Battista."  </P> <P> Given that mindset, the Chinese government's decision to not impose total  censorship booting out all of the foreign press remains a puzzle. "It's so easy  for them to get rid of us," Futterman said. "They know where we are. They know  what hotels we're at. Why they have allowed us to stay there is a mystery."  </P> <P> Another mystery is whether the fickle media -- especially network TV, with its  limited minutes and intolerance for nonviolent international news -- will  eventually tire of the China story without having to be expelled. Just as  Central America, South Africa and other hot spots rise and fall in the public  mind depending on media access and coverage, so too may China and bittersweet  memories of Tien An Men Square.  </P></p>

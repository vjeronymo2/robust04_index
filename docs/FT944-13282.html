			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Labour waves on peace process The Northern Ireland peace process must be kept moving forward, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said last night, warning that any slackening of the pace would be 'counter-productive for everyone involved.' Ms Mowlam used her first Commons appearance in her new role to advise others involved in attempts to forge a durable settlement in the province not to dig in their heels in the hope that a Labour government would soon be elected. She said: 'No one will have anything to gain by prevarication and procrastination in the hope of a change of government. 'We have got to keep on trucking.' In a wide-ranging speech summarising Labour's position on recent developments, Ms Mowlam highlighted the party's support for the Downing Street declaration and the principle that there could be no change in Ulster's constitutional status without the consent of a majority of its people. But she also reaffirmed Labour's commitment to the unification of Ireland by consent. Promising that Labour would 'facilitate and encourage' a balanced constitutional settlement, she set out five required features for such a package. These were: Provisions ensuring that constitutional legislation in Britain and Ireland was 'mutually consistent' and consistent with the principle of majority consent. Strong devolved government in Northern Ireland elected by proportional representation. Parity of esteem and equity of treatment for both communities, reflected in fair employment, policing and the administration of justice. Deepening cross-border co-operation. Secure guarantees from both governments for any new constitutional arrangements. She called for assurance that the Treasury would 'keep its hands off' public spending in the province. In the first Commons debate on the province since the IRA and loyalist ceasefires, Mr Nicholas Scott, a former Tory Northern Ireland minister, called for long jail sentences of terrorist prisoners in the province to be reviewed. His contribution sparked an angry response from Mr David Wilshire, Conservative MP for Spelthorne, who said some Tories 'would find it absolutely impossible to go down the track you are suggesting'. Earlier Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, announced a Pounds 1m fund to help those disabled by violence in the province.</p>

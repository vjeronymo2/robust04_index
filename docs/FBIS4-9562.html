			<p>BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, has sent letters to U.S. President Clinton,  Russian President Yeltsin, and Saudi King Fahd, in which he asks  them to follow the situation in Gorazde after NATO's ultimatum,  and to launch new initiatives for the political settlement of  the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In his letter to Russian  President Yeltsin, President Izetbegovic says, among other  things, the following:    We have received with pleasure and hope your firm  condemnation of the bloodshed among the civilians in Gorazde.  We favor a political solution to the conflict. However, the  aggressor is not giving up the idea of destroying Bosnia and  exterminating our people even after two years. The keys to the  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina are in the hands of Belgrade and Pale,  the letter states. In our hands are only the keys of resistance  and determination to persevere in this unfair struggle between  good and evil, between democracy and fascism. Esteemed Mr.  President, we welcome the activities of your government with  regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the end of the letter to Boris  Yeltsin, President Alija Izetbegovic officially invites the  Russian President to visit Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In his letter to Saudi King Fahd, President Alija  Izetbegovic  stressed his demand that in future peace talks on our country,  in addition to the United States, Russia, the United Nations,  and the European Union, the Conference of Islamic Countries also  take part as a fifth equal member.</p>

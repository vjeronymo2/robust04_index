			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: WILL NO ONE REPRESENT O.C. AT STATE ARTS FORUM?  </P> <P> What if they gave a protest and nobody came?  </P> <P> Since Wednesday, hundreds of arts leaders, patrons and advocates from  throughout the state have been meeting in Los Angeles to discuss all manner of  burning issues as part of the "1990 Congress of the Arts," presented by the  California Confederation of the Arts, the state's largest nonprofit arts  advocacy group.  </P> <P> Among the panels that have been or will be covered are "Arts and the Global  Economy," "Beyond Disneyland: Getting California Arts on the International  Tourism Map," "The Arts and the New Governor" and "Arts and Disabilities: An  Agenda for the '90s." All are subjects you might expect to draw the interest of  at least some Orange County arts leaders.  </P> <P> One that looks especially inviting, though, is "The Fight for Freedom of  Expression." Not only have there been several clashes over arts and censorship  in Orange County that would seem to make such a seminar of interest to local  arts types, but the organizers said they planned to focus on recent incidents  in Costa Mesa, where irate citizens successfully persuaded the City Council to  attach anti-obscenity regulations to city arts grants.  </P> <P> Just one problem: Conference officials were nowhere near as successful in  trying to persuade certain artists from Costa Mesa to take part in the  discussion.  </P> <P> Now, I can understand why the local folks might not rush to a panel called  "International and Multicultural Festivals: What Works and What Doesn't." We  obviously have no need to take pointers from anyone on that front, still awash  as we are in the artistic euphoria, the creative afterglow spawned by the  recent Festival of Merchandising . . . er, Britain.  </P> <P> But county arts leaders must have memories shorter than a freshman senator's.  Have they forgotten so quickly about the storms set off by the Costa Mesa Civic  Playhouse's staging of Christopher Durang's satire, "Sister Mary Ignatius  Explains It All for You"? The La Habra Community Theatre board's refusal to let  a director cast an interracial "Romeo and Juliet" for fear of upsetting the  community? And how about the Grove Shakespeare Festival, which probably would  get the blessing of certain City Council members if only they dropped all of  that, you know, foreign stuff and staged a musical version of, say, "Wheel of  Fortune."  </P> <P> Confederation associate director Ken Larsen said he tried to involve officials  from the Costa Mesa Playhouse and from South Coast Repertory, who unexpectedly  found themselves on the censorship-sponsorship hot seat earlier this year.  Remember when a couple of city residents took exception to the SCR flyer urging  support for the National Endowment for the Arts?  </P> <P> The Playhouse is still thinking about attending, but SCR -- clearly Orange  County's big fish -- won't be there. Could there be a better victory for those  who would silence voices and opinions they'd rather not hear?  </P> <P> SCR's participation would have been especially significant because it is one of  the very few Orange County arts organizations that has achieved national  acclaim. Co-founder David Emmes, who turned the confederation down, wouldn't  have needed to bellow "we're mad as hell," but with force and dignity might  have let the rest of the state know that "we're not gonna take it anymore."  </P> <P> But Emmes says that his PR man didn't tell him what the panel was about and  that, anyway, we didn't have enough advance notice and we're awfully busy over  here right now so would you please stop bugging us?  </P> <P> The PR man, meanwhile, says he wasn't told that the invitation had anything to  do with a "Freedom of Expression" seminar, while Larsen swears he made that  perfectly clear.  </P> <P> Funny thing: Lots of others who were invited to the panel -- including Bella  Lewitzky, the acclaimed modern dance company director who's got to be at least  as busy as David Emmes, and Arts Democratic Club vice president Bruce W. Davis,  who's coming all the way from San Francisco -- managed to get the invitation  straight and found that it came in plenty of time for them to arrange their  schedules. But then, this wouldn't be the first time that Emmes has opted out  of the spotlight as far as controversy is concerned (see accompanying story).  </P> <P> In any case, with no Orange County representatives on this panel, the outside  perception will persist that this is a region where freedom is limited to which  credit card we use at Nordstrom, and self-expression is what follows the words  "My Other Car Is a . . ." on our BMW license plate frames.  </P> <P> Regardless of how busy SCR might be, it certainly should be able to find at  least one top official who could be sprung loose for a few hours to attend the  Saturday morning session. Undoubtedly, officials there are more than happy that  they wound up with their grant money safely in hand, and now would just as soon  forget the whole thing. But it's a mistake to play ostrich -- or is it opossum?  -- and then meekly hope that the opponents of free expression will turn their  attention elsewhere. It's crucial to show that an arts community won't be  intimidated by those who fear the unconventional, the unfamiliar, the  unsettling.  </P> <P> I hope circumstances don't arise in which SCR finds itself in need of  vociferous support of arts organizations outside of Orange County. It might  just hear the refrain of that great old country song, "When your phone don't  ring -- it'll be me."  </P></p>

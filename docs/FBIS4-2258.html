			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "Chinese Economic News" column: "New Import-Export </F> Regulations for Foreign-Invested Enterprises"]    [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation [MOFTEC] has recently formulated import-export  regulations for foreign-invested enterprises. The main contents  are as follows:    --According to the enterprise law regarding Sino-foreign  joint operations and relevant laws and regulations,  foreign-invested enterprises can only export the products they  produce themselves and import such machinery, equipment, raw and  semifinished materials, spare parts and components as they need  for their own production purposes. In addition to having  approval of the relevant quarters in accordance with the  provisions, they must not purchase or act as agents for the  products of another enterprise nor must they import commodities  for sale or exchange on the mainland.    --Where products exported by foreign-invested enterprises  require export licenses, they must be approved by MOFTEC and  their annual export volume must not exceed the licensed fiscal  export plan. No foreign-invested enterprise is allowed to  purchase export licenses from a foreign trade company for export  purposes. If such a deal is discovered, the buyer and the  seller will be penalized.    --Foreign exchange earned by the Chinese side of a  Sino-foreign joint venture or cooperative enterprise should be  settled and turned over to the higher authorities in strict  accordance with relevant regulations. It is necessary to  prevent some foreign-funded enterprises from retaining foreign  exchange by exporting through the foreign-invested enterprises  they have set up.    --When setting up, examining, and approving the  establishment  of foreign-invested enterprises, all localities should continue  to make it an important point to set up product exporting  enterprises, encourage and support enterprises to earn more  foreign exchange by increasing exports, to attain a balance of  foreign exchange income and expenditure, and to increase  gradually the numbers of homemade raw and semifinished materials  and spare parts and components exported.</p>

Samsonov considers as their prototype the peacekeepers in  Tajikistan, which include armed units from Russia, Uzbekistan  and Kyrgyzstan.    Addressing in Moscow a news conference, Samsonov said that  the CIS countries see for themselves that no one state can  ensure military security independently. Samsonov drew the  attention to the fact that at the CIS summit in Ashgabat,  Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Belarus joined the treaty on collective  security which was earlier signed by six CIS countries.    Samsonov praised Ukraine's growing interest to problems of  collective security. Though the country did not sign the  documents, it said it was going to consider its possible  involvement in the collective security system.    Samsonov has called as one of the main results of the CIS  Defense Ministers' Council meeting in Ashgabat the annulment of  the chief command of the CIS Armed Forces and the creation of  the staff for coordinating CIS military cooperation. Samsonov  said that among the staff's tasks is the coordination of the CIS  Defense Ministries' efforts for organizing and developing of the  CIS armed forces, coordination of efforts to organize a system  of air defense, as well as problems associated with the border  guard of the Tajik-Afghan border.</p>

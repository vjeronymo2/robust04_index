			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WATER DILEMMA  </P> <P> Water is something most Southern Californians take for granted -- until it is  taken away, as it has been in Santa Barbara ("Drought Law Bans Watering Grass,"  March 1).  </P> <P> The reality is: California is in its fourth consecutive drought-condition year.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara's strict water enforcement rules are indicative of the type of  measure that all of Southern California will need to adopt in a severe water  crisis.  </P> <P> We can still enjoy our green lawns, plants and flowers if we embrace simple  conservation efforts (taking shorter showers, alternating days for outdoor  irrigation, running full loads of laundry and dishes). Water re-use  (reclamation) is a viable alternative to using valuable drinking water for our  golf courses, parks and freeway medians.  </P> <P> HARRIETT M. WIEDER  </P> <P> Supervisor, 2nd District  </P> <P> Trustee, Southern California  </P> <P> Water Committee  </P></p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Ruling may save Names up to Pounds 17m MORE THAN 400 Names (members of Lloyd's) on the troubled Pulbrook syndicate 90 may save as much as Pounds 17m as a result of a ruling yesterday by an independent arbitrator on the validity of a Lloyd's reinsurance run-off contract placed by the syndicate in 1982 with another Lloyd's syndicate. The Names have already paid losses of more than Pounds 34m (just over 200 per cent of the stamp capacity) for the 'open' 1982 year of account but still face further potential losses of up to Pounds 90m. Last week 306 Pulbrook 90 Names served writs against the syndicate's managing agents, Names' members' agents and brokers, alleging that negligence was responsible for their losses. The Names' losses would have been increased by 50 per cent had the arbitration case gone against Pulbrook. The disputed reinsurance contract covered US liabilities insured by Pulbrook before 1974. Claims on such so-called 'long-tail' policies arise many years after the policy inception. Pulbrook 90, now owned by Merrett Underwriting Agencies, was a leading underwriter of such insurances in Lloyd's in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Claims from asbestosis victims have led to huge losses on the policies. Meacock syndicate 727, which wrote 20 per cent of the reinsurance policy in January 1982, contested its validity on the ground that there had been material non-disclosure by Pulbrook. Sir Michael Kerr, QC, the arbitrator, ruled that a run-off reinsurance contract placed with two groups of Lloyd's syndicates was valid. Outhwaite syndicate 317/661, which wrote 50 per cent of the run-off policy, had agreed a settlement outside the arbitration procedure. Pulbrook was unable to place the remaining 30 per cent of the policy.</p>

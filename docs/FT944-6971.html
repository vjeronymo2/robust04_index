			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / How to Spend It: A brush with the professionals Perfect as a present for the would-be sophisticate is a set of make-up brushes. Anyone who has ever had a professional make-up knows that brushes are the basic tools. Maggie Hunt, one of Britain's leading make-up artists, creator of looks for Naomi Campbell, the Princess of Wales et al, has put together a set of brushes, each designed to do a specific job. To the uninitiated, 11 different brushes may seem a trifle excessive, but Maggie Hunt is convinced that the properly made-up face requires them all - from eyebrows to complexions, from lips to eye shading, brushes are the way to get the truly finished look. Handles are of painted wood, the hair fine quality and a set costs Pounds 95, including a smart leather wallet. A leaflet with a step-by-step guide shows the professional way to use them. Available from Harrods and by post (Pounds 2 extra for mail order) from Lion Brush, Planet Place, Killingworth, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE12 0RZ. Tel: 091-268 2288.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: BA files new USAir investment agreement BRITISH Airways, which earlier this year invested Dollars 300m in USAir in return for a potential 19.9 per cent stake, last night filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission details of its revised investment agreement, writes Nikki Tait in New York. The new SEC filing runs to around 300 pages, and will be subject to minute scrutiny by lawyers for the big US airlines - American, United, and Delta - who are opposed to the BA-USAir deal. It was the small print contained in an earlier Dollars 750m investment proposal between BA and USAir - in particular, certain 'negative control' provisions - which allowed the 'big three' US carriers to lobby successfully against that transaction. Last night, lawyers for the leading US carriers had yet to receive copies of the new filing and were unable to comment on it. However, the wording in the current document is considerably more complex than in last year's investment agreement and, from a legal standpoint, BA's advisors appear to have crafted the revised transaction so as to minimise the possible resistance. Even so, there will be hurdles. Earlier in the day, for example, the US carriers petitioned the US Department of Transportation, noting that the new transaction appeared to envisage BA's having three board seats at USAir - a figure confirmed by last night's filing - and warning that the deal could restrict USAir's future ability to issue new securities in cash-raising moves. This, said the US carriers, could prevent USAir from taking truly independent decisions, and 'enhance BA's grip' over USAir. The new investment agreement does, indeed, give BA certain pre-emptive rights if USAir issues new securities.</p>

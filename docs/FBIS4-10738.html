			<p>BFN     [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff yesterday asked  the Congress of the Republic to investigate him, if it suspects  he has cooperated with drug trafficking, as charged by some  persons. Among the accusers are U.S. Senator John Kerry and  U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.    The high-ranking judicial official also requested the  Executive Branch to create the necessary conditions for harmonic  cooperation in the struggle against drug trafficking. This is  the reason he held a meeting yesterday with Attorney General  Carlos Gustavo Arrieta.    De Greiff, during a news conference upon his return from  abroad, said that Colombia is possibly giving in to pressure  from U.S. officials and one senator. In this regard, the  prosecutor gave as an example the letter that Gabriel Silva,  Colombia's ambassador to the United States, sent to Senator John  Kerry in which he explains the Executive Branch's position on  the surrender policy to justice. In addition, he indicates that  the government "opposes the surrender of drug traffickers under  conditions inconsistent with their level of criminal guilt."  Meanwhile it suggests that De Greiff seeks the opposite by  indicating that the prosecutor's opinions are not those of the  Executive Branch.    Regarding this matter De Greiff said: "When, how, and where  has the Prosecutor General's Office or specifically the  prosecutor general sought something different? Quietly but  firmly I ask those who have been involved in episodes to present  any evidence they may have on this. Furthermore, I ask the  competent institutions, in this case the Congress, to  investigate if it is true or not that the prosecutor general has  cooperated with drug trafficking, as is published in the same  daily that invented the wanted pardon or amnesty (for the drug  traffickers who surrender to justice)."    In addition, the prosecutor general said that to strive for  the cooperation from another nation to be received with the  commitment to previously consult with the cooperating nation, on  the use it will give to the evidence supplied or on the legal  measures that these could justify, would be an attack on  sovereignty. "I have been and I am in favor of the nations'  legal cooperation with Colombia in my country's solitary or  practically solitary struggle against the drug trafficking  scourge. However, this has to take place within the bases of  respect for sovereignty, and fundamentally within the parameters  of independence in the Judicial Branch and in keeping with the  constitutional and legal provisions on the matter," De Greiff  said.    The prosecutor, referring to a letter he sent to a U.S.  judge, in which it is indicated that in Colombia there is no  evidence that Dandenys Munoz Mosquera, alias "La Quica," was  involved in the Avianca airplane explosion, he said that this  was distorted by some media. De Greiff said that all he pursued  with that letter was for that nation's judicial official to be  informed of some facts relevant to a decision he should have or  would have to make, but in no case did he attempt to mediate for  any specific individual.    To defend his action, the prosecutor general based his  procedure on a court decision issued by the Constitutional Court  that states: "the omission of a judicial action on which is  based the exercise of a fundamental right escapes all  justification and de-naturalizes the legal aspect, turning it  into a mere exercise of power in the abnormal exercise of  jurisdictional duty."    Meanwhile, De Greiff announced a new tone in his relations  with the media given that "some media with criteria I do not  want to label -- that everyone should label according to his  conscious and his heart, as Dr. Eduardo Santos used to say --  have interpreted in their own fashion the measures that in given  cases the prosecutor general has taken, and what is even worse,  they have distorted them..." For this reason, the high-ranking  judicial official announced that from now on he would  communicate with the media in writing in the briefest form  possible and through press communiques.    The prosecutor general also made reference to the situation  of the bishops who allegedly have cooperated with the  guerrillas. In this regard he said "it is not true that the  Prosecutor General's Office has voiced its opinion on its  agreement or disagreement on the testimonies of cooperation with  subversive groups."</p>

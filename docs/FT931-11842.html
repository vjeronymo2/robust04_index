			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Letter: Privatisation supporters slow to back plans for British Rail Sir, It will be interesting to see whether, as a consequence of your leader on rail privatisation ('Privatising British Rail', January 26), others will be encouraged to come forward to join the 'few faint voices of support' for the government's proposals. Certainly, it is most strange that none of the plethora of eminent merchant bankers and management consultants who have been proudly 'privatising the world' has shown any strong inclination to lend their support. Possibly, they are all too busy advising the Department of Transport, British Rail, prospective bidders et al. Alternatively, previous experience of providing advice overseas on rail privatisation may have proved a chastening experience, particularly to those who have accepted work on a success fee basis. My own consultancy experience ranges from Serpell to the High Speed link, as well as foreign privatisation plans. Such a track record reflects a well-worn advisory path from the lack of political will to address BR's problems by internal re-organisation in the early 1980s, to the eventual failure of the much-heralded public/private sector Eurorail joint venture in the face of the government's unwillingness to provide a subsidy. This despite the private sector's ability to provide significant capital investment funding. Given the government's current willingness to provide subsidies to prospective operators without seeking any commitment to new investment, are we about to see the spectacle of the High Speed link saga entering a new phase? With the ever-changing policies to British Rail, it may well be that the reticent government supporters are just too giddy to put pen to paper.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.101(a) would indicate that provisional applications filed under &sect;1.53(b)(2) would not be examined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.102(d) would have the reference to &sect;1.17(i)(2) replaced with a reference to &sect;1.17(i) to be consistent with the proposed change to &sect;1.17. No substantive change is intended by this proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.103(a) would have the reference to &sect;1.17(i)(1) replaced with a reference to &sect;1.17(i) to be consistent with the proposed changed to &sect;1.17. No substantive change is intended by this proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.129 would be added to set forth the procedure for implementing certain transitional provisions contained in S. 2467 and H.R. 5110. These transitional provisions are not applicable to any application which is filed on or after the effective date of 35 U.S.C. 154(a)(2) or to any design or reissue application. Paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;1.129 would provide for limited reexamination in certain applications pending for 2 years or longer as of the effective date of 35 U.S.C. 154(a)(2), taking into account any reference to any earlier application under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c). Under the proposed procedure, an applicant would be entitled to have a first submission entered and considered on the merits after final rejection if (1) the submission is filed prior to or simultaneously with the filing of a notice of appeal and prior to abandonment of the application and (2) the $730.00 feet set forth in proposed &sect;1.17(r) is paid within one month of any written notification from the Office refusing entry of the first submission and prior to abandonment of the application. If applicant complies with the requirements of the proposed rule, the finality of the previous rejection would be withdrawn and the submission would be entered and considered on the merits to the extent that the submission would have been considered if made prior to final rejection. The subsequent Office action could be made final under existing Office practice. If a subsequent final rejection is made in the application, applicant would be entitled to have a second submission entered and considered on the merits under the same conditions set forth for consideration of the first submission. Paragraph (a) would also define the term ``submission'' as including, but not limited to, an information disclosure statement, an amendment to the written description, claims or drawings and a new substantive argument or new evidence in support of patentability. For example, the submission may include an amendment, a new substantive argument and an information disclosure statement. In view of the $730.00 fee required in proposed &sect;1.17(r), any information disclosure statement previously refused consideration in the application because of applicant's failure to provide the certification under &sect;1.97(e) or to pay the fee set forth in &sect;1.17(p) or which is filed as part of either the first or second submission would be treated as though it had been filed within one of the time periods set forth in &sect;1.97(b) and would be considered without the petition and petition fee required in &sect;1.97(d), if it complies with the requirements of &sect;1.98. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;1.129 would provide for examination of more than one independent and distinct invention in certain applications pending for 3 years or longer as of the effective date of 35 U.S.C. 154(a)(2), taking into account any reference to any earlier application under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c). Under the proposed procedure, a requirement for restriction or for the filing of divisional applications would only be made or maintained in the application after the effective date of 35 U.S.C. 154(a)(2) if: (1) The requirement was made in the application or in an earlier application relied on under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c) more than two months prior to the effective date; (2) the examiner has not issued any Office action in the application due to actions by the applicant; or (3) the required fee for examination of each additional invention was not paid. If the application contains claims to more than one independent and distinct invention, and no requirement for restriction or for the filing of divisional applications can be made or maintained as a result of proposed &sect;1.129(b), applicant will be notified and given a one month time period to pay the $730.00 fee set forth in proposed &sect;1.17(s) for each independent and distinct invention claimed in the application in excess of one. The fee set forth in proposed &sect;1.17(s) would not be subject to the 50 percent reduction for a small entity. The additional inventions for which the required fee under &sect;1.17(s) has not been paid would be withdrawn from consideration under &sect;1.142(b). An applicant who desires examination of an invention so withdrawn from consideration can file a divisional application under 35 U.S.C. 121. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.139 would be added to set forth the procedures for reviving a provisional application where the delay was unavoidable or unintentional. Paragraph (a) would address the revival of a provisional application where the delay was unavoidable and paragraph (b) would address the revival of a provisional application where the delay was unintentional. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

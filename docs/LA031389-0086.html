			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> ONE-SIDED RACE FOR MAYOR LEAVES A VOID ON ISSUES  </P> <P> In the first weeks of the mayoral competition, the major questions facing Los  Angeles have not been reflected in the one-sided campaign.  </P> <P> The big-picture issues -- citywide growth, a gangs policy, economic disparity  between affluent and poor -- are discussed in community meetings centered on  neighborhood problems. And when candidates take a citywide view, the only  people who hear them are those civic-minded few who attend the neighborhood  forums.  </P> <P> In addition, the lack of television news coverage and of TV commercials --  those roundly condemned communications devices -- seems to have left a void.  The campaign seems more like an election for City Council than for chief  executive of the nation's second-most populous city.  </P> <P> Simplistic and slanted as they can be, the commercials have the effect of  dramatizing the issues to the electorate and presenting them in a citywide  context.  </P> <P> Thus the scenes of the election do not fit the city, this self-proclaimed  Pacific Rim center, home of the entertainment business, working place of the  most sophisticated mass communications experts, cutting edge capital of trend.  </P> <P> With not a television camera in sight, for example, Mayor Tom Bradley opened  his Crenshaw campaign headquarters in a storefront, packed with many of the  same, loyal supporters who have been with him since he was a city councilman in  the 1960s.  </P> <P> It was a revealing episode, but witnessed by only about 200. Bradley was not  the stiff, formal character of most of his public appearances. Rather, he was  relaxed, enjoying the comfortable surroundings, thoroughly a part of the  middle-class black neighborhood where he had raised his family.  </P> <P> Magnificent Montague, a famed black disc jockey, was master of ceremonies. The  mayor recalled Montague's famous phrase, "Burn, Baby, Burn."  </P> <P> "This was the hottest DJ in L.A.," the mayor said, standing on a small platform  in a crowded room. "But after his slogan 'Burn, Baby, Burn' seared across the  city and somehow had been associated with the Watts uprising . . . Montague  decided he'd better move on."  </P> <P> Here, where many of Bradley's generation refer to Watts, 1965, as the uprising  rather than the riots, the mayor, with no high-powered electronic press corps  recording him, spoke as if he shared their view of that historic event.  </P> <P> Earlier that Saturday, in a small church hall in South-Central Los Angeles, the  Equal Rights Congress, a community action group, held a forum for mayoral  candidates for an audience of about 50.  </P> <P> Bradley was not there. But some of the others were. Chevron oil worker Joel  Britton, the Socialist Worker Party candidate, spoke. Perennial candidate  Eileen Anderson sang "Danny Boy."  </P> <P> So was former Los Angeles County Supervisor Baxter Ward, running without funds,  who spends much of his time sitting at a typewriter in his San Fernando Valley  home writing letters to council members and reporters with his campaign  thoughts. He roundly condemned the major candidates for accepting campaign  contributions.  </P> <P> City Councilman Nate Holden drove up to the hall alone.  </P> <P> "We need a change," he said, after joining the others on stage. "We need it  now. We all did support Tom Bradley, but 16 years is enough."  </P> <P> The scene outside the church told of two big-picture problems, dwindling  low-cost housing and the need for more schools for a growing immigrant  population with many children.  </P> <P> Signs on old Los Angeles bungalows, occupied by families who could lose their  homes to construction of a badly needed elementary school, read: "Home Not For  Sale."  </P> <P> Gerry Silver of the Equal Rights Congress said the lack of a citywide debate on  such issues is not good. "I think it is disappointing," she said of what, so  far, seems to be an election without close competition.  </P> <P> The city had been braced for a more competitive campaign, but Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky, the best-funded contender, dropped out after months of organizing  and of voicing strong criticism of the Bradley Administration.  </P> <P> After Yaroslavsky's withdrawal, Bradley, as he opened the campaign, indicated  that the absence of intense competition could improve the quality of political  debate.  </P> <P> "Freed from narrow political concerns, we are free to see more clearly and to  set directions that can take us far beyond the dead ends of political trench  warfare," he said.  </P> <P> He listed the issues he would discuss: gangs and drugs, day care, affordable  housing, easing traffic congestion, and improving education. So far, he has not  gone much beyond that speech.  </P> <P> In his defense, Bradley aides said he has already announced a detailed traffic  improvement program, begun shuttling city funds to day care and has proposed a  program to use money from downtown development to build more housing that  low-income people can afford.  </P> <P> Bradley is strongly in favor of encouraging foreign investment in the city and  has said those who express fear of too much Japanese investment are guilty of  racism against Asians.  </P> <P> Holden is a nationalist, reflecting the fears of some of his poorer black  constituents that immigration and foreign investment is costing them jobs.  </P> <P> Holden criticizes the Police Department's handling of gang violence and drugs.  "If we had better support from the Police Department, the gangs would not be  out of control," he told the community forum at the church.  </P> <P> Bradley says it differently: "Los Angeles is ready -- to drive the gangs, their  violence and drugs out of our community," he said in his campaign opener. "And  together we will deploy a police force large enough to do the job."  </P> <P> Holden, although short of money, is making plans to take his message citywide.  He has opened headquarters on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Bradley is expected to intensify his efforts. But he is also pursuing the  traditional tactic of the heavily favored incumbent -- ignore the opposition.  </P> <P> As a result, this is a campaign that may never leave the church halls and  storefronts.  </P></p>

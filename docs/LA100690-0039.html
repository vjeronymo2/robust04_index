			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELP IS ON WAY, LONG BEACH'S CHIEF TELLS HIS OFFICERS  </P> <P> Responding to state crime statistics that show his officers trailing badly in  solving many serious crimes, Long Beach Police Chief Lawrence Binkley said  Friday that the department has been grossly neglected for 15 years but that  "help is on the way."  </P> <P> The controversial 49-year-old chief acknowledged the crime figures are  "staggering," but said the department has been saddled with broken equipment,  an outdated police lab and skeleton staffing for years.  </P> <P> There are about 1.7 police for every 1,000 citizens in Long Beach, compared to  2.6 per thousand in Los Angeles, Binkley said. The result, he conceded, is  showing up in the latest California Department of Justice statistics that  monitor the performance of police departments.  </P> <P> According to the statistics, Long Beach police trailed nine major cities in  California in solving rapes, robberies and burglaries. For all major crimes  combined, Long Beach police solved 14% -- a performance worse than any of the  cities surveyed from Sacramento to San Diego.  </P> <P> But Binkley said the addition of 43 sheriff's deputies to assist the  beleaguered department and several academy recruits due to arrive by November  will help his 650 officers and detectives "march back up" to fight a relentless  crime wave.  </P> <P> "Long Beach has some of the finest police detectives anywhere in the nation. .  . . There are just not enough of them," Binkley said. "And the victims are the  citizens and the cops -- who really are great cops."  </P> <P> The city has arranged for the sheriff's deputies to begin patrolling the north  end of town in November, freeing dozens of local officers to concentrate on  other parts of the city. That assistance also will reduce the workload in the  detective bureau by 20%, Binkley said.  </P> <P> "I anticipate nothing but better policing in this city," Binkley said.  </P> <P> Detectives complained in recent interviews of being so overworked that rape  cases can sit as long as six months on a desk without attention. Although the  detective team has a first-rate reputation with the district attorney's office,  prosecutors say some cases are lost in trial, dismissed or plea bargained away  because the investigators are too stretched to do a thorough job.  </P> <P> Some critics have complained that Binkley's tough management style has driven  morale to the ground, further crippling a department already struggling with a  bare-bones budget and a staff to match.  </P> <P> Binkley said he was hired three years ago to bring the department into the era  of modern policing. When he arrived, he said, he found detectives' cars that  wouldn't start and radios that were out of date. The narcotics team had no  cellular phones, and some detectives were without bullet-proof vests. The  helicopters, he said, were worn out, having flown 16 hours a day for 20 years.  </P> <P> The chief said he persuaded the city to hire 166 more officers. Even so, the  department remains at the same staffing level it was at 10 years ago. Binkley  also recently won two new helicopters, ordered hours of tough training and  imposed strict discipline. He said he doesn't expect to be liked for all of it.  </P> <P> "Any time you have an organization that has been neglected as long as this  police department has, the officers will get angry. And they are angry at their  chief," he said. "But they'll get over it.  </P> <P> "What I really demand is that they work hard and treat the citizens well. If  they don't like that, they should go someplace else."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, city officials reacted to the figures with some astonishment.  </P> <P> "I was surprised and disappointed. We should have done better," said Mayor  Ernie Kell. "But we are getting the situation under control."  </P> <P> "These are just devastating comparisons," said City Councilman Les Robbins, who  also is a sergeant with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "This is  an indictment of the entire organization. I don't see how anybody, from the  chief on down, can say 'It ain't my fault.' Everyone has to share in some of  the blame for this."  </P> <P> Some officers have expressed concern that importing sheriff's deputies to  protect a city that has been in the hands of a local police department for 84  years is the beginning of the end for the Long Beach station.  </P> <P> But Binkley stressed that it is just a reprieve to help the department bounce  back. "If there is an increase in policing as we march back up, they will all  be a lot happier," he said.  </P></p>

In a news conference held in the premises of the  government-controlled Sudanese News Agency in Khartoum  yesterday, al-Turabi said: "You know I am not a liar. I swear  that the NIF, which is called a national front, does not exist  as an organization in the regime at present, either secretly or  publicly."    Answering a question put by AL-HAYAH, he revealed that a  reconciliation is being conducted between "the ruling authority  and the popular groups." He said that leaders of the Sudanese  parties are excluded from this reconciliation, pointing out that  "the government always has opened its doors to anyone who joined  the salvation efforts to rescue the country from its past  predicament."    Al-Turabi also revealed that he is making contacts with  several quarters before traveling to Afghanistan in a bid to  achieve reconciliation among the parties to the conflict in  Kabul.    He pointed out that among these quarters are the Islamic  Salvation Front in Algeria and several European states,  including France.    Commenting on the expulsion of British Ambassador Peter  Streams from Sudan, he said: "A number of Western ambassadors  to Khartoum told me that Ambassador Streams used to vehemently  attack Sudan in their meetings. And perhaps the government was  very patient with him. But it is completely unacceptable for  him to insult it to the point of forcing Sudan's guest  (Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey) to enter the country by  the back door." He went on: "Britain has realized the mistake  of its ambassador and that of the archbishop of Canterbury."</p>

He  declined to name the countries, but he pointedly refused to include France and  Syria among the stalwart supporters of U.S. policy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diplomatic Front:  </P> <P> Arab leaders in the Persian Gulf met to iron out differences over how tough a  line to take with Baghdad. Some of the six Gulf Cooperation Council leaders  said peace should be given more time before implementing the U.N. resolution  authorizing use of force after Jan. 15.  </P> <P> Kuwaiti leaders reportedly refused to talk with Iraq until it has withdrawn  from Kuwait, but some other nations wanted to discuss giving Iraq use of two  Kuwaiti islands.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Domestic Front:  </P> <P> Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell predicted that Congress would deny  President Bush "blank-check authorization" to attack Iraq after Jan. 15.  Mitchell said Congress must consider the ramifications of using force, saying,  for example, that if Iraq countered U.S. force by attacking Israel, Syria would  likely switch sides to join Iraq.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deaths of U.S. military personnel in Operation Desert Shield:  </P> <P> * Sailors from carrier Saratoga drowned: 21  </P> <P> * Other deaths in Desert Shield: 57  </P> <P> * Total: 78  </P></p>

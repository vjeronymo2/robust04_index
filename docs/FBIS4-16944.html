			<p>BFN     [Text] In adopting the decision to join the CIS, the  Chisinau parliament reconfirmed the criminal Molotov-Ribbentrop  pact and annulled the essential right of the Romanian nation for  the integrity of its historic and spiritual territory, says the  statement of the chamber of the Romanian parliament's deputies  published by the newspaper Tsara, an organ of the Christian  Democratic Popular Front of Moldova.    The statement points out that in 1812 and 1940 Bessarabia  was  torn from its homeland by means of agreements between various  powers and despite the will of the Romanian people.    "The events which took place in 1989 and later made us  hopeful that Bessarabia would be re-unified with its  motherland," asserted the Romanian parliamentarians and said  that the USSR Supreme Soviet had called the Molotov-Ribbentrop  pact "which tore Bessarabia from Romania in 1940" invalid.    The chamber also gave its backing to Moldova's efforts to be  integrated into European structures and "condemns actions of  political forces trying to again include Moldova into the  previous structures."</p>

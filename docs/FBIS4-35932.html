			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just received the following: A short while  ago, AFP cited an official in Sanaa as saying that a cease-fire  will be announced in the next few hours. The northern Yemeni  official, who asked to remain anonymous, said: The cease-fire  announcement, which will be issued by the Presidential Council  in Yemen, will come in harmony with the Sanaa government's  acceptance of the Security Council resolution, calling for a  cease-fire. The northern Yemeni official added: Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is currently holding contacts  with the Defense Ministry and the command of the Army units to  take the necessary measures to achieve a cease-fire in Yemen.</p>

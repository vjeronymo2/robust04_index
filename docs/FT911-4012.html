			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Technological Achievement 1991: Draught taste to take home - Guinness IT MAY not rank with the ring-pull; it may even sound like a contradiction. But to one brewer, it represents a revolution in packaging: draught beer from a can. Just 30 years ago, Guinness drinkers were faced with change. The dark brew they had only been able to buy in bottles was suddenly available in their local pub on tap. It was the dawn of a new era. Pressurised pumps were being introduced, allowing barrels of beer to be rapidly disgorged into glasses. Gas mixed with the beer as it churned out of the tap through a series of tiny nozzles, causing tiny bubbles to rise to the surface and form a creamy head. Experienced bar staff could carve shamrocks out of the thick foam that gathered at the top of the glass. But then things changed once more. Drinkers began to abandon the pub for parties and solitary sips in their own homes. Demand for 'take-home' beer grew sharply, to the extent that the market is now worth Pounds 1.5bn a year. How could Guinness keep their 7m drinkers around the world content and prevent them switching to one of the rival 300 brands of canned beer? How could they sustain the volume of one million Guinness pints pulled each day? The company spent Pounds 5m and five years working on a solution. It applied for a patent and launched the result in mid-1988: a beer called Draught Guinness, packaged in the 'in-can system', a can with a special bubble-generating device sealed inside. A plastic moulded ring with a small hole in it sits at the bottom of each can. As the beer is poured in, the oxygen is removed and extra nitrogen added, so that the pressure inside the can exceeds the atmospheric pressure outside. Once the can is sealed, the internal pressure forces beer and gas into the ring at the bottom. When it is opened, the beer and gas is forced back out through the hole, creating a stream of bubbles which rise to form the head on the beer, just as with a draught pint. Three years later, as Guinness Brewing Worldwide accepts its Queen's Award for Technological Advancement, it considers the design a success. The award reflects the introduction of a 'genuine innovation to the beer market', according to managing director Mr Brian Baldock. Some 120m cans of Guinness Draught have been sold, making it the sixth best take-home variety by value on the market. Current sales are estimated to be Pounds 45m a year. There have been a series of minor modifications to both the technology and the production of the draught can since it was first introduced, although the company is coy about revealing details. Drinkers have also had to learn the importance of preparing the beer before serving: keeping it chilled in a refrigerator for at least two hours before opening. Canned Guinness Original, without the head created by the new device, retains a larger market share than the draught. The original, a spokesman explains, has a slightly more bitter taste, while the draught variety appeals to newer converts to the Guinness brews and younger drinkers. The company refuses to comment on current research projects and future plans. Nevertheless, it has been keenly watching the market for bitter, which makes up 50 per cent of beer sales in pubs but only 30 per cent of those in cans. Guinness has begun test marketing a new canned draft bitter using the same 'in-can' system. Trials began in several UK regions last month. 'We are actively considering the potential of other markets', says Mr Baldock.</p>

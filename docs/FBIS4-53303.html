			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh at </F> the second session of the first National Assembly in Phnom Penh  on 16 May -- recorded]    [Text] Permit me to pay my respects to the samdech  chairman of the National Assembly, their excellencies the vice  chairmen, excellencies, and mesdames. First of all, I would  like to express thanks on behalf of our Royal Government of  Cambodia [RGC] for the support just given by their excellencies  and mesdames to the RGC's plan to redress our national economy.  Besides, the RGC promises to to take for further study any  well-founded suggestions you made to take concrete measures for  their implementation.    As for the issue of our forests, which constitute one of the  nation's resources, the RGC has given this maximum attention  because not only does this issue affect the environment of the  nation as a whole, but it also concerns the survival and future  of Cambodia itself. The RGC has already decided to impose a  moratorium on the export of both whole logs and processed logs  from the Kingdom of Cambodia as of 1 April 1994.    The madame representing the commission concerned just now  talked about the import-export imbalance, and there is also an  imbalance in the national budget, which normally relies on tax  income from our rice, rubber, and log export, especially during  the times of Sangkum Reas Niyum. At the present, however, we  are not in any position to export, say, our rice of which we  even experience a serious shortage. As for our rubber, it can  be exported but does not generate enough revenue. So, only our  forests remain the main resource.    I would like, therefore, to remind the National Assembly  that  when UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] was here, it  advised us to stop exporting our logs. Now, when the time has  come for it to provide us with aid to fill our national coffer,  when it heard that we would impose a log export moratorium,  UNTAC tried to dissuade us from doing that. It said: Where  would you get the money you need; why not sell your trees to get  money for your budget?    Moreover, in his capacity as a member of the RGC, the state  minister in charge of finance and economy [Sam Rangsi] supports  the RGC's stance on the log export ban, while in his capacity as  the minister in charge of finance and economy, he too has some  reservations.    Thirdly, it should be noted that no new trees have been  felled. Considerable amounts of already felled logs are lying in  huge piles all over the country. If we do not take appropriate  measures to deal with them, they can only rot and go to waste.  This log export ban is prompted by the RGC's plan to divert the  export of raw material into local production. This would  generate, first, employment and, second, what you called the  added values [two preceding words in French] to our natural  resources. However, because of the shortage in capital  investments, our internal markets cannot cope with the excessive  quantities of the decomposing timber. For this reason, while the  RGC continues to maintain the log export ban, all ministries  concerned should survey the quantities of the already felled  trees. Although the RGC continues to uphold the export ban,  some exporters will always be permitted to export logs just as  pointed out by His Excellency [H.E.] Son Chhai [MP, Siem Reap  constituency].    Briefly, the RGC must face many major issues. The first  issue is the question of protecting the nation's environment.  The second issue is the question of national budget, which is  experiencing a serious imbalance or the question of trade  imbalance. Currently, in our state the national budget relies  mainly on tax income. So, in this regard, we do not have any  objection to H.E. Son Chhai's call to increase the severity of  the punishment. However, this issue has already been dealt with  by law. Yet, should our National Assembly deem it necessary to  pursue this matter by adding that provision, the RGC has no  objection. We merely ask that more appropriate wording be  reached. This is because just saying "to consolidate the  Forestry and Wildlife Department" and adding "by meting out an  urgent punishment" seems to be mismatched phrasing. Therefore,  I ask the commission or H.E. [Planning Minister] Chea Chanto on  behalf of the RGC to rearrange this sentence so that it includes  the two conditions -- to consolidate the department and increase  the severity of punishment -- to fight this crime. So, the RGC  only asks for a rewording. Other than that, as a question of  principle, the RGC has no objection.    H.E. Son Chhai also talked about the issue of specialists. I  would like to inform all of you that the RGC has asked France  and France has responded by sending their specialists to help  the RGC compile a forestry and wildlife code to ensure a correct  logging and reforestration policy that would conform with the  nation's needs as well as the international norms and laws  observed in other countries.    Once more I would like to inform you, excellencies and  mesdames, that the RGC is paying maximum attention in line with  the august idea of our revered king concerning the protection of  our nation's natural resources and environment as part of our  efforts to ensure the future of Cambodia, the future of our  younger generations.    I take this opportunity, in my capacity as the first prime  minister, to make some observations on the points just raised in  its report by the commission.    First, on the assertion that the imbalance between  production  and consumption is a major problem that the entire national  community must confront and solve and particularly the assertion  that this imbalance is essentially caused by the insufficient  means of production, the low level of technology, and the lack  in human resource, I would like to inform you, excellencies and  mesdames, that the RGC has a plan to ask the Education Ministry  to change the aim of our national education. We must emulate  post-World War II Germany, which needed labor to meet its  national reconstruction needs. Therefore, the RGC will order  the ministry concerned -- namely, the Ministry of Education --  to give priority to setting up vocational institutes. After  finishing secondary education, our students should be diverted  to receive at least three years of vocational training. If we  fail to do that, if we continue to encourage our students to  further their study in colleges or universities, we will surely  have graduates in the forms of engineers, scholars, and doctors  with substandard academic degrees. In real life, these graduates  will be incapable of finding jobs although many investors have  vacancies to fill. So, there will be a serious social problem  in the future, and we will not be able to meet the demands of  our nation. For this reason, the RGC once again asks the  Education Ministry to effect a reorientation. Let us compare  Germany and France. France at this moment is experiencing a  serious unemployment problem whereas Germany is able to solve  this same problem. So is Japan. Japan and Germany after the  war took the correct steps in national educaction.    Based on this reasoning, the RGC will ask friendly countries  who wish to help us to do so by creating as many institutes as  possible for vocational training to meet the demands of the  country and the needs of foreign investors. If we can provide  only what they call low-skilled labor, Cambodia will remain poor  forever while our neighbors will prosper. For this reason, we  must start with producing the so-called low-skilled labor first  and in the very short future we must have the ability to produce  the so-called finished-skilled labor before reaching the state  of labor category achieved by Singapore, which is called  high-tech labor.    Nonetheless, we are able to provide the low-skilled labor  now. Cambodia has very great potential. It has been said that  the cheapest labor in Southeast Asia can be found in Indonesia,  where the lowest wage is $68 to $70 a month. In Cambodia, our  monthly wage is only $35 to $40. So, our labor is the cheapest.  It is almost half of what is earned in Indonesia. For this  reason, we must attract as many foreign invesments as possible.    Regarding this investment issue raised by the commission,  the  RGC has already drafted a bill on investment in Cambodia. The  RGC will submit this bill for cabinet approval and will submit  it for the National Assembly's scrutiny and passage as soon as  possible. I met with foreign diplomats and major would-be  investors. They clearly told us that our current problem is not  the Khmer Rouge. What stops them from coming in now is the  absence in our country of a legal investment law. We have  created distrust in them. So, they have proposed that we pass  an investment law as soon as possible. We have already drafted  such a bill, and some of those foreign experts to whom we have  submitted it for examination have assured us that if such an  investment law is promulgated, we will be the star of Asia  [preceding three words in English]. We have drawn up this  investment law with outside help. We have modeled it after the  laws of many other countries. We also studied the stipulations  of the IMF. We have made it better than others. If we do not  do that, no one -- no major investor -- will come to invest in  our country. They would rather go to Vietnam. For this reason,  the National Assembly will have to study and pass this  investment law as soon as possible. The investors have told us  they are not afraid of the Khmer Rouge. If they have not yet  come in it is because no investmment law is in effect.  Furthermore, they have told us that Cambodia is too slow in  making decisions. Who is responsible for making these  decisions? Some firms have submitted their applications as long  as 18 months ago already. These are major firms such as  Germany's Siemens and others. We keep holding endless  discussions and debates on their applications. So, it is not  the question of insecurity but the question of our lack of an  investment law, lack of sufficient guarantees, and lack of  ability to make prompt decisions. If we continue to be as  deficient as we are now, no countries will have the patience to  wait; they will surely take their investments elsewhere. This  is a point that I would like to impress upon you.    Moreover, concerning this investment matter, sometimes it is  smart to ignore a few insignificant mistakes committed by the  investors. We must not hesitate to let major firms of  international standing, those coming from big countries, proceed  with their investments in our country even if to a small extent  they affect our own interests. In the long run, Cambodia can  only benefit from such companies. For example, if major firms  from America, France, England, Japan, or Australia invest in our  country we will not have to go around begging for their  assistance. They will automatically help us because they will  need to protect their interests in our kingdom. So, the  interests will be mutual. This is a response to the question  raised by Madame who just now said that we are lacking in human  resources. I say we have the human resources. What we need to  do is to transform this human resource, and make it meet the  demands of the nation and of foreign investors. The RGC has the  plan to redirect our national education from now on.    On the other hand, the madame representative's assertion  that the lack of balance between import and export is noteworthy  is most correct. In the past we had agriculture as our asset.  Now the RGC is making great efforts in its water conservancy  and irrigation policy, restoring ditches and canals, selecting  good seeds, and providing farmers with fertilizers. However, if  in dealing with agriculture we keep relying on traditional  methods, we will not be able to achieve much. So, the new  objective of the RGC is also reorientation. We are aiming our  focus on industrial crops.    Talking of industrial crops, the first thing that comes to  mind is rubber plantations that I and Samdech Hun Sen agreed the  other day to set aside. I would like however to inform their  excellencies and mesdames who are the representatives of our  state and nation that the new objective of the RGC is to develop  industrial crops. For example, in agriculture today's Vietnam  has become a bigger coffee producing nation than the African  nations. Why can Cambodia not do the same? What is the  difference between the two sides of the political border? There  is no natural border, of course. If the land is good for coffee  in Vietnam it should be good for coffee in Cambodia, too.    Another crop is the oilseed, soy beans, or [word  indistinct].  The competent departments are studying possibilities and several  major firms have been prepared to invest in this field.    Yet another industrial crop is the castor-oil plant. We have  a large market for this crop, in particular Thailand, which has  just built a large refinery to extract this type of oil.  However, Thailand has no land to grow this crop. It has  contacted us and leased some 200,000 hectares of our land for  the planting of this new crop.    So, in summary, we must change our objective and focus on  industrial crops. If we continue to stick to our traditional  crops, we will not be able to meet our demands both at the  present and in the future. The RGC plans to build an assembly  plant for tractors, such as Massey-Fergusson. There are many  regions like the plains around the Tonle Sap lake where during  the Sangkum Reas Niyum era there were as many as 200 tractors  engaged in the cultivating the floating rice. Now there are  only about 60 to 70 tractors for this purpose. The local  farmers have appealed for somebody to import additional  tractors. I would like to inform you that we are going to  borrow money and use it to assemble or produce these tractors  for sale to the people at low prices so that they can cultivate  the 30,000 hectares which even without the use of fertilizers  yield from 2.5 to 3 metric tons per hectare. This is a great  yield, and it is something that the kingdom can do and will do  in the near future.    The imbalance of our national budget, as I said before,  results from the fact that our national budget relies on two  main sources of incomes: taxes and foreign aid. H.E. Chea  Chanto said just now that foreign countries cannot help us  forever, and we cannot depend entirely on our tax incomes.  However, as I have just informed you, there are means to beef  up our national budget. Up to this point, the RGC has been able  to balance the budget in terms of service although in terms of  construction we still incur a budget imbalance. This, however,  should be seen as an achievement by the RGC.    Besides, it was proposed to increase the national product  from 2.5 percent to 8 percent in 1994 if possible. Normally, we  need a bigger growth because ours is a newly developing country.  A growth of 7 or 8 percent is seen as a natural development in  Southeast Asia. Thailand's growth remains at 9 percent. In  1993 we recorded a 7-percent growth. This year -- H.E. Sam  Rangsi is here to confirm it -- maybe we will be able to reach  8-percent growth. Considering the needs of our nation, an  8-percent growth is insufficient, and we need much more than  that. However, under the current circumstances, we cannot do  better than that. But this 8-percent rate is the average growth  rate of countries in our Southeast Asia.    The RGC is paying attention to the raising of silk worms.  The Agriculture Ministry is closely following development in  this area because presently we are importing silk from foreign  countries. However, I have asked our people why they did not  grow mulberry trees. They said there was no need to plant these  mulberry trees to raise silk worms because it was much more  convenient and much cheaper to buy silk from abroad. This was a  problem. We have decided that we must grow mulberry trees to  raise silk worms, but the weavers insisted that they did not  need to plant them because it was cheaper and faster to buy silk  from Vietnam and, to top it, this silk from Vietnam was of  better quality. However, we must solve this problem for the  people.    Now let us talk about industry, trade, and tourism.  Concerning the issue of factories, I would like to inform you  that the RGC has a plan to privatize the nation's industrial  enterprises. However, there are a few national enterprises that  are considered to be strategic. The RGC cannot privatize all  our state industrial enterprises. A few will remain under the  control of the RGC because they are regarded as strategic.    Concerning the private factories, I would like to inform you  of this: Some Japanese wish to rent our state-owned factories,  but they have asked the RGC to seal off the border and stop the  smuggling of similar goods from abroad. The Japanese has asked  us to set up a customs wall [two preceding words repeated in  English]. This is because should they invest in our country and  produce consumer goods for local consumption and export,  especially for local consumption, and should we be unable to  seal off our border, the factories in the country would not be  able to compete with the same goods, the same products that can  be sold at much lower prices because of mass production and  higher technology. As a result, our factories will be forced to  close their doors one after another.    There is also the issue of duties and profit taxes. We are  not resorting to a protectionist policy, but we have to find a  way to enable the local factories to compete with the same  products imported from abroad. Moreover, the imported products  that outsell our local products are made abroad. What we need  -- even if we make only a small profit -- is the employment  opportunities for our people. This should be a priority.  Without such opportunities, our people will become poorer and  poorer. Consequently, the RGC would like to make the following  plea to you, excellencies and mesdames: If you feel that we are  imposing too low taxes, you should realize that the job  opportunities given to the unemployed populace should more than  compensate for the relatively small incomes into the national  coffer. Employment is a priority to be immediately solved  otherwise we will be confronted with a serious social problem in  Cambodia in the very near future.    Furthermore, there is the issue of electric supply. Not only  are we experiencing a massive power shortage but the people of  Cambodia are paying a much higher price for their electricity.  Ours is not one time but five times higher than the electricity  sold anywhere else in the world. So, despite the cheap labor,  products made in our country remain costly because our  electricity is very expensive. For this reason, the RGC has  another goal. We will not just set up power plants, but our  strategy is that our electricity will rely on water, on  hydroelectric sources, because we have so many possibilities in  this area and many international organizations, countries, and  companies are prepared to help us in this field. Without  speaking of dams on the Mekong River, just the dams to be built  on other rivers throughout the country would produce 17,000  megawatts. This production far exceeds the needs in our kingdom.    Another area that we should talk about -- which madame the  representative has raised just now -- is tourism. This is a  major issue, an important issue. Almost every day the RGC is  studying ways to exploit tourism. However, it is not possible  to deal with tourism without taking into consideration the  question of security as a whole. The issue of prices in our  country must also be tackled. Our hotels and restaurants are  very expensive compared to those in our neighboring countries.  The RGC therefore has a plan to help reduce to the maximum  capital necessary in this vital field of tourism. The RGC,  despite some shortcomings, is working to restore not only the  airport in Siem Reap but also the Pochentong airport. Our  Pochentong airport is incapable of taking in large- bodied  aircraft of the Boeing-747 type. This weakness has led many  potential tourists to go to neighboring countries instead.  These neighboring countries are making profit at the expense of  all of us Cambodians. For this reason, the RGC has an urgent  plan to build a new runway at the same Pochentong site. This  new runway will have the international standard length of 3,600  meters. Its construction will be finished within two to two and  a half years and it will allow Boeing-747 planes to land.  Otherwise, there would be no end to the so-called bottleneck  [preceding word in French]. The RGC also has a plan to build  another terminal [preceding word in French] to be completed  within two to two and a half years at Pochentong.    Concerning the issue of the airport in Siem Reap just raised  by the commission, I would like to say that we will not permit  large aircraft like the Boeing-737's or Airbus-300's to land on  the Siem Reap runway although this runway is capable of  accommodating these planes. This is because we fear that the  landing tremor might shake up and damage our ancient temples,  such as Angkor Wat. The RGC therefore has decided not to permit  large jet aircraft to land at the Siem Reap airport, but we are  going to restore this Siem Reap airport, and in the future we  will find means to build another airport some 30 to 40 km away  from Siem Reap city. In the meantime we must permit small  propeller-driven planes to shuttle between Phnom Penh and Siem  Reap.    In this field of tourism, the RGC has a plan to open up  Sihanoukville and turn it into Asia's largest tourist site if  possible in the future. This is because we have many more  conditions favorable to us to do just that than any other  country. The RGC has also already decided to build another  international airport in Sihanoukville. All of that, in  principle, is good enough to bring about success in the tourist  field.    Briefly, we accept all the proposals or observations of the  commission concerning the restoration of roads as a priority  task. As you know, National Routes 12, 13, 18, 19, and so on are  receiving close attention from the RGC. In the name of the RGC,  we have just visited Koh Kong, Ratanakiri, and Mondolkiri and we  talked about this priority issue there. However, we currently  lack the budgetary funds, and these routes need considerable  funds. Nevertheless, the RGC will do its best to restore them  at all costs, especially the routes linking Phnom Penh with the  eastern and western regions of the country. This is because of  the concept that development without roads is not possible. In  two or three provinces, such as Mondolkiri, Ratanakiri, and  Stung Treng, there are huge natural resources, and these  provinces are very lightly populated. Mondolkiri's population is  20,000 and Ratanakiri's is 60,000. Several big firms plan to  invest in our country in growing industrial crops. So, this is  a great guarantee for the future of our kingdom. What the RGC  asks for is merely this: to a number of youths who seem to be  restive over the issues of security, or the lack of it, and  development, I would like to take this opportunity to remind  them that before the elections H.E. Lee Kwan Yew, former prime  minister of Singapore, told our august and most revered king  father that after the war comes to an end and when there is 100  percent security Cambodia will need at least 10 more years just  to become equal to what it was under Sangkum Reas Niyum.    Mind you, we will need 10 years not to catch up with  Singapore but just to be as good as when we were under Sangkum  Reas Niyum. The RGC is now only eight months old. Therefore,  you should not pass judgment on us for what we have done in only  eight months. That is not 10 years with total security. We are  just eight months old. Therefore, I ask the respected National  Assembly to kindly allow the RGC to continue working with the  limited resources at its disposal to lead the nation for a  little while longer. Please consider my request. Thank you.</p>

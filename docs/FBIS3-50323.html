The prosecution is founded on the publication of a reader's  letter last summer which read: "As long as various popularity  polls are led by a person like Mr. Meciar, with (Party of the  Democratic Left Chairman Petr) Weiss, (Culture Minister Dusan)  Slobodnik, (Parliament Chairman Ivan) Gasparovic, Ambassador to  the Czech Republic Ivan) Mjartan, (Constitutional Court Judge  Milan) Cic and the Kovacs behind him, things will never be all  right in Slovakia."    Since the word "Kovacs" could be understood as referring to  Slovak President Michal Kovac, the investigating officer has  maintained that the author is "publicly defaming the president  of the Republic."    "These people are political cowards, characterless rogues,  who are doing great damage to Slovakia. It annoys me that  people cannot tell lies from truth and that they have been duped  again by sacked comrades," the letter continues.    The investigation has so far established that the author was  writing under an assumed name. Consequently Hrico, as  editor-in- chief legally obliged to ensure the authenticity and  check the origin of all the information he publishes, has in  effect broken the law.    Hrico told CTK that he was questioned twice last year  although the investigation at that stage focused more on the  sender of the letter. In his view the writer was not  necessarily referring to the president as he personally could  think of half a dozen Kovacs who currently figure in Slovak  politics.</p>

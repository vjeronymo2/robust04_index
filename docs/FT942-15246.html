			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Hint of recovery in Japan's economy Japan's econonomy showed a tentative sign of recovery yesterday, with the first decline in corporate bankruptcies for four years. The number of company failures fell 2.9 per cent to 14,019 in the fiscal year to the end of March, said Teikoku Databank, a credit research group. Companies' liabilities also fell, by 10.7 per cent over the same period to Y6,650bn (Pounds 43bn), the second consecutive year of decline. The result appears to support the Bank of Japan's belief that the worst is over in the country's longest economic slowdown since the war. However, Teikoku said the number of corporate collapses specifically caused by the recession rose 14.6 per cent, showing that times are still hard for some. Optimists believe a rise in housing starts and consumer spending is paving the way for Japan's first post-war consumer-led upturn. Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, vice minister at the government's economic planning agency, said yesterday signs had emerged in recent months that the economy would 'continue growing with greater brightness' this year. Small businesses, often the first to feel economic change, this week told a survey by the Association of Shinkin Banks that the decline was halting. Shinkin credit banks specialise in small business lending. But a reminder of the economy's continued fragility came yesterday when the Ministry of International Trade and Industry revised down its preliminary estimate of industrial production for February. Output fell by 0.1 per cent from January to February, instead of rising by 0.2 per cent. By comparison with February last year, output fell by a revised 4.4 per cent, said Miti. Officials said the change was due to lower-than-expected sales of pharmaceuticals, whisky and lumber products.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: US-German deal to create third-biggest reinsurer General Re, the biggest US reinsurance company, has agreed to take indirect control of Germany's Cologne Re, a move that would create the world's third-biggest reinsurance grouping. Cologne Re had premium income of DM4.5bn (Dollars 2.7bn) in 1992, the most recent figures available, while General Re had premiums of Dollars 2.5bn in 1993. Together, the two would still be smaller than two other European-based groups, Munich Re and Swiss Re. General Re described its planned alignment with the German company as an 'association'. However, the deal, which has yet to be finalised, would give the US company ultimate control. The plan is for Colonia, the German insurance group, to transfer its 75 per cent interest in Cologne Re to a new company, which would, in turn, be majority-owned by General Re. In return, the US reinsurer would pay an unspecified amount of cash and securities, part of which would be used to boost Cologne Re's capital. The proposed deal represents General Re's first big move out of its home market, where it generates 90 per cent of its premium income. It would make it one of the biggest companies in international reinsurance. Rumours about a possible joint venture between Cologne Re and a foreign company have circulated in Germany since early June. Mr Klaas Kleyboldt, chief executive at Colonia, confirmed last week that talks were under way. However, he stressed then that Colonia had no intention of selling its stake in its reinsurance subsidiary. The new alliance is consistent with the strategic restructuring of the Colonia group, which was set in motion by Mr Kleyboldt after the German group became a majority-owned subsidiary of the French Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP). France's biggest insurance group took control of Colonia last October with the aim of challenging Allianz, the Munich-based company, as Europe's largest insurance group.</p>

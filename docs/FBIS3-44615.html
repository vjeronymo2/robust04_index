One of the most developed provinces in China, Jiangsu is  leading the country in attracting foreign funds and conducting  import and export trade.    According to official statistics, more than 9,000 joint  ventures were approved in the province in 1993, involving total  foreign funds of more than 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, doubling  the figure and 69.5 percent more than that in 1992, respectively.    Meanwhile, more well-known international giant companies,  such as Philips of the Netherlands, the Sweden-based Ericsson  Telecom, the Toyota Tsusho Corporation of Japan and Siemens of  Germany, have come to Jiangsu to establish factories and invest.    Ye Jian, director of the Jiangsu Foreign Trade and Economic  Commission, said that the investment fields have been expanded  greatly since last year, and the technological structure has  been improved at the same time.    He noted that more and more foreign investment has been  poured into such fields as computers, laser videos,  telecommunications, transportation and software over the past  few years.    In the past, foreign investors chose co-operative partners  among a mass of Chinese companies, Ye said, but now Chinese  firms seek foreign partners at their own initiative.    In order to adopt international practices as soon as  possible, the province has made great efforts to expand its  foreign trade by distributing rights to foreign trade to lower  levels over the past few years.    Not only are more firms at the city and county levels  conducting import and export directly, some scientific research  institutes and universities now enjoy the same rights.    Expanded foreign trade has resulted in a remarkable growth  in  the import and export volume of the province. An estimated over  5.6 billion U.S. dollars of export value was recorded in the  past year, up 17.8 percent over 1992.    In the process of further opening up and economic  internationalization, economic development zones in the province  play important roles, official sources said.    According to official statistics, by the end of 1993 some  2,154 foreign-funded companies had been established in the  zones, with a total investment of some 5.56 billion U.S. dollars.    In the meantime, some 2.19 billion yuan (about 251 million  U.S. dollars) had been paid in profits taxes by those companies.    In addition, the province's economic development zones,  mostly located along the Chang Jiang River, have played a key  role in boosting the development of the economic belt along the  river, Ye said.    Ye added that he believed that Jiangsu would maintain its  leading position in opening up and developing its  export-oriented economy this year.</p>

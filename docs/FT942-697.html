			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Structural aid should have right goals Sir, Perhaps EU structural aid should be granted only when it promises to create local jobs and local industrial investment ('Poverty trap with an exit', June 21). This might help prevent it being used to create markets for high-tech products from richer EU countries and have other benefits, too. Athens, for instance, did not have to build a high-tech Metro. On transport policy grounds, as was set out in an OECD urban division study to which I contributed, there was a case for mid-technology tramways and trams. Compared with a Metro, the effects of trams would have been significantly different. As far as jobs and investment go there are grounds for believing that the track and the cars, but not perhaps the drive units or the signalling, could have been made in Greece - under licence if necessary. Furthermore, for any given budget, a more extensive transit network could have been created more quickly - to the considerable benefit of Athenians. And since the trams would have run down the middle of existing streets on slightly raised paving, or through pedestrianised streets, they could have provided a reliable, congestion-free service and reduced the area of road available to cars. This might indeed have helped 'turn the traffic-clogged and polluted Greek capital into a modern city'. If, as your correspondent suggests, a Metro is capable of doing this for Athens, it has to be asked why it has not already done it for Milan - or Paris or London. Perhaps structural aid should have more clearly defined environmental as well as employment goals? Terence Bendixson, 39 Elm Park Gardens, London SW10 9QF</p>

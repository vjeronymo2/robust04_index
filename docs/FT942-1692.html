			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / C&amp;G gains room for manoeuvre Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society appeared to have been given some more room for manoeuvre yesterday in devising a lawful way of distributing the Pounds 1.8bn cash offered by Lloyds Bank for the society. Sir Donald Nicholls, the Vice-Chancellor, said C&amp;G depositors and staff could be given cash payments, whether or not they were members of the society. The point at issue had been the position of depositors and staff of the society who could vote on the Lloyds offer but could not lawfully receive cash payments as members. Two weeks ago Sir Donald ruled that Lloyds could not pay cash to C&amp;G investors who had been shareholders for less than two years, or to borrowers who were members of the society. He also said then that in principle if members were prepared to approve payments to employees, depositors and pensioners, that was up to them. C&amp;G needs the consent of 75 per cent of its shareholders for any takeover to proceed. Its borrowing members must approve the deal separately. Yesterday's decision marked the formal conclusion of the legal challenge by the Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, to the Lloyds bid. Sir Donald emphasised that his declaration related only to the particular C&amp;G scheme that had been the subject of the action. Mr Jonathan Sumption QC, putting the case for C&amp;G, had said that the issue arose where someone had more than one relationship with the society. He gave the examples of an employee who had recently become a shareholder through opening an investment account, and of someone who had a deposit account but also had a mortgage with the C&amp;G. In each case, the person would qualify for a payment in their first capacity. In their second capacity they would have a vote on whether to approve the Lloyds offer but would not qualify for a cash payment under the terms of the previous judgment. Mr Sumption said it would be artificial to give different treatment to people who were identically placed as employees simply because one had opened a share account more than two years ago, and one had opened a share account less than two years ago. Mr Phillip Heslop QC, for the commission, said that since the original scheme could not proceed unless there were a successful appeal against the judgment, it would be better to make no specific ruling on this issue so that the matter could be addressed in the context of an amended C&amp;G scheme or a future transaction. Mr Heslop said that even though the terms of the court order would be directed to the C&amp;G scheme, a ruling that someone could receive a cash payment in a non-voting capacity while being excluded from such a payment in their voting capacity brought the possibility that other transactions might seek to circumvent the judgment's intention. But Sir Donald said that he had to focus on this point in making his judgment, and that it would be wrong not to make it plain. Either C&amp;G or the commission could seek leave to appeal.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MEUSBORN PROVIDES CORRECT ANSWER IN FINAL TEST  </P> <P> One year ago today, 29-year-old Tom Meusborn was poring over the roster of the  Grant High junior varsity, trying to figure out which ninth-graders might be  strong enough to throw a ball 60 feet 6 inches.  </P> <P> One season was all it took for the former Grant junior varsity coach to take  his first varsity team to the City Section 4-A Division championship.  Chatsworth scored two runs in the bottom of the seventh inning Wednesday at  Dodger Stadium to upset El Camino Real, 3-2.  </P> <P> "I'm still in shock," Meusborn said. "It was a great, great, great, great first  year."  </P> <P> With one bold stroke, Meusborn and Chatsworth squeezed the life out of favored  El Camino Real when shortstop Tommy Lee laid down a bunt with the bases loaded  and one out to score Nestor Martinez.  </P> <P> "It's the first time all year we've run a suicide squeeze," Meusborn said.  </P> <P> Meusborn called for bunts three times in the seventh, contributing to the  dramatic conclusion. With the Chancellors trailing, 2-1, Rodney Bloom opened  the inning with a walk off El Camino Real starter Pat Treend. Meusborn,  coaching in the third base box, signaled for his No. 3 hitter, Martinez, and  cleanup hitter Mike Mancuso, to bunt. Both calls worked.  </P> <P> Martinez reached base when Treend threw late to second in an attempt to nail  Bloom. Mancuso also reached safely on Herman Merchan's fielding error.  </P> <P> After Chatsworth tied the score, 2-2, and loaded the bases with one out,  Meusborn went with his hot hand -- the bunt call.  </P> <P> "Tommy Lee's a great bunter," Meusborn said. "I knew if it was near the plate,  he'd get it down."  </P> <P> Down it went and down went El Camino Real.  </P> <P> Meusborn, the second consecutive rookie coach to win a City title (he follows  Kennedy's Manny Alvarado), accomplished the feat for a school that last won a  City title in 1983 but stumbled in the semifinals at the end of the decade. The  Chancellors lost in the semifinals in each of the past three years.  </P> <P> Leading the Chatsworth cheers was starting pitcher Reed McMackin, the only  leftover from the 1988 team that was ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today  before losing a semifinal game. He proved a perfect beneficiary of Meusborn's  freshness.  </P> <P> McMackin, who worked 5 2/3 innings Wednesday, said that he had received a call  from former Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano before the game. And what did the  coach who suffered all those semifinal losses have to say?  </P> <P> "He just said, 'Congratulations,' " McMackin said.  </P> <P> One can imagine that McMackin, Meusborn, Lee -- and the rest of these unlikely  champions -- will hear those words for weeks to come.  </P></p>

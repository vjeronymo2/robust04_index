			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GRIEVING FAMILY SAYS '73 LAOS CRASH DIDN'T KILL SON  </P> <P> Kate Rothacker of Mission Viejo has had versions of the same dream off and on  since 1973. In some, her brother Joe comes home on crutches. Sometimes, he  comes home blind. Or, he comes home crazy. But he always comes home.  </P> <P> In reality, no one knows exactly what happened to Joseph Matejov -- one of the  2,303 American servicemen in Vietnam for whom the government has yet to  account.  </P> <P> For families of those men, today's Memorial Day remembrances only underscore  the grief still emanating from an undeclared, unsuccessful war that left wounds  so deep that scars have not formed.  </P> <P> "It's a very emotional time for most of the families," said Judie Mills Taber  of La Habra, California coordinator for the National League of Families of  American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, an organization with a  mailing list of 12,000. "We don't know if they've given their lives or not."  </P> <P> Matejov's case is particularly difficult because his family insists that they  have found evidence that he was captured alive -- despite a U.S. Air Force  declaration that he had been killed when his EC47 plane was shot down Feb. 5,  1973, over Laos.  </P> <P> All nine brothers and sisters in the devoutly Catholic, military family firmly  believe that Joe Matejov -- a handsome, popular 21-year old when he vanished --  is still alive after 17 years, Rothacker said.  </P> <P> "No one has said he is dead," said Rothacker, 35, a homemaker and mother of  four. She wears two POW bracelets, one with Joe's name and one for another  missing soldier. POW signs are pasted on the windows of her home and station  wagon.  </P> <P> Her children include prayers for Uncle Joe around the family dinner table.  </P> <P> Kate Rothacker remembers her brother as generous, considerate, handsome and  hard working. "He was every mother's dream." Once, he took her shopping to buy  himself a clock radio but kept asking which one she preferred, ultimately  asking her to keep it for him. "In effect, he was giving me a present."  </P> <P> Rothacker was 18 when a U.S. Air Force representative knocked on the door of  their East Meadow, N.Y., home to say that Joe had been killed during an  intelligence-gathering mission over Laos -- eight days after the signing of the  Paris Peace Accords. The officials said he had died instantly with seven others  when their plane was shot down and disintegrated.  </P> <P> They held a memorial service.  </P> <P> Then, five years later, the family began to hear other accounts -- first  reported by columnist Jack Anderson on "Good Morning America" -- that four of  the eight men, including Joe Matejov, had bailed out of the plane.  </P> <P> Because one crew member's personal effects included a letter suggesting that  their mission broke the new peace treaty, it was hinted that the United States  had tried to cover up a possibly illegal spy mission, Rothacker said.  </P> <P> In his service record, Joe's parents, Mary and Stephen Matejov, found Air Force  transcripts of intercepted enemy radio transmissions describing "air pirates"  captured the day of the crash in the area and where they were being taken.  Pentagon officials said descriptions of the prisoners described in the  transcripts do not match Matejov or other crew members.  </P> <P> Finally, Mary Matejov said, she and her husband were told six or seven years  ago by Roger Shields, who was deputy assistant secretary of defense in charge  of POW/MIA affairs at the time of the crew's disappearance, that the four  missing crew members were intentionally listed as dead in order to protect  them.  </P> <P> "He said he was afraid the Vietnamese might say, 'This plane was flying; you  broke the treaty; we don't have to return the men,' " she said from her  Hampton, Va., home.  </P> <P> Shields, now chief international economist with Chemical Bank in New York,  denied telling the Matejovs their son was alive and was deliberately declared  dead. He said there was no reason to cover up the flight, which was legal.  </P> <P> However, based on the radio intercepts, he had opposed the Air Force  secretary's finding that the crew died in the crash and still believes that  declaring them dead was a mistake, he said in a telephone interview last week  from London.  </P> <P> He said he strongly suspects that they were captured because the date of the  "air pirate" transmission was the same as the crash, there were very few planes  in the area at the time and the broadcast was beamed directly to Hanoi from not  farther than 60 miles from the crash site.  </P> <P> "I think the Air Force was wrong, but the judgment was not made out of malice.  It was not part of a conspiracy. As far as I know, no one ever lied to her. The  Air Force secretary has a right to make those calls. In their judgment, he was  dead. I dispute the judgment; she disputes the judgment. A (bad) judgment does  not amount to a lie."  </P> <P> Had they been declared missing, he said, "efforts to find them might have gone  on in a different vein."  </P> <P> "She's right to feel there's more information available, but whether that means  her son is alive is another issue."  </P> <P> Shields said that he has no hope that the crew members are still alive but  believes that families such as the Matejovs "deserve massive amounts of  sympathy."  </P> <P> Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist said: "There is no evidence that  any crew members survived the crash and no evidence that any crew members were  captured by enemy forces." He said the plane plunged, bounced once, landed  upside down and burned.  </P> <P> A search party four days after the crash was not able to lift the fuselage to  look for remains, he said.  </P> <P> He said he would not comment on the cover-up issue because facts of the case  were not immediately available.  </P> <P> Since the fall of Saigon in 1975, there have been 11,754 reports of POWs or  MIAs, and the Pentagon continues to receive about a dozen reports a month,  Lundquist said. The vast majority have been accounted for, he said.  </P> <P> Only 131 of the 2,303 unresolved cases involve first-hand reports of "live  sightings," he said. Of those, 76 were held under guard when seen and 55 were  reported to be living in "non-captive" situations such as with a Vietnamese  family in a village.  </P> <P> So far, the government has been unable to prove that any Americans are being  detained against their will in Southeast Asia, Lundquist said. But since 1981,  official government policy precludes ruling out the possibility, and roughly  100 people are employed full time to investigate cases under the assumption  that some are still alive, he said.  </P> <P> "It is an unrealistic expectation that we will be able to account for all of  them," he said. In World War II, 78,750 servicemen (or 18% of all those who  served) remain unaccounted for, as well as 8,177 (15%) from the Korean War. In  Vietnam, 4% remain unaccounted for.  </P> <P> Matejov is not among the high-priority cases, a ranking created to facilitate  recovery efforts with Vietnam, Lundquist said. Those are cases of 80 Americans  for whom there is "strong evidence that they survived their incident and were  captured, or otherwise came under control of the Indochinese governments or  about whom those governments should have information. Yet neither these men,  nor their remains have been returned," Lundquist said.  </P> <P> However, Matejov's name has been submitted seven times, most recently in  February of this year, to the Joint Casualty Resolution Center, at Barber's  Point Naval Air Station in Hawaii, which mounts investigations with Southeast  Asian governments.  </P> <P> So far, the Lao government has rejected the request for unknown reasons. The  most recent request is unanswered, said George Atkinson, chief of Air Force  Missing Persons.  </P> <P> As a result of expeditions, the Air Force retrieved the remains of 42 people  last year -- a far greater number than in any one year so far since the war, he  said.  </P> <P> "I don't think families understand how much work has been done," he said. "It's  a personal thing with them."  </P> <P> Mary Matejov and her daughter, Kate Rothacker, speak on the issue, hoping to  galvanize public opinion and spur greater government efforts to find prisoners.  And they pray -- though Rothacker said she is sometimes unsure what to pray  for.  </P> <P> "I don't expect him to come home completely normal," his mother said. "I  imagine he would be hospitalized for quite some time. I do believe they might  have played with his mind. I'm prepared for that. . . . He may have been given  a family. If he's got a family, bring them here. They're welcome too.  </P> <P> "I want him home where he belongs. He belongs on American soil. He doesn't  belong over there."  </P> <P> One of the hardest parts for the family has been a loss of faith in a  government to which it had been devoted.  </P> <P> Mary Matejov's husband, who died in 1984, was a career Army officer. Others in  her family have served in the Marines, the Navy and the Air Force.  </P> <P> But because they believe that the government lied about Joe, her two youngest  sons said they would join the service only if drafted.  </P> <P> "When we thought he was dead, we felt we were one of the families that had to  have the pain," Mary Matejov said. "That happens in war time. We accepted it.  It was his career. Somebody's going to be killed.  </P> <P> "When we found out the truth, it was like somebody sticking a knife in and  twisting it. At first we didn't believe it. It was hard for my husband to  believe in the beginning, until we saw the radio intercepts."  </P> <P> Said Rothacker, whose husband is a former Marine, "The feeling I have is of  betrayal. We had faith in the government. What would you do if your mom stabbed  you in the back?"  </P> <P> Jack Anderson, whose broadcast changed the focus of the family's lives, cannot  remember specifics of his report, other than that his information came from  sources inside the Pentagon or the CIA. "Washington tells the public one story,  we tried to tell a different story -- the one that has been suppressed."  </P> <P> Joe's mother and sister say faith keeps them going in their efforts to bring  live prisoners home. "Sometimes I get quite tired," Mary Matejov said. "I do  want to quit, and yet I don't. I just can't.  </P> <P> "Until my last breath I can't quit. I have to know the answer. I can't just  leave it hanging and not know."  </P> <P> Kate hasn't dreamed of Joe for several years now. The last time, she awoke less  startled at having seen him than of having had the same dream once again after  all these years.  </P> <P> In it as in all the others, she and her mother meet Joe at the door. And she  tells him: "I knew you'd come home."  </P></p>

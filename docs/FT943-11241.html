			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / International Press Review: Asean ministers face wrath of Thai journalists Thailand's liberal newspapers have excelled themselves in their efforts to embarrass the now not-so-liberal Thai government, which was host to the annual meeting of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) in Bangkok over the past two weeks. Visiting foreign ministers from Indonesia and Burma were greeted with hundreds of column-inches about Indonesian brutality in East Timor, Burmese military cruelty and editorials scoffing at the notion, put about by authoritarian Asian governments, that human rights and democracy are inappropriate for Asia. Thai commentators were inspired by two events: Thailand invited Mr Ohn Gyaw, foreign minister of the Burmese junta, to the Asean meeting, an honour which some editorial writers felt was scarcely deserved; and the Thai authorities made hamfisted attempts to stop an insignificant human rights conference, deporting three foreigners and harassing the participants because they wanted to discuss Burma and East Timor. Thailand, said The Nation in an editorial, was foolishly giving in to the 'bully-boy tactics' of Indonesia in the name of Asean solidarity. 'It is high time that the regional grouping reviewed its concept of 'solidarity',' said The Nation. 'The events of the past three months clearly show that Indonesia is using Asean as its platform to impose authoritarian values over members which have different political systems.' During the May 1992 crisis, in which Thai troops killed 50 demonstrators on the streets of Bangkok, The Nation, an English-language newspaper, openly opposed the Thai armed forces and supported pro-democracy activists. Its support helped bring the present democratic government of Mr Chuan Leekpai to power, and the paper believes it has the right to express disappointment at his performance. Mr Chuan, the newspaper said in another editorial, now seemed to think it more important for Thailand to have good relations with Indonesia than to care about human rights. On the subject of bullying, Mr Ali Alatas, the Indonesian foreign minister, in an interview with the Bangkok Post, the other leading English-language daily, said Indonesia was not a bully - it had simply informed Thailand about the plans of some East Timor activists and had explained how offended Indonesia would be if nothing was done to stop them. While English-language newspapers in Thailand represent the views of liberal academics and businessmen - half the readers are Thais - and take a close interest in international affairs, the Thai-language press tends to be more concerned by the shenanigans of Thai politicians and local crime stories. Over the last two weeks the Thai papers have concentrated on the fate of two politicians: one accused of international drug smuggling; the other, suspected of buying votes by giving cash to Buddhist temples. A Bangkok Post survey of ordinary people on the streets of the capital suggested that the Thai papers were right to think their readers would not be interested in the dry affairs of Asean. 'Asean? Is it a sports event? It sounds familiar,' said Mr Sermsuk In-jan, a 50-year-old shop assistant. But the dispute over human rights prompted by the Asean meeting did generate heated debate in the Thai papers. Siam Rath (Siam Nation) and Naew Na (Frontline) both supported the Thai government's crackdown on dissidents. Thailand should not allow outsiders to use the country as a venue for criticising neighbouring states, because the national interest should have top priority, Siam Rath said in an editorial. Liberal commentators rejected this sort of nationalism, declaring that national pride meant standing up for what you believe in rather than allowing your policies to be dictated by the sensitivities of other governments.</p>

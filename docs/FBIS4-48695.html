			<p>BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], has urged the residents of Pebane District,  Zambezia Province, to forget about the war. Addressing a mass  rally in Pebane yesterday, Dhlakama guaranteed that war will  never be renewed in the country and added that the objectives  for which he fought were attained with the implementation of  democracy in Mozambique. On the occasion, the Renamo leader  urged the Pebane residents to participate actively in the  forthcoming multiparty elections. Dhlakama, who has been in  Quelimane since 20 May, is scheduled to close Renamo's political  conference, which has been discussing particularly issues linked  to the electoral process. The conference was attended by Renamo  political delegates in Zambezia and Nampula Provinces.</p>

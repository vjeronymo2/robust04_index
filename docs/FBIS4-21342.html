The representatives of the 12 EU countries and the 13  representatives of the Rio Group, the main Latin American forum  for concerted action, promised to contribute to the  strengthening of democracy through the subordination of all  sectors to legally constituted civilian authorities.    The so-called "Sao Paulo Declaration," which is eight pages  long, establishes the bases for future dialogue in the political  and economic fields.    The European bloc wanted the document to mention the  subordination of the armed forces to civilian power. This  proposal, however, was softened at the recommendation of the  Latin Americans, who preferred not to mention the military at a  moment when threats to the institutional order were felt in some  countries.    The document condemns xenophobia, racism, terrorism, and the  illegal production, trafficking, and consumption of drugs, as  well as money laundering.    The delegates agreed to concentrate their "efforts in  combating the wave of racism and xenophobia against, for  example, immigrant workers and their families through, among  other measures, the application of strict laws and the  implementation of intense education campaigns."    As for drug enforcement, the participants agreed to apply  global solutions to the drug problem, prevent the misuse of  chemical precursors used in drug manufacturing, and promote  alternative income sources for the benefit of the affected  peasants.    The ministers and delegates from the two blocs repudiated  "without reservations and labelled as an unjustifiable crime all  kinds of terrorist actions wherever they are committed by anyone  and for any reason, because they endanger and eliminate human  lives, offend the dignity of the human being, and attack  democracy and the state of law."    They thus agreed to reinforce cooperation and coordinate  practical measures to combat terrorism.    The declaration pointed out the EU's and the Rio Group's  interest in eradicating poverty, defending the environment, and  rejecting "arbitrary unilateral actions" in international trade  and noncompliance with the GATT principles.    The document states that mutual cooperation must be aimed at  the eradication of poverty and the protection of the  less-favored classes. It must efficiently promote democracy and  cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, industry, science,  and technology.    The chiefs of European and Latin American diplomacy stated  that the "right to development is part of basic human rights,  the human being is the central subject of development, and the  lack of development cannot be used as an excuse to justify  disrespect for internationally acknowledged human rights."    They also recognized the importance of the Ibero-American  Conference, whose fourth summit of chiefs of state and  government will take place on 14 and 15 June in Cartagena de  Indias, Colombia.    They also promised intensifying dialogue within the UN  framework for the purpose of reforming its charter and to  improve the organization's work methods.    The two blocs made an appeal to countries to renew their  commitment to the nonproliferation of weapons of mass  destruction, they suggested signing a multilateral treaty to  totally prohibit nuclear tests, and they mentioned the progress  in the consolidation of the system of a total prohibition of  nuclear weapons in Latin America.</p>

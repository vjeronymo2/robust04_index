			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / The hottest act in town: Microsoft and Intel are seeking to reinforce their dominance in information technology Welcome to the Bill and Andy Show,' says Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, as he mounts a stage with Andrew Grove, chief executive and president of Intel, to introduce the latest product of their companies' joint efforts to bring video pictures to the personal computer screen. Lately, the 'Bill and Andy Show' has become the most closely watched act on the information technology stage as Intel and Microsoft assume the role of industry leaders against a backdrop of rapidly shifting technology trends. Long the dominant suppliers of microprocessors and personal computer software - the 'brains' inside the personal computer and the programs that control its functions - Intel and Microsoft have emerged over the past couple of years as the most powerful companies in the computer industry. Not since the heyday of International Business Machines has there been such a concentration of power in the sector. Just as 'Big Blue' was unassailable in the 1970s and early 1980s, now Intel and Microsoft appear unbeatable. Each company commands its field - Intel as the world's largest chipmaker and Microsoft as by far the biggest supplier of PC software. However, as the West Coast duo - Intel of California and Microsoft of Washington state - prepare to expand their territory beyond the PC market with the introduction of more powerful chips and software for higher-performance computers, their strength is about to be put to the test. Both aim to use their mastery of the PC market to dominate the next phase of computing technology as microprocessor chips become the building blocks for more powerful 'servers' - computers that feed information to networked PCs. 'The microprocessor chip has destroyed the oligopoly of the mainframe and minicomputer makers,' says Andrew Grove. Invented over 20 years ago by Intel, this miniature information processor has replaced custom-designed processing units and facilitated the mass production of personal computers. Microprocessors have now become so powerful that they rival the performance of minicomputers and mainframes, the traditional workhorses of information processing technology. 'The model of the 'old' computer industry has been broken by the microprocessor,' says Mike Maples, executive vice president of Microsoft. 'In the past, the manufacture of computers, the creation of software and support services were all provided by a few tightly integrated companies such as IBM and Digital Equipment.' This structure is being 'bulldozed' by the advent of low-cost computers based on microprocessors, says Grove. The 'new' computer industry is becoming increasingly segmented into hardware, semiconductor, software and service specialists. IBM's financial problems demonstrate the impact of this shift in the balance of power. In January, it reported net losses of almost Dollars 5bn for 1992 and it is rapidly 'downsizing'. It plans to cut 25,000 jobs this year after reducing its workforce by more than 40,000 last year. The same technology and market forces that have blown IBM off course have benefited Intel and Microsoft. Intel's 1992 sales rose 22 per cent to Dollars 5.84bn and net profits were up 30 per cent at Dollars 1.07bn. For fiscal 1992 ending in June, Microsoft recorded a 50 per cent jump in revenues to Dollars 2.8bn, while net income rose 53 per cent to Dollars 708m. Microsoft and Intel are dwarfed by IBM's revenues - Dollars 64bn in 1992 - but they have become the 'keepers of the flame, the keepers of industry standards', says Roger McNamee, of Integral Capital Partners, an investment partnership. Computer users now look to them, rather than to IBM, to map out the future of information technology. 'Microsoft's products are at the forefront of most customers' long-term computer systems strategies,' says Mort Rosenthal, chairman of Corporate Software, a US distributor of software. But doing business with Microsoft 'is like water-skiing behind the Queen Mary,' he says. 'When you do business with Microsoft you do business their way.' Similarly, computer manufacturers are forced to follow Intel's lead. As the sole supplier of leading-edge microprocessors, Intel can dictate when new computers are introduced by its customers. In a recent confidential letter to customers Intel even specified the prices that it expects them to set for the next generation of PCs. If Intel's customers are unhappy, they are not saying so publicly. Competitors, however, are less reticent. Intel has built an 'illicit monopoly' in the microprocessor market, says W J Sanders III, chairman and chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices, a semiconductor rival that has engaged in a legal feud with Intel over rights to microprocessor technology. Microsoft has also been accused of abusing its power. In particular, competitors charge that its use of 'per-processor' licensing arrangements for PC software restricts competition. Under these arrangements, Microsoft gives discounts to PC makers who agree to pay a licensing fee for every PC they sell. This makes it difficult for competitors to persuade PC makers to offer alternative operating systems. Such complaints have drawn the attention of the US Federal Trade Commission, which recently completed anti-trust investigations of both companies. The outcomes of these investigations have yet to be determined. However, the FTC is not expected to take action against Intel and the commission last month split over whether to seek an injunction against Microsoft. Even if the FTC does nothing, the dominance of Intel and Microsoft will remain a controversial issue in the computer industry. Steve Jobs, chairman of Next Computer and the former chairman of Apple Computer, has publicly called for the break-up of Microsoft. He fears the company's control over the software market discourages innovation and limits competition. Microsoft maintains that complaints by rivals are just 'sour grapes'. 'Leading an industry does not mean that you win popularity contests,' says Maples, who spent 23 years at IBM before joining Microsoft. He says that Microsoft has become the industry's latest whipping boy, just as IBM was. Despite such comparisons with IBM, Microsoft and Intel claim they have no ambitions to become industrial giants. 'We are a maker of building blocks,' says Grove of Intel. The company will continue to concentrate primarily on manufacturing chips and PC add-on circuit boards, he says. Microsoft also aims to remain focused on its 'core competences' - developing and selling software that makes computers easier to use. 'We have avoided getting into the hardware business,' says Maples, adding that Microsoft is deliberately limiting its rate of growth. 'It is not that there aren't plenty of opportunities, but you can get fat and lazy' he explains. Intel and Microsoft nonetheless have plans to expand their markets with important products that will be launched shortly. These are: Pentium: This month Intel will unveil its fifth-generation microprocessor. At least twice as powerful as the Intel486, the current top-selling microprocessor, Pentium is intended to power a new generation of high-performance desktop computers and PC network servers. Windows NT (New Technology). Now expected in May, Microsoft's NT will combine the features of the popular 'Windows' program that enables PC functions to be selected by a pointing device with advanced capabilities such as 'multi-tasking' - the performance of several tasks simultaneously. The combination means it should be possible, for example, to search through a data-base while writing a document. Intel and Microsoft aim to cement their industry leadership with these new products. But while industry analysts have high expectations for both Windows NT and Pentium, there are significant hurdles. For NT, success depends on breaking into a market in which Microsoft has little experience. Whereas its current products are aimed at individual PC users, NT is designed for critical applications within industry such as management of corporate databases. 'If somebody's PC word-processing program stops working, it is a big inconvenience to that person. But if a bank's transaction register fails, millions of dollars may be lost. Microsoft has no experience in supporting such customers,' says Mr Bill Bluestein, senior market analyst at Forrester Research, a market research and consulting group. Windows NT may also face stiff competition from Unix, the widely-used operating system developed by AT&amp;T and recently acquired by Novell, one of Microsoft's few serious rivals. Unix supporters dismiss NT as an unknown entity. 'NT is like a blind date - you don't know what she is going to look like until she turns up at the door,' says Scott McNealy, chairman and chief executive of Sun Microsystems. Intel's Pentium faces fewer obstacles, but it is not without competition, some of it created by Windows NT. The new Microsoft program will be able to run on microprocessors from Intel's rivals such as Digital Equipment and Intergraph. However, these companies pose little threat to Intel's dominance in the PC market because they do not have the production capacity to make the millions of microprocessors that the PC industry consumes each year. More challenging are rivals such as AMD that are producing similar versions of Intel's existing products. Already, AMD has claimed more than 50 per cent of the market for 386s, the third generation of Intel microprocessors. The almost simultaneous introduction of Pentium and Windows NT 'is a total coincidence' says Paul Maritz, Microsoft senior vice president. But the two companies did work closely in the development of the products. Such collaboration has been common since Intel and Microsoft were chosen by IBM to supply microprocessors and software for its original PC more than 10 years ago. 'We have a very large area of common interest. We co-operate very well and our technical people spend a lot of time together,' says Maples. 'Both companies have a vested interest in the structure of the industry as it exists today,' adds Maritz, who worked for five years at Intel before joining Microsoft. 'We are both motivated to ensure that it keeps growing.' To this end, they are jointly proposing an industry standard for video display technology which allows the transmission of moving pictures on computer screens. Yet both Microsoft and Intel have other partners. 'The success of Microsoft can't be tied to the success of Intel,' Maples says. 'If either one of us drops the ball there are others ready to pick it up,' agrees Grove. The partnership is expected to face increasing pressure. 'The alliance between Microsoft and Intel is a marriage of convenience,' says Roger McNamee. 'It has been rewarding to both companies, but the opportunities for Microsoft's interests to diverge from those of Intel are increasing with the introduction of Windows NT. As the focus moves from stand-alone desktop PCs to networks, pressure is mounting for Microsoft to make its systems compatible with multiple (microprocessor) platforms.' Both Intel and Microsoft may also prove vulnerable to the next 'technology shift'; the introduction of a radically new technology. 'That is the great danger. We think about it a lot,' acknowledges Maritz. One such shift which concerns Microsoft and Intel is the emergence of pocket-sized 'personal communicators', devices that combine a PC, a telephone and a facsimile machine in a hand-held device. 'The benefits of compatibility with existing PC standards are not clear in this emerging market,' says McNamee. Intel and Microsoft could be followers, rather than leaders, in what many industry analysts are predicting will become a multi-billion dollar market. Another threat could be 'object-oriented technology'; a method of streamlining the lengthy process of writing new software application programs. James Cannavino, IBM senior vice president, predicts that 'objects' will sharply increase the productivity of programmers. IBM is in the forefront of this technology through a joint venture with Apple Computer, called Taligent. But Maritz dismisses IBM's claims. 'Object-oriented technology is the software industry equivalent of 'Ingredient X' in soap powder,' he says. IBM is also working with Apple and Motorola, the number two US chip maker, on a range of microprocessors that could dislodge Intel's power in the PC sector. But Grove doesn't give the IBM alliance much chance of beating Intel in the microprocessor market. 'They are building a new railroad to a different gauge,' he says. The value of existing 'rolling stock', or software in the computer world, is a big disincentive to change. Yet the history of the computer industry suggests that technological change will overtake today's industry stars. While 'Bill and Andy' hold centre stage in today's IT show, the lead roles have yet to be cast in the next act of this industry drama. There are plenty of emerging players and established acts waiting in the wings for an opportunity to upstage them.</p>

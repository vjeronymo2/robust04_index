			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Small - but growing fast The Japanese investment trust sector is small but has been expanding rapidly this year. A new smaller companies trust, Fidelity Japanese Values, pulled in Pounds 105m while a conversion share issue by the long-established Fleming Japanese fund raised Pounds 162m in February. Now, another existing smaller companies fund, Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon, is trying to raise new capital and Schroders is launching a new general fund, Schroder Japan Growth. New issues are popular now because existing trusts have mostly been trading at premiums to net asset value. This means you pay more for the shares than their assets are worth, as well as paying dealing charges. If you buy a new issue, you pay only the issue expenses, which rarely amount to more than 4 per cent. So, if an existing trust is at more than a 4 per cent premium, a new issue looks cheap. There are good arguments against buying investment trust shares at a premium. Premiums result from surges in demand and are, generally, short-lived phenomena. If you buy a trust at a 10 per cent premium, it might have dropped to a more normal 5 per cent discount a few months later. Even if the fund's underlying asset performance is good, this still means your profits are eroded by about 15 per cent. Recent research by broker Credit Lyonnais Laing found that Japanese trusts bought at a premium underperformed the market consistently. The firm picked two trusts and tracked them over a year, following any period when they were at a premium. It found the share prices underperformed by an average of 18.1 per cent and 9.9 per cent over the 12 months. What, then, do you do if you think Japan looks a good bet but (a) are not keen on new issues and (b) the investment trust run by the manager you like is carrying a hefty premium? The answer is to check whether the manager also has a Japanese unit trust under his wing. Most do. Schroder, for instance, has several Japanese unit trusts with a good track record. The connection between trusts is not always obvious: the Save &amp; Prosper unit trust is run by the same group as the Fleming Japanese investment trust. When investment trusts are at a reasonable discount, you would generally do better to buy them than a unit trust; when investment trust shares rise much above asset value, the reverse is probably true. Unfortunately, because of initial charges and dealing costs, frequent arbitrage between the two is expensive for most private investors. Nigel Sidebottom, an investment trust specialist with broker Gerrard Vivien Gray, also warns that it is not always easy to tell when a trust is at a large premium - there is more to it, he says, than the basic discount or premium to net asset value published in the FT every day. Most Japanese investment trusts also issue warrants which, at some future point, can make a substantial call on the assets of the trust, so diluting the entitlement of ordinary shareholders. Sidebottom suspects that the market does not price this future dilution fully into the ordinary shares. To get a full share of the trust's capital growth, you would have to buy a combination of warrants and ordinary shares. When the premium for the package is recalculated, it can be far higher than the printed figure would suggest - an ostensible 3 or 4 per cent premium can turn out to be nearer 16 per cent, which is too expensive by most measures. Thus, Sidebottom is very careful in his choice of Japanese trusts, looking at new issues in a particularly favourable light as well as considering the alternative of unit trusts.

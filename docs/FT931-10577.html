			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Bosnia mediators hope for US backing: Washington now appears to favour a negotiated solution INTERNATIONAL mediators working for a peace settlement in Bosnia are heartened by signals from Washington that the new US administration may be prepared to back a modified version of their plan rather than rejecting it altogether. Having criticised the plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance, representing the United Nations, and Lord Owen, the European Community's representative, for supposedly failing to guarantee the Bosnian Moslems' rights, President Bill Clinton is due to announce the US's own proposals this week. However, the mediators believe there is now much more common ground between them and the US than at first appeared. They are particularly relieved by indications that Washington appears to have abandoned any idea of direct military intervention in Bosnia and has come round to a negotiated solution, albeit one that could be backed up by force if necessary. The US policy rethink was 'going in an encouraging direction', a British official said yesterday. One of the main reservations about the Vance-Owen plan expressed in Washington, other than that it 'rewards' the Bosnian Serbs for their policy of ethnic cleansing, is that even if it is signed by all the warring parties, there are not sufficient guarantees that it will be properly implemented. That reservation has been taken on board by the mediators, who would welcome suggestions from the US on how the implementation of the plan, particularly the control of heavy weapons, could be given more teeth. In his talks with the mediators over the week-end, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Moslem foreign minister, again underlined the need for an effective weapons control system. Among the proposals under discussion, both at the UN in New York and in Washington, are the use of air power to destroy artillery and other heavy weapons that any of the warring parties refuse to place under UN supervision. Such operations could be organised by Nato's air command, although formally under the UN umbrella. It is also clear that, if the US plan is to be taken seriously, it would have to be backed up by the promise of ground troops to help in the peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations. One of the main criticisms of US policy on the Bosnian conflict voiced at the UN is that it has been big on words and short on concrete contributions to peacekeeping operations. The use of Nato as a surrogate for the UN would be designed to meet traditional American objections to placing US troops under UN command. Mr Les Aspin, US secretary of defence, confirmed yesterday at the annual Munich security conference in Germany that the US believed Nato had a role to play. 'Europe and the alliance are not secure if we fail to bring the full force of our influence to bear in contributing to a restoration of peace,' he said. Another proposal reportedly being discussed is an international tribunal to try war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, which would be welcomed by the mediators. When Lord Owen first made such a proposal at the meeting of the enlarged steering committee of the Yugoslav peace conference in Geneva last December, none of the 32 foreign ministers present formally endorsed it. Before submitting their plan to the Security Council today, the mediators attempted to persuade, without success, one or two of the warring parties to give up to the Bosnian Moslems some of the territory allocated to them under the plan to divide the country into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. The Moslems, for their part, continued to reject the proposed map, in the knowledge that they could count on the US administration's support. The Security Council's meeting today will take the form of informal consultations. Apart from the US, all other permanent members of the Council (Russia, China, Britain and France) support the Vance-Owen plan. But among the non-permanent members, three Islamic states, Pakistan, Morocco and Djibouti, are opposed. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said yesterday he hoped Moscow could persuade Washington to support the Vance-Owen plan. Editorial comment, Page 13</p>

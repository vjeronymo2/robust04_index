			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Democrats 66 Scoring Highest Among </F> Students"]    [Excerpt] Apparently, Netherlands students are no longer  adhering to ideologies. Indeed, if the Netherlands were one big  university, the D66 [Democrats 66] would be the biggest party  and [D66 leader] Hans van Mierlo would be the unchallenged  leader.    This was revealed by a representative sample conducted among  the future generation of intellectuals by Specifiek Universitair  Magazine (SUM). Another remarkable fact, especially in  comparison with the 60's, is that the PvdA [Labor Party] would  be wiped out.    The figures: The D66 gets almost 30 percent of the student  votes, the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] 19  percent, the GroenLinks [Green Left] 13 percent, the CDA  [Christian Democratic Appeal] 12 percent, and the PvdA only 5  percent. The students make a fairly conscious choice. Almost  half of them determine their choice based on a party's ideas and  principles. This is what should alarm the PvdA most. [passage  omitted]</p>

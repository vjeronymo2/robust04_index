			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Northern Telecom cuts workforce NORTHERN Telecom, the equipment manufacturing affiliate of BCE of Canada, has begun reducing its Canadian operations as part of a plan to reduce the present 58,000 payroll by 9 per cent over the next 18 months, writes Robert Gibbens. Nearly 800 jobs will go with the shutdown of one plant in Ontario and another in Nova Scotia. About 1,200 more jobs will vanish in the remaining 17 Canadian plants. The company says obsolescence is the main reason for the rationalisation. About 2,000 more jobs will be eliminated in the US and several hundred at STC in Britain, acquired by Northern in 1991. Northern took a CDollars 282m restructuring charge in the second quarter to cover rationalisation costs.</p>

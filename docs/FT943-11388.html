			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Gt Southern up 11% as SCI buys more shares Great Southern Group, the besieged UK funeral company, yesterday announced an 11 per cent increase in interim profits and urged shareholders to ignore the current offer by Service Corporation International, the US funeral group. However, SCI executives will fly into London on Sunday night presaging an expected increase in their 600p a share bid for Britain's third largest funeral operator. Mr Bill Heiligbrodt, president of SCI, described the latest document by Great Southern as 'pathetic'. His company bought a further 1.6 per cent of the company's convertible shares yesterday, showing SCI's commitment to the bid. However, the bid remains opposed by JD Field, Great Southern's largest shareholder, which owns 56 per cent. Members of the Field family, and the trustees which control 70 per cent of JD Field, met yesterday to discuss SCI's offer. Mr Christopher Stainforth, managing director of corporate finance at Guinness Mahon, JD Field's advisers, said: 'Everyone is agreed that anything close to Pounds 6 is just not enough.' Great Southern's Pounds 3.82m (Pounds 3.45m) pre-tax profit for the half year to June 30 was set against a 2.5 per cent decline in the mortality rate, and operating profits from its core business of retail funeral services fell to Pounds 2.31m (Pounds 2.38m). The crematoria and cemeteries operations increased profits to Pounds 1.12m (Pounds 1.02m), but the main contributor to growth was its pre-paid funeral business, Chosen Heritage. Great Southern sold 10,500 (9,600) funeral plans in the first half and has started booking profits from the actuarial surplus of funds held from these plans, set against the anticipated costs of the funerals. This contributed Pounds 774,000 (Pounds 552,000 restated). Earnings per share were 19.7p (17.6p) and an interim dividend of 4.5p (4p) is declared. An increased final is forecast for a 14p (12.2p) total. SCI only records profits from its 'pre-need' policies upon completion of the actual burial, and it has attacked Great Southern's accounting treatment. SCI has another week to increase its offer.</p>

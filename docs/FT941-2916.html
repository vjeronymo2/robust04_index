			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Greenhouse faces stoning: Is global warming really such a threat For the past five years global warming has been high on the world's list of environmental worries. Outstripping other 'green' concerns in the scale of its potential impact and in the complexity of its causes, it has offered the environmental movement some of its grandest images of apocalypse. Industrialised countries took the threat so seriously that they made curbing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases the target of a treaty negotiated at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. On Monday, that treaty becomes international law, following ratification by more than 50 countries; signatories will now have to draw up plans for curbing emissions. This week in Geneva, the United Nations has wrestled with proposals for a fund to help developing countries cut emissions too. However, this legislative and bureaucratic effort is misguided, according to Global Warming: Apocalypse or Hot Air?, published this week by the Institute of Economic Affairs. The authors, Roger Bate and Julian Morris, are economists at the institute, a free-market think-tank. The introduction by Wilfred Beckerman, an Oxford economist fond of tilting at environmental exaggerations, urges resistance to the 'cohorts of eco-doomsters who warn us we are living on the edge of the abyss'. Bate and Morris acknowledge that the science which underpins predictions of global warming is not in dispute. Physicists agree that some gases, including carbon dioxide, now referred to as 'greenhouse gases', can trap heat which is emitted from the earth's surface and so prevent it passing into space. The authors take issue, however, with the hypothesis that, if greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere, the planet will warm up. The four leading models of climate change used worldwide suggest that, if carbon dioxide levels double, the world will warm up by between 1.9`C and 5.2`C from existing levels. Among other criticisms, Bate and Morris say such climate models cannot fully explain the warming of about 0.5`C that appears to have taken place this century. Instead, warming may be occurring because monitoring stations are located near cities, which have been getting larger and warmer, they suggest. These complaints are rejected by scientists studying models of climate change, such as Bruce Callander, head of the working party which weighs up scientific research for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In his view: 'It is naive to bring up urbanisation as a problem, because it is recognised and has been thoroughly addressed.' Callander acknowledges that the models have many shortcomings. The behaviour of clouds remains the 'single biggest uncertainty', he says; modellers are not sure whether clouds speed up warming or slow it down. But he adds: 'The modellers themselves are the models' greatest critics.' Scientists admit that the global warming hypothesis is unproven, and that they will need years of further data to know whether predictions are accurate. The authors exaggerate the degree of scientific certainty and do not succeed in establishing that the threat of warming should be dismissed. They are on stronger ground in looking at ways in which economists have tried to compensate for the imperfect state of scientific knowledge in formulating policy. The pamphlet deftly picks holes in the green lobby's favourite claim that measures to improve energy efficiency are a 'no-regrets' policy, providing benefits such as cheaper fuel bills as well as curbing emissions. The authors maintain that, if savings from investing in energy efficiency outstripped the costs, companies and households would have made those changes already. They home in, too, on the spurious precision of 'cost-benefit analysis'  - the technique of comparing the costs and benefits of a particular policy before deciding whether to proceed. The estimates are necessarily tentative, yet are often used as firm predictions; the UK government's recent proposals to tax rubbish dumping are a case in point. But as in their attack on science, the authors are shadow-boxing at targets which are less solid than they claim. For instance, the policies which the authors warn would slow economic growth have not been implemented. The Rio convention, in the watered-down form which finally received international consent, tells countries only to draw up plans for curbing emissions, not to make cuts. And although the authors rail against the European Union's proposals for an energy tax, they seem not to have noticed that the proposals are stalled, if not dead. In addition, the pamphlet's only recommendation - dashed off in two paragraphs - is that all taxes and subsidies on fossil fuels should be removed worldwide. 'This is likely both to reduce emissions and increase global economic output,' Bate and Morris state baldly. The shortcomings of their case are unfortunate, because scepticism about environmental scaremongering is welcome and all too rare. So is the reminder that, in pandering to green populism, governments can put in place policies which are counter-productive and expensive. The Rio convention will encourage governments to grapple with the important question of whether any international agreement to curb carbon dioxide emissions can be binding. Such treaties are almost impossible to police, as the emissions of individual countries are hard to monitor. Further, countries may be tempted to avoid the inconvenience and cost of the curbs, provided they can be satisfied that they will benefit from other countries continuing to observe them. The only contribution which could settle the global warming debate, however, is more data about climate change. In Callander's words, 'in 10 years we may say (scientists' investigation) has been an interesting exercise which came to nothing, or we may say that we were recognising something important happening in the atmosphere. At the moment, though, (the threat) should be taken seriously.' Global Warming: Apocalypse or Hot Air?

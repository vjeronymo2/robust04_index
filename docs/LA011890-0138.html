			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNHAPPY WITH WILSON, GOP GROUP MAKES A PITCH FOR UEBERROTH  </P> <P> So far they are merely pebbles on Pete Wilson's road to the Republican  gubernatorial nomination. But -- undeterred by the odds -- a handful of Los  Angeles area conservatives has launched a desperate effort to get a second name  on the GOP primary ballot: Peter Ueberroth.  </P> <P> Ueberroth, president of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and, until last  year, the commissioner of major league baseball, was unsuccessfully courted a  year ago by both major political parties for the governor's race. He has not  sanctioned the current attempt. But a letter the group says it received from  him in November -- attesting that he had "not made a firm decision" about  running -- was enough to stoke the optimism of the anti-Wilson activists.  </P> <P> "Peter Ueberroth encompasses the qualities that Ronald Reagan did," said Leslie  Dutton of Santa Monica-based California Pro-Family Women's Coalition,  expressing the highest praise imaginable from a conservative.  </P> <P> "You don't often run into a candidate that there's nothing wrong with,"  seconded Paddy Lackey, immediate past president of the Sacramento Suburban  Republican Women and an ally of the local activists.  </P> <P> Not that they have looked deeply into Ueberroth's positions.  </P> <P> Ueberroth has described himself as conservative on business, defense and  foreign policy and more liberal on social issues -- in other words, almost a  twin to Wilson.  </P> <P> Some of the would-be drafters oppose Wilson because of the senator's pro-choice  stand on abortion. But Ueberroth, too, has said he is pro-choice. Not to worry.  </P> <P> "I'm not familiar with that at all," said Dutton, dismissing any conflict.  "Most of us are not familiar with his political background because he's not run  for office."  </P> <P> If not for the issues, why bother mounting such a long-shot campaign, which so  far has drawn only disdain from the Republican Establishment? Because the  activists' reasons for disliking Wilson are many.  </P> <P> They object to the senator's recent campaign proposal that would increase the  number of counselors and other social services providers in the state's school  system. They have not forgiven him for refusing last year to deny party  recognition to gay Republican clubs. And they question his loyalty to the  Republican right, citing his support of moderate Gerald R. Ford over Reagan in  the 1976 presidential race.  </P> <P> But in addition, the group, almost entirely women, is bridling at its limited  influence within the GOP.  </P> <P> Wilson provides a tempting target because he entered the governor's race at the  behest of the state's top Republicans, who were scrambling for a strong  candidate after Gov. George Deukmejian decided against seeking another term.  </P> <P> "They (the disgruntled women) are asked to do the work, and they're not given  any say," Dutton said.  </P> <P> Contacted by The Times, Ueberroth declined to comment. Wilson's office did not  answer requests for comment. And Steve Johnson, executive director of the Los  Angeles County Republican Party, dismissed the group as "12 ladies who have a  lot of people on their stationery."  </P> <P> The group's maiden effort got off to a rocky start. A half-dozen stood outside  a county Republican meeting Tuesday night, handing out flyers asking supporters  to urge Ueberroth to run. The flyers -- which included Ueberroth's Newport  Beach business address -- and the drafters got drenched by rain.  </P> <P> The nonconfrontational tone of their protest disintegrated rapidly, too. As  Dutton and others were readying a press conference, a Ueberroth supporter and a  Wilson backer screamed at each other, concluding their battle with an exchange  of slaps.  </P> <P> "You were yelling in my face," Stephanie Kennedy, the Ueberroth supporter  yelled at the unidentified man who slapped her after she had slapped him.  "You're an animal!"  </P></p>

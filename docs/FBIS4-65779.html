			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Announcer] Well, I'm joined on the line now by  the Tanaiste [Deputy Prime Minister] Dick Spring from County  Cavan, where he was attending the opening of the Ballyconnel  Canal and from Belfast by the Presbyterian minister, the  Reverend Roy McGee, who has been meeting loyalist paramilitaries  regularly to try to wean them away from violence. First, if I  can come to you, Tanaiste. Do you have a sense of heavy irony  attending a cross-border project, which is aimed at  strengthening cross-border links, in the aftermath of this  bombing, or attempted bombing?    [Spring] Well, indeed, Shane, it is one of the ironies of  the  situation that we are here today celebrating a tremendous  project, a north-south project, the big investment from the  international fund for Ireland from the European Union, indeed  both governments, and it's a tremendous opportunity for the  locals in Fermanagh, Cavan, and Leitrim, and obviously we had  what was, would have been another very serious situation in  Dublin over the weekend. I have to say, though, that the Irish  Government, with the British Government, would be very concerned  about all instances of violence, whether they are in Dublin or  in the north or, indeed, in the UK, and we will pursue the  policy of cooperation between the security forces at the highest  level to ensure that the men of violence will not be able to  make any progress.    [Announcer] Did you manage to hear what Jim Molyneaux had to  say in his interview just before you came on?    [Spring] I did. I listened very carefully to what James  Molyneaux was saying. In fact, I listen very carefully at all  times to what Mr. Molyneaux has been saying.    [Announcer] You heard what he said about it being the  inevitable outcome of the Downing Street Declaration? How did  you respond to that?    [Spring] I would dispute that with him, in fact, and I have  on many occasions since the Downing Street Declaration attempted  to draw the attention of Unionists and Loyalists, indeed, to the  Downing Street Declaration and to the benefits for them in the  Downing Street Declaration. Unfortunately, this has not been --  we have not been successful in drawing their attention to it,  but I would also support Mr. Molyneaux's call over the weekend  for the Loyalist paramilitaries to realize that they, too, have  an obligation to end their part in the violence, because,  obviously, we want violence to end from all quarters. And  whereas efforts are being made in terms of the clarification to  end the Provisional violence, efforts must also be made by the  Unionist community to end the Loyalist violence as well.    [Announcer] Well, Jim Molyneaux has appealed for a  cease-fire, but it does appear that there is a threat of further  attacks. Do you agree with what the minister of justice, Maire  Gheoghegan-Quinn, was saying that a ring of steel cannot prevent  earnest bombers and those intent on murder getting through?    [Spring] Well, that obviously would be, I think, a realistic  assessment of the situation. We obviously are going to maintain  the highest level of security possible, both north and south, to  ensure that we contain any threats of aggression or violence,  and also we are going to pursue our political efforts to bring  the talks to -- restarting the talks and to make progress.    [Announcer] Is there any possibility that efforts to control  border security have been, perhaps, too relaxed in recent times,  given the knowledge of the possibility of these attacks?    [Spring] No, I certainly -- perhaps, obviously it's a matter  for the minister of justice to reply, but I can tell you from  the government's point of view there has been no letup in our  pursuit of the violence, or men of violence, from whatever  quarter it comes.

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Avesco drops into red with Pounds 2.3m loss Avesco, the radio and electronic goods and television and film services company, turned in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.26m for the year ended March 31, against a Pounds 1.15m profit last time. Turnover was down from Pounds 19.3m to Pounds 17.9m. The company blamed the figures on the Gulf war, ITV franchise renewals and the recession. It has, however, kept up spending on research and development, with Pounds 3.2m last year being invested mainly in Videologic, its multimedia computer arm which announced a joint venture with IBM this weekend. There was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 960,000 (Pounds 121,000) arising from the disposals of the System Video business and assets of Spaceward. Losses per share were 3.4p against earnings of 2p. No final dividend is recommended (1p), making a total of 0.5p (1.5p).</p>

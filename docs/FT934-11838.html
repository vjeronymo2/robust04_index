			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Glass ceiling 'shows no cracks' ONLY 8 per cent of top executives in Britain are women, and the higher up the corporate hierarchy, the fewer women there are, a survey of 29,000 executives in 533 companies shows. Mr Paul Gregg and Mr Stephen Machin from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the London School of Economics say that women are paid less than men even if working in the same job. 'There does appear to be a glass ceiling blocking the promotion of women to the highest jobs and it does not appear to be cracking,' they conclude. BBC Television has reached its equality target for women in senior positions, three years ahead of schedule, delegates at the Institute of Personnel Management in Harrogate were told yesterday. Is the Glass Ceiling Cracking? National Institute discussion paper No 50. Tel 071 222 7665 ext 201.</p>

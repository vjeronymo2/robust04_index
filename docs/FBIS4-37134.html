			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salih Qallab: "Brahimi Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F> Three Steps To Resolve Yemeni Crisis; They Begin With  Cease-Fire"]    [Text] Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general,  has emphasized that the situation in Yemen is not easy.  However, he said that both sides are aware that the situation  is very serious and that the Yemenis could lose control of the  situation if matters continue as they stand and if the war is  not brought to an end quickly.    Brahimi told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT during his stopover in Amman  that the reality of the past four years has created very  difficult conditions, and that the failure of the attempts to  secure a solution over these years has made matters more  difficult.    The international envoy defined three phases for his current  mission:    First, the two parties must be convinced that the fighting  will lead to nothing but ruin and destruction, and that its  continuation would cause the Yemenis to lose control of the  situation.    Second, after everyone reaches this conviction, they must be  convinced that the solution lies in dialogue and that reaching  an understanding through dialogue is the only way to resolve the  Yemeni crisis.    Third, if the first two steps are achieved and the two sides  sit at the negotiating table, certainly every party is going to  bring its conditions with it...and we will talk about it then.</p>

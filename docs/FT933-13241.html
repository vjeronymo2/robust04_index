			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Indonesian timber flotation suffers setback BARITO Pacific Timber's planned Dollars 250m flotation suffered a setback yesterday with the withdrawal of Salomon Brothers, the US merchant bank, as lead foreign underwriter. Barito is Indonesia's largest integrated timber producer, accounting for 16 per cent of the world plywood market. Its gross profits last year totalled Rp230m (Dollars 113m) on sales of Rp769m. The flotation, consisting of 10 per cent of the company, is expected to value Barito Pacific Timber at about Dollars 2.5bn. Salomon Bros had been asked to co-ordinate and place shares with foreign financial institutions not represented in Indonesia. Salomon Bros would not comment on its withdrawal but the decision resulted from Barito's failure to provide information which 'a reasonable investor would expect to see in the prospectus', explained one banker. An official close to Barito said Indonesian regulations limiting corporate disclosure may have resulted in Salomon Bros having insufficient information to satisfy US regulatory authorities. Barito executives have begun a two-week road show to publicise the flotation which will take in London today, then Scotland, the US, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Brokers said the flotation would proceed, although Makindo Securities, the Indonesian broking house lead-managing the issue, may find it harder to attract foreign investors. Crosby Securities, which specialises in Asian markets, and Schroders, the UK investment bank, were still supporting the flotation, brokers said. Several broking houses, including Wardley James Capel, have published subscribe notes to clients. The issue has been dogged by bad publicity since it was formally announced two weeks ago. Barito executives denied a document, allegedly compiled by government officials, which named the Barito Pacific Group as one of 26 companies in arrears on state bank loans last December. Government officials have refused to confirm or deny the document's authenticity. Executives of Barito Pacific Timber said the company's debt was Dollars 584m at the end of last year and they have letters from the state banks confirming that all Barito Pacific Group subsidiaries were fully servicing their loans. The Barito Pacific Group has more than 100 timber, petrochemical, agribusiness and financial services subsidiaries and a turnover of about Dollars 2.5bn. Mr Prajogo Pangestu, chairman of Barito Pacific Group, declined to give a figure for total group borrowings. 'I know exactly how big our loan exposure is but I cannot disclose it to the public,' said Mr Pangestu, who explained the figure was subject to Indonesia's bank secrecy laws. Last week, Mr Pangestu was summoned to parliament after announcing that Taspen, the largest state pension fund, took a 20 per cent stake in Barito Pacific Timber for Rp375bn last February. The government has said it would review the transaction, along with all of Taspen's investments in private companies. Mr Pangestu defended the deal which he said followed all necessary procedures.</p>

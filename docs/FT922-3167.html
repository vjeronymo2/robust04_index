			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: East Europeans know they are in a mess MEMBERS of the former Soviet bloc are present in Rio in large numbers - not only do they have appalling environmental problems, they also see the occasion as an opportunity to assert their new-found independence. Many of the erstwhile Soviet republics have come: the Baltic states, Belarus, Ukraine, the Caucasian states and the Russian federation. The former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia - as well as Montenegro - are here too. All have agreed to sign all the conference documents. Their message has been that they accept their environments are in a mess and are acting on it. Many have made clear they are not trying to wrest money from the rich industrial nations which might otherwise go to help developing countries deal with global environment problems. However, the former Soviet bloc states have secured the inclusion in conference documents of a reference to the problems of countries 'in transition to market economies', which may qualify them for extra access to financial and technological help. Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, gave the conference a sombre warning: 'If, in the transition to democracy and the market economy system, all these countries do is copy imported western models they will repeat the mistakes already committed in the west, which is in no position to give lessons to anyone where the environment is concerned.'</p>

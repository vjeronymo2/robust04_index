			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Face to face with the interactive future - Diane Summers finds consumer attitudes can affect the development of new media and the influence of advertisers The techno-buffs may be talking excitedly about the convergence of technologies, interactivity, the information superhighway and so on. But for many, the concepts are absurdly futuristic and are to be feared. At the opposite extreme, some consumers are already bored even before the technology has become a reality. Consumer attitudes will clearly affect how new media develop, who users are and how much influence advertisers will be able to wield. Researchers at the London office of advertising agency Ogilvie and Mather decided, therefore, to explore through discussions with groups of consumers, what attitudes are forming. To begin with, the very notion of 'convergence' between televisions and computers appears to be distasteful to many. While the techno-buffs are striving to pull everything together, consumers are fighting to push them apart. The group discussions highlighted the way in which the computer is seen as synonymous with work, while the TV equates with leisure. The last thing many people want is for the two to be confused - a fear particularly strong among 'techno-literate' consumers. The research, which was conducted for O&amp;M by the Hallam Hopper group, was unveiled yesterday. Four sets of group discussions, each of three hours duration, were held with British adults, while two, two-hour groups of 13 and 14-year-olds were also held. Researchers also talked to 16 and 17-year-old 'computer literate' young adults. All groups had access to, for example, CD-Rom, and were able to play games, explore a 3-D atlas and thumb through an interactive Argos shopping catalogue. The groups were also shown a futuristic film of a world where portable screens would be used to conduct a face-to-face meeting, go shopping, carry out an operation and redesign a building. The technology which was presented through a soap opera-style story in the film, still appeared to leave room for traditional family values and meaningful personal relationships. Not surprisingly, some of the discussion group members found it difficult to project themselves into such scenes or the science fiction realms of, for example, virtual reality. Others were cynical about the differences that would be made to their lives. Beth Barry, O&amp;M planning director, says this cynicism is born of experience: 'Ten years ago we were told everybody was going to have hundreds of channels on their television and that video recorders were going to change our lives because we'd all be timeshifting.' The reality is that only about 17 per cent of UK households have cable or satellite and video recorders are mostly used for watching pre-recorded films, she says. People's ability to reduce everything to a 'so what' should never be under-estimated, says Barry. There were comments from the group such as: 'So you can tap into your TV and order up a bottle of Dettol. But, in the end, what you're left with is still a bottle of Dettol.' The technology might be perceived as mundane in certain respects, but the group discussions also unearthed the usual fears about 'the machines taking over' - expressed by the adult technophobes. There were also fears about drowning in information, as well as losing high-quality British TV and the surprises it can offer. The positioning of converging technologies are vitally important to advertisers - whether, for example, entertainment services, home shopping and banking are seen to be extensions of the TV or the computer. If consumer perceptions are that the information superhighway will be routed principally through the TV then the mass market is there to be tapped. However, if advertisers seek the more up-market audiences, there will be more benefit in emphasising the technology's computer pedigree.</p>

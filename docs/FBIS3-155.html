Jerry Rawlings made a one-hour  technical stopover in our country after attending the official  handing over of Walvis Bay to Namibia. Presidents Jose Eduardo  dos Santos and Jerry Rawlings took the opportunity to review the  situation in Angola and Ghana. Shortly before his departure,  Jerry Rawlings told the press that the Angolan Government has  been taking a generous stand in the Angolan conflict.    [Begin Rawlings recording, in English fading into Portuguese  translation] After listening to President Jose Eduardo dos  Santos, I think the Angolan Government has taken a very generous  stand in the Angolan conflict, which has already killed  thousands of people. Because of the unjust war carried out by  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA],  the Angolan people continue to suffer. It is imperative that  UNITA negotiates seriously to find a solution that would bring  lasting peace to Angola. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Prime Minister on Economic Growth; </F> PSL Chief Council Session"]    [Text] On 23 April the Chief Council of the Polish  Peasant Party [PSL] spoke out in favor of a treaty concluded  between Poland and the Holy See in 1993. The council also  expressed its conviction that the June elections to gmina [small  administrative units] councils will be the most important  political event that will enable the establishment of  representative authorities for the next four years. Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak informed the meeting's participants  that the inflation level did not exceed 5 percent in the first  quarter of this year, which means it was the lowest level in  seven years. During the same time frame, output rose by 10  percent.    The resolution states that the concordat regulates relations  between two subjects of international law--that is, Poland and  the Vatican--by defining general rules for cooperation between  church and state. Aleksander Bentkowski reminded the  participants that, in the document, both parties recognized each  other's internal legal provisions and obliged themselves to  respect those provisions. The resolution regarding the document  was adopted by an overwhelming majority of votes, and it was  also stressed that the PSL regards it as harmful to introduce  disputes on the concordat into political campaigns and that that  is why the council spoke in favor of an accelerated rate of  proceedings to ratify the concordat.    "The economic indicators are optimistic, and, from an  economic standpoint, the situation is quite good," the prime  minister said. In the opinion of the government's chief, after  an analysis of wages and salaries in the first quarter, there  are no reasons for concern. As Pawlak reported, wages and  salaries in March rose by about 14 percent and 8.8 percent,  without taking into account salaries from profit [not further  specified]. "And we should keep in mind that, in terms of time,  March is 12 percent longer than February," the prime minister  stressed.    W. Pawlak expressed his hope that talks will be initiated  between the government and the striking miners, and that the  problem will be solved to the employees' advantage.</p>

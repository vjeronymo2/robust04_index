			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F> `g.p.' in Milan; date not given: "Fininvest's Networks Are the  Worst"]    [Text] Milan -- [LA REPUBBLICA] Mr. Bossi, have you heard  Prime Minister Berlusconi's statement about RAI?    [Bossi] Does he want to return to the past?    [LA REPUBBLICA] Berlusconi says that a situation in which  the  public service goes against the government is an anomaly.    [Bossi] Taking this bit in isolation, the reasoning is not  at  all absurd, but...    [LA REPUBBLICA] What?    [Bossi] But heading the government is someone who already  has  three TV networks which daily manipulate people's ideas, second  by second. It is enough just to look at what they are doing  right now. In this situation, to give the government RAI would  be like giving it six TV channels.    [LA REPUBBLICA] You then like the idea of a public  television  which is asked to be attuned to the government?    [Bossi] Normally speaking, in a balanced and democratic  system, whose government does not include one person with three  TV networks, it makes sense to have a public TV, one which  supports and emphasizes the government's action. This support  should not be blind but aimed at the stability of the country, a  support which does not harm the opposition. The situation in  Italy is not like this. We have inherited the moral and  party-dominated decadence of RAI. In addition, we have --  something which has never happened before in a civilian or  noncivilian country -- one person owning three networks and  being the head of government. What is clear is that, beyond the  chit-chat, it is Fininvest which is in the line of fire.    [LA REPUBBLICA] And then?    [Bossi] The logical solution is to break the duopoly, that  of  RAI and of private TV. But it seems to me that there is no wish  to change this situation, to achieve a solution rapidly.  Whatever the declarations are, the problem is to break the  duopoly. The League has been repeating this for years.    [LA REPUBBLICA] RAI and Fininvest, which of them functions  most poorly?    [Bossi] RAI, for all the damage it has done, is nothing  compared with Fininvest's closed and implacable system.  Berlusconi manipulates his televisions much more than RAI has  ever done. Where do we put the Fininvest of the last few days?  Here we would have to sack [media watchdog] Santaniello; one no  longer understands what game he is playing.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Berlusconi says the RAI problem will be  placed on the government's agenda, a government which includes  five League ministers. What will you do?    [Bossi] When the time comes, we will see. We will see, don't  you worry. I repeat that we wish to get out of the duopoly.  The League voters are not the upper crust, but normal people,  workers, artisans, small industrialists. For them, no duopoly.  This is the choice we must make for the good of the country.</p>

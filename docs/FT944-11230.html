			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (9): Foreign investors spur exports - The turnaround in China's trade performance China, in the first nine months of 1994, registered a marked turnaround in its trading performance with exports growing much faster than imports. To the end of September exports exceeded imports by Dollars 1.38bn compared with last year's trade deficit of Dollars 12.2bn. Not only does this reverse last year's slowing of export growth, but the figures also reveal that foreign-funded enterprises are leading the way in generating exports. This is in line with the government's foreign investment strategy aimed at using foreign funds to build a strong exporting base. In the first six months of the year exports of foreign-funded enterprises (which include wholly foreign-owned and joint ventures) leapt by about 45 per cent over the same period last year, and are now running at one-third of China's total exports. For the nine months to September, exports increased by 29.7 per cent over last year to Dollars 79.44bn. Imports reached Dollars 78.06bn in the nine months, growing by 15.2 per cent. This compares with import growth last year of about 30 per cent. The export surge has been attributed partly to the unification on January 1 of the Chinese yuan resulting in an effective 50 per cent devaluation and partly to China's economic stabilisation programme introduced in July last year which squeezed opportunities at home, making external markets more attractive. Chinese trade officials have also been encouraged by the changing composition of exports. Miao Fuchun, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec), noted that in the first six months of this year the 'export mix continued to improve as demonstrated by further expansion of the proportion of exports of manufactured goods.' These now account for 83 per cent of total exports, an increase of 3 percentage points over the previous year. Exports of machinery and electronics items continue to grow strongly and comprise a bigger proportion of total exports at 24.8 per cent for the half-year compared with 23.6 per cent for the same period last year. In this new phase of its economic development China is seeking to encourage growth of higher technology investment at the expense of low technology industrial processing which provides low returns and is a drain on scarce energy resources. While China's trading performance has taken a sharp turn for the better this year, it is the wider issues of trade reform and Beijing's application to re-enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that have preoccupied trade officials. At home, China introduced its first-ever 'Foreign Trade Law' on July 1 and abroad its officials were enmeshed in difficult negotiations on Gatt entry. The new foreign trade law is in part China's answer to Gatt-related criticism of a lack of transparency in its trading rules. One of the more persistent gripes is that in negotiations with Chinese officials reference is often made to unpublished regulations, many of which tend to be discriminatory. Governments and businesses have criticised the lack of consistency in trading regulations between Chinese provinces and regions. In response, Mr Miao, the Moftec spokesman, says that China intends to spend three years on building up 'a fairly complete system of foreign economic and trade law and regulations.' Trade authorities have also pledged to improve the system of tax rebates for exports. Exporting enterprises, which are obliged to import raw materials or semi-finished products, are often at loggerheads with the authorities over customs and other rebates. China has also opened further its export sector by encouraging the activities of a growing number of trading corporations - 'whereas in 1978 (the year that China resolved to open to the world) foreign trade was monopolised by 12 Foreign Trade Corporations, today over 3,600 FTC's compete increasingly fiercely for export business,' says a recent World Bank study*. This year China also opened to tender exports of items subject to quota. Initially, 13 such items were offered, including foodstuffs and raw materials. Trade officials say the process will be extended to cover all items covered by quota. Overshadowing the complex issue of internal trade reform, however, are China's difficult negotiations on Gatt re-entry. While officials insist that Beijing has reached the limit of 'concessions' it is prepared to make to become Gatt-consistent, US negotiators are demanding further progress on a range of issues. In October, Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy US Trade Representative, said China would need to 'put its foot on the gas pedal' if it were to meet requirements of Gatt-entry in time for it to become a founder-member of the World Trade Organisation. The US, which represents the Gatt-community in negotiations with Beijing, has focused on key areas of trade reform in which it says China has made insufficient progress to satisfy Gatt-requirements. These include access to the services sector, financial and non-financial, and enforcement of regulations prohibiting infringement of intellectual property rights. Ms Barshefsky said that the US expected China to eliminate 'rampant' piracy in the audio-visual and computer software sectors. She also complained strongly about agricultural import bans saying restrictions were of 'serious concern with respect to China's agricultural schedule in the Gatt-WTO accession.' The stage has thus been set for a tough final stage of negotiations. Li Zhongzhou, director general of the Department of International Trade and Economic Relations, said China would consider abandoning the Gatt and going its own way, thus threatening a 'chaotic situation' in world trade. Mr Li said China had reduced tariffs across the board by 55 per cent, and had also committed itself to phase out most quota restrictions by 1997 in its efforts to satisfy Gatt requirements. But progress in tariff reform is perhaps less impressive than officials suggest. As the 1994 World Bank study* on China's Trade Reform reported, 'China's tariffs remain higher, more numerous and more dispersed than those of most other large developing countries.' China's interest in securing Gatt membership is attributable to its desire to be a founder WTO-member and, perhaps more important, to its interest in benefiting from the Uruguay round liberalisation, which is dependent on Gatt accession. The World Bank estimates that if protection levels in the EU the US and Japan were reduced by 50 per cent, China's exports would increase by an estimated 38 per cent, or Dollars 11.4bn, in terms of 1988 prices. China would also benefit from Uruguay round tariff cuts that would erode the preference margins other developing countries enjoy, and China does not, under the Generalised System of Preferences. It is little wonder that China prizes Gatt entry so highly. Of all the world's big trading nations, it probably has most to gain. * China: Foreign Trade Reform.

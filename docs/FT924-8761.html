			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Bonn sees bankruptcies rise The slowdown in the west German economy is causing an increasing number of bankruptcies in small and medium-sized companies, writes Judy Dempsey in Bonn. The failure rate reached 839 in August, a rise of 13.4 per cent over the same month a year ago. Over the first eight months of this year, 6,374 companies filed for bankruptcy, an increase of 12.5 per cent over the same period in 1991, while the total number of officially announced insolvency cases increased to 9,235, or 6.7 per cent, according to the Federal Statistics Office. The German finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, said the D-Mark was under exaggerated upward pressure, Reuter reports from Bonn. In a speech prepared for delivery in Bonn, he said tight curbs in public spending would help to make lower interest rates possible. 'Lower interest rates would remove the exaggerated upwards pressure on the mark. The competitive situation of our companies will also be noticeably improved as a result,' he said.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Property: Manhattan pick-me-up - Is the construction cycle turning? Cranes are a rare sight in Manhattan these days. No new office buildings have been started in several years. None has been completed this year, and there were only two completions last year. But in 12 months, the long metal arms may once again begin to claw their way between the towers of midtown. Is Manhattan ready for new office construction? The first big hole in the ground could come courtesy of Mr Howard Ronson, cousin of UK businessman Mr Gerald Ronson, who is proposing to construct an 800,000 sq ft tower on a site between Madison and Park avenues. After their experience of the 1980s, lenders are said to be holding back on the project finance until enough prospective tenants have signed up. Is the construction cycle turning? After the beating the rental market took in the 1980s, there are signs that the sector is picking up - in midtown, at least. While the downtown office market, with a vacancy rate of more than 20 per cent, still faces some acute problems, the overall vacancy rate in Manhattan's bigger and more active office market has been edging down since last year, and now stands at about 12 per cent. Also, rents are showing signs of picking up from the bottom they touched during 1992 and last year. These turnrounds hardly look significant. As the accompanying charts indicate, there is plenty of lost ground to make up after the slide in rents since the start of the decade, and much of the new office space that came on the market at the end of the 1980s has yet to absorbed. But these overall figures do not tell the full story. First, space. 'The headline (vacancy) rate still looks comparatively high,' says Mr Murray Keith, managing director of Baring Advisors, the real estate arm of Barings, the investment banking group. 'But quality space of over 50,000 sq ft is getting difficult to find.' That is a sentiment echoed by most other real estate professionals in New York this year. Manhattan's archetypal tenant - a bank looking for high-quality space with ample room for large trading floors - is experiencing increasing difficulty in finding the right accommodation. The headline figures on rents also tell only a small part of the story. More important than changes in basic rent levels in the past 18 months has been a steep fall in the concessions that landlords have had to offer to attract tenants, says Mr Josh Kuriloff, a director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a New York real estate company. Rent-free grace periods have fallen from an average of 12-18 months to 6-12 months, he adds. Also, the money landlords need to spend on construction or improvements before a tenant moves in has fallen from about Dollars 50-Dollars 60 a sq ft to Dollars 30-Dollars 40. It is not difficult to see what lies behind these trends. New York city's economy is still emerging fitfully from recession. The number of jobs available, for example, only began to increase this year. The financial services industry, however, has been enjoying a heady period. Many of the new tenants of recent months have been banks expanding or shifting part or all of their operations to new premises as their old leases expire (including Bear Stearns, S G Warburg) Tenants can often move to superior quality space in better locations at less rent than under old leases signed during the boom years in the 1980s. What of demand for midtown office space in 1995 and beyond? The investment banking industry, for one, is just entering a period of uncertainty. Few expect an early return to the soaring financial markets of 1993. That has a knock-on effect on demand for accountants, lawyers and other associated services. At the same time, some financial services businesses - including Swiss Bank Corp and MasterCard - are planning to move most of their business out of Manhattan altogether. SBC is drawn by the prospect of purpose-built trading floors in relatively low-cost Stamford, Connecticut. Such plans stir memories of the 1980s, when New York lost companies such as Exxon, Mobil and J C Penney - though some other financial companies which have talked of leaving in recent years have decided to stay, often after extracting tax concessions from the city. All of this suggests that demand is unlikely to soar. And in the background is the threat that US companies will continue to shrink their overall need for office space, finding better or more efficient ways of running their operations (aided by advances in information technology). With these cautions, it seems that demand is set to remain steady for the foreseeable future - while supply, in the shape of Mr Ronson's development and others, will take time to hit the market. That implies a further firming of rents, though nothing significant. The investment market, meanwhile, has been gathering its own head of steam. With few big properties on the market, prices for those that are being sold have climbed. Bertelsmann, the German publishing group, bought 1540 Broadway in 1992 for less than Dollars 150 a sq ft, the first big transaction of the decade. Since then, prices have risen past Dollars 200 a sq ft - the price paid for an IBM building earlier this year - to touch Dollars 250 (near the level reached for the Metropolitan Tower and, more recently, a small 80,000 sq ft building on Fifth Avenue owned by the UK's National Westminster bank). The last time prices hit Dollars 250 a sq ft was in 1989, says Mr Woody Heller, director of investment sales at surveyor Jones Lang Wooton USA. The Chase Manhattan building at 410 Park, which is being sold throug JLW, is probably the only midtown property of any size to have come onto the market recently. This year, there have been 15 sales, compared with 13 last year and 12 in 1992, says Mr Heller. This is a long way from the frenzy of the mid-1980s. And while the real estate market bubbles with talk of an influx of south-eastern investors  - mainly from Hong Kong - it is notably less frenetic than the last eastern invasion, from Japan, during the 1980s. The greatest symbol of that era, the Rockefeller Centre, 80 per cent of which was bought by Mitsubishi in the mid-1980s, faces an uncertain future. Mitsubishi warned last month that it may not pay the interest on the Dollars 1.3bn mortgage on the property. And if Mitsubishi eventually sells, says one investment manager, then it could provide an excuse for other Japanese owners to retreat as well.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- Ukraine may interrupt the  disarmament of its nuclear weapons. This was indicated by  Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetsky in a talk with  journalists during his visit to the Defense Ministry in Bonn on  Monday [11 April]. He pointed out that, so far, Russia has not  fulfilled its promise of delivering nuclear fuel rods for  Ukrainian power stations. In return, Kiev had promised nuclear  disarmament. If Moscow does not provide the nuclear fuel,  everything must be renegotiated, Radetsky stressed. [passage  omitted]</p>

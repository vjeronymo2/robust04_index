			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Matif picks brokers for new currency option trade The Matif, the French futures exchange, has appointed 15 members to act as associated brokers on its new currency options contracts, due to be launched on May 20. The options, on the dollar/D-Mark and dollar/French franc exchange rates, are aimed primarily at corporate treasurers, whose preferences have been taken into account in the structuring of the contracts, according to the Matif. The new products are also targeted at fund managers. Corporate treasurers often complain that currency options are too expensive in the over-the-counter market. The Matif options could provide a cheaper alternative, but there are concerns that the contracts will not prove sufficiently liquid. Currency options are already traded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. A previous attempt by London's Liffe to trade foreign exchange options ended in failure in 1990, when the contracts were de-listed due to chronically low volume. 'I think we will have the same sort of clients as on the Philly, but with more European participants,' said one broker. She noted that although the Philadelphia exchange opened very early in the morning, smaller market participants may not bother to call the US. The associated brokers have undertaken to maintain a trading team in the currency options pit, and to trade a minimum volume in each contract. The list includes French subsidiaries of BZW, Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber, as well as French brokers.</p>

"There's no alternative," said Pietro Larizza,  secretary-general of the UIL [Italian Federation of Trade  Unions] labour federation. "If the new executive decides to  interrupt the present model of economic and welfare state  management, room would emerge for concern and hostility since  our productive system would be headed for economic adventures."  "In other words," he explained, "the ball is now in the court  of whoever offers himself to lead the country. Italy's hopes of  emerging from the crisis depend on what government programme he  offers."    Concern over governability after the elections also emerged  from the observations of Guglielmo Epifani, assistant  secretary-general at the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of  Labor] labour federation, by far the country's largest, ahead of  the CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] and the UIL, in  that order. "The platforms presented by the Right are very  distant from the unions are proposing," he said. "Certainly, if  I were to go by the platforms circulating during the election  campaign, I would have reason for alarm," added Raffaele Morese,  assistant secretary- general at the CISL, who added that people  now had to get used to alternation between opposition and  government.    "It remains to be seen how the electoral alliance will be  transformed in a government alliance," he added as top union  officials said a meeting of the Big Three labour federations  already scheduled tomorrow for consultations on trade-union  unity would now devote some time to the political situation.  "One can imagine Italy with the most laissez-faire government  in its history," added Morese, "but you certainly can't imagine  it with higher inflation or high unemployment."    Morese also noted in a warning footnote that the new  government could "theoretically" decide its majority is all it  needs to govern: "But the case of the Balladur government in  France is a lesson; when you decide without the consent of the  other partners to the social pact, you may be forced into  reverse by what happens in the streets."    Morese's superior at the CISL, Secretary-General Sergio  D'Antoni, agreed that judgement should be suspended until the  government platform is clear, but the Berlusconi cartel has  "distinguished itself only for its contradictory proposals, with  a touch of laissez-faire, corporativism, a vocation to state  interventionism and secessionist temptations."    In an article to be published by a trade-union periodical  tomorrow, D'Antoni said the premises for the unions' position  remains a debate in a "constructive spirit" on "work, employment  and social equity."    On the extreme right, the CISNAL [Italian Confederation of  National Trade Unions] labour federation, the neo-Fascist labour  organisation whose political equivalent is now the National  Alliance, also pledged firm support for keeping social  insurance, health and education in government hands, against  plans from other members of the Berlusconi cartel for radical  privatisation. "If anything," said the CISNAL, "the systems for  managing social welfare programmes must be re-designed and their  objectives renewed so as to re-establish efficiency and  administrative transparency."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It seems as if the government and the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] are finally  reaching agreements on specific principles and modalities of  national reconciliation and may soon close down this topic.  Today, more than ever before, the news blackout was reinforced  in Lusaka. The only information that our correspondent in  Lusaka was able to obtain is that the negotiating teams continue  to meet and in view of the time they took for discussions [words  indistinct]. Pedro Manuel reports.    Good evening! The press was not able to obtain any kind of  information on the peace talks between the government and UNITA  today. This is because, first, the morning session lasted more  than usual and second, after this afternoon's session, the  negotiating teams began to hold their own meetings, which are  still going on. According to reports, the parties are expected  to once and for all conclude discussions on specific principles  and modalities of national reconciliation. The information that  only two points remain to be discussed in this topic, has not  been denied yet.    What is more, in view of today's intense movement it is very  probable that the mediators have set a deadline to reach an  agreement on national reconciliation. Sources here say the  parties have already reached agreements on issues such as  administrative decentralization and UNITA's participation in the  country's administration.</p>

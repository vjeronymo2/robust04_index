			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Singapore Minister  of Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng criticized the United States today  for trying to impose its system on Singapore concerning the  caning sentence on an American teenage vandal.    In recent weeks, much has been said about caning as a form  of  punishment in Singapore, he noted when addressing the official  opening of two prisons here this morning.    He said some in the American media had gone so far as to  equate caning to torture because caning caused pain and possibly  permanent cane marks. And they called caning a "cruel",  "inhuman" or "unusual" punishment.    "It is absurd that societies so stricken with crime should  attempt to apply their standards on us and teach us what to do,"  the minister said.    The United States should not "try to impose its system on  others" since even in the United States, it does not have a  criminal justice system that is universally applied in every one  of the 50 states, he said.    The American teenager, Michael Fay, 18, was sentenced here  last month to four months imprisonment, a fine of 3,500  Singapore dollars, and six strokes of the cane.    "Nobody takes any joy in carrying out these strict  punishments, be it imprisonment, caning or execution. But if it  has to be done, it must be done," Wong said.    "Laws will not be effective if the penalties are not  sufficiently strict. Only then will these laws have the desired  punitive and deterrent effects," he added.    "In Singapore, our own experience has convinced us that  strict laws, rigorous and impartial enforcement and a fair and  transparent judicial system have made our country relatively  crime-free," the minister said.</p>

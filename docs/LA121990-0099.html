			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> AT&amp;T to Lower Some Rates: The telecommunications giant said it would cut  interstate and international long-distance rates for consumers and  small-business consumers by $33 million a year, effective Jan. 1. The cuts,  which reflect lower fees that AT&amp;T will pay in 1991 to local phone firms  for access to customer lines, include: a 1.1% drop for basic long-distance  service from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays, and a reduction in charges on calls  from the U.S. mainland to the area formerly known as East Germany.  </P></p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Divided opposition hands victory to Moi: Whole tribes come out against ruling party EARLY returns from Kenya's elections showed yesterday the country had voted on divisive tribal lines with President Daniel arap Moi heading for victory on a minority of the vote because of a split among opposition supporters among three main challengers. For the first time in Kenya's history, however, yesterday's provisional results revealed the extent of the unpopularity of the ruling party Kanu and the solid opposition of several provinces and tribes to the continued rule of Mr Moi. The results also showed that the opposition would have swept to power if it had agreed an electoral pact and united behind one presidential candidate instead of fragmenting into different parties based on tribalism and personal greed for power. Political observers said last night that Mr Moi faced a considerable challenge in trying to rule a divided Kenya. With results in the presidential race announced in 51 of 188 constituencies by last night Mr Moi had won 600,377 (48 per cent) out of 1.2m votes counted. Mr Moi's lead was artificially inflated by the early declaration of many results from his power base of Rift Valley province. Mr Kenneth Matiba, the presidential candidate of Ford-Asili, was leading the race for second place with 359,345 votes (29 per cent), well ahead of seven other contenders. In the eight constituencies of the Rift Valley, a Kanu heartland and home to Mr Moi's Kalenjin people and other pastoralist minority tribes, which had declared results by last night Mr Moi had won more than 93 per cent of the presidential vote. He was also drawing strong support from Coast province and from Northeastern province, which has been closed off to opposition activity by the government. In Western province Mr Moi was in second place behind Mr Matiba with four results declared. In the Coast, however, the first results from the provincial capital of Mombasa town in Changamwe constituency showed a large vote for Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Presidential candidate of Ford-Kenya, reflecting the influence of the banned Islamic Party of Kenya which did an electoral pact with Ford-Kenya. The IPK was expected to continue to have a favourable impact on votes for Ford-Kenya in Kwale and Mombasa districts of Coast province as more results are announced. Ford Kenya was last night sweeping three of the four districts of Nyanza province, the homeland of Mr Odinga's Luo tribe. Other opposition parties, led by Mr Matiba, were also hammering Mr Moi and Kanu in Central and Nairobi provinces, homeland of the powerful and disenchanted Kikuyu tribe. In the five of 30 constituencies which had declared presidential results by last night Mr Moi had won a mere 3 per cent. Mr Matiba led the presidential race in Nairobi and Central provinces led with nearly 75 per cent of the vote. 'Moi is going to face a crisis of governability after the elections because it is impossible to rule Kenya without the Kikuyu and the Kikuyu have now declared forcefully they are completely in opposition to Moi,' said Mr David Throup, a Kenya specialist at Keele University who observed the elections.

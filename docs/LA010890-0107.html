			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FUJITSU TOUTS FASTER COMPUTER  </P> <P> Fujitsu Ltd. said today it has developed a "super neural computer" with  processing speeds several hundred times faster than that of models on the  market.  </P> <P> A prototype built by Fujitsu Laboratories links 256 digital signal processors  in parallel to achieve processing speeds of 500 million connection updates per  second, a company spokesman said.  </P> <P> This is several hundred times faster than models sold by U.S. companies and  about 2,000 times quicker than neural network simulations run on engineering  workstations, he said.  </P> <P> Neural networks simulate the workings of the brain, which through its network  of interconnected neurons and synapses is capable of processing tremendous  quantities of data and performing many tasks simultaneously.  </P> <P> No date has been set for commercializing the Fujitsu system.  </P></p>

Availing himself of  this opportunity, President Ion Iliescu said before the NATO  Council: `As a true partner, Romania wishes to work ever closer  with NATO and to strengthen its ties with the structures of the  alliance, to draw closer to them, by taking part in any form of  cooperation open to the Central European countries. Besides the  immediate positive effects, all this would be of a nature to  contribute to creating the prerequisites for reaching the  strategic aim which is Romania's joining the North Atlantic  Alliance. This would offer the necessary guarantees for a  normal evolution of the irreversible process of Romania's  democratization.'    "Subsequent to these official efforts made by the president,  which were among the first statements of this kind on the topic  of permitting the countries in this part of Europe access to  NATO, messages were addressed on two different occasions -- in  September and December 1993 -- to NATO heads of state and NATO  Secretary General Woerner, including President Iliescu's  considerations on the role of NATO in maintaining security in  Central and East Europe, and the official position relative to  the inclusion in the alliance of the countries in this part of  Europe.    "Those messages were well received by the member states of  the alliance and found by the greatest part of their  representatives as most welcome, straightforward, and clearly  worded," the presidential spokesman said.    On receiving the letter from the president of Romania, the  representatives of several (NATO) states made a point of showing  that they would support Romania in its strive for integration in  NATO and other Euro-Atlantic structures, knowing that Romania  was resolutely committed to the course of democratization and  the rule of law, and therefore it should stay in the family of  the democratic European states.    It was also shown that Romania's security interests would be  considered, as well as its readiness to assume responsibilities  in ensuring security in Europe.    A positive assessment was made of the way Romania responded  to the initiative of Partnership for Peace, which several member  countries see as a transitional stage in the gradual extension  process of the alliance.    The message of the Romanian president was unanimously  appreciated as a significant signal for the priority Romania  gives to enlarging its political, economic, and security  relations with the Western countries, the spokesman for the  presidency said.</p>

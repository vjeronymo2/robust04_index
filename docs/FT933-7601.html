			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Germany's challenge THE THIRD year of unification has, says the latest OECD report on Germany, brought 'mixed results'. So, indeed, it has. It has brought a deep recession, for one thing and declining inflation, for another. Fortunately, German economic policy should soon weigh less heavily on its neighbours, even if its own struggle with unification will remain long and arduous. The immediate economic effect of unification on the east German economy was collapse: in 1991 east German real gross domestic product fell by 31 per cent. For west Germany and its neighbours, however, it was expansionary. With German demand rising still faster than did output, its current account swung from a huge surplus of 5 per cent of GDP in 1989 to a deficit of 1 1/2 per cent in 1992, to the delight of its European neighbours. The delight was not to last. The inflationary effects of unification were a red rag to the Bundesbank, already provoked by Mr Kohl's casual treatment at the time of the monetary unification. Monetary policy was bound to tighten, particularly in response to the wage push of 1991 and 1992. But the Bundesbank is finding it particularly difficult to lower inflation this time, largely because inflationary pressure has emanated from the public sector, private services and housing and construction, while inflation in the internationally exposed sectors is already less than 2 per cent. However difficult lowering inflation may prove, nothing will stop the Bundesbank from trying. Given the tight monetary policy, the dwindling away of the fiscal stimulus and the length of the preceding expansion, it is hardly surprising that the German economy shrank at an annual rate of 1.5 per cent in the second half of 1992. In addition, says the OECD, it will shrink by 3.2 per cent in the first half of 1993, with a weak recovery expected only next year. When the Germany economy catches a cold, its ERM-tied neighbours are certain to sneeze. What has aggravated the disturbance has been the instability in German policies and economic performance. This at least should soon end. From the smoke of the past few years should emerge a Germany with massive, but manageable, structural problems. The economy of eastern Germany is in ruins. The share of manufacturing in eastern Germany's value-added, for example, is down to 14 per cent, while the transfer-supported level of demand is almost double the total value-added. Eastern Germany needs a growth miracle. With hourly wages in 1992 65 per cent of the west German level, but output per worker at only 40 per cent, it is unlikely to enjoy one. This will leave western Germany with a huge transfer burden. Transfers are about 5 per cent of west German GDP this year and are likely to remain that high for years. Nevertheless, the OECD believes the fiscal position is containable. The ratio of gross public debt to GDP should not much exceed 60 per cent by 2000, even with trend growth of only 2 per cent a year. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank is likely to ensure modest inflation, but reduce short term interest rates substantially quite soon. With an external deficit, as west German savings continue to flow eastward, this should mean a weak exchange rate (both nominal and real). The first consequence of German unification was economic expansion. The second was contraction. The third, likely to last rather longer than the first two, should be recovery. Meanwhile, Germany's neighbours should enjoy greater competitiveness against the rest of the world, combined with reasonably stable exchange rates against the D-Mark and considerably lower short-term interest rates. Germany is only at the beginning of its long voyage towards economic and social integration. But with luck, both it and the rest of Europe will soon see the haven of recovery.</p>

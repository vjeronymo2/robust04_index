			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sao Paulo - After visiting the 20th Century  Brazilian biennial art exhibit in Sao Paulo yesterday, Finance  Minister Rubens Ricupero said "the real will begin circulating  even before approval of the provisional measure, which will be  reedited as many times as necessary." Ricupero said the text  will include the salary adjustment measures that were negotiated  with Congress.    The minister said the new text sets forth that the  government  will compensate any salary loss caused by the conversion into  URV's [Real Value Units]. He reiterated that the president will  "shortly" announce the implementation of the new currency, but  he did not specify the date. The minister said the period  between the announcement and the implementation of the new  currency can be longer than the 35 days provided for by the  provisional measure. Ricupero said the provisional measure that  creates the real has not yet been drawn up. He said: "This will  follow the presidential announcement."    The minister said he does not believe the rural bloc will  impede approval of the provisional measure again. "The bloc is  not that big, there has been some exaggeration," he said, adding  that the provisional measure should be approved in May, with the  support of other parties. "Even if it is not approved, it will  not delay the implementation of the real," he said, pointing out  that the measure can be reedited an unspecified number of times.  "Provisional measures operate as laws and come into force as of  the time they are submitted to Congress," he explained. [passage  omitted]</p>

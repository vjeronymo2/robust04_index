The final details were decided during a meeting last night  among President Itamar Franco, Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso, the economic team, six other ministers, and  the counsel general in Planalto Palace.    The final details of the provisional measure to implement  the  URV were decided last night during a meeting in Planalto Palace  that lasted nearly nine hours. Three subjects were decided  during the meeting: First, the minimum salary value as of  tomorrow will be $64 or $65. Social Security Minister Sergio  Cutolo, who also attended the meeting, recalled that with the  URV, pensioners and retired workers will obtain an average  increase of 17 percent.    It has also been decided that the Labor Ministry will begin  preparing a law on collective labor bargains. Finance Minister  Cardoso has said that with the implementation of the URV,  workers will no longer need to struggle to recover their lost  purchasing power because this will no longer happen. In the  future, they will struggle for real wage increases.    Minister Cardoso said the provisional measure to establish  the URV, which is published today in the Official Gazette,  includes mechanisms to stop abusive price increases. Prices  will not be converted into URV's. The minister guaranteed that  this does not represent a price freeze.    [Begin Cardoso recording] In case of price abuses, the  provisional measure includes a provision that allows the Finance  Ministry to summon private or public oligopolies and companies  to explain why their prices surpassed the average price increase  of the previous four months. We will then discuss how these  oligopolies can transform their prices into URV's. Oligopolies  are also free to resort to their industry associations to  achieve a negotiated solution. There will be no price freeze,  but there will be a mechanism to force those who commit price  abuses to lower them in keeping with normal market costs. [end  recording]    The finance minister said the economic program is supported  by the whole government. He said that neither private or public  sector workers will loose their purchasing power with the  conversion of their salaries into URV's based on the average  increases of the previous four months. The finance minister  said the main objective of the URV is to recover the workers  purchasing power.    The finance minister will today meet at 0830 [1130 GMT] with  the chief editors of the main newspapers, radio and television  stations to give a detailed explanation of all the changes that  will come with the implementation of the economic stabilization  plan and the URV in people's lives.</p>

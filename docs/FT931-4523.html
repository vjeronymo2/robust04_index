			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Aer Lingus executive resigns MR Cathal Mullan, chief executive of Aer Lingus, the Irish Republic's national airline, resigned last night and was replaced by Mr Bernie Cahill, the state-owned company's chairman, Our Foreign Staff reports. The appointment of Mr Cahill was announced in a statement in the Dail by Transport Minister Brian Cowen, who said the government would be prepared to support 'convincing and visible action' by Mr Cahill to solve Aer Lingus's problems. He made it clear a large cash injection was out of the question. Reports earlier yesterday had indicated that Aer Lingus, already facing losses running into hundreds of millions of pounds, stood to lose around IPounds 90m (Pounds 91m) this year alone. Mr Cowen denied reports that a cabinet sub-committee, established to monitor the Aer Lingus position, and headed by premier Albert Reynolds, had plans to call in international consultants to advise on the airline's future. Earlier this year it was reported that Aer Lingus was considering shedding 500 of its 7,000-strong work force as part of a survival plan and seeking more government cash aid.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE'S ORDINANCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS  </P> <P> Having read your editorial Jan. 15, I am compelled to write to you.  </P> <P> I find it very disturbing that there are so many otherwise normal people who  try to excuse the aberration known as homosexuality.  </P> <P> I do not advocate violence toward the poor unfortunates who are trapped in this  behavior, but I do believe that they should have the decency to keep their  activities private. Heterosexuals are expected to do as much. The only  motivation for all the publicity and propaganda favoring homosexuality (and  there is a great deal of it in movies, television and newspapers) is to snare  other borderline or unformed individuals into their life style. Have we not  enough of AIDS and other problems engendered by them without having the media  producing apologies for them?  </P> <P> Again, I do not care what they do in private. I only ask that they keep their  activities private and cease proselytizing.  </P> <P> BARBARA G. THOMAS  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES ended the week in a dull mood with dealers awaiting next week's autumn statement and further news on a cut in base rates, writes Joel Kibazo. The December FT-SE future opened at 2,737 and after a brief squeeze was led lower by 'locals' - independent traders - in thin trading. Thereafter, the contract traded in a narrow range of 2,725 and 2,735, with the afternoon proving to be as dull as the morning. The premium was well below that seen in recent sessions, being between 5 to 15 points throughout the session. December finished at 2,732, down 7 on Thursday's close and around 12 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 17. Turnover was 6,146 lots. Traded options were equally featureless and volume was a poor 21,808 contracts. The FT-SE options 100 contract accounted for 4,556 of the total and the Euro-FT-SE 100 option 826 lots. Asda was once again the most active stock option with a day's total of 4,377 trades. &amp;</p>

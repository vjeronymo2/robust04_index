			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free  Democrats (SZDSZ) is the only force which may counterbalance the  excessive power of the Hungarian Socialist Party. This will be  at stake in the second round of the parliamentary elections,  SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto told a news conference tonight.    "The Free Democrats are satisfied with their result, namely  the acquisition of 20 percent of votes in the first round," Peto  said. In his view, high voter participation is a success of  Hungarian democracy. As a result, the government to be formed  will have a great deal of legitimacy. "The SZDSZ has achieved  its main goal: the government has been dismissed," Peto said.</p>

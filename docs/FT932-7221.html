			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / EC leaders likely to consider strategy to create extra jobs EUROPEAN Community leaders are likely to consider a strategy for tackling unemployment in the EC which would create more jobs than economic recovery on its own is expected to produce. A document which the Commission is expected to adopt tomorrow says unemployment could be cut by measures such as reducing employers' social security contributions and encouraging the sharing-out of jobs. There are now 17.4m EC citizens without jobs, 10.3 per cent of the workforce. The framework policy, which was approved in its essentials yesterday by the chefs de cabinet of the Commission, puts forward a jobs-crisis agenda for the next three presidencies of the EC, to the end of 1994. But the so-called 'Community-wide framework for employment' avoids any challenge to Europe's welfare states. The document says a return to the high economic and productivity growth of the late 1980s 'would still leave the Community well short of a target such as 5 per cent unemployment'. But the Commission confidently states that 'there is sufficient evidence and experience to suggest that ways of, at least, improving the situation can be found - over and above those which can result from higher levels of economic growth.' The proposed strategy, which is likely to be near the top of the agenda at next month's Copenhagen summit of EC heads of government, is the first EC-wide attempt to deal with structural unemployment. It focuses on ways of creating more labour-intensive growth. The document notes that while Belgium and the Netherlands have similar labour productivity, the Dutch provide jobs for 10 per cent more people of working age. The Danes earn less per head in real terms than western Germans, but have a much higher proportion of people at work. Outside the EC, the Commission notes that the US had the same rate of output growth as the Community in the last decade, but that income growth per American worker was half EC levels. More jobs were created and household incomes rose. In Japan, the document says, high productivity in the traded goods sector has created well-paid jobs in the service sector, where productivity is well below EC levels. 'You can have labour-intensive work while still providing a highly competitive product,' said one senior Brussels official. The five main points call for: 'reducing labour costs . . . notably by modifying the incidence of taxation systems'; new working time structures to share out jobs; 'adaptibility at the workplace' and 'new forms of work organisation'; training systems to bring more people into work and 'anticipate structural change' in industry; and exploitation of 'new areas of work' like environmental industries.</p>

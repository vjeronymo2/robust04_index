			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Technology: Company snapshot Nature of Business British Airways is the world's biggest international airline, claiming to carry more passengers on international routes than any other airline. It serves 165 or so destinations in 74 countries, with more than 250 aircraft, and the route network is some 600,000 kilometres (almost to the moon and back). In its last financial year, the BA group (including the Caledonian charter flight division) carried 28.1m passengers and 532,000 tonnes of cargo. Turnover: Pounds 5,566m, with pre-tax profit of Pounds 185m, in the full financial year to March 1993 (one of the toughest years yet for the entire aviation industry). Employees: The approximate number worldwide is 48,960. Key Personnel: Sir Colin Marshall, chairman; Robert Ayling, group managing director; Mike Batt, director of marketing; Charles Weiser, head of customer relations. TECHNOLOGY FILE Software: Caress was custom-built in the Synon development language, comprising 900 program modules. It uses ImagePlus scanning software for the automatic input, and links with 20 other mainframe systems, including the Babs reservation system, Pandora for flight information, plus corporate mail and telex systems. Hardware: IBM AS400 E80, running 60 workstations, largely in the same Heathrow site, but a few elsewhere including chairman's office. Supplier: IBM, in conjunction with Stockport-based Space Computer Systems, a specialist in bespoke systems. Cost: Pounds 4.5m (slightly under the estimate) including implementation, consultancy and 250 man-days of documentation and training.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiro Gligorov, president of the Republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  gave an interview for Macedonian Television yesterday [20 June]  on Census 94, answering questions and giving personal opinions  and evaluations on this statistical endeavor. Following are  some excerpts. Asked his opinion on the census, President  Gligorov said that it was of an extreme importance, primarily as  a chance to draw up a real map of Macedonia, the population  count, its make-up, and what and how much of anything there is.  In brief, he said that it was a chance to create a source for a  lot of important data needed for a realistic examination of the  present situation, which can be used in planning our future.    "I think that we have created the necessary conditions for  carrying out such an activity, and I do not think that any of  the sides will have any objections," President Gligorov said,  adding that the census will help free the agenda of an issue of  a purely statistical nature that has tended to be given  political meaning. "Therefore, in my opinion," President  Gligorov said, "this is a goal of essential importance for our  state, for the stability and peace of our country."    Asked about the degree of politicization, in the sense of  who  needed the census and why, President Gligorov said that such  politicization started being implemented right after the latest  census in 1991, when some internal and international factors  were involved, and most of all our neighbors. "That is not  uncommon," Gligorov said, "if we look at the present situation  in the Balkans, on the territories of former Yugoslavia, and the  aspirations and historic ambitions of various countries toward  Macedonia. Therefore, the census should put an end to such  controversies and provide real arguments for discussions.  Politicization, particularly the argument presented to the  international public that far greater numbers of certain  nationalities reside here than is actually true, conjures up an  image where, if we add up all those pretentious numbers,  Macedonia turns out to be a state of many millions, which  everybody knows to be a notorious lie. After the census,  everyone will have to face the truth."    The next question was related to our standards and our  Census  Law compared with the same regulations in Europe and the world.  "In this feverish atmosphere among and around us, we can  understand the manipulations of the number of certain  nationalities. However, it is beyond understanding when some  claim that our census is below European standards, because it is  the only census that will be carried out according to the  standards of the Council of Europe. This is the only such case,  and it is good, because after the census it will be hard to deny  the results. The census can serve as an example of how things  could be resolved in the boiling Balkans. It means discussing  by presenting arguments, and not historic burdens and personal  subjective evaluations."    At the end, President Gligorov emphasized that the census  was  a possibility, as was the referendum, for our people to show  their attitude to the state, to do their civil duties, and thus  remove from the agenda an issue that can cause a lot of  misunderstanding.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Lautro in first move to suspend a member LAUTRO, the self-regulating body for the life-assurance industry, has for the first time suspended a member. The action against Oaklife Assurance, based in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, relates to its sales practices. The company has been ordered to stop selling policies until the regulators are satisfied that Oaklife is able to comply with the rules. The company has 20 branches and sells policies through about 100 direct sales agents. It has Pounds 800,000 of policies in force. Lautro said Oaklife had breached a broad range of rules ranging from failure to train staff properly to a failure to ensure that agents were urging consumers to purchase the best possible policy for their needs. Lautro recently announced a steep rise in complaints alleging sharp practice by life-assurance sales agents to more than 4,000 in the 12 months to June last year. However, apart from cases where members have agreed or been ordered to make restitution to customers, Lautro has rarely taken disciplinary action. It has issued only four public reprimands to companies in the past two years and has never expelled a member. In October the organisation's board authorised it to fine members for breaches of rules relating to sales practices but Lautro has yet to use those powers. Last December the Department of Trade and Industry prohibited Oaklife from selling policies for several weeks after the former chief executive and three other top officials resigned, taking complaints about the company to the DTI.</p>

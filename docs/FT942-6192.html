			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Minister blocks Pounds 7.5m aid for Brixton Sir George Young, inner-cities minister, has refused to approve a Pounds 7.5m grant to Brixton, one of London's most run-down inner-city districts, because of delays by Lambeth Borough Council in approving projects. The south London district faces the loss of more than Pounds 30m of government funds for urban regeneration because of the delays. Brixton, the scene of much-publicised rioting in 1981, is one of 31 inner-city areas to have won funds in the government's City Challenge programme. The Brixton Challenge plan was awarded Pounds 7.5m a year over five years for an urban regeneration plan which included a Pounds 40m shopping mall in the centre of the area. But the scheme has failed to hit most of its performance targets and underspent its first-year budget by Pounds 1.8m. Sir George has refused to approve the second year's grant until he has assurances from council leaders that they will speed up their approvals for the scheme's projects. He is also concerned that the political impasse on the council, which has had no overall political control since last month's council elections, could make it impossible for Brixton Challenge to function effectively. The council met last night to discuss committee chairmanships after arguing over the procedure for electing the mayor at two previous meetings. Sir George told leaders of the political groups on Lambeth council that the Brixton Challenge had given him more trouble than any of the other 30 City Challenge schemes. They have until June 10 to convince him that they will clear the obstacles to the scheme. Leaders of the Labour and Liberal Democrat groups on the council, which each have 24 seats, said last night that Sir George would receive the necessary assurances. Ms Anna Tapsell, leader of the Labour group, said the problems had arisen out of the council's 'over-bureaucratic ways of working with Brixton Challenge'. She added that she expected new standing orders to be introduced to ensure that urgent business passed through the council more quickly. Mr Mike Tuffrey, Liberal Democrat leader, said he was confident that his party and Labour would be able to give the assurances. However, Mr Hugh Jones, leader of the 16 Conservative councillors, warned that future funding would depend on the parties demonstrating that they could operate council business. He said: 'The signs are not that good at the moment. It took the council over 13 hours to elect a mayor.' Two other schemes, in Leicester and the London Borough of Brent, are also being monitored closely by the environment department. Their continuing funding will be reviewed by ministers in the autumn, halfway through the 1994-95 year.</p>

In a meeting with reporters at dawn today, our time, Foreign  Minister Han, who is currently on an official visit to Canada,  said that North Korean representatives stationed at the IAEA  notified the IAEA that North Korea is willing to accept  inspection of seven nuclear facilities which the IAEA is  demanding for the continuity of nuclear safety measures.  Foreign Minister Han also said that the government welcomes the  move and that he hopes the nuclear inspection on North Korea  will be carried out as agreed upon between the IAEA and North  Korea.    Foreign Minister Han said that it is unclear whether the  nuclear inspection on North Korea will be carried out the day  after tomorrow but said that there is a high possibility that  the inspection will start within a week.    Foreign Minister Han said that since the North Korean side  is  showing a developing attitude regarding nuclear inspection, he  will meet with high-ranking U.S. working-level officials  including Secretary of State Warren Christopher and National  Security Adviser Anthony Lake when he revisits Washington on 17  February to hold full-scale discussions with the United States  on reaching an agreement on dealing with the upcoming  three-stage contact.</p>

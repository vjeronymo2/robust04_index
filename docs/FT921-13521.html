			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Tough Lisbon budget for 1992 THE Portuguese government yesterday announced a tough budget for 1992 aimed at reducing the public sector deficit, and introducing value added tax on basic foods, Patrick Blum writes from Lisbon. Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, finance minister, described his budget as a 'single market budget'. It would prepare Portugal for economic and monetary union (Emu) and for the benefits of the single European currency after 1997. Government spending would be kept rigorously under control, with investment in the infrastructure and education given the greatest priority.</p>

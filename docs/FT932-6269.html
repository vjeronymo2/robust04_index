			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Russians backtrack on Cyprus RUSSIA last night back-tracked on its decision two weeks ago to veto a British proposal to finance the UN force in Cyprus by mandatory assessment of all states instead of voluntary funding. A new resolution, which the Security Council approved by 14-0 with Pakistan abstaining, combines elements of both forms of financing. Greece and Cyprus have volunteered to contribute a total of Dollars 25m a year for the force, leaving about Dollars 22m yearly to be shared among the other 179 member states. Because only a handful have paid to maintain the force, Britain has been contributing, in cash and services, Dollars 50m a year. Under the new arrangement this will drop to about Dollars 1m and Russia's share will be about twice that amount. The UN says the force, now down to 1,500 troops from a high of 6,400, is about Dollars 200m in arrears. Governments providing contingents have not been compensated for ten years, although the UN was supposed to pay them 30 per cent of costs. Russia's veto on May 11 was its first for nine years, and the first by any member of the Security Council since February 19. The action, which surprised many members, was interpreted as a demonstration of independence after a long period when Moscow had gone along with the west.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Bensalem: "FLN's All-Or-Nothing Position"] </F>   [Text] The reply of the FLN [National Liberation Front]  political bureau to the letter of Mr. Youcef Khatib, adviser to  the presidency, asking political parties and associations to  declare before 16 April whether or not they will participate in  the National Transition Council (CNT) was made public  yesterday...    No, says the FLN. In its letter, made available to EL WATAN  yesterday, it declined the invitation to attend the 20 April  meeting at the presidency that was called to allocate seats  among those participating in the dialogue. The decision came at  the end of Monday's meeting of the FLN political bureau. The FLN  position hardly comes as a surprise, given the statements its  secretary general has made to the press, recent political bureau  communiques, and the latest statements from its central  committee, which met on 13-14 January.    According to the reply the political bureau sent to Mr.  Khatib on Monday, the FLN--which had said often before it was  not bound by the decisions of the national conference that it  had boycotted--believes "the fundamental questions raised by the  FLN and other parties in different forms have not been debated,  nor have they been embraced as necessary elements for the  reaching of an accord or the real basis of the national  consensus..."    The FLN political bureau--more specifically some of its  influential members, who were alledged to have virtually offered  the party to the highest bidder--has returned in its latest  statement to the decisions of the last central committee  meeting, in order to show it is not acting against the wishes of  the party rank and file; it notes, for example, that the party  has decided "not to endorse any de facto authority or tarnish  the party's good name by lending a fictional legitimacy to such  authority," and "not to solicit any positions of responsibility  for its militants that lack a mandate of the people."    It thus appears very likely the transition will go forward  without the participation of Mr. Mehri's party, since the latter  does not approve the presidency's handling of the transition  period in accordance with the "national consensus platform."  According to the political bureau, "prolonging the transition  period for three more years to pursue the same policy followed  since the interruption of the democratic process, designing  structures to implement it, and continuing to ignore the  people's will...does not contribute to political pacification or  resolve the serious, complex crisis consuming our whole society."    The political bureau added nothing to what it has said  before  about what is needed to resolve the crisis. The only thing  missing from the bureau's letter was the party's previous appeal  for "an in-depth and broad dialogue." A constant theme in the  FLN's earlier statements, it was omitted, curiously enough, from  the bureau's letter to Mr. Khatib. In fact, no mention is made  of participation by the now-dissolved FIS [Islamic Salvation  Front] in such a dialogue, despite the fact the FLN has always  claimed such participation was a vital necessity in any search  for a solution to the crisis. It may be stretching a point to  speak of a "change" in the FLN position on the issue, but the  question is worth flagging.    The expected defection of the FLN, followed probably by  other  parties that hold similar views about the dialogue, places the  presidency in an awkward position as it proceeds to set up the  transition structures, beginning with the National Transition  Council at the end of this month.    A close analysis of the statements of the various political  parties--some of which admittedly are resorting to hyperbole in  an effort to increase their influence--would suggest the future  "assembly" may be composed of little more than the  representatives of civil society and a handful of fairly small  political parties.    Indeed, all indications are the transition process will be  carried out with the cooperation of the very same forces that  participated in the national conference and adopted the  "national consensus platform." Some observers are already  raising the question of the "legitimacy" of the transition  structures, especially the future CNT, from which the most  influential parties, the most obvious candidates for membership,  have been excluded. President Zeroual's plans already have been  thrown off schedule by the departure of the Redha Malek  government; now the presidency has only a few more days to  convince all sides to participate in the transition phase.</p>

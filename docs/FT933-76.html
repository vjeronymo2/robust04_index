			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (2): Engine of the world falters - Financial Times writers analyse the performance of companies in three sectors of the economy and examine the structural changes taking place THE RECENT difficulties in the Japanese economy and gloomy prospects for a near-term recovery have triggered a crisis of confidence among manufacturers. In the electronics industry, a four-year decline in demand for audio-visual products has led Japan's large consumer electronics companies to admit that they are not fully prepared to deal with the saturation of the markets for television sets, video cassette recorders and compact disc players, which have provided them with profits. Car makers, faced with sluggish demand at home and slow sales in Europe, also say that their own competitiveness is threatened by a high yen and quality improvements at the big three US manufacturers, at a time when there is an over-capacity in the world car market. Meanwhile, the high costs of manufacturing have raised the question of whether Japan can continue in its role as the world's engine of manufacturing growth. Faced with the combined pressures of one of the worst economic slowdowns in Japan since the war, the sharp appreciation of the yen and growing protectionism in overseas markets, manufacturing companies are questioning the way in which they have long been doing business. 'In the past, it was thought that markets would always continue to grow,' says an official at Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics maker. 'That is no longer true.' This change in their business environment, from strong and rising demand to slower growth, is forcing manufacturers to review their business priorities. While demand was growing, the objective was simply to keep increasing sales volumes, which would naturally lead to higher profits. As demand has slowed, that strategy has proved an obstacle to the maintenance of profits in a more difficult era. The large numbers of staff, particularly white-collar workers, taken on during the growth years as, manufacturers' corporate structures grew in line with rising market demand, is now a considerable source of high costs. The wide variety of models and the short shelf life of products, which were the hallmark of companies riding high on a period of strong growth, also helped to create bloated corporate structures, which have made it difficult for companies to adjust quickly to the new environment. In a complete reversal of their former expansionist strategies, the call among manufacturers is for the creation of a lean and mean corporate structure, capable of producing profits even when revenues are not rising. The quest for profitability, rather than market share, has led companies to seek greater productivity among their white-collar workers by reducing numbers working in jobs not directly linked to manufacturing. 'Japan's blue-collar productivity is very high,' says Mr Kuniyoshi Sasaki, a director at the Japan Productivity Center. But white-collar productivity has, in contrast, been very low. Since it is difficult to raise the productivity on the factory floor, which is already high, Japanese companies face a strong need to improve the productivity of white-collar workers in order to raise their profits to revenues ratios, he says. Japanese manufacturers are also trying to meet the challenge of slow growth markets by shifting their product mix to more higher value-added products. The move of consumer electronics makers into software, such as Hollywood films, and advanced components, such as liquid crystal displays, is an example of that trend. As they shift the focus of their own energies to high value-added products, Japanese companies are looking increasingly to tie-ups and OEM (original equipment manufacturer) deals with other companies, to supply them with those products that are less profitable for them to produce but which they still need to complement their product line-up. Fujitsu, for example, is asking Siemens Nixodorf, the German computer company, to supply it with low-end mainframe computer technology, while it supplies Siemens with higher end machines. In a further response to the slowdown in their markets, Japanese manufacturers are developing their global strategies, to enable them to call on resources worldwide rather than just at home. A growing number of car makers are therefore calling on their overseas production facilities to provide them with cheaper components, while consumer electronics makers are investing in US companies, ranging from large film studios to small venture companies, to better exploit the wealth of new market ideas emerging in that country. Matsushita, for example, not only owns MCA, the entertainment group, but has a stake in 3DO, a small company developing advanced multimedia products which has yet to make a profit. The changes being required of Japanese manufacturers pose a significant challenge to managers, who have so far only had to concern themselves largely with manufacturing issues. 'It is the business strategy of top management in Japan that is now being questioned,' says Mr Sasaki. Unless top management can introduce dramatic change, companies are unlikely to achieve the real restructuring they need for a revitalisation of Japanese manufacturing, he predicts.</p>

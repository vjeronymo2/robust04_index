			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Taylor Woodrow takes Pounds 47m charge TAYLOR Woodrow, the property and construction group, yesterday said it was pulling out of US contracting and made exceptional write-downs of Pounds 46.5m to cover falls in UK and Spanish property and land values. Mr Colin Parsons, who took over as chairman after Mr Peter Drew resigned last month, is to simplify Taylor Woodrow's management. He will lead an executive team of Mr Tony Palmer, chief executive, and Mr David Green, finance director. The company reported a loss before tax of Pounds 2.7m in the year to December 31 compared with a profit of Pounds 83.4m a year ago. Mr Parsons described the performance as 'far from satisfactory', and said costs needed pruning. About 600 people have been made redundant, at a cost of about Pounds 5m, and more redundancies are expected. The results continued a string of disappointing performances and asset write-downs from UK construction and property companies, hit by recession. Taylor Woodrow is maintaining its final dividend, as earlier promised, at 7.64p to make an unchanged total of 9.5p. The shares gained 9p to 129p. Mr Parsons defended the decision on the dividend, which is uncovered. 'It's simply a matter of honour to pay that dividend.' Following last year's rights issue, the company's debt/equity ratio improved to 23 per cent, from 30 per cent, on net borrowings of Pounds 156m, down from Pounds 205.1m. Turnover fell slightly to Pounds 1.39bn from Pounds 1.41bn. The order book finished the year at Pounds 850m against Pounds 1.25bn. Profits before exceptionals fell to Pounds 43.8m from Pounds 75.9m. Worst hit was the contracting division with losses of Pounds 19.6m, against a profit of Pounds 14.1m last time, following provisions of Pounds 11.5m on Taylor Woodrow's share of the Channel tunnel, a Pounds 13m provision on the Storebaelt bridge contract in Denmark and a Pounds 3.8m provision on Euro Disney contracts. In the US, contracting ran up losses of Pounds 12m before being discontinued. There was a loss per share of 1.4p, against earnings of 16.2p, adjusted. Losses attributable to shareholders totalled Pounds 28.9m, against a Pounds 55.6m profit. Combined with a higher dividend charge, due to the rights issue, there was a retained loss of Pounds 68.6m, against a Pounds 24m profit. Lex, Page 18; Appointments, Page 14</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Management: Tape v tape; Philips v Sony - Recorded music technology / Michael Skapinker assesses the reception awaiting digital compact cassettes American teenagers spent more on trainers than on music last year. Some might see this as a comment on the outrageous price of footwear. To Gerry Wirtz, it is a warning that time is running out for the cassette tape. Wirtz is a senior product manager at Philips, the Dutch electronics group which invented the cassette. He says that the traditional audio tape is in decline. Some companies, headed by Sony of Japan, have come up with a new technology, Digital Audio Tape (DAT). Philips has hit back with the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC). Both offer sound quality as good as that of compact disc. At first sight, the companies' concern appears unwarranted. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry reports that cassette sales tripled during the 1980s, reaching 1.5bn units sold in 1989. Wirtz says it is vital, however, to introduce a new recording technology before the old one reaches its peak. Work on the compact disc began before sales of vinyl records began their precipitous fall. The development of digital tape is, if anything, a bit late, he says. There are signs that sales of traditional cassettes have already begun to slip. Market research reveals that consumers think of traditional audio cassettes as being old-fashioned, unreliable and offering poor sound. US youngsters, Wirtz contends, are as disillusioned with the cassettes as with the music on them. A popular digital format is necessary if the demise of the audio cassette is not to drag the entire Dollars 22bn recording industry into decline. The proponents of digital audio tape have moved faster than Philips. DAT machines are already on the market, despite legal objections from the record industry which feared that people would use them to make crystal clear pirate tapes. DAT has not, however, made much impression. Philips says this is not surprising; DAT machines play digital tapes only. Anyone owning one would have to throw their traditional audio cassettes away. Wirtz contends that the tape market has to be approached differently. Cassettes still outsell other musical media by a long way. Despite their decline, 'the music cassette will be with us beyond the year 2000,' he says. The problem with the cassette is not that it will stop selling. It will simply sell more slowly. The trick, Wirtz says, is to come up with a technology which can attach itself to the cassette market while at the same time boosting tape sales. Philips believes the DCC machines will do just that. The main difference between DCC and DAT players is that the new Philips machines will play both old-fashioned and digital tapes. Both types of tape can be inserted into the same slot. (The old style of tape player will not, however, play the new digital cassettes.) As traditional cassette players wear out, Philips hopes that new buyers will go for DCC, attracted by the idea that they do not have to throw their old tapes away. Philips' prototype of a DCC player will soon be available; it plans to launch the machines and tapes in April 1992. It has already lined up an impressive array of music companies to support its technology, including EMI, Bertelsmann, and PolyGram, a Philips subsidiary. Tandy of the US is also expected to make the players. The most impressive backer, however, is Matsushita of Japan, the world's largest consumer electronics company and Sony's traditional rival. Philips will not confirm that Matsushita is lending its support, but it is believed that the Japanese group will be a co-licensor of DCC. Philips and Matsushita will together sell the right to manufacture DCC to other companies. Wirtz admits that marketing DCC will be a difficult job. The compact disc, the other digital recording format on the market, has grown rapidly from almost nothing in 1983 to worldwide sales of 600m discs in 1989. The CD had the advantage of offering a sound clearer than anything that music enthusiasts had heard before. DCC, as a subsequent digital technology, will not have the same novelty value. Philips, which invented the CD as well as the audio tape, thought each new purchaser of a compact disc player would buy eight recordings in the first year of ownership. Instead, new buyers of CD players bought 16 discs in the first year. 'We don't expect DCC to be the same as the CD,' Wirtz says. 'It's the second digital child. With your first child you go nuts. With your second you have a one-day party and then go back to work. We expect people to buy only three tapes in the first year they own a DCC player. It will be a massive problem to keep the cassette market going. To do so with digital cassette we've got to grow like hell.' Philips is expected to aim DCC at the portable music market, selling personal digital stereos and car tape players. Alain Levy, PolyGram's chief executive, says he would like to give DCC tapes a price mid-way between that of traditional cassettes and compact discs. Wirtz, however, says he expects sales of DCC tapes to begin at around the same level as CDs. DCC players will be sold for between Pounds 300 and Pounds 500 each. He showed off the new tapes at a London hotel last month, along with a provisional version of a DCC player. The sound is as good as that of a compact disc. Wirtz demonstrated this by playing the same piece of music on CD and DCC players simultaneously and switching between the two. He then played a traditional audio cassette on the DCC player, producing a noticeably fuzzier sound. The DCC tape looks like a cross between an audio cassette and a floppy disc. Wirtz claims, however, that it will be far more reliable and durable than an audio cassette. Licencees will have to follow strict guidelines in the manufacture of DCC tapes. They will, for example, have to use high quality plastic which does not melt on the dashboard of a car left in the sun. But DCC still uses tape, however. Although better protected than in a traditional audio cassette, it still looks vulnerable to accident or wear and tear. CDs appear more durable. Apart from the ability to carry on playing old cassettes, it is difficult to see what DCC offers that CD does not. Some in the industry say DCC will benefit from being vibration-resistant and therefore more suitable for use in cars and personal stereos than compact discs. But the CD has quickly established itself as a popular device. If DCCs are no cheaper than CDs who will buy them? The answer, one imagines, is people who want to record from CDs on to blank DCC tapes - an activity the record industry has never liked.</p>

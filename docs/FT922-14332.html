			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Fear tarnishes gilded southern realm - David Marsh on the Tory marginals where 'For Sale' signs outnumber party posters IN THE gilded southern realm of Toryland, the daffodils fluttering on town perimeters have been among the few bright spots in a campaign studded with negatives. This has not been a time for hope, vision or even the firm announcement of convictions. 'For Sale' signs outside houses heavily outnumber party election posters. Across southern England, from Bath to Basildon, voting will be shaped less by ideology than by two sets of opposing fears. The recession, impinging particularly on service industries and higher-income mortgagors, has chilled middle-class hearts previously uplifted by wealth-creating Thatcherism. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats are banking on a widespread protest vote by disaffected Conservatives to make inroads in the Tories' southern territories. For many in the south, however, the present fright over unemployment and bankruptcies is outweighed by a greater fear: that a Labour government could make matters still worse. By increasing taxes on the better-off and introducing new regulations on business, Labour - so Tories argue - could end up twisting further the stiletto inserted into the southern economy. Conservative campaigners, heavily pushing the 'Fear Kinnock' message, this week are likely to win back thousands of wavering Tories. Nonetheless, disillusionment with the government can be expected to swing several marginal seats to the opposition. Labour appears to have a good chance of clinching at least one of the two key Southampton constituencies. The party is offering a fresh start, but no magic solutions. Mr Alan Whitehead, the respected leader of Southampton City Council, standing for Labour in the Test constituency, is confident of toppling the Tories' 12 per cent majority. If Labour forms the next government, he says, 'We don't kid ourselves we'll be able to solve all the problems or see the British economy basking in sunshine.' The Liberal Democrats, for their part, have concentrated on three seats where the Tories are defending small majorities: Portsmouth South, Bath and Cheltenham. In places such as these, 1980s' prosperity has raised aspirations without being able to fulfil them all. It has also dramatically increased the vulnerability of many to the harsher economic climate. Mr Richard Askew, rector of Bath Abbey, says that, after unemployment, 'the most saddening aspect' of the recession is the rise in house repossessions. Mr Peter Beebe, head of the Southampton chamber of commerce, speaks of the 'sledge-hammer' effect of the downturn in the city. Council officials in Portsmouth say their city is suffering a 'double recession', with cuts in defence spending adding to the impact of the recession. Many larger and smaller businesses, clearly, are resolved to ride out the storm. Mrs Janet Hart, who runs the Cornwallis Business Centre in Basildon, says that of the 40 small companies in her building, half are doing well. The other half face difficulties 'but are determined to be there when the upturn comes'. A firm Tory supporter, she says: 'Things will bounce back.' Beyond the economic problems, evidence of social dislocation abounds - jarring with Conservative claims to represent the party of order and virtue. In most southern counties last year the increase in notifiable crime was well above the national rise of 16 per cent. Crime went up by 34 per cent in Kent, 21 per cent in Avon and Somerset, 20 per cent in Hampshire and 18 per cent in Sussex and Surrey. In the staid Tory seat of Hove on the south coast, licentiousness is on display just round the corner from the constituency office of Mr Tim Sainsbury, Hove's MP since 1973. In the town last week I handed Mr Sainsbury a set of 15 different brightly coloured advertising cards for call girls, on show in a nearby telephone kiosk. Somewhat wanly Mr Sainsbury - who holds an impregnable 37 per cent majority - said he would be asking British Telecom to investigate. Against this background, it is not surprising that Tory candidates resort to negative arguments. Mr Simon Coombs, the sharp-tongued Conservative MP for Swindon since 1983, defending a 7.2 per cent majority and a mortgage of well over Pounds 100,000 on a home in Kennington in south London, declares: 'We offer them (the electorate) negative security. Things would be far worse under Labour. Higher taxes, higher inflation, higher interest rates, higher mortgages, less defence and more government interference.' Mr Nigel Forman, the Conservative incumbent in the safe seat of Carshalton and Wallington, tries to push a positive message when he goes canvassing. But he admits that April 9 will basically be a competition of negatives: 'People give us points for being less incompetent (than Labour).' The prize for negative campaigning goes to Mr David Amess, who has held Basildon for the Conservatives since 1983. He shows exceptional vituperativeness towards his Labour opponent, Mr John Potter. Among his more printable assertions, Mr Amess, a staunch Catholic, criticises Mr Potter's agnosticism. Even in safe seats, however, Conservatives are ladling out the vitriol. Mr Peter Griffiths, who has sat for Portsmouth North since 1979, commanding a 31 per cent majority in 1987, says Neil Kinnock would be the worst prime minister since the 18th century. The Tories believe that if Mr Kinnock moves into Downing Street it will be the result of well-packaged knavery. Mr James Hill, the veteran MP for Southampton Test, accuses his opponents of being 'tricky little devils'. More thoughtfully, other Conservatives discern deeper factors at work. If the Tories lose, part of the blame will be heaped on the policy of keeping interest rates high during the longest recession since 1930-32. This is a consequence of Britain's decision to join the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. Mr Christopher Chope, a fervent Thatcherite who has been MP for Southampton Itchen since 1983, says: 'After the election, all political parties will be doing some hard thinking about the desirability or otherwise of having economic policies influenced by what is going on in Germany.' In Carshalton, Mr Forman has a particular insight into the consequences of ERM membership. Between 1987 and 1989 he was parliamentary private secretary to the then chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Nigel Lawson - a firm supporter of joining the ERM. 'Whatever the result, this election is likely to be seen as the first British national election in which external factors such as the influence of the Bundesbank have been decisive,' says Mr Forman - heralding what could become, once the dust settles, a central component of the Tory post-mortem.  --------------------------------------------- MARGINALS IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND OUTSIDE LONDON  --------------------------------------------- 1987 Conservative majorities  ---------------------------------------------  1  Portsmouth     South             0.4% over SDP  2  Thurrock          1.5% over Labour  3  Bath              2.7% over SDP  4  Basildon          5.2% over Labour  5  Swindon           7.2% over Labour  6  Slough            7.3% over Labour  7  Cheltenham        7.9% over Liberal  8  Isle of Wight     8.2% over Labour  9  Dover            11.9% over Labour 10  Southampton     Itchen           12.2% over Labour 11  Southampton     Test             12.3% over Labour  ---------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] It has been said that the political and  administration system has become obsolete. With such a view in  mind, ASAHI SHIMBUN interviewed in late March administrative  vice ministers of ministries and agencies, who are top-ranking  career bureaucrats. In the interview, they were asked what they  make of the criticism of bureaucrats. Asked how bureaucrats and  the bureaucratic system should change, eight vice  ministers--about 40 percent of the total vice ministers  responding--admitted that there is "a harmful influence caused  by bureaucratic sectionalism," and they said it is necessary to  correct such a system. Meanwhile, most of them made the  counterargument that it is not reasonable to criticize  bureaucrats for playing a central role in decisionmaking in  policy matters, and most denied that there is collusion between  bureaucrats and politicians or business circles. [passage  omitted on remarks by Education Ministry and Management and  Coordination Agency vice ministers who hint that there are  interministry struggles to protect the interests of their own  ministries]    In suggesting how to get rid of the harmful effects of  bureaucratic sectionalism, Shigeo Mochizuki, administrative vice  minister for construction, said that "we want to promote  personnel exchanges between ministries." Vice Foreign Minister  Kunihiko Saito said that "the current administration system has  to be corrected under the leadership of the government."    When asked to comment on the criticism that bureaucrats take  the initiative in deciding on policies, 15 out of a total of 21  interviewees made a counterargument by saying that "such  criticism is not reasonable." Five vice ministers declined to  give a clear-cut answer on this.    Futoshi Shirai, vice minister of posts and  telecommunications, said that "it is natural for the  administrative sector to speak up about policy matters within  their jurisdiction." Many of those who made a counterargument  expressed a similar view. Vice Foreign Minister Saito said that  "it is partly unavoidable for bureaucrats to have a greater say"  because the coalition government has so little experience in  governing. At the same time, however, he said: "It is natural  for the public to have doubts about bureaucrats' role, and it  may be true that bureaucrats are playing a leading role in  decision-making in policy matters. Bureaucrats must heed the  principle of not making the final decision."    When asked what they think of the criticism of Japanese  bureaucrats leveled by the United States in the course of the  recent Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, Vice Finance  Minister Jiro Saito said: "It is regrettable to be the target of  criticism. We will give careful attention to criticism in a  humble way, and we hope to remove the misunderstanding, if there  is any." Hideaki Kumano, vice minister of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry, said that the criticism "was  amplified" beyond bearable limits, thus expressing his  dissatisfaction with the U.S. criticism.    As for the issue of the alleged deep collusion between  bureaucrats on the one hand and politicians and business circles  on the other, most of them, while denying their collusion with  political and business circles, said that "it is necessary to  exchange opinions with politicians and business leaders, and  this is not collusion" (said Vice Transportation Minister  Michihiko Matsuo).    When asked what they think of former bureaucrats' finding  employment with companies formerly under their jurisdiction,  many answered in the affirmative in view of finding a new job.  Some indirectly admitted the fact that former bureaucrats find  employment in this way, saying "I cannot say that no former  bureaucrats find employment with companies which are related to  ministries or agencies for which they worked, but...."  (according to Shigekazu Mori, vice minister of home affairs).</p>

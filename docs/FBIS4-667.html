			<p>BFN     [Text] The Rwanda Government Army chief of staff and nine  other senior officers of the Rwanda Government Army today  requested for a cease-fire. These officers should first explain  whether they have been fighting. A cease-fire is arranged  between two fighting forces. The Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF]  is fighting that small clique of Presidential Guards and  elements of the government Army who took it upon themselves to  massacre innocent banyaRwanda [Rwandans]. These officers should  explain whether they are in league with or fighting alongside  these murderous criminals, which they are. Then they need not  waste their breath requesting for a cease-fire, since the RPF  went to Kigali to reinforce its battalion, which was under  attack, to restore order and security and to stop the  indiscriminate killing of innocent people by the Presidential  Guards and elements of the government Army.    The RPF soldiers have accomplished their mission. If these  officers are in the clique of murderers, then they should not  ask for a cease-fire or later on expect it. If they are not  with the murderous Presidential Guard and have disassociated  themselves from the government Army elements who kill and loot,  then they should not be requesting for a cease-fire. Instead  they should be fighting alongside the RPF soldiers against the  criminal elements of the government Army and the notorious  Presidential Guard. How could they be asking for a cease-fire  when the criminal elements are still killing innocent people?  How could they be asking for a cease-fire when the retreating  government soldiers are killing people in Kigali, Butare,  Cyangugu, and Kibungo.    How could they be asking for a cease-fire when the extremist  radio RTLM [Radio Television Libre des Milles Collines] speaks  the whole day and night calling upon the population to kill each  other just under the very noses of these officers? These  officers should know that as long as all this is going on, the  RPF will fight on until it restores order and security. Having  said that, should these officers have separated themselves from  the Presidential Guard, then they should join the RPF, fight the  criminals and help restore order and security in the country.  In this case, they should not be requesting for a cease-fire.  Instead they should be disarming the Presidential Guard and the  bad elements of the Army. They should be making statements to  the effect that they have joined the RPF in the country in  stopping the criminals from committing atrocities. On the other  hand, if these officers are in league with or are part of the  criminal elements, then they leave the RPF no option but to  fulfill its patriotic duty of restoring order and security and  protecting not only the Rwandan nationals but also the  foreigners in the country.</p>

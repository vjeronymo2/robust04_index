			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Branson seeks apology over tax allegations LAWYERS for Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group asked for retractions and apologies yesterday over an article in Business Age magazine published today. The magazine said Mr Branson had used family trusts to avoid paying capital gains tax on Pounds 229m from the sale of the Virgin music group to Thorn EMI earlier this year - which is perfectly legal. The magazine said that out of the total Pounds 510m sale price of Virgin music, Mr Branson had received Pounds 22.4m from his 4.4 per cent personal stake - which would lead to a capital gains tax liability of Pounds 8.8m. The magazine said that Branson family trusts had shown a total gain of Pounds 229.3m and that as a result Pounds 92.1m in capital gains tax was saved. In other articles, the magazine raised the general issue of offshore trusts and the billions of pounds it says is lost to the Inland Revenue as a result. Mr Branson said yesterday that the article was 'misleading, riddled with inaccuracies and Virgin were never approached for a comment'. He added that his personal stake was understated and that the capital gains tax on the shares he owned was likely to be in excess of Pounds 20m. 'It is no secret that the trusts were set up before we took one of the Virgin companies public in 1986, and financial journalists and shareholders were fully informed of that fact,' Mr Branson said. Full capital gains tax was paid, the company said, in relation to the setting up of the trusts. Virgin said the proceeds of the sale to Thorn EMI were being used to build up various Virgin holding companies rather than being paid to Mr Branson or his family. It added: 'If this policy of investment is as successful as it has been in the past, the tax created should one day be very considerable indeed and considerably more than if Richard Branson had pocketed the money personally.' The magazine said yesterday that it stuck to its story, which was a matter of public record. On the general issues of offshore funds and capital gains tax, the Revenue has already taken steps to tighten up on taxpayers holding assets offshore, but has not managed close all the loopholes. The basic principle is that foreigners are not subject to tax when assets are sold. That is designed in part to encourage as much investment from overseas as possible. It also means that UK taxpayers with assets overseas may be in a position to escape liabilities. Offshore trusts can hold assets that can then be sold free of capital gains tax if the money remains offshore.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Capital reorganisation for Dwyer Dwyer, the Dublin-based property company, is proposing a capital reorganisation aimed at cutting gearing and allowing it to end the payment of preference dividends. It plans to replace its convertible preference shares with ordinary shares on a 1-for-1 basis. The 12.8m shares resulting will represent a little less than 50 per cent of the enlarged capital. The company said that with the conversion price of 256p, against yesterday's closing price of 34p, down 5p on the day, and following a fall of 9p on Thursday, it was unlikely holders would exercise their rights making the preference shares similar to debt. Treating them as such resulted in gearing of about 400 per cent, which the reorganisation would cut to 175 per cent. On the same basis net asset value per share would fall from 120p to 110p. The proposals will be put to an extraordinary meeting on May 14.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Algiers, May. 05 (MAP) -- Two leaders of the  outlawed Islamic Salvation Front `FIS' who were released last  February said `bloodshed will stop in Algeria if there is proof  that authorities will not hamper the project of an Islamic state  and confiscate free choice of people'.    The two FIS leaders who granted an interview to pro-Islamic  AL BAYANE daily said those who were forced to take arms for  political reasons will end up opting for a way that will spare  the lives of Muslims, restore security and faith, respect the  nation's will to change and end injustice affecting innocent  people. To a question on whether armed wings will comply to the  Islamic party's eventual call to lay down arms, Abdelkader  Boukhemkhem and Ali Jeddi said the FIS leaders strongly believe  that their move will yield results because it is based on the  charia (Islamic law) and on the people's trust as well as on  cooperation with reformist forces of the country.    The two men who were sentenced to 4 years imprisonment  proposed four requisites likely, in their opinion, to bring  about a climate favorable to the quest of solution: `ending  injustice affecting people, lifting restrictions imposed on  political freedom and information, charity and daawa (Islamic  call) moves, lifting all obstacles preventing the FIS from  undertaking its civilizational mission and restore to people the  right to have a say'.    They also voiced optimism that Algeria will overcome the  crisis if the authorities meet requests of parties which enjoy  popular credibility. For the two men, there are fundamental  convergences on the assessment of the situation among the FIS  leadership, five major political parties, ulema (Islamic  scholars) and political figures.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: German group to spend Pounds 115m on crop protection programme Hoechst and Schering, two of Germany's largest pharmaceutical and chemical companies, which last month merged their plant protection and pest control activities, yesterday announced an invest programme of more than DM300m (Pounds 115m) for crop protection research and development. At the same time Mr Gerhard Prante, chairman of AgrEvo, the new company, said increasing its market share in North America and Japan, which he identified as the two growth areas for pesticides and insecticides, would be one of its main aims. AgrEvo will have 1,200 employees at four research centres in Europe: Berlin, Frankfurt, Paris and Cambridge. They will develop two insecticides and 10 herbicides, which could be registered by the end of the decade. Until their merger, the agrochemical division of Hoechst, primarily focused on cereal herbicides and insecticides. Last year it recorded a turnover of DM2.1bn. Schering, which specialised in sugar beet herbicides, cereal, vine and fruit fungicides, had a turnover of DM1.3bn. Following the merger, AgrEvo, which will have its headquarters in Berlin, expects to have a turnover this year of DM3bn and will employ 8,000 people. The company already holds 15 per cent of the market share in Europe, 5 per cent in Japan, and 4.4 per cent in North America. But AgrEvo expects little growth in Europe this year, because of overcapacity and pressure on agricultural prices. However, it hopes to expand into eastern Europe despite the limited purchasing power of the region's farming community, which no longer enjoys the subsidies of the communist era. But it is the North American and Asian markets that AgrEvo will home in on with the intention of developing and marketing the Basta herbicide, a product designed for compatibility of various crops to glufosinate-ammonium, a compound that destroys pests. Essentially, the Basta herbicide enables crops, through molecular biological processes, to withstand, or have immunity from pesticides and insecticides. Mr Christoph von Szczepanski, head of research at AgrEvo, said the company expected to obtain licences for spring-sown oil seed in Canada by 1995. He added that AgrEvo would introduce to Canada maize, oilseed rape and soyabean species that would be compatible with the Basta herbicide, making the company one of the first to market biologically engineered products. 'The aim of the Basta herbicide is not only to maximise yields but to give farmers greater flexibility in the choice of application time,' said Mr von Szczepanski.</p>

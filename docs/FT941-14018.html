			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Sky's the limit for soaraway Kelvin 'Exclusive: the Queen Mother's killer corgi Ranger has savaged Fergie's dog,' says the main article on the front page of this morning's Sun. Students of tabloid journalism will instantly recognise the style of Mr Kelvin Mackenzie, editor for 13 years. But they will have to turn to the bottom of Page 2 to learn that it is one of the last issues to be edited by him. The archetypal tabloid editor, who rarely appears on television, is leaving what used to be called Fleet Street to be managing director of British Sky Broadcasting. Mr Gus Fischer, chief executive of the paper's parent company News International, said Mr MacKenzie deserved such a career move. 'He is very smart,' Mr Fischer added. 'He can also be serious, very serious.' At BSkyB - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times has a stake - he will join Mr Sam Chisholm, chief executive, one of the few people in the UK media who is every bit as direct in his language as Mr MacKenzie. Mr Chisholm, who will be showing 47-year old Mr MacKenzie the ropes from next Monday, said last night: 'The great thing about Kelvin is he is a highly creative, very energetic man with a great deal of flair and imagination.' Mr Stuart Higgins, aged 37, the deputy editor of The Sun and acting editor of the News of the World, will become only the third editor of the paper since its relaunch by Mr Rupert Murdoch in 1969. Mr MacKenzie was saying little last night about his new job. He did issue an uncharacteristically bland quote about having had the best job in British journalism for the past 13 years and was now on his way to one of the most exciting challenges in television. Other than that he could not be distracted from editing this morning's paper. Independent decision, Page 8</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First part of a two-part interview with President Suleyman </F> Demirel by Hasan Yalcin in Ankara; date not given--Bureau does  not plan to process the second part of the interview a review of  which revealed no fileworthy material]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Yalcin] Looking at the Middle  East, are we seeing a change in the essence of the relations  among Turkey, Iran, and Syria or is this a simple improvement in  ordinary relations? There have been reports of late that joint  operations could be undertaken in Iran and Iraq and that signs  in this direction are being observed. Was this a qualitative  jump?    [Demirel] There is some information to the effect that the  PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] has settled in Iran. These were  rumors for a while and Iran rejected them. Later, the situation  was explained to Iran. Incidents that might have happened over  there would have concerned them. Upon that, a major  rapprochement took place. I held a long conversation with  Hashemi-Rafsanjani in Tehran last year. I also held a long  conversation with him when he visited Istanbul for the ECO  [Economic Cooperation Organization] meeting. Our foreign  minister went to Iran and their's came here. All these things  are good, but there is also an agreement that goes back to 1932.  If they [the PKK] are there, let us launch an operation against  them. We have reached the point of joint operation.    [Yalcin] Is this, that is, the joint operation, something  for  the coming months?    [Demirel] But an improvement is obvious. [reply as  published]    [Yalcin] What about the last three visits?    [Demirel] These were scheduled visits. Their foreign  minister could come at any time. First Vice President Habibi  had to pay a return visit for my visit, but it was then  postponed following the assassination of Ugur Mumcu. It was  said that the Iranians were behind it, which upset them.    [Yalcin] I will ask a question concerning the PKK. For the  last 10 years there have been promises to the effect that this  problem would be eradicated. You too expressed similar views.  Has there been a tragic turn to the events now? [passage  omitted]    [Demirel] No matter which government comes to power it has  to  show the same determination that the 49th government headed by  me and the present 50th government have shown. Any other  government cannot be the government of this state.    [Yalcin] New forces and measures are being introduced. Are  these the foundation of this determination?    [Demirel] These are security measures. There is no political  aspect to it.    [Yalcin] You made a statement on local elections. Could you  clarify it? You said that the PKK candidates will be prevented  from running. What is the legal way to prevent it? That is,  how are you going to do that?    [Demirel] Could a PKK candidate run in an election?    [Yalcin] How are you going to weed out such people since  their being PKK is not written on them?    [Demirel] What I want to say is this: If a PKK member runs  in these elections and wins it would be tantamount to a  plebiscite. The PKK is a criminal organization, a terrorist  group. Could a state, while struggling against the criminal and  terrorist group, also allow its members to run in the elections?  When the time comes, measures against it will be thought out.    [Yalcin] Is there a legal measure before the start of the  elections?    [Demirel] No, there is no legal way to sift out such people  before the elections. But if a candidate says "I am a PKK  member," or is engaged in such propaganda, then the state will  take care of it. Could a state ever allow members of a crime  syndicate to run in elections? Could the state forces, which  pursue the bandits in the mountains, allow the members of that  bandit group to come down to the cities and run in elections?    [Yalcin] There might be legal measures if the state knows  these people.    [Demirel] It knows, it knows. The state knows everything.  Of course there is also the following case: The elections  cannot be presented as a plebiscite if a candidate has not  entered the elections in the name of the PKK and has not openly  declared himself affiliated to it but later announces that he is  a PKK member.    [Yalcin] Simply because he has not stated this at the  beginning?    [Demirel] This is not possible by merely stating that  elections were tantamount to a plebiscite. [passage omitted]    [Yalcin] When we were still publishing the magazine 2000  IKIBIN'E DOGRU, I asked you. I then conveyed to you fresh  reports, and at the time you told me that such organizations are  illegal and that you are opposed to such things. You are now  the head of state and an influential organization is active over  there. I am talking about Hizballah, which is based in the east  and southeast. What can you say on this issue?    [Demirel] The state is closely watching this organization.  The state cannot make concessions to illegal activities. There  cannot be a state where some enjoy the right to commit lawless  acts and some are charged with criminal offenses if they act  lawlessly. We are watching them very closely.    [Yalcin] You might have heard, but it is being said that the  state is making use of Hizballah to balance out the PKK.    [Demirel] Such a claim is wrong.    [Yalcin] But there have been many complaints in this  direction in Batman.    [Demirel] There is no such case.    [Yalcin] There are hundreds of unsolved murders in Batman.    [Demirel] Unfortunately, all these are interconnected. I am  following the case of unsolved crimes very closely.    [Yalcin] Are you satisfied with the things that are being  done to solve these problems? You are at the helm of the state  and yet such things are taking place in the country you run.    [Demirel] It would be very wrong if I were to say that I am  not concerned about what is happening in Turkey. I am very  concerned. But since the state has no other alternative than its  present course of action, then it should do what it is already  doing but do it better and get results. I am telling you openly  that in my former capacity as prime minister and in my present  capacity as the head of the National Security Council I told all  the state organs that the unsolved crimes should be solved.  Otherwise, there will be an inclination to blame them on the  state. I am following this problem very closely. It is being  tackled in a positive manner.</p>

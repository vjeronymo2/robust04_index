			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: London The consensus among City economists is that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, will announce in tomorrow's Budget tax increases of amounting to about Pounds 2bn. These would come on top of the Pounds 6.7bn of increases due to take effect from next April. The tightening of policy which such a strategy would entail is one reason why gilts have performed well in the past month, with yields continuing their downward path of the past year. Another reason is the subdued state of inflationary pressures in Britain, which many economists believe will continue for some time. However, gilts specialists would not like to see Mr Clarke tighten the screw too much in terms of higher taxation. This could push the economy into a long period of low activity, which could mean the public sector borrowing requirement stays high. This would be bad for gilt prices in the long term. The consensus is that the deficit, set for about Pounds 50bn this financial year, will fall to about Pounds 40bn in 1994-95. A figure of this order is likely to be projected by the Treasury tomorrow. In the March Budget, the Treasury forecasts Pounds 44bn. On Budget day, the Bank of England announces gilt-edged stock to be sold in its next auction on December 8. It said on Friday an unspecified amount of bonds in the maturity range between 2002 and 2006 would go on sale.</p>

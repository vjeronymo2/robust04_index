			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Cold shoulder for EU from Norway's north: The debate over Union membership has pitted the coast against Oslo and the south On the outer edge of the Arctic Circle, an epic struggle is under way which will determine Norway's future in Europe. Opposition to membership of the European Union is an article of faith among the farmers and fishermen on Norway's northern coast, and nobody expects the mood to change ahead the November 28 referendum. Mr Ivar Jorgensen, a 6ft 5in goat farmer from near Tromso, sums up the anti-EU atmosphere: 'John Major is the only one telling the truth. He said the European Union needs the Norway's oil and gas and fish, so get them in.' Between beeps from his mobile phone, Mr Jorgensen ticks off more reasons for opposing EU membership: slack EU environmental standards which allow farmers to use growth hormones on animals; contaminated drinking water; high unemployment; and the Common Agricultural Policy, which, he says, has forced an Irish friend to turn his 40-cow farm into a golf course and a motor cycle track. 'But the main reason is the Viking tradition,' says Mr Jorgensen, who would not look out of place in a Norse long-boat. 'We won't let anyone rule over us.' The referendum campaign has exposed latent political conflicts in Norway. Just as in 1973, when Norwegians narrowly voted against membership of the (then) European Economic Community, the struggle pits the coastal periphery against the Oslo-dominated south, the cossetted fish-and-farm economy against free trade-minded business, and national collective bargaining, built around strong trade unions, against Brussels-based decision-making. 'This is a struggle between traditionalists and modernisers which poses a challenge to the Norwegian model,' says Mr Jon Erik Dolvik, head of the Oslo-based Norwegian Institute for Social Science and Research. The intensity of the No campaign has knocked the Labour coalition government led by Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland off balance. Mrs Brundtland has fought her way out of tight spots before, but her own party is split on membership. Polls show the Yes campaign trailing by a solid eight to 10 points, and the people are wary about joining a Union. It was only early this century, she points out during an interview in her office, that Norway escaped 600 years of domination by either Denmark or Sweden, and won independence. The question which the government has so far failed to answer persuasively is what Norway stands to gain from the Union. EU newcomers such as Austria and Finland argued successfully in their referendums that the Union offered security against creeping instability in eastern Europe and Russia. Sweden, which votes in its own referendum on November 13, can plead a strong case for membership because its business and industry are entrenched in the EU market. By contrast, the Norwegians, rich in oil, gas, and fish, suspect that membership may prove an unequal bargain. In Tromso Mr John Arst, a grizzled former torpedo boat captain who once headed the Norwegian coast guard, is adamant that Norway risks having its fisheries plundered by the Europeans, despite government claims that it negotiated a watertight agreement on fishing quotas in its accession agreement. Although Mr Arst voted Yes in 1973 ('I wanted cheaper food and liquor'), he is voting No in 1994. 'If the fish stocks disappear, the coastal communities will disappear,' he says. Mr Helge Gorrissen, who runs two prawn processing plants in the Tromso region, disagrees. A No vote would destroy jobs, forcing companies to move factories to neighbouring Sweden or Finland to take advantage of their favourable EU tariff status. By contrast, a Yes vote would encourage Norwegian business to create hundreds of jobs through the creation of an indigenous fish-processing industry able to export direct to supermarkets in Europe. Mr Terje Osmudsen, a director of the Kvaerner shipbuilding and engineering group, says a No vote would lead to a steady shift of 'knowledge-based' industries to Europe. Like Mrs Brundtland, he rejects the idea that Norway can afford to stick with membership of the European Economic Area - the half-way house which offers the benefits of the single market without the political obligations of full EU membership. 'We need to be involved when common rules are agreed in Brussels on investment and standards, and on areas such as the CO energy tax or the selection of EU-funded research programmes,' Mr Osmudsen says. Against this hard-nosed business calculation must be set the sense of superiority which comes naturally to a nation whose high-wage, low-inflation economy is the envy of its Nordic neighbours. The Norwegian model, with its commitment to open government, equality among women and high employment, is viewed as infinitely purer than the behind-closed-door compromises in Brussels. 'The European Union is a men's playground,' says Mrs Grethe Fossum, a Social Democrat MP who opposes EU entry. It will require a formidable effort to pull public opinion round to supporting EU membership. The best hope lies in a Swedish Yes on November 13, because it would force Norwegians to confront the prospect of relative isolation among their Nordic neighbours. A Norwegian No would leave the country country stranded but defiant alongside Iceland (and Liechtenstein) inside the EEA. Even the independent-minded Mr Arst admits he is uneasy about the future. 'If we just had a little more time (to consider EU membership),' he sighs. 'It's all being done in such a rush.'</p>

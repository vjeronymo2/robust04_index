			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 31 (XINHUA) -- China is to abolish  state prospecting and exploitation of its mineral resources, a  legacy of the planned economy, and incorporate them into the  socialist market economy it is striving to build.    A senior official at the Ministry of Geology and Mineral  Resources said today that several ministries and commissions  under the State Council are putting the final touches to plans  for experimenting with paid development of mineral resources.    According to He Xianjie, deputy director of the ministry's  Department of Mineral Resources Management, the ministry will,  on behalf of the State Council, exercise overall control over  the prospecting, exploitation and utilization of mineral  resources.    All mineral reserves -- the 160 kinds already found  throughout China and those to be discovered -- will be  state-owned assets, and developers will have to pay for their  use. This includes both government departments and private  companies. Prospecting, exploitation and utilization of mineral  resources will be opened to bidding. "Whoever offers terms for  the lowest input and the best economic and social benefits will  be allowed to develop the mineral resources in a specific area,"  he explained.    The plans are meant to "rationalize the use of China's  mineral resources, which, relative to the size of the  population, are not abundant, and to better protect them from  being wasted," the official added.    Mineral resources are specified as state-owned in the  constitution and laws. "In practice, however, their ownership  in a specific area is ambiguous, and this is liable to cause  waste and unnecessary losses," he conceded.    To add value to mineral resources, he said, the State  Council  plans to allow the transfer of property rights on  state-controlled markets.    "After a company gains the right to develop the mineral  resources in a given area, it may transfer it to another company  on terms agreed upon by the two sides," the official explained.    Prospectors will pay rent for the prospecting sites, and the  right to develop the mineral reserves will be given to the  company which is the first to find them," he said.    "These measures are aimed at encouraging market  competition,"  he concluded.    To make the development of mineral resources truly market-  oriented, the official disclosed, the state is to promulgate a  mining law and a law on protecting mineral resources to replace  the "law on mineral resources" currently in force.</p>

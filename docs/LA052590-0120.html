			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAJOR U.S. AIRLINES SLICE SUMMER FARES;  </P> <P> TRAVEL: OTHER CARRIERS MATCH OR BEAT A DISCOUNT COUPON THAT UNITED INAUGURATED.  </P> <P> The lure of a larger share of the vacation travel market has led the nation's  big airlines to break with tradition and discount some of their domestic ticket  prices during the busy summer season.  </P> <P> United Airlines said Thursday it will meet the reductions of competitors who  dropped prices in response to a $35 United coupon offered Monday.  </P> <P> The coupon is good on round-trip tickets of $175 or more.  </P> <P> Trans World Airlines cut some domestic round-trip fares Tuesday by up to 30%,  and American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, USAir and Continental Airlines  announced Wednesday that they also were lowering prices.  </P> <P> Industry analysts say that, so far, the fare cuts pose little danger to the  companies' earnings.  </P> <P> "There are some diminishing returns, as far as profitability, but you don't  give up market share to someone else," said Paul H. Nisbet, an analyst with  Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.  </P> <P> If the war escalates, earnings could become a casualty, he said.  </P> <P> Raymond Neidl, an analyst with Dillon, Read &amp; Co., was surprised that  airlines were offering discounts so early in the vacation season.  </P> <P> United's coupons are good through Dec. 14, excluding Nov. 16-30. The offer  requires a Saturday night stay, and tickets must be bought seven days in  advance of departure and no later than Aug. 31.  </P> <P> United, which American surpassed last year as the nation's biggest carrier in  terms of traffic, was "looking for a recouping of that market share," Nisbet  said.  </P> <P> TWA responded by cutting domestic round-trip fares up to 30% for travel Tuesday  through Thursday. TWA also is requiring a Saturday night stay and seven-day  advance purchase. Tickets must be purchased by June 7. The discount is good for  flights through Dec. 13.  </P> <P> Under TWA's discounts, the lowest coast-to-coast fares fall to $298 from  $428.50.  </P> <P> The restrictions place the lower fares out of peak periods for business travel,  the carriers' most lucrative market.  </P></p>

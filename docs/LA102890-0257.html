			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TURN IN, TUNE ON, SPEAK OUT;  </P> <P> HERE ARE THE RESPONSES TO THE OCT. 7 QUESTION: WHAT ARE THE BEST OF THE NEW  SHOWS?  </P> <P> "American Dreamer" with Robert Urich was a thought-provoking gentle  storywithout the violence and sex that seems to fill the screen today.  </P> <P> Ida K. Miller, Tujunga  </P> <P> New shows? Several really good ones! "Evening Shade," great cast,  veryentertaining; both "Uncle Buck" and "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" provided  somelaughs; Sharon Gless does a fantastic job in "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill."  </P> <P> So, weUre pleased with most of the new shows. But what do we know? We  loved"Slap Maxwell" and that show vanished.  </P> <P> Wayne and Doris Sisk, Cypress  </P> <P> Please convey the following to NBC: "American Dreamer" is refreshing, funny  andreal. We hope it survives.  </P> <P> Doug and Mary Scott, Laguna Niguel  </P> <P> Please add two votes for best new show to our favorite, "Evening Shade."  Thesupporting cast is hilarious, especially Charles Durning and Elizabeth  Ashley.It's also unusual to find a show where the children are "just" the  children, anddo not dominate the stories.  </P> <P> Burt Reynolds is restrained and charming. But why isn't this show on the  CBSMonday night lineup, where it would fit perfectly?  </P> <P> Mr. and Mrs. Kenny Altman, Sherman Oaks  </P> <P> We like "Hull High" and think the network should keep it on the air.  </P> <P> Barbara and Cort Casady, Los Angeles  </P> <P> I haven't been in school since the '60s, but that doesn't stop me from  enjoying"Hull High."  </P> <P> The "musical" is a true American invention. Bravo to "Hull High" for bringing  itinto the '90s with style and good humor. As far as I'm concerned, MGM has  metMTV ... and I couldn't be more pleasantly surprised.  </P> <P> Ginger Smith, North Hollywood  </P> <P> I feel "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" is off to a strong start, showing a lot  ofpotential. Sharon Gless is marvelous. Great delivery and timing. She got  theaudience immediately interested in her character.  </P> <P> Jack Reedon, Fullerton  </P> <P> "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" is the best new show I've seen this season.  Thewriting and directing have been solid. Sharon Gless is very likable and  makesRosie a compelling character.  </P> <P> Pat Cole, Anaheim  </P> <P> Although the ratings don't indicate it at the present, I think "The  FanelliBoys" is one of the best new programs on TV. It presents a combination  of goodwriting, a fine mix of characters, an ethnic flavor which is not  offensive.  </P> <P> Gary Traxler, North Hollywood  </P> <P> There are two new shows that I really hope will be around for a long time.  Theyare "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" and "American Dreamer." They are both  adult,thought provoking and thoroughly enjoyable.  </P> <P> M. Rita Stricklin, Chatsworth  </P> <P> For a long time Wednesday nights were horrible, but along came "The  FanelliBoys," a really funny show with good writing and good actors, it's one  of my topfour favorite shows along with "Lenny" and "Dear John."  </P> <P> Sallie Becker, Tujunga  </P> <P> Great new additions "The Fanelli Boys," "Cop Rock," "DEA," "Against the  Law,"and "Law and Order."  </P> <P> Jim Santorelli, Laguna Hills  </P></p>

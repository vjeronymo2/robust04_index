			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MIND'S EYE: CRESTED KIMONO POWER AND LOVE IN THE JAPANESE BUSINESS FAMILY  BY MATTHEWS MASAYUKI HAMABATA (CORNELL UNIVERSITY PRESS: $17.95; 191 PP.;  0-8014-2333-3)  </P> <P> It's difficult to find two cultures more dramatically different than America  and Japan. While Americans in pursuit of the Dream will blithely slacken ties  to extended family, the Japanese are preoccupied with winning respect within  the family. While Americans celebrate promotions as symbols of money, prestige  and freedom, the Japanese at least seem to accept them somberly, as burdens to  be fulfilled. And while most Americans discreetly cloak their social standing  in private bank accounts or isolated estates, the Japanese are constantly  defining theirs in public: Few lines of Japanese can be spoken, for instance,  without distinguishing between close and distant friends, responsible and  immature relatives, macho and boyish men.  </P> <P> In an America of lonely careerists and fragmented families, do we have  something to learn from the tightly knit Japanese? Or does Japanese culture  confine singular people in a straitjacket? Matt Hamabata, a third-generation  Japanese immigrant, essentially answers "yes" to both questions in "Crested  Kimono," a book where case studies as emotionally charged as Kabuki drama make  up for the occasionally drab fieldwork notes that Hamabata the Haverford  College sociology professor had to include.  </P> <P> Attempting to ingratiate himself in Japanese business families, Hamabata began  his research by pretending to be a native Japanese; this was quickly belied,  however, by tramps across "pure" white floor cushions at dinner parties and a  reluctance to meet with potential marriage partners. "You are being fukoo,"  snaps one matchmaker, "undutiful to your parents."  </P> <P> Gradually, Hamabata learned to manipulate his social position with remarkable  precision: After being given a box of chocolates and $250 in cash, for example,  he makes a long string of calculations and then buys a return gift valued at  exactly $125; his friendship is thereby continued, but circumscribed.  </P> <P> Hamabata's central point, nevertheless, is that most intimate social  relationships in Japan cannot be manipulated with such facility; the Japanese  are constantly compromising their own desires to avoid tensions that might tear  at the social fabric. He interviews four young Japanese women, for example,  whose duty to family confines them in marriages to insensitive, uncaring men.  </P> <P> Hamabata tries to justify the system, dismissing Mitsuko's passionate love for  George, for instance, by pointing out that she later fell out of love. Only  family bonds are lasting, he argues, while "the inner, private life of  emotions, although real, is ephemeral." It's an argument that astutely exposes  problems with American marriages, where a union with another person is often  seen as the only way we can become part of something larger than ourself. But  it fails to acknowledge that Japanese culture might also have its shortcomings,  such as an impersonal dating ritual that permitted Mitsuko to love George only  from afar.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 2 Jun (EFE) -- Today, the "de facto"  government presided over by Judge Emile Jonassaint denied it has  frozen some $800,000 the executive branch of Prime Minister  Robert Malval has in the Central Bank. This money was donated  by AID.    "These are rumors," the government indicated in a communique  released to the media by "de facto" Economy Minister Rigaud  Duplan. Duplan said the decision to freeze the funds had been  made by AID officials.    Duplan maintained that only this organization has the right  to authorize the opening and closing of state checking accounts.  [sentence as received]    "The government's measure to freeze all accounts is not  directly related to any program to finance humanitarian aid,"  Duplan explained.    He added that on 27 May, AID asked the person in charge of  the "PL-480" program, which is responsible for regulating food  assistance, to freeze all operations and withdraw money from the  account in the Central Bank. Despite this request, the Central  Bank refused to hand the money over to the government of  constitutional Prime Minister Robert Malval and to AID when it  wrote a check to recover the funds and transfer them to another  bank.    A Central Bank source said the people in charge of the  institution acted in accordance with a decision of the Economy  Ministry to "freeze" the use of funds to the Malval government,  adding that they were not forced to do so by the Army. The  money in the account comes from the sale of food donated by AID  to the Malval government to finance humanitarian aid for the  poorest sectors of the population.    The constitutional government has not yet reacted to this  decision by the "de facto" government, which wants to use this  money to finance "its social programs."</p>

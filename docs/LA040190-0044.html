			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW TACTICS STUDIED;  </P> <P> POLITICS: LOS ANGELES MAY FOLLOW OTHER AREA CITIES IN LIMITING DEVELOPER ROLES  -- AND THE APPEARANCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST -- IN ENVIRONMENTAL STATEMENTS.  </P> <P> Los Angeles officials who are considering steps to stop developers from  directing environmental reviews of their own projects would be following a path  charted by many other communities -- a move critics say is long overdue.  </P> <P> Many other local governments in Southern California, including Ventura and  Santa Barbara counties and the city of Santa Clarita, do not let developers  manage the environmental review process, out of concern about conflicts of  interest.  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County, however, continue to let  developers select and manage the consultants who prepare environmental impact  reports, or EIRs, on their projects. Developers then have the opportunity to  read and edit the reports before sending them to city planners. Once planners  have accepted an EIR, it is issued as an official government report.  </P> <P> To a wide assortment of critics -- including planning officials outside Los  Angeles and homeowner and environmental activists -- the arrangement is a  conflict of interest and an invitation to abuse.  </P> <P> "It doesn't take a brain surgeon to realize that information is going to get  filtered to best serve the needs of the person that's paying the bill," said  Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn.  </P> <P> "I've been in this business long enough . . . to know that you can pay a  consultant to say anything," said Jeffrey T. Harris, deputy director of  environmental review in the Santa Barbara County Resource Management  Department. "The process can be manipulated severely when you turn the process  over to the fox and put him in the chicken house."  </P> <P> In Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and other areas considered to have tough  planning and environmental standards, government planners choose and manage the  EIR consultants, leaving the developer no role but to pay the bills. As a  further precaution, some cities even restrict communication between consultants  and developers.  </P> <P> No official statistics exist, but an informal survey by The Times of about 40  planning departments suggest more manage EIRs this way than leave developers in  control.  </P> <P> In areas where developers choose consultants, planning officials do review EIRs  and prescribe changes before putting their seal on the work. But planning  departments typically are understaffed, and experts say the most sharp-eyed  planners may be unable to spot every data gap or expunge all promotional  language.  </P> <P> The consultants "basically take the attitude that they are working for the  developer, for the person who's paying the fee," said Frank Meneses, a senior  planning assistant with the Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning.  Often "when the first copy comes in, it's almost like a sales brochure," agreed  Pamela Holt, chief of environmental analysis for the regional planning  department. "Our role is to take any inherent bias out of that."  </P> <P> Some EIRs sing "paeans of praise for the project," said Franklin Eberhard,  deputy director for project planning with the city Planning Department. Keeping  the consultants neutral is one of the "constant battles we fight," said Albert  Landini, supervisor of environmental review for the city department.  </P> <P> These officials said, however, that adequate EIRs are produced under their  system.  </P> <P> They said they send the documents back until they're satisfied that they are  sufficiently thorough and unbiased.  </P> <P> But city planners acknowledged last week that they are thinking of taking over  the job of choosing and managing the consultants who prepare EIRs, leaving  developers only to pay the bills.  </P> <P> "Environmentalists and homeowners may feel more comfortable if it's not done by  the developers," Eberhard explained.  </P> <P> Developer representatives have already served notice that the proposed change  could meet heavy resistance. Developer lobbyist Robert Wilkinson, who heads an  advisory committee to the planning department, predicted the plan is "going to  be objected to by everybody in the development world."  </P> <P> Under the California Environmental Quality Act, an EIR is required for any  project that may have significant environmental effects, including impacts on  air and water quality, wildlife, recreation, traffic and public services such  as schools. Officials may approve an environmentally harmful project, but its  impacts must be fully and objectively disclosed.  </P> <P> EIRs must also discuss alternatives to the project, and possible ways to  mitigate environmental harm, such as by setting aside open space, planting  trees, restoring wetlands, or making traffic improvements.  </P> <P> The mitigations proposed in EIRs are of special importance to the developer  because they can be very costly, even in the millions.  </P> <P> Evidence of bias does appear in some developer-prepared EIRs, critics say,  despite the efforts of planning officials.  </P> <P> One example is the controversial Paramount Ranch project, a 150-unit tract of  million-dollar homes to be built on the former Renaissance Faire site in  Agoura. The National Park Service and Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy had  long hoped to buy the scenic, oak-studded tract as an addition to the Santa  Monica Mountains Recreation Area.  </P> <P> But the developers were not willing sellers and the EIR did not explore the  alternative of using the site as park land. Environmental and homeowner groups  have cited this and other issues in a pending lawsuit that seeks to void the  county's approval of the project.  </P> <P> Another example is the EIR prepared for the Porter Ranch project, a huge  commercial and residential complex planned for the hills above Chatsworth.  </P> <P> The city public works department had argued that the developer should make  certain bridge improvements because the project would add traffic to the area.  The EIR, however, stated that the developer had no legal obligation to make the  improvements.  </P> <P> In some instances, consultants have come under subtle or not-so-subtle pressure  to provide favorable EIRs.  </P> <P> An EIR consultant who has worked mainly in northern California said that on two  occasions developers who hired her to work on EIRs offered special inducements  in return for favorable reports. In one case several years ago, she said, she  was told that if she could justify all the lots the developer wanted, one of  those lots would be hers.  </P> <P> The consultant, who would not speak if identified, said that other times she  was threatened with loss of contracts for being too thorough. She said she was  told: "If it keeps going in this direction, you're not going to get paid and  we'll find someone else to complete the document."  </P> <P> Jim Slosson, a consulting geologist in Van Nuys who has worked on EIRs, has  also been threatened by clients with loss of work for including data that had  not been requested by planning officials, "but that I felt as a professional  should be considered," Slosson said.  </P> <P> "I've said, 'Fine, get someone else,' " Slosson said.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles EIR consultant, who would not speak if identified, said he had  "had many disagreements with clients about content and findings . . . or even  the use of language." Typically, he said, he put more detail in the EIR than  required to "provide . . . a little cushion," should the developer insist on  taking some things out.  </P> <P> Experts said the pressure more often is indirect or subtle, and could tempt the  consultant to tone down his conclusions to avoid conflicts with the client.  "Certainly, the EIR preparer knows who butters their bread," said Jim Moose, a  Sacramento attorney involved in land-use cases.  </P> <P> Consultants "want to stay in the good graces of the developer and they want  business in the future," said John Kirlin, a professor of public administration  at the University of Southern California.  </P> <P> Others cited an informal sorting-out process, in which developers learned over  the years which consultants to deal with and which ones to avoid.  </P> <P> Clay Singer, a Santa Monica-based archaeological consultant who works on EIRs,  is considered more rigorous than some in assessing archaeogical resources at  development sites. As a result, Singer said, he does much of his work outside  the Los Angeles area, because in Los Angeles developers have no incentive to  hire him.  </P> <P> Locally, Singer said, he is retained by those who "are ignorant of my  reputation or . . . who actually want a good job done."  </P> <P> Some planning officials and developers say the risk of abuse is overrated,  since a botched EIR can bring litigation and tie up a project for years.  </P> <P> It's the developer, more than anyone else, who needs "a bullet-proof impact  report," argued Bob Nastase, a developer and former city planner in Upland.  </P> <P> Others said consultants won't compromise their ethics, if only for selfish  reasons. A consultant need only "misrepresent or leave out some important facts  . . . and then that guy is dead meat, he's all done, he can go get a job  selling shoes somewhere," said Ira Norris, president of Inco Homes, a Southland  home builder.  </P> <P> Some developers said they prefered hiring consultants themselves to save time  and red tape, not to assure a favorable EIR. They said it can take months for  planning agencies to solicit bids and contract with an EIR preparer --  something they can do quickly by themselves. Some planning officials said they  prefer to leave the developer in charge, since that spares them the burden of  administering contracts.  </P> <P> But critics of that process point out that developers are major contributors to  the political campaigns of county supervisors and city council members, who  often end up deciding the fate of controversial projects. They say developers  extend their influence by managing the EIR consultants, some of whom are  politically connected themselves.  </P> <P> One example is Engineering Technology Inc. of Sherman Oaks, which not only  wrote the EIR on Porter Ranch, but represented the Paramount Ranch developers  in hearings before the county supervisors. Engineering Technology is a planning  consultancy, but also an "expediter," or lobbying firm, that doles out more  campaign money than many of its developer clients.  </P> <P> Los Angeles isn't the first place where developers have been reluctant to  surrender their control of EIR consultants.  </P> <P> In 1988, for example, former Orange County planning director Robert G. Fisher  suggested that the county take over the hiring of consultants. The idea was  dropped when it provoked a strongly negative reaction from an advisory  committee of developers and consultants, according to Fisher, now the county's  director of harbors, beaches and parks.  </P> <P> A former environmental consultant himself, Fisher said he knew from personal  experience that consultants can be pressured by their developer-clients. "I'm  not suggesting that it's typical, but the problem is that there's that  temptation and it's difficult to know . . . if the public agency isn't managing  the contract," Fisher said.  </P> <P> "Credibility is a very important issue in government," Fisher said, "Our system  should be designed to promote that."  </P> <P> In a sense, developers would shed some political baggage if they gave up  control of the EIR consultants. Their opponents would no longer be able to say  an EIR can't be accurate or fair simply because the developer had a hand in it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How They Handle EIRs  </P> <P> * Some cities and counties that hire and manage EIR consultants:  </P> <P> Burbank, Glendale, Lancaster, Simi Valley, Agoura Hills, Santa Clarita, Santa  Monica, Beverly Hills, Culver City, La Verne, Azusa, Claremont, Ventura*,  Camarillo, Newport Beach, Irvine, San B1701998177  </P> <P> * Some cities and counties that let developers select and manage EIR  consultants*:  </P> <P> Los Angeles, Pasadena, Santa Ana, Fullerton, Riverside, San Jose, San Diego,  San Francisco, Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Diego County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> * Some cities and counties that prepare EIRs using their own planning staffs:  </P> <P> Long Beach, Thousand Oaks, Sacramento County.  </P> <P> *Ventura allows developers to pick consultants from a city-approved list, but  the city then contracts with and manages the consultants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> **Some of these communities require developers to pick consultants from an  approved list. San Francisco allows developers to hire the consultants, but  forbids them from showing the developers 1952998761Source: Interviews with  planning officials from the above cities and counties.  </P></p>

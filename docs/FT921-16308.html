			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Keeping the paperwork MY brother-in-law died in November 1984 and I was named an executor in his will. My co-executor died in June 1990. I have the complete record regarding the liquidation of assets and the final distributions which were made according to his will. The benefactors have gained their inheritances and no query is expected. How necessary/desirable it is for me to continue to hold any records of the transactions? They are somewhat bulky and I would prefer to dispose of them. We think that you should retain all documentation until at least six years after completion of the administration of the estate. If the final distribution was made in 1985 you could consider disposing of the documents, otherwise you should wait before doing so. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

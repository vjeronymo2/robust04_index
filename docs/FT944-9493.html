			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Krona moves centre stage after Swedish EU vote The Swedish krona was the main mover on the foreign exchanges yesterday after a weekend referendum vote in favour of joining the European Union, writes Philip Gawith. Although a 'yes' vote had been largely discounted, the market still drove the krona to a high of SKr4.6530 against the D-Mark, from Friday's close of SKr4.75. Profit-taking then saw the currency slip back to SKr4.712 at the London close. Also in the news was the French franc, where a further political resignation helped to drive the currency to an 11-month low. It closed at FFr3.44/DM, from FFr3.439. Overall activity was fairly subdued, with most market attention focused on the meeting today in the US of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. There is an overwhelming consensus in favour of the Federal Reserve lifting the Fed Funds rate 50 basis points, to 5.25 per cent. With the D-Mark the victim of some selling pressure, the dollar ended firmer at DM1.5453, from DM1.5280. Against the yen it closed at Y98.425 from Y97.5. It finished New York trading at DM1.5445 and Y98.30. Some analysts fear, however, that this will not satisfy the market, leaving the dollar vulnerable to a sell-off. Sterling had a quiet day, with the trade weighted index closing at 80.2 from 80.3. After the initial bout of post-referendum euphoria, the market's attention returned to the underlying economic challenges facing Sweden, causing a small correction. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, commented: 'The krona is probably not going to appreciate much more from here, following the sharp run-up in the weeks ahead of the vote. People realise that joining the EU will not be the answer to many of their problems.' The key concern is whether the new government will succeed in putting its finances on a sounder footing. 'They have to address the fiscal issue if they want to take part in monetary union,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in London. Although the prospect of EU membership is likely to serve as an inducement to tighten policy, the central bank's efforts to curb inflation could complicate this process. Mr Turner noted: 'The central bank has shown itself happy to raise rates if it sees inflation ahead, but that is not terribly consistent with trying to lessen the debt burden.' One of the catalysts for further French franc weakness was the weekend resignation of the co-operation minister Mr Michel Roussin, the latest in a string of corruption related departures. 'Is there another Italian job in the offing? That is what's bothering international investors,' said Mr Peter Luxton, economist at MMS in London. Mr Roussin's departure follows comments last week from Mr Jacques Chirac, a right-wing candidate for the presidency next year, that unsettled markets. He proposed a referendum on whether France would join a single currency arrangement, and also pledged to strive for full employment. Mr Turner said: 'Once you get within six months of an election, as you are in France, politics become a much bigger issue for the markets.' Amid all the speculation about what the Fed may do today, a few facts are to hand. One concerns market expectations: the December and March Eurodollar contracts on the Liffe were trading at 93.97 and 93.46 yesterday, suggesting that the market is expecting rates to rise by around 125 basis points, from 4.75 per cent currently, by the year-end, with a further 50 basis points tightening in the first quarter of 1995. Another involves a bit of history. Citibank, in its latest currency comments, noted that the average cumulative rise in Fed Funds, for any period of monetary tightening since 1960, is 530 basis points over an average time scale of 20 months. 'This implies a potential Fed Funds target of 10 per cent by the end of 1995,' said Citibank. 'However, the current cycle features relatively lower levels of inflation and our best guess is that the Fed Funds rate will move to 8 per cent over that time period.' The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.176bn assistance, at established rates, after forecasting a Pounds 1.15bn shortage. Overnight money traded between 3 1/2 per cent and 5 5/8 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93&hyph;NM&hyph;229&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In April 1988, a transport category airplane managed to land after tiny cracks in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rivet holes in the upper fuselage linked together, causing structural failure and explosive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decompression. An 18-foot section ripped from the fuselage. This accident focused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater attention on the problem of aging aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In June 1988, the FAA sponsored a conference on aging airplane issues, which was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attended by representatives of the aviation industry from around the world. It became  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obvious that, because of the tremendous increase in air travel, the relatively slow pace of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new airplane production, and the apparent economic feasibility of operating older  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology airplanes rather than retiring them, increased attention needed to be focused on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this aging fleet and maintaining its continued operational safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA, in concert with the Regional Airline Association (RAA); the General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA); several U.S. and non-U.S. operators of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected airplanes; the Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the Netherlands; and Fokker; has agreed to undertake the task of identifying and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing procedures to ensure continuing structural airworthiness of aging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commuter-class airplanes. This group reviewed selected service bulletins, applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fokker Model F27 series airplanes, to be recommended for mandatory rulemaking action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure the continued operational safety of these airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This group's proposal is contained in Fokker Report Number SE&hyph;278, ``F27 Aging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aircraft Project-Final Document,'' Issue 3, dated February 1, 1993. This Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> references modifications from eight service bulletins and recommends that they be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated in the applicable Fokker Model F27 series airplanes. The modifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consist of three modifications to the fuselage, two modifications to the wing, and three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications to the empennage of the airplane. They include structural reinforcement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frames, ribs, and stringers; replacement of formers and ribs; and installation of inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> doors and covers, access holes, and drain holes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The procedures described in these service bulletins are intended to positively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address conditions identified in Model F27 series airplanes that, if not corrected, could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in structural failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RLD classified this Report as mandatory and issued Netherlands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Airworthiness Directive (BLA) 91&hyph;058/5 (A), dated July 16, 1993, in order to assure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Netherlands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since fatigue cracking and corrosion are likely to exist or develop on other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require modification of Fokker Model F27 series airplanes prior to their economic design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goal in accordance with the Fokker Report described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The economic design goal of an airplane is typically considered to be the period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service after which a substantial increase in the maintenance costs is expected to take place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to assure continued operational safety. The economic design goal for Fokker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model F27 series airplanes is 90,000 landings for structural problems associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fatigue damage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed compliance time for implementation of the mandatory structural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification program is prior to reaching the applicable economic design goal. This time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interval was determined based upon the ability of the manufacturer to provide the parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for the modification, and the time necessary to incorporate the modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the interim, safety will be provided by various means currently in place that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered satisfactory to detect damage prior to the occurrence of an unsafe condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These include operators' on-going basic maintenance programs; continuing inspections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by numerous previously issued AD's; the Structural Integrity Program (SIP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, previously mandated by AD 92&hyph;19&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;8365 (57 FR 42693,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 16, 1992); the FAA's increased emphasis on surveillance of operators'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance programs and procedures; and the FAA's participation in programs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physically inspect high-time airplanes during scheduled heavy maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 58 Fokker Model F27 series airplanes (excluding Mark 050 series airplanes) of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD within the initial threshold. Since not all affected airplanes would be required to accomplish every modification referenced in each of the service bulletins, the cost impact of the proposed modifications is estimated in the following table. This cost includes the price of modification kits, and the estimated labor rate is $55 per work hour. It does not include the cost of downtime, planning, set up, familiarization, or tool acquisition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

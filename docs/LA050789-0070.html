			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAZA'S 'WAR DAY': 3 DIE, 100 HURT;  </P> <P> CLASHES WITH ISRAELI ARMY BRING HEAVY TOLL AMONG ARABS  </P> <P> Young Jamalat Abu Lulu pondered the violence approaching her door Saturday with  calm as reports of fresh deaths in nearby refugee camps circulated and an  Israeli army helicopter buzzed overhead.  </P> <P> "The situation is getting worse and worse," she said, fingering her "I Love  Palestine" bracelet. "People are getting more and more committed."  </P> <P> The 14-year-old is herself a walking showcase of violent commitment. She has  been wounded three times and is something of a hero in her neighborhood inside  the chock-a-block Rafah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Her tenacity seemed to mirror the events outside on a day when three  Palestinians were shot to death during some of the fiercest confrontations in  the 17-month-old Arab uprising. It was a day designated by Palestinian rebel  leaders as one "of war and confrontation," and the violence reminded onlookers  of the chaotic first months of the uprising, when mass demonstrations often  ended in violence and large numbers of casualties.  </P> <P> The toll of wounded Saturday reached single-day levels never before seen in the  Gaza Strip -- at least 100, according to U.N. officials.  </P> <P> Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin flew into the Gaza Strip by helicopter  to survey the violence. The Gaza area had been declared "pacified" by Israeli  military officials just a month ago.  </P> <P> The unrest capped a bloody month of Ramadan, a time when devout Muslims fast  and pray to commemorate the period when the Prophet Mohammed received the word  of God. At least 40 Palestinians died in clashes with troops during the month,  mostly in the Gaza Strip and the southern part of the West Bank, where Islamic  fundamentalism is strong.  </P> <P> In the Nusseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, a procession of several  hundred congregants from a mosque tried to converge on a cemetery where they  planned to hold memorial services for Palestinian dead, witnesses said.  </P> <P> The crowd chanted "We redeem our martyrs with blood and soul!" and "We want our  state!" then threw stones at observing Israeli troops. An Israeli helicopter  launched tear gas and soldiers fired into the crowd, using marble-sized metal  projectiles, plastic bullets and full-metal rounds.  </P> <P> Word of the unrest in Nusseirat spread to other refugee camps, and crowds took  to the streets, putting burning tires in roadways and pelting army jeeps with  stones if they tried to enter their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "It's getting worse than ever before," said Jorgen Rosenbal, director of Ahli  Hospital, run by the Anglican Church.  </P> <P> Ambulances pulled up frequently to the hospital, bringing patients with a  variety of wounds, especially to the face and upper body. Of the 55 victims  treated by 1:30 p.m., most suffered some injury from bullets, while some had  been hit with the metal marbles and others had been bruised from beatings,  doctors said. Muslim imams broadcast calls for blood donations from  loudspeakers atop minarets.  </P> <P> Mohammed Abdullah Zakout, 35, and Raid Muanes, 20, were shot dead in Nusseirat,  and Id Alama Saud, 22, was killed in the Khan Yunis camp in Gaza.  </P> <P> At some point, Palestinians in Khan Yunis stabbed a suspected collaborator to  death, bringing the day's fatal toll to four.  </P> <P> The latest leaflet circulated by the leadership of the uprising had called for  Saturday to be a day of "war and confrontation." So had published instructions  from the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, which commands a large  following in Gaza.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Follower of Hamas  </P> <P> Abu Lulu is a follower of Hamas; she wears a modest black cloak of the type  fundamentalist women wear and believes that all of what once was Palestine,  Israel included, should form a single state under Islamic law.  </P> <P> Saturday morning, Abu Lulu was sure the violence would soon arrive in Rafah. "I  myself will join up when we hear the call," she assured visitors.  </P> <P> The slightly built girl makes no bones about her role in the intifada, as the  uprising is called by Arabs. Unlike some Palestinians who claim to have been  shot while out shopping, Abu Lulu says she was injured confronting the  soldiers.  </P> <P> She has been hit by rubber-encased bullets, metal marbles and plastic bullets  in the thigh, arm and shoulder. She said she received the latter injury trying  to stop soldiers from beating a neighborhood boy.  </P> <P> The fact that she is a girl in a male-dominated society impedes her none at  all.  </P> <P> "This is a revolution. Are girls supposed to stand around and just let the boys  suffer?" she asked.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fled Home in 1948  </P> <P> Abu Lulu's family fled their home in Beersheba, a desert town east of the Gaza  Strip, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Forty-one years later, the younger  generation has built a record of combat against the Israelis; her eldest  brother, Farid, 21, is spending time in jail for organizing stone throwers to  attack soldiers.  </P> <P> Three other brothers have served short terms in prison; two are in hiding and a  third is recuperating from a chest wound.  </P> <P> Only on occasion does a fancy surface that might seem appropriate to someone  Abu Lulu's age. When asked who here heroes are, she answered: "(PLO leader)  Yasser Arafat and (pop singer) Michael Jackson."  </P></p>

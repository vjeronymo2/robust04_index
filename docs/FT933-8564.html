			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Markets: Storms clear for risk business - The Bottom Line INSURANCE companies this week provided the City with profit figures for the first half indicating that the sector is on the way to recovery after its losses of the last three years. General Accident and Royal Insurance - both of which have seen three years of heavy losses - reported their first profits since 1989, while Commercial Union, which clawed its way back into the black last year, posted further improvement on Wednesday. Two other composites Guardian Royal Exchange and Sun Alliance, look set to continue the trend when they report in the next few weeks. An improvement in trading conditions has helped the sector. John Chester, analyst at SG Warburg, said: 'Everything which is key to the fortunes of insurers is positive. The companies are flying.' Costs have been cut; claims from theft, mortgage indemnity, subsidence and storm damage have declined or levelled off; and growth in the equity and bond markets is strengthening balance sheets. Above all insurers are reaping the benefits of premium rate increases in the home and motor insurance markets, with consumers paying increases of an average 20 per cent per year in 1991 and 1992. Although market reaction this week was mixed - GA and CU both rose while Royal fell - each company's price has risen strongly in the past 18 months. The composite insurance index has outperformed the FT-A All Share Index by 36 per cent since March 1992. Industry leaders believe that positive trading conditions will continue for the next few years. While rates for personal lines business are seen as adequate, commercial buyers still face increases. Both CU and Royal forecast this week that falling returns from investments were putting more pressure on them to underwrite business more profitably. Following billions of pounds of losses from catastrophes in recent years, the cheap reinsurance capacity, which helped fuel rate competition in the 1980s, is no longer available. Indeed European reinsurers are pressing direct insurers to increase rates, reducing the chance of competition. Analysts such as David Hudson, of Credit Lyonnais Laing, believe trading conditions will translate into further upward movement in share prices. 'The industry has entered a period of profitability the likes of which we haven't seen for years,' said Hudson, who is expecting a further 10 per cent outperformance by insurance shares before the sector reaches its peak. Shortages of capital will restrict competition in the UK, and UK insurers are also well placed to benefit from a strengthening in the US and European markets. 'The UK has firmed up in isolation. We are now seeing the first signs of rates hardening in other direct markets,' said Hudson, who said insurance companies may be able to obtain returns on capital of more than 20 per cent in the next few years. Other analysts strike a more cautious note. Chester says the sector is standing on a historic high relative to net assets, with most of the shares trading at a substantial premium. 'Long term investors must remain cautious,' says Chester, 'share prices have rarely traded at premiums to NAVs and when they have, poor share price performance has invariably followed.' Shares of some of the most successful US insurers have reached prices equivalent to 200 per cent of NAV but Warburg believes there is little chance that UK insurers will follow suit. Chester says that such US companies have a proven record of achieving underwriting profits, while this is a relatively new phenomena for UK companies. who have traditionally made money mainly from their investments. In addition insurance companies may not be so immune to competition as they would like to believe. Some analysts stress the potential inroads that rapidly growing low cost producers such as Direct Line and Churchill might still make in the market. Nor, following recent falls in yields, will dividends offer much support to prices. 'We are about to peak,' says Youseef Ziai, analyst with Morgan Stanley. 'Most of the recovery is already discounted.'</p>

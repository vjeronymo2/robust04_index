			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: JA Devenish challenges Boddington to show hand JA DEVENISH, the West Country-based pub operator, yesterday challenged Boddington, its largest shareholder, to declare its intentions towards the company as it unveiled a 17.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to March 31. Profits rose from Pounds 3.95m to Pounds 4.64m on increased sales of Pounds 41.4m (Pounds 30.4m). The company also announced the sale of its 30 per cent holding in Freetraders Group, the drinks wholesaler, for Pounds 5.9m cash, with a further Pounds 1m of working capital to be repaid on September 30 1995. The disposal will give rise to a Pounds 4m exceptional profit in the year-end results. Mr Michael Cannon, chairman, said he continued to regard Boddington's decision to hold on to its 19.5 per cent stake as 'hostile'. The pubs, hotel and healthcare group made a failed bid for Devenish two years ago. 'We assume Boddington's strategy remains hostile towards us; it has had plenty of opportunities to sell its stake. If it is not hostile it should tell us what its intentions are,' said Mr Cannon. Following its decision to withdraw from wholesaling, Devenish has continued to expand its pub estate through acquisitions, mainly responsible for increased profits. Capital expenditure of Pounds 7.4m is expected to increase during the second half of the year. Devenish has already agreed to buy another 10 pubs. Trade in the managed and tenanted pubs in Cornwall has continued to be difficult. Weather permitting, the company expects an improvement on last year's second half. Borrowings rose from Pounds 34.5m to Pounds 42m, representing gearing of 29.4 per cent. The interest charge rose from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 2m. Earnings per share increased to 6.08p (5.26p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.625p (1.5p). COMMENT It is difficult for Boddington to fault Devenish's strategy of focusing on pubs, not least because it first argued for it. But it will not have escaped Boddington's notice that operating profits from Devenish's existing pubs edged up by just Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 5m. With 60 per cent of its pubs based in Cornwall Devenish concedes that there was some truth in Boddington's jibe during its unsuccessful 1991 bid that Devenish issued a 'weather forecast' instead of a profit forecast. To be fair to Devenish the seasonal factor is diminishing as it continues to expand its estate outside of the West Country. The sale of its 30 per cent stake in Freetraders will give it further opportunity to buy more pubs. With forecast full year pre-tax profits of Pounds 15m, the shares up 3p to 283p, are on a prospective multiple of 14.3. Given Boddington's continued interest in the shares, the slight premium to the market average must be justified.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Simply too embarrassed to own up: The present government's hypocrisy will give its opponents an easy time We are, of course, all deeply impressed by the decision of the Conservatives to abstain from political debate in the immediate aftermath of the death of John Smith MP. However, I suspect that the late Labour leader would have pointed out that the Conservative party had more to gain than Labour from such an absence of debate. It is not the least of the many ironies surrounding Smith's sudden death, that it came at a time when he had at last found an issue with which he could harry the government into panic. Do not believe everything that is said by way of eulogy: until last week the Labour Leader had become increasingly criticised by his own backbenchers for his seeming inability to create trouble for the government, rather than merely sit back and watch the conservatives fight among themselves. But, in his relentless harrying of the government's conduct in the House of Commons, as it secretly condoned the talking-out of the disabled persons bill, Smith had returned to his element. The facts are simple enough. The bill, sponsored by backbenchers of all parties, was designed to make it compulsory for all buildings and workplaces to be easily accessible to the disabled. The government had discovered that this measure, which it affected not to oppose, would cost many billions of pounds to implement. Therefore, Nicholas Scott, Minister for the Disabled, gave authority to his civil servants to assist Conservative backbenchers with the drafting of a myriad of blocking amendments, which eventually destroyed the bill. For reasons which remain unclear, or are all too clear, depending on your view of the man, Scott told the House of Commons that the government had no part in this fairly mundane piece of sabotage. Only after the debate was over, and the government got its wicked way, did Scott admit to the subterfuge and apologise for misleading the House. A bit late, that, for the disabled, although one could imagine that some of them - in the manner described by Damon Runyon in the Lemon Drop Kid - had become so angry that they miraculously rose from their wheelchairs. The problem for Scott is that while the cost of the measure proposed was clearly unacceptable, it was politically incorrect for a minister for the disabled to say so. Better to pretend that the government was not opposed to the measure, and let apparently maverick Tory MPs carry the political odium of playing Scrooge to the handicapped millions. This form of hypocrisy is, unfortunately, entirely characteristic of the current government. Even when it is promulgating measures which rightly seek to reduce public spending, it insists that it is doing so for reasons of beneficence. The Child Support Agency, for example, should properly be called the Exchequer Support Agency. The government noticed that social security payment to single mothers had got out of hand, and decided that the only way of evading those demands was to chase fathers for the money - even if those fathers had previously discharged their financial responsibilities by a one-off payment through an agreed court settlement. This revenue-driven policy was defended by the government on the spurious grounds of social engineering, as if it was any business of the state to interfere in agreed court settlements between a man and wife. Similarly the Deparment of Health likes to defend its policy of Care in the Community on the grounds that paranoid schizophrenics will all have a much nicer time wandering about the streets, rather than being locked up in secure accommodation. No health minister has ever had the guts to say: 'We must save money in the National Health Service and closing down asylums is a lesser evil than closing down even more hospitals.' For as long as the government is too embarrassed to admit to its motives - which, I repeat, are not bad ones - the job of the Opposition will be made joyfully simple. John Smith's successor will have a wonderful time. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator</p>

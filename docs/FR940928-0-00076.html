			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPR, the Commission concluded that the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to an initial Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis are not applicable because the Commission has determined that the amendments ``will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' <FOOTCITE>80</FOOTCITE>  In the NPR, the Commission initially concluded that not many companies produce pool and spa heaters. The Commission stated that it had learned that most producers are not ``small entities'' as that term is defined in section 601 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and in the regulations of the Small Business Administration, found in 13 CFR 121. <FOOTCITE>81</FOOTCITE>  The Commission also stated that the market for heat pump water heaters is small, and that only a few companies, two of which are large entities, produce these products at present. <FOOTCITE>82</FOOTCITE>  The Commission noted that most instantaneous water heaters are produced abroad, and are imported by a very small number of small-sized importing firms. <FOOTCITE>83</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 80 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> U.S.C. 603&hyph;605. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 81 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 58 FR 7855. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 82 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 83Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Because it appeared to the Commission that the amendments were not likely to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the rules implementing it, the Commission concluded that a regulatory analysis was not necessary. The Commission, however, requested information in the NPR about the impact of the amendments on small entities to determine whether a final regulatory analysis was necessary. <FOOTCITE>84</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 84 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> No comments provided information about the effect of the amendments on small entities. Two comments, however, provided information on the numbers of entities involved in the manufacture or importation of pool heaters, instantaneous water heaters, and heat pump water heaters. <FOOTCITE>85</FOOTCITE>  According to these comments, there are six companies that produce pool heaters, twelve that either manufacture (at least three are foreign) or import instantaneous water heaters, and four that produce heat pump water heaters. Two of these companies make products in more than one category, so there are 20 companies in all. The Commission has determined that four of these 20 entities are ``small,'' as defined in the Small Business Administration's Size Standards. <FOOTCITE>86</FOOTCITE>  Of the other 16, the Commission has determined that seven are not ``small.'' The Commission has not been able to determine the size of the remaining nine. <FOOTCITE>87</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 85 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> GAMA, E&hyph;3, Appendices; CEC, EE&hyph;2, 3&hyph;4, 6, 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 86 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 13 CFR 121.601. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 87 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> To estimate the size of the companies, the Commission's staff researched the companies in standard reference materials, such as Dun and Bradstreet Information Services, Dun and Bradstreet Million Dollar Directory, Series A&hyph;F, G&hyph;O, P&hyph;Z (1993); Dun and Bradstreet, The Dun and Bradstreet Reference Book of American Business, Vol. 1&hyph;4 (July-Aug. 1993); National Register Publishing, 1993 Directory of Corporate Alliance, Vol. 4 Who Owns Whom International and Private Companies (1993); and conducted informal inquiries with staff of the California Energy Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

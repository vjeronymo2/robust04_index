			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Arts: Royal Opera and the twisted Ring / A look at why the new cartoon-style version of Das Rheingold led to booing at Covent Garden There was tempestuous booing after the Royal Opera's new, cartoon-style Das Rheingold last Thursday. It sounded genuinely angry and disappointed, not orchestrated in advance, and it was quite specific. Once the soloists and the conductor, Bernard Haitink, had been warmly applauded, one after another, the producer and designer were greeted with howls of fury on a truly Wagnerian scale, unprecedented - within recent memory, anyhow - at Covent Garden. You might think: Wagnerians are a conservative lot, they want all the hoary old paraphernalia intact, and the story enacted with uncritical piety. The Wagnerites, here including many Wagner-lovers who were seeing their first Ring in the flesh, would retort: this Rheingold production is unforgivably silly, facetious, inconsequent, diminishing. Yet it is worth remarking that on the next night, Die Walkure - staged in just the same spirit - earned as much delighted applause as booing: less newsworthy, but an interesting fact. The seeds of the trouble (honestly fated, as I think) lay in Wagner's own notion of the Gesamtkunstwerk, the complete art-work - which could only be opera - in which everything heard and seen should be dictated by an overriding idea. In Wagner's case that was easy; his own taste was for picturesque naturalism, and at Bayreuth he used to supervise every detail of the sets, the costumes, the wigs, the action. Long after he died, the family establishment that Bayreuth became was still dedicated to preserving all those details. Before then, producers and designers were barely nodded to. Their tasks were respectively to organise the chorus and help the singers avoid bumping into each other, and to illustrate the librettist's notional locales attractively, and when appropriate impressively. Earlier composers - Monteverdi, Mozart - were often closely involved with the staging, but in the later 19th century the burgeoning of operatic apparatus made that unfeasible for anyone less despotically privileged than Wagner. When Wagner died, however, the concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk lived on; and who, in the absence of the original genius, was to realise it? Part of the problem, as Wagnerians outside Bayreuth discovered, was that literal adherence to Wagner's detailed stage prescriptions soon looks naff, fusty, lifeless. Our tastes in stage manners change. The Royal Opera's clever producer and designer, Richard Jones and Nigel Lowery, must have decided early on that there was no mileage to be got out of staging Alberich's transformations into dragon and toad for real, nor the entry of the gods into Valhalla across the rainbow bridge, nor the wild ride of the Valkyries. Part of the answer came from two visionary designers, Edward Craig and the Swiss Adolphe Appia, and it was driven home by Wagner's grandson Wieland. Simplify everything, even the visible action; take fussy visual details as read, and eliminate them; use modern lighting to set the stage suggestively and strip it down to an arena for the singing actors. Above all, honour the concept of the work - which may have to be winkled out from its old-fashioned format. Never mind that some great operas seem not to be based on any 'guiding concept' at all; for Wagner's, at least, we have the composer's own testimony that his were. Now, Der Ring des Nibelungen is a heady brew of despairing idealism and political prophecy, Jungian mythology before its time and importunate Affekt, fake-primeval epic and ripe 19th-century melodrama. If there really was some overriding Wagnerian conception of the whole, to grasp it we should need to reformulate it in our own modern terms  -which are inexorably different. Ring producers in the 1970s and 1980s liked to fix it to some one modern concept: of political power, or class resentment, or familial tragedy. The peculiarity of the Jones/Lowery staging is simply that it is a pure post-modernist affair, where the designer's fancies have equal weight with anything else. It offers no all-in reading of the operas, but plays catch-as-catch-can with any ideas that they happen to trigger off, with visual cues taken from Picasso, Ernst, Klee and others too numerous to mention. Making the giants Fasolt and Fafner into Siamese twins who share a suit is one such. Others include garbing the Rhinemaidens as gross rubberised nudes, having Fricka as well as Froh and Donner grow a long beard when deprived of the golden youth-apples, and putting Brunnhilde into a tracksuit with a Hallowe'en top and a dinky cheerleader's skirt. During the innocent-age-of-the-world prologue, the Rhinemaidens had to weed their way among a horde of strange, blue-uniformed persons hustling in slow motion toward stage left, reminiscent of Thurber's cartoon for 'The Day the Dam Broke' but quite unexplained. In Die Walkure, those personages became corn-dolly figures with lofty headdresses. One of them, preternaturally tall, served as the tree from which Siegmund must draw the magic sword, and he had plainly outlined shoulder-pads. At the crunch point, Siegmund and Sieglinde pulled at his scarecrow arms in opposite directions. Fricka's cart, originally 'drawn by rams', was an armoured car: okay, but did it have to sport push-button windows? For the epic battle which culminates in Siegmund's death, the lights go out at the crucial moment; and come on again, after an embarrassing pause, to reveal the remaining four characters in an absurd low-budget-sitcom row at the grave. The brute Hunding is not felled by Wotan's scathing gaze, but scrambles off unharmed. Cruellest of all, when the loyal but guilty Brunnhilde prevails upon her father to mitigate her sentence - not to be snatched up by the first comer, but only by a great hero - and the heart-tearing crescendo reaches its climax, instead of the intended father-daughter clinch we have Wotan breaking suddenly away and retreating across half the stage. One of the great cathartic moments in opera is reduced to something shrinking and evasive. This Rheingold founders upon inconsequence and sheer lack of purpose. At the close of the last Royal Opera Rheingold, Gotz Friedrich had the effete gods tripping up Georges Guetary's 'Stairway to Paradise' as decadently as could be, but at least they thought they were going somewhere. Here they do nothing but chase a falling star, literally and ineffectually - and utterly at odds with Wagner's triumphalist music, though like all the rest of the score Haitink judges it to a nicety. Even John Tomlinson's superbly robust Wotan can make little of that, and in the earlier stages Covent Garden's regular Alberich, Ekkehard Wlaschiha, is hobbled by being turned into a mere figure of fun. Robin Leggate's artful Mime awaits Siegfried for his fruition. Commendations to Paul Charles Clarke's Froh and Peter Sidhom's Donner for services in difficult circumstances, and to Jane Henschel, whose distinguished Fricka at last escapes her caricatured guise in Die Walkure; and to Gwynne Howell's unexpectedly sensitive Fasolt, Carsten Stabell's Fafner and Rita Cullis's Freia. Robert Tear's Loge is of course incorrigibly engaging and musical. In Die Walkure, Ulla Gustafsson's very young, shy Sieglinde wields an affecting timbre and brave purpose, Poul Elming's Siegmund adds a raw, vulnerable edge to a finely developed portrayal (stopping short of the ultimate exposure), and Matthias Holle is a Hunding of sterling menace. The great discovery is the tall American Deborah Polaski's Brunnhilde: recklessly heroic singing, and a rare degree of whole-hearted commitment. With some more intimately searching tone-colour, she must soon be one of the great Wagner singers of our day.</p>

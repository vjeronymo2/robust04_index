			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KING DEFENSEMAN LAIDLAW GETS NO RELIEF IN OFF-SEASON  </P> <P> Five months ago, defenseman Tom Laidlaw of the Kings limped off the Boston  Garden ice. Minor injury, it was said. Back in a few days, it was predicted.  </P> <P> Days turned into weeks, the season into the off-season, but still the pain,  centered in his back, persisted.  </P> <P> Another season looms only two weeks ahead, and Laidlaw is still no better.  He'll be absent when the Kings report to training camp in Hull, Canada, on  Sept. 6.  </P> <P> Another defenseman, Bob Halkidis, also will miss training camp while he  continues to recover from shoulder surgery in May.  </P> <P> Halkidis hopes to be back by the start of the regular season; Laidlaw has no  target date.  </P> <P> "If I'm going to miss a good part of the exhibition games," Laidlaw said, "I  may miss a good part of the season as well.  </P> <P> "I don't really have any answers. When someone breaks a leg, you put a cast on.  When they take it off, they can rehabilitate it and are ready to play. But this  is a real guessing game."  </P> <P> The big concern on that St. Patrick's Day in Boston was about Wayne Gretzky,  who also left the ice limping. When the Kings left Boston, Gretzky's injury was  diagnosed as a pulled groin. Laidlaw, it was believed, had a hamstring pull.  </P> <P> By the time Laidlaw got home, however, the pain had moved into his back. And a  minor problem suddenly looked major.  </P> <P> After a summer of therapy and tests, doctors believe Laidlaw may have a tear in  the protective lining around one of his disks.  </P> <P> If further tests this week show loose lining material floating around, surgery  to remove that material could be the solution.  </P> <P> For Laidlaw, a 10-year veteran, the thought has occurred that he may never be  back.  </P> <P> "At 32," he said, "time is not on my side. I hope it doesn't come to that, but  I want to know, one way or the other."  </P></p>

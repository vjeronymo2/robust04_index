			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / More time for Collor's defence PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil last night was granted an extra week to prepare his defence to the Congressional commission considering whether he should be impeached for corruption, Christina Lamb reports from Braslia. The Supreme Court ruled that Mr Collor will have until September 22, instead of next Tuesday as was scheduled. Mr Collor's aides greeted the decision as his first victory in the impeachment battle. The delay may mean that no Congressional vote on impeachment would occur until after the municipal elections to be held on October 3. Presidential advisers believe that would increase his chances of survival. Earlier yesterday, though, Mr Jorge Bornhausen, Mr Collor's political co-ordinator, resigned. He was angered by Mr Collor's refusal to include his suggestions in a speech to the nation 10 days ago.</p>

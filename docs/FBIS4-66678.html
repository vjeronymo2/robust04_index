			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All names as published] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 11. In an historic verdict, the  supreme court today unanimously upheld the dismissal of the  erstwhile BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] governments in M.P.  [Madhya Pradesh], Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh in the wake of  the demolition of the Babri masjid at Ayodhya on December 6,  1992, and at the same time struck down as unconstitutional the  sacking of the three other ministries, including that of the  S.R. Bommai (Janata Dal) in Karnataka, reports PTI [Press Trust  of India].    It is for the first time the dismissal of state governments  and imposition of President's rule has been held as  unconstitutional.    Delivering judgment on petitions challenging the validity of  Article 356 of the constitution under which these governments  were dismissed and President's rule imposed, the nine-judge  bench, headed by Mr. Justice S.R. Pandian, declared in  unequivocal terms that secularism being the bedrock of the  constitution, any act of a state to subvert this could "lawfully  be deemed to give rise to a situation where the government  cannot be carried on in accordance with law".    The judges on the bench comprised Mr. Justice A.M. Ahmedi,  Mr. Justice Kuldip Singh, Mr. Justice J.S. Verma, Mr. Justice  P.B. Sawant, Mr. Justice K. Ramaswamy, Mr. Justice S.C.  Aggarwal, Mr. Justice Yogeshwar Dayal and Mr. Justice B.P.  Jeevan Reddy.    The bench, however, held as unconstitutional the 1989  dismissal of the Janata Dal government headed by Mr. S.R. Bommai  in Karnataka and the Meghalaya and Nagaland governments in  January 1991 and August 1988 respectively.    The judges made it clear that they could, however, not  direct  the revival of these governments as fresh elections held during  the intervening periods had led to the installation of new  ministries.    The sharpest indictment of the policies and programmes of  the  Bharatiya Janata Party came from Mr. Justice K. Ramaswamy who  dwelt at length in separate but concurring judgment on the  party's efforts to use religion in politics which was expressly  prohibited by the constitution.    "Any act by a political party or government of a state in  furtherance of its policies and programmes to mix religion with  politics is violative of not only the law but the constitution,"  Mr. Justice Ramaswamy declared.    The judge observed that if religion was overplayed by  political parties it was bound to result in eruption of social  tensions. Religion he said cannot be mixed with politics.    Justifying the imposition of President's rule and the  dissolution of the assemblies of the three states, Mr. Justice  Ramaswamy said when the President feels that religion had been  mixed with politics by the party in power he was free to reach a  satisfaction under Article 356 in accordance with law.    Earlier, Mr. Justice Pandian in his judgment said he was  however, of the firm opinion that the power of the President to  impose President's rule and dissolve assemblies, should be used  sparingly only when he was fully satisfied as to the situation.  The party in power at the Centre should not be allowed to use  the provision to disrupt constitutional balance by frequent  exercise of the power through the President who acts on the  advice of the Centre.    Mr. Justice Pandian pointed out that as per official  records,  in the last 41 years Article 356 had been invoked by various  ruling parties in power at the Centre 95 times. On 23 occasions  assemblies were dissolved and in 18 cases the assemblies kept in  suspended animation had been revived.    "Pathetically, the provisions had been used frequently to  disrupt constitutional balance and as a result the chief  ministers of the states were held in perpetual fear of the act  of Presidential proclamation. The chief ministers were in many  cases not sure that they would remain in power and stand up in  their seats to fulfil constitutional obligations," Mr. Justice  Pandian said.    In his judgment, Mr. Justice Ahmedi said article 74(2) under  which the Prime Minister and his council of ministers advice the  President in the exercise of his power to impose President's  rule was not a bar for judicial review of the decision.    Merely because a political party had come to power at the  Centre with a majority was not sufficient reason for imposition  of President's rule to dislodge state governments led by other  political parties.    In his concurring judgment, Mr. Justice J.S. Verma said only  objective factors like subversion of the principles of  secularism and failure of constitutional machinery of the state  could be used to invoke Article 356.    The judge said imponderable materials which do not strictly  constitute legal evidence and thus are incapable of being tested  in a court of law, cannot be judicially reviewable.    Mr. Justice P.B. Sawant in his judgment ruled that the  validity of the proclamation under Article 356 was judicially  reviewable to the extent that the materials relied on by the  President were not relevant or extraneous and the exercise of  power was malafide.    In such a case if the concerned state government effected by  the decision could make out a prima facie case then it would be  the burden of the Central government to prove that the materials  did in fact exist.    Mr. Justice Sawant was also of the view that article 74(2)  was not a bar against scrutiny of the material on which the  President had based his satisfaction.    The judge made it clear that since Article 356 was also  intended to check the power of the President in imposing  Presidents rule, it was not permissible for the President to  take irreversible action of dissolving the state assembly till  Parliament approved his action in imposing President's rule.    Mr. Justice Sawant said if the presidential proclamation was  held invalid notwithstanding Parliament's approval the court had  the power to restore status quo ante of the legislative assembly.</p>

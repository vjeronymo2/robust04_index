			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Smith attacks Labour MP for appearing on Iraq TV Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday delivered a strong reprimand to Mr George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead, for appearing on Iraqi television with President Saddam Hussein. Mr Galloway, who has strongly opposed United Nations sanctions on Iraq, was quoted as saying to Mr Saddam: 'Sir, allow me to salute your courage, power and indefatigability. I would like you to know that we are with you until Nasir (victory).' Mr Smith issued a statement deploring 'foolish statements' made by Mr Galloway. He said Mr Galloway would be interviewed by Mr Derek Foster, the opposition chief whip, when he returned to the Commons. Labour MPs speculated that the party might go as far as to 'withdraw the whip' from Mr Galloway, preventing him from attending meetings of the parliamentary Labour party and voting in backbench elections. A prominent backbencher said sentiment was running high against Mr Galloway, whose visit was 'unauthorised'. However, Mr Galloway said his remarks had been misinterpreted. 'It was not to Saddam Hussein, it was to allow me to salute the Iraqi people's courage, power and indefatigability in the face of the enormous barrage of explosive ordnance and strangulating blockade,' he said. Mr Galloway sought to undermine criticism by linking his concern for ordinary Iraqis with his long-standing opposition to British arms sales to the Baghdad government. The government moved quickly to exploit Labour's embarrassment, which Conservative officials hope will help to deflect attention from Mr John Major's troubled back to basics campaign. Sir Norman Fowler, chairman of the Conservative party, said Mr Smith should demand a full retraction from Mr Galloway, or expel him from the parliamentary party. A senior Labour official said no action would be taken against Mr Galloway until a full inquiry had been completed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] A violent, aggressive, and threatening march in  downtown Mexico City reached the National Palace. On Friday  afternoon, various social organizations held a demonstration in  downtown Mexico City. Approximately 5,000 persons were there to  commemorate the 23d anniversary of the 10 June 1971  disturbances. People of all ages took to the streets in the old  section of Santo Tomas; they walked along Puente de Alvarado  Avenue. When they reached the corner with Zaragoza Street in  the Guerrero neighborhood, a bus driver, who did not stop for  the marchers, ran over two persons.    Israel Lopez, age 25, who was driving the bus with Mexico  State license plate No. 96JWV of Route 65, ran over Angel  Sotero, age 48, and Victor Padilla Flores. Both were taken to  the Ruben Lenero Hospital with fractures and internal injuries.  A group of demonstrators wanted to lynch the bus driver and  tried to turn the bus over. Judicial police took him away and  protected him and later took him to the patrol station, which  the demonstrators covered with spray paint.    Israel Lopez was turned over to the Investigation Department  No. 7 of the Federal District. Among the demonstrators were  people from the Francisco Villa Front, who two weeks ago,  blocked the Ignacio Zaragoza Avenue. A female photographer, who  was covering the demonstration, had to defend herself against  two female marchers who started beating her up. Acts of  aggression and attacks against reporters, cameramen, and  photographers followed.    The demonstration continued down Hidalgo Avenue, Eje  Central,  and Madero Street until the marchers reached El Zocalo. The  main gates and the front entrance of the National Palace were  spray painted, and the demonstrators shouted insults against the  government.</p>

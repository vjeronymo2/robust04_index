			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> FALWELL DECRIES BAKKER JAIL TERM  </P> <P> The Rev. Jerry Falwell, who once battled to keep Jim Bakker away from PTL, says  the 45-year prison sentence given to the fallen television evangelist is too  harsh.  </P> <P> "No doubt a debt to society had to be paid, but 45 years is unreasonable,"  Falwell said Sunday night before preaching at Calvary Church.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Robert Potter sentenced Bakker in October for defrauding  followers who had sent him $158 million in exchange for lodging guarantees at  PTL's Heritage USA Christian retreat in nearby Ft. Mill, S.C.  </P> <P> Falwell took over at PTL after Bakker's March, 1987, resignation in a sex and  money scandal involving former church secretary Jessica Hahn. Falwell resigned  six months later, after Bakker announced he wanted to return to the ministry.  </P> <P> "I think everybody here -- including the court -- just got caught up in the  spectacular nature of what was going on," Falwell said.  </P></p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Observer: Starry-eyed How nice to see market forces finally at work in that previously tightly state-controlled sector, the former Soviet space industry. Colonel Talgat Musabayev, a would-be cosmonaut, is being squabbled over by Russia and Kazakhstan; both want him as their interplanetary representative. Russia says he either flies for Russia or Kazakhstan will be charged Dollars 10m a week while he is in space, the going rate for 'foreigners' aboard Russian spacecraft. Musabayev was a Soviet citizen until 1991. And although an ethnic Kazakh, he remained in Russia as an officer with the Russian air force; he holds a Russian residency permit; and works at the Russian cosmonaut training centre. Due to blast off in early July, in theory he should stay in orbit for four months - meaning his flight would cost more than Kazakhstan's entire space budget.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preceding summary of the proposed alteration to the Class B airspace area configuration identifies that airspace which is necessary to contain large turbojet aircraft operations at the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. ATC would provide control and separation service for all flights within the proposed airspace boundaries. Furthermore, ATC clearance is required for aircraft operations within that airspace. Modifying this Class B airspace area would greatly enhance the safety of flight within the congested airspace overlying the Charlotte metropolitan area by facilitating the separation of controlled and uncontrolled flight operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class B airspace area designations are published in Paragraph 3000 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, and is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298), July 6, 1993. The Class B airspace area designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In keeping with the ``principles of regulation'' contained in Executive Order 12866, this section summarizes the regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA on the proposed amendment to 14 CFR part 71_to alter the Charlotte, Class B airspace area, Charlotte, NC. The full regulatory evaluation, contained in the docket, assesses and quantifies, to the extent practicable, estimated costs and anticipated benefits to the private sector, consumers, and Federal, state, and local governments. Additionally, the FAA has determined that this proposed rule is not a ``significant regulatory action''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operational requirements mandate that the Class B airspace area shelves be lowered between 20 and 25 nautical miles of the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport (CLT) to more easily accommodate large turbine-powered aircraft operating in the Class B airspace area. This situation is particularly critical when conducting simultaneous ILS operations due to the present lack of maneuvering airspace for aircraft on final approach to CLT or taking off from CLT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed modifications of the Charlotte Class B airspace area are the result of a staff study conducted by the local FAA authority. The staff's goal was to determine a better Class B airspace area design that would provide greater safety for aircraft operating to and from CLT. The airspace design reflects user feedback and information obtained during Informal Airspace Meetings held June 17 and 18, 1992 at the North Carolina Air National Guard Facility at Charlotte Douglas International Airport. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed modifications were chosen after reviewing three options. The FAA does not recommend the first option, to retain the existing Class B airspace area design, because the area boundaries do not conform to current guidelines for regulated airspace at busier terminal facilities (FAA Order 7400.2), nor do these boundaries provide the necessary Class B airspace area to handle levels of traffic experienced today and projected for the future. The second option, which is also not recommended, would modify the existing Class B airspace area to the standard configuration as contained in FAA Order 7400.2. This option does not have any visual references and the amount of airspace involved would be greater than needed. The FAA chose the third option, which would establish a site specific Class B airspace area configuration based on the operational needs of the Air Traffic facility and input from the Charlotte Class B airspace area ad hoc committee. This option provides necessary Class B airspace area that would contain Charlotte present and future traffic flows. It would also minimize the impact on airspace users and would also enhance the visual means for boundary definition. Finally, it would provide airspace below the floor of the Class B airspace area for VFR operators desiring to remain clear of the Class B airspace area. It would, however, require site-specific charting, and a non-standard design would require heightened area awareness by users. It would also establish controlled airspace where it currently does not exist thereby impacting some users. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Cost Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would impose little or no administrative costs to the FAA. Additional personnel and equipment are not needed to implement this rule. The FAA's controller workforce would be trained in the aspects and procedures of the proposed Class B airspace area during regularly scheduled briefing sessions at no additional costs to the FAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> CITY OKS 64% HIKE IN DEVELOPER FEES  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a 64% hike in developers' fees  to pay for construction of the Eastern Transportation Corridor tollway.  </P> <P> The increase is on the amount developers pay per home. Two-thirds of the cities  represented on the county's tollway agencies must approve the higher developer  fees for them to take effect.  </P> <P> The Foothill/Eastern and San Joaquin transportation corridor agencies have  asked the cities to approve the fee increase to help offset the escalating cost  of constructing the three new tollways.  </P> <P> "The developers will just add this fee to the cost of homes, so the buyers  eventually pay," Councilman William Steiner said.  </P> <P> Fees for houses east of the corridor would rise to $2,327 per single-family  home. For those west of the corridor, fees would be $1,655, according to a  tollway agency report.  </P> <P> A higher fee is levied on homes east of the corridor because development there  will create most of the traffic the new tollway is designed to handle, said  Orange city engineer Gary Johnson.  </P></p>

Duma Not Yet in Session, but Confrontation  Already Growing"]    [Text] It looks as if the renewal of parliament is not  going to bring about a reconciliation. Reports are filtering  through, little by little, about the maneuverings and dealings  being conducted by the leaders of political parties and blocs on  the eve of the State Duma's commencement of work. This was  discussed in the item headed "Party Sword Hangs Over Duma"  (ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA for 4 January). Since its publication the  independent deputies' fears have been confirmed, and they are  being excluded from the formulation of major decisions on the  Federal Assembly organizing committee. And now the newly formed  Interregional Association of Independent Deputies has issued a  trenchant statement.    The editorial office asked Gennadiy Kalistratov and Sergey  Voskholov, members of the organizing committee of the  association of "independents," to comment on this move.    "The statement was prompted by the fact that, for some  reason, only the eight parties that crossed the 5-percent  barrier have voting rights on the Federal Assembly organizing  committee which is currently in session in the Kremlin making  organizational preparations for the first steps in the State  Duma's work. Our association, which was formed back in  December, not only has no voting rights, but is being totally  ignored, as if we did not exist. Absurd views are being  expressed: that the political ideas and guidelines have already  been formulated by the parties, while the independent deputies  elected in the regions for single-seat districts are, so to  speak, deliberately outside politics; your job, they tell us, is  to work in the committees.    "Readers may think that we are inflicting petty  parliamentary  squabbles on the public. But no, this is a serious matter.  This public denigration of the status of independent deputies  compared with those who got in on the party lists prompts great  anxiety.    "It is ridiculous to hear it said that the 'independents'  are  apolitical. True, they did not support a single political  doctrine, but they are united on another, politically  significant principle: 'The revival of Russia through the  revival of the regions.' It is no accident that S. Shakhray has  begun to show a keen interest in us, with his fundamental  principle of emphasis on the regions.    "The parties' leaders realized that by uniting, the  independent deputies -- there are 140 of us -- would become an  influential force that could decide the passage of questions in  parliament. The subsequent actions, alas, bordered on foul play.  The parties' electoral associations described themselves as  factions and declared that all other associations of deputies  can be nothing more than groups. What a ludicrous initiative!  It cannot be so, because factions have substantial procedural  advantages over other types of associations of deputies,  beginning with the power of diktat in the formation of the  Duma's leadership organs. And that, of course, is the plan --  to secure those advantages. Therefore our association of  'independents' has firmly declared its intention to register as  a faction (of course, the faction of 'independents' will be  distinguished by the absence of any kind of internal discipline  or compulsion for the deputies belonging to it).    "When we 'independents' were elected, we never even thought  about uniting to form some kind of wing. But in the light of  this turn of events, more than 50 deputies from the regions (and  15 more have confirmed their desire to join us) got together and  decided not to be fragmented in the parliament hall, but  together to defend the stability of the Duma against unilateral  party actions.    "Hand on heart, we say: This is really no time to engage in  this struggle. Some 150 laws are already being examined, and  must be seriously studied and adopted. It is necessary without  delay to establish cooperation between parliament, the  government, and the Central Bank, so as to continue to pursue  economic reform, but without shock.    "Hence our statement. We demand that the formation of the  Duma's leadership and working organs proceed not on the party  principle, but on the faction principle, and that an obligatory  secret ballot is used, ruling out the system of voting by  'packages' of proposals and lists of candidacies, as they are  now trying to compel us to do."</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (3): Shake-out continues - Players Under Pressure THE BRITISH venture capital industry faces a further round of closures and restructuring as it adapts to the tougher operating conditions of the 1990s. So far, the contraction of the sector has gone largely unnoticed as funds move from active investing to managing their portfolios on a 'care and maintenance' basis though there has been a growing number of more public discomfitures. Optimists in the industry regard the shake-out as an inevitable result of the recession and the stage of maturity that the industry has reached. Pessimists fear a further narrowing of the industry's focus - on buy-outs and development capital - and permanent damage to the less fashionable sectors such as seed funding and start-ups. 'The industry will shrink to a core group of half a dozen 'broad brush' players alongside a number of niche funds,' says Mr David Wansbrough of ECI Ventures. 'The weaker management teams with a poor track record and no deal-flow will decline to looking after the rump of their portfolios,' comments Ian Hawkins of Phildrew Ventures. 'That will concentrate activity among fewer funds. But venture capital is still a young, cyclical industry.' Four key factors are presently at work, taking their toll of some of the marginal players. Their influence is likely to become more rather than less-pronounced over the next two tothree years. Firstly, those funds which have not performed well will be unable to raise further rounds of finance. Funds which invested heavily at the top of the market in 1988-89 in particular are showing very poor returns and may be swept from the board. Secondly, funds which have proved unable to manage problem portfolios will find themselves shut out of future syndication deals. Some venture capitalists have been deeply disillusioned by deal leaders who lacked the skills to help out their portfolio companies when they ran into difficulties. Co-investors found themselves called in to help sort out the problems which should have been dealt with by the deal leader. The more active players are now unwilling to take part in large syndicates and prefer either to take the entire deal onto their own book or to put together small syndicates consisting only of other venture funds they can trust. Thirdly, valuation guidelines introduced two years ago by the British Venture Capital Association have exposed a number of funds with imprudent valuation procedures. Finally, both the British and the European Venture Capital Associations are working on standardised measures of performance of venture capital portfolios. These projects are at a very early stage and are not intended to allow the direct comparison of the performance of different funds. Inevitably though, they will shed more light on performance and weed out the less successful. AT THE seed and early-stage capital end of the market, Oxford Seedcorn Ventures and JMI have both ceased making new investments and are now managing their portfolios on a caretaker basis. Other small players such as Birmingham Technology Venture Capital are almost fully invested while the recently privatised British Technology Group says its venture capital activities, never in the mainstream of the business, will be even less important in future. An ambitious attempt by Midland Bank to establish a nationwide network of regional funds has fallen foul of investor caution and initial plans for 11 funds with Pounds 55m available for investment have been delayed. Midland was hopeful of launching two of the funds, covering the east Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside this month but there is no immediate prospect of the others getting off the ground. However, Midland also has plans to provide small amounts of equity - of between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 750,000 - to suitable banking customers through a separate Growth Capital initiative. Despite Midland's difficulties there is growing evidence that many of the smaller deals are being financed in the regions by small local funds, often with backing from the local authority, its pension fund or a business support organisation such as an enterprise agency or a Training and Enterprise Council. These organisations usually combine social with commercial objectives. There are also signs that 'business angels,' private investors usually with a business background, are providing more funds to early stage ventures on a local basis. Angels are sizeable providers of funds in the US. Local funds and business angels both represent low-cost alternatives to the larger venture capital funds which often have central London offices and highly-paid teams of executives to support. The largest single provider of small amounts of equity capital in recent years has been 3i, currently preparing for a public listing in the form of an approved investment trust. 3i's flotation plans have caused some concern in the industry that institutions would channel all their venture capital investments through 3i, cutting out the smaller venture funds. There are also fears that pressure for dividends will force 3i to reduce investments in smaller, riskier companies. Twice postponed because of the seriousness of the recession, the listing is now planned for 1993. THE SHAKE-OUT is concentrated on the smaller players but even well-established firms have been hit by investments which have turned sour. Sumit Equity Ventures, a Midlands venture group with more than Pounds 40m under management, was bought out by Schroder Ventures and Lyndsay Bury, a founder of Apricot Computers, after a sharp drop in the net asset value of one of its funds. Drayton Consolidated, meanwhile, became the latest investment trust specialising in unquoted investments to be forced into making a savage write-offs on its portfolio. Drayton wrote off more than half the value of its unlisted assets - from Pounds 87m to Pounds 40m - in the six months ended March 1992. Until recently the general assumption in the industry had been that the independent funds, which raise capital from outside investors, would be most vulnerable in a shake-out. But the sudden decision by Hill Samuel, the hard-pressed merchant banking arm of the TSB group, to put its development capital arm up for sale, raised questions over the position of the 'captives,' funds owned by the banks or large institutions. The decision to sell - Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures later took over management of the portfolio - reflected a head office decision to concentrate on activities with a shorter pay-off time than development capital, rather than any problems at Hill Samuel Development Capital itself. But with all the main clearing banks sitting on large loan provisions, there is little doubt that they have been looking at all their non-core businesses, including venture capital. The result of all these developments is that a smaller, more profitable  - but less diverse - venture capital industry seems set to emerge over the next few years.</p>

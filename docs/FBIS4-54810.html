			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Janos Gyarmath under the "We Cannot Leave This </F> Without Commentary" rubric: "Transylvanian Offensive"]    [Text] The ambitious Adrian Nastase and the governing party  thinks that the time has come to obliterate, or attempt to  obliterate, the weak election results of the Social Democracy  Party (of Romania) [RSZDP] in Transylvania. As we recall, in  spite of all his efforts, Ion Iliescu and his troupe did not  succeed at the time in "building a nest" in Transylvania, in the  municipalities of which the votes were acquired by the two  opposing regional parties, the Romanian National Unity Party  [RNEP] and the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania  [RMDSZ], as well as by the Democratic Convention of Romania  [RDK] which was supported by the latter. This fact might lead  one to conclude that the election program of the SZDP did not  capture the sympathy of Transylvanians, for two simple reasons.  On the one hand, its economic policy did not promise the changes  for the towns and villages which Transylvanians expected after  the change of regime in 1989, and on the other hand, the  national strategy proved to be opportunist, because it did not  satisfy extremist Romanian movements, the Romanian Hearth [Vatra  Romaneasca], but neither did it present a modern program,  befitting the spirit of Europe, which could have appealed to the  moderate elements, or to the Hungarians. Thus, in the tense  atmosphere following the events of Marosvasarhely [Tirgu Mures],  essentially with the powerful help of the governing party,  nationalism and xenophobia gained ground in Transylvania,  accompanied by the rise of the RNEP and "Funarism." At the same  time, all the people who were disappointed in the Front(s)  showed their support for the RDK, so that the Hungarians, who  became relatively isolated, would unequivocally vote for the  RMDSZ.    One cannot grasp exactly what is more annoying for the SZDP,  which has a virtual monopoly in the other historical provinces  and especially in the countryside--whether that the RNEP lured a  great number of Romanians from it or rather that by now, in  three rounds of voting, the Hungarians ended up on the other  side, on that of the RDK? Perhaps both. Of course not to the  same degree. Whereas the SZDP has been cooperating, at least in  Parliament, with the RNEP for two years, in spite of all  irritations and partnerial unruliness, the RDK and the RMDSZ,  which delivers votes to it, are indisputably on the other side,  that is to say, in the opposition.    However, it seems that the balance of power is shifting in  Transylvania. It seems that because of its extremist and  demagogue program, because of Mayor Funar's unruliness and its  ties to Caritas, the RNEP is losing speed and at the same time  ground. But in whose favor? Not necessarily in favor of the  governing party, with which not only the Hungarians but also the  Romanian population of the province are more and more  dissatisfied. Thus, an early election would favor the RDK, the  parties of which could lately be labeled less and less "henchmen  of the Hungarians" because they hardly ever stand up to  accusations against the RMDSZ, or for the party's legitimate  demands....    In other words, one must make a move, Adrian Nastase  decided.  And he made a move. Moreover, he did so on Saturday, in Cluj, in  the "nest" of the RNEP, where he convened a regional meeting and  sketched the direction and strategy of his Transylvanian  offensive before 16 SZDP chairmen and prefects from Transylvania  and Bansag. This signals that on the one hand, the governing  party would like to fill the void left by the decline of the  RNEP, and on the other hand, somehow curtail the RMDSZ, namely  by "alienating" several organizations of Hungarians from it. In  other words, if up to now his purpose was to drive a wedge  between the RDK and the RMDSZ, to isolate the latter, and to  strip it from its allies, then from now on he wants more. With a  somewhat modified national policy, he wants to decrease the  political influence of the organizations that safeguard the  interests of Hungarians and to demonstrate that the majority of  the Hungarian population does not follow the "extremists" of the  RMDSZ and does not want any kind of autonomy; that is, having  lost its patience and having resigned itself to everyday  problems, it would be satisfied with much less. This is the  source of the praise for the RMDSZ but also of the serious  accusations that it conducts ambiguous politics and that some of  its leaders are accomplices of the Budapest power structure....    One cannot leave without commentary Adrian Nastase's  "political science" analysis and the intentions of the SZDP. One  must take his ideas seriously. After all, what he planned is a  challenge, a challenge to a "game of chess" which it would be a  sin to begin unprepared. Thus, it would be good to set aside for  a while internal disputes, and put out heads together, so that  in this game, which promises to be serious, there would be no  gaps left, even by accident, in the unprotected defense lines of  the RMDSZ....</p>

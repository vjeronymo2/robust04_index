			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Col. Valeriy Kovalev under "National Armies: </F> View of an Observer" rubric: "Who Is Marching Under the  White-Red-White Banner?"]    [Text] Two years ago, in  March 1992, the Supreme Soviet of Belarus passed a resolution on  the preservation of the Republic Armed Forces. And as early as  May, they organized a Ministry of Defense of the Republic of  Belarus, which began to implement this resolution.    In contrast to some other republics of the former  Union, Belarus did not have to begin to build a national army  from scratch. It inherited from the Armed Forces of the USSR a  powerful force grouping numbering about 170,000 men and equipped  with the most up-to-date combat equipment and  armament--Belarussian Military District, an air army, a separate  air defense army, an airborne division, large rear bases,  arsenals, and depots. It was on this solid foundation that the  Belarussian Armed Forces were established.    One must give credit to the higher leadership of the  Republic  and to the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus: they  did not force the process artificially. Everything possible was  done to see to it that the transformation of the Republic's  Armed Forces took place smoothly and without severe disruptions  of the fate of individuals. People with shoulder straps were  given the opportunity to think and to get their bearings. This  made it possible to avoid a mass outflow of military personnel  from the Republic. By the end of 1992, they had concluded the  legal formation of the Armed Forces and the military doctrine of  Belarus was affirmed. On 31 December of that year, officers and  warrant officers swore allegiance to the Republic. And only  after this did the second and principal stage in the  establishment of the Armed Forces begin--the reduction of the  numerical strength of the forces and the transition to a new  organizational and personnel structure.    According to the plan, it will continue until 1 January  1995.  In the opinion of Col.-Gen. Pavel Kozlovskiy, minister of  defense of the Republic of Belarus, however, the basic tasks in  the reduction and reform of the Armed Forces have practically  been completed already and as time goes on their appearance will  not change substantially.    What does the Belarussian Army look like after two years of  "swimming by itself." A higher leadership and command agencies  have been established and are functioning: the Ministry of  Defense and the main staff. The next step is that of the Army  corps that are replacing tank and combined-arms armies. There  are three of them. The 28th Army Corps includes three separate  mechanized brigades, a base for the storage of armament and  equipment (BKhVT), and a set of corps units. They include units  of missile forces and artillery, signal troops, and engineer  troops. The Seventh Army Corps is made up of mechanized  brigades, three BKhVT, and units subordinate to the corps. The  Fifth Army Corps has two BKhVT and a set of corps units. If  necessary, the bases for the storage of arms and equipment can  form mechanized brigades.    Thus, the mechanized brigade is the basic combat unit of the  Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus that is independently  capable of performing the tasks of mobile defense. It has four  or five battalions: one or two tank and two or three mechanized  battalions. It numbers from 3,000 to 5,000 men. According to  specialists, the brigade in this form is not so far behind the  previous division in firepower but is more mobile than the  latter and is better commanded.    The air forces have likewise undergone some changes. Instead  of the former aviation regiments and divisions, nine air bases  of different purposes have been established. Several  antiaircraft missile brigades and regiments and individual air  defense groups form the basis of the republic's air defense  forces. The separate 120th Guard Rogachevskaya Motorized Rifle  Division and the 103rd Airborne Division that are part of the  ground forces represent a real power.    In the process of reform, the Armed Forces were subjected to  significant cuts. In 1992-1993, almost 13,000 officers and  warrant officers were discharged from them. There are a little  over 100,000 men "under arms" at the present time. The strength  of the armed forces will be reduced to approximately 80-85,000  by the beginning of 1995. In short, the emphasis has been put on  the establishment of a relatively small army that performs  purely defensive functions. The Ministry of Defense considers  that numerical losses must be compensated through up-to-date  armament and equipment, high proficiency of personnel, and  qualified command cadres.    It is another matter whether the Republic will be able to  maintain this potential at the same level in the future. This is  by no means a rhetorical question. Belarus, just as the other  states of the CIS, is experiencing an extremely serious economic  crisis. This year the military department has been allocated a  sum that amounts to only four percent of the Republic budget. It  is asserted in the finance-economic directorate of the Ministry  of Defense that this money is sufficient for only the most  urgent needs.    In the words of Aleksandr Tushinskiy, first deputy minister  of defense of the Republic of Belarus, many other problems  affecting the combat readiness of the Republic's Armed Forces  are arising because of the limited financial possibilities. As  everyone knows, one of its most important components is the  proficiency of personnel. There is combat training in the forces  but it is becoming more and more difficult to organize it. In  the units of the Air Force, for example, they are talking with  concern about the logged flight hours of pilots approaching a  critical level of only 20-30 hours. In the ground troops, the  shortage of vehicle resources is forcing the lion's share of  exercises to be carried out without taking equipment and people  to the training centers. Simulators help out to some extent but  there are not enough of them.    The meager budget of the military department gives rise to  still another serious problem. It is a matter of the social  protection of service personnel. The government and Ministry of  Defense of the Republic are making considerable effort to  provide tolerable conditions for them in their service and daily  life. In two years it was possible to cut almost in half the  number of officers without apartments. Last year the housing  stock of the Ministry of Defense was increased by almost 3,000  apartments. By 1 January 1995 it is planned to reduce the number  of those waiting for housing by another 3,000. But even after  this there will still be more than 7,000 families waiting....    Dissatisfaction with their current material situation is  forcing many military personnel under various pretexts to leave  the service for the reserves or to go over to the armies of  other countries of the CIS. According to the personnel  directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of  Belarus, the shortage of platoon leaders alone is now 700 men  and this number continues to grow. The Armed Forces of the  Republic now have more than 1,500 vacancies for officer  positions, mostly pilots and communications personnel. The once  abundant flow of applications from officers desiring to return  to their homeland has practically dried up--the conditions of  service do not suit them. The personnel problem is being made  worse by the fact that the two military schools in the Republic  cannot provide for the training of officer cadres in all  specialties. Cadets have to be sent to Russia for schooling. And  this is not inexpensive these days.    This year it is proposed to begin the transition to contract  service but these plans had to be postponed for an indefinite  time. The reason is the same as before.    One could continue for some time the list of difficulties  that the Belarussian Army encountered in the phase of its  formation. Alas, there is one root to most of them--the acute  shortage of financing. Apparently, in making the decision to  establish their own armed forces, the higher levels of authority  in the republic were not entirely clear about what their support  will cost.    The past two years have made it quite obvious that much more  funding than was thought will be required to maintain even a  relatively small but up-to-date and well-armed army that is  really capable of defending the sovereignty of the state. The  matter is clear: either the Armed Forces will obtain at least  the minimum that is needed and they will survive or they must be  given up entirely. There is no third choice.    It appears that they have recognized this in the Government  of Belarus. In speaking to generals and officers recently on the  results of a command and staff exercise, Prime Minister of the  Republic of Belarus Vyacheslav Kebich declared that the Council  of Ministers of the Republic is greatly concerned about the  situation developing in the Armed Forces. He also assured them  that the government of the Republic will persistently pursue the  course of close cooperation in the area of defense with other  countries of the CIS and above all with Russia, which will make  it possible to develop the military with fewer expenditures and  greater efficiency.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY'S EISNER HAS TOP SALARY AT $40.1 MILLION  </P> <P> Walt Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner, who orchestrated the company's  transformation into a multimedia entertainment titan, earned $40.1 million in  1988, putting him at the top of Business Week's list of highest-paid corporate  bosses, the magazine said Thursday.  </P> <P> Right behind him is Disney's president, Frank G. Wells, who garnered $32.1  million, the magazine reported in its May 1 edition. The bulk of money earned  by Eisner and Wells came from stock options they exercised.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Biggest Surprise  </P> <P> Business Week said the biggest surprise in its 39th annual survey of executive  pay in the United States was that the average salary and bonus for chief  executive officers topped $1 million for the first time, and the average total  compensation exceeded $2 million.  </P> <P> The survey of 354 corporations found the average CEO's salary and bonus rose to  nearly $1.13 million, an increase of 17% over a year earlier. Stock options and  long-term pay upped the figure to more than $2.02 million, up 14% over a year  earlier.  </P> <P> The advances far exceeded the 1988 average inflation rate of 4.4%.  </P> <P> In the magazine's own analysis of how the CEO's performed considering the money  they make, Business Week gave the best rating to Holly Farms Corp.'s R. Lee  Taylor II, whom it said "gets paid chicken feed by today's standards."  </P> <P> Taylor made a total of $816,000 over the past three years for running a company  with $1.8 billion in annual sales.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Top Earners  </P> <P> Here in descending order are the top 10 earners ranked by Business Week in  terms of 1988 total pay, which includes salary, bonus and long-term  compensation:  </P> <P> Michael D.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Zambia's Foreign Minister Vernon Mwaanga has  resigned. He says he had to go to allow the government to  investigate allegations against various cabinet ministers of  drug trafficking and corruption, but he denies that he has been  involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and there is still  pressure on President Frederick Chiluba to dismiss other  ministers. Our reporter in Zambia, (Anias Nyakuthemba), has  been watching the reaction to the scandal:    [Begin (Nkyakuthemba) recording] Many Zambians and some  Western diplomats have welcomed the decision by Zambia's foreign  affairs minister, Vernon Mwaanga, to resign, saying it would  [words indistinct] precedent and a better government image.  Mwaanga (?officially) resigned yesterday morning, but his  action was not entirely unexpected. It follows several weeks,  if not months, in which pressure from the donors, the  opposition, and the local media has been piling up on President  Frederick Chiluba to sack ministers allegedly involved in drug  trafficking and corrupt practices. Mwaanga said yesterday that  he was bowing to public pressure to resign his post and to allow  the government to prove allegations of his involvement in drug  trafficking even though, he said, he was clean. Mwaanga also  urged what he called corrupt ministers to resign as well.    Many Zambians I interviewed yesterday evening described  Mwaanga's decision as courageous, (?honest), and an excellent  example. Others told the BBC that ministers who were allegedly  corrupt should resign and that, if they (?did not), President  Chiluba should sack them to repair Zambia's tattered image.    Some Western diplomats I talked to also described Mwaanga's  decision as the right step in the right direction, but added  more action was needed to restore donor confidence. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest charges fuel Adwest's 21% rise to Pounds 3.9m Adwest, the automotive components and power systems group, yesterday announced a 21 per cent jump in interim pre-tax profits fuelled by sharply lower interest charges and a 20 per cent improvement in property. Pre-tax profits for the six months to December 31 rose from Pounds 3.24m to Pounds 3.93m, on flat sales of Pounds 63m. At the operating level profits fell by 4 per cent to Pounds 4.04m. Mr Fred Grant, who was making his last presentation as chairman and chief executive before retiring in April, said he was confident Adwest would progress this year. 'We take a fairly confident view of the future,' he said. For this reason the interm dividend was increased by 5 per cent to 2.1p. Earnings rose by 9 per cent to 3.8p. Mr Grant said the group intended to hold dividend cover at about this level. The proceeds of the Pounds 22m rights issue in September, lower interest rates and cash generation helped to cut debt charges from Pounds 1.28m to Pounds 531,000. The property division increased its contribution from Pounds 1.33m to Pounds 1.59m. Mr Graham Menzies, the chief executive-elect, said profits from the manufacturing divisions had held up well when compared with last year's exceptionally strong first half. Profits had been hit by redundancy costs of Pounds 150,000 and bad debts of about Pounds 100,000. Adwest had also suffered abortive acquisition costs which had depressed profits. The automotive division suffered from the French recession, with operating profits 11 per cent lower at Pounds 1.44m, on sales 5 per cent down at Pounds 36.87m. France continued to be difficult, although there were tentative signs of an improvement. Mr Menzies said recent increases in volumes from most of Adwest's main customers had left order books about 12 per cent ahead in the automotive division. Power systems, which relies on defence related orders for about 48 per cent of its business, had been increasingly competitive and margins had suffered. Operating profits fell by 21 per cent to Pounds 1m, on sales 8 per cent ahead to Pounds 24.54m. Mr Menzies said that while orders were still lower than last year, there was some evidence that the decline had halted.</p>

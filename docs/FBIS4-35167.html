			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 26 Jun (EFE) -- For the first time ever, an  official delegation from Spain's conservative People's Party  [PP], the principal opposition party in Spain, has established  contacts with Fidel Castro's government during a visit to  Havana. In addition, the PP delegation also took the  opportunity to meet with representatives of Cuba's domestic  opposition.    Guillermo Gortazar, PP deputy and party secretary, and  Information Office Director Miguel Angel Rodriguez told EFE the  visit was "a goodwill gesture by the PP, and it has been fully  satisfactory and the objectives have been met."    Gortazar stressed that they conveyed "a message of accord"  to  the Cuban authorities in the event of a change of government in  Spain, but they also made it clear that the PP would suggest  recommendations to initiate a process of political opening.    He added that, so far, the PP has demanded improvements in  the treatment of political prisoners, amnesty, and an  acknowledgement of the right to association, just as the current  Constitution envisions.    "Economic changes must translate into genuine political  changes to enable the people to voice protests that will stem  from the required adjustment measures," the deputy pointed out  after warning that some Cuban leaders recognize the risk of a  "social explosion," particularly in Havana.    "Deregulation and opening are a matter of common sense and  political prudence, and it is up to the current leaders to  equitably conduct this process from within the government,"  Gortazar stated.    Miguel Angel Rodriguez insisted that the changes "must be  carried out from within," and he pointed out that the term most  used during his meetings was that of "reconciliation."    Gortazar and Martinez who today, Sunday, ended a visit that  began on Wednesday, met with Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice  president of the Council of Ministers; Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina; Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of  the People's Government [ANPP]; and Jose Ramon Machado Ventura  and Jose Ramon Balaguer, members of the Cuban Communist Party  [PCC] Central Committee Politburo who are responsible for  propaganda and ideology.    "This is the first time," Martinez pointed out, "that a PP  mission has been received by the Central Committee."    The PP representatives, who stressed "the receptiveness" of  the meetings, said their party will invite between eight and 10  Cuban officials to a seminar on "political transition" that will  be held in Madrid in the autumn.    Both PP leaders noted that Cuban authorities expressed great  interest in establishing closer ties with the PP, as  demonstrated by the fact that official interviews included on  their itinerary were not canceled following their meeting with  some members of Cuba's domestic opposition. "This establishes a  precedence and is evidence that the Cuban authorities' interest  in the PP is very high," Miguel Angel Martinez stated.    Human rights activists Elizardo Sanchez Santacruz, Vladimiro  Roca, Rene del Pozo, Jesus Yanes Pelletier, and Gustavo Arcos,  as well as others, participated in meetings with the PP.  According to Gortazar, they said, "the government is giving out  false signals of change, while, at the same time, the human  rights situation is deteriorating."</p>

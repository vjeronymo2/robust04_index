			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> OVERRIDE OF SCHOOL SPENDING CUTS FAILS  </P> <P> Efforts to override Gov. George Deukmejian's veto of $462 million in school  spending were dealt a fatal blow when Senate Democrats said they would not  support such a confrontation and preferred to mend the problem through  negotiations. Senate Democrats said they favor restoration of the cuts but are  unwilling to reopen wounds from last month's bruising budget battle while  Assembly Republicans are waiting on the other side of the Capitol to shoot down  any Democratic override attempt.  </P> <P> "We think it would be a futile effort and it would just take time away from  what we have to do with three weeks to go" before the Legislature adjourns for  the year, said Senate leader David Roberti (D-Los Angeles). Any attempt to  override a budget veto must start in the upper house because the spending plan  signed last week by Deukmejian originated from a Senate bill.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SENATE PANEL OKS CROAKER FISHING BAN  </P> <P> A state Senate panel Tuesday approved a ban on commercial fishing of white  croaker in Santa Monica Bay. The Senate Committee on Natural Resources and  Wildlife, in an 8-0 vote, approved a bill that also would prohibit commercial  fishing of white croaker near the White Point Sewage Outfall near the Palos  Verdes Peninsula.  </P> <P> Tests of the water in the area show it has "extremely high levels of toxic  contamination" and that the white croaker species in particular is "unfit for  human consumption," said Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), who authored  the bill.  </P> <P> Although authorities thought commercial fishing near the outfall had stopped  after tests disclosed the problem in 1985, they found evidence last year that  fishermen were catching white croaker and "those fish are sold to unsuspecting  consumers," Rosenthal said.  </P> <P> He said his bill, which was sent to the Senate Appropriations Committee for  another vote, was limited to white croaker because it is not a transient  species and therefore susceptible to site-specific contamination.  </P> <P> Another bill approved by the committee would authorize the state director of  fish and game to close contaminated areas to commercial fishing.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> COOK RUNS OUT OF LUCK IN VEGAS  </P> <P> For a second Sunday, John Cook thought his 95-yard sand wedge was going to give  him a miracle victory in the Las Vegas Invitational.  </P> <P> But the shot, which would have been a birdie on the first hole of a playoff had  it stayed in the cup, hit the bottom and spun out, landing 15 feet away.  </P> <P> Bob Tway then two-putted for par and collected $234,000 from the $1.3-million  purse for winning the 90-hole tournament that was played over three desert  courses.  </P> <P> Was Cook disappointed, upset or angry about the ball that disappeared in the  cup for the winner, then came out?  </P> <P> "Not in the least," Cook said. "Not in this game. These things happen."  </P> <P> Tway, the leader by three shots at the start of the final round at Las Vegas  Country Club, struggled all day.  </P> <P> His lead was gone by the eighth hole, and when Cook birdied from 10 feet at the  11th, Tway was behind.  </P> <P> It stayed that way until Cook made his first mistake of the day, three-putting  for bogey on the 16th. Each birdied the final hole to force a playoff.  </P> <P> They finished 90 holes at 334, 26 under par. Cook had a closing 67 and Tway a  70.  </P> <P> On the first playoff hole, the par-four 12th, Cook pulled his tee shot behind a  tree and had to play out into the fairway. With 95 yards to the hole, he hit  his sand-wedge shot into the hole -- and out.  </P> <P> Tway reached the green in two and two-putted for the par that became the winner  when Cook missed a 15-footer from the front fringe.  </P> <P> Corey Pavin and Phil Blackmar missed the playoff by three strokes at 337. Pavin  came from a tie for 15th with a bogey-free, nine-under-par 63. Blackmar had a  67 that included a three-putt par on the par-five 18th.  </P> <P> Cathy Gerring shot a one-under-par 71 and beat Beth Daniel by one stroke in the  LPGA World Championship at Cely, France.  </P> <P> Gerring, who led through every round, shot 10-under 278 to win her third title  this year.  </P> <P> Daniel, needing a victory to clinch player-of-the-year honors, finished with a  68. Patty Sheehan, who tied for fourth, remained in the running for the honor.  </P> <P> Sheehan can catch Daniel by winning the last official LPGA Tour event, the  Mazda-Japan Classic in Tokyo, Nov. 1-4. If Sheehan wins and Daniel finishes  below the top five, they would end in a tie.  </P> <P> Gerring led from the 18th hole on the first day. She started the final round  with a three-stroke advantage and increased it to seven with four birdies  through five holes.  </P> <P> But she then saw her lead shrink over the back nine, where she bogeyed three  times.  </P> <P> Gerring hit through the 14th green to drop a shot, then missed the 15th green  to bogey again.  </P> <P> Defending tournament champion Betsy King had a 72 Sunday to finish third at  282.  </P> <P> Cindy Rarick and Dottie Mochrie both carded 70 and tied at 284 with Sheehan,  who shot 68.  </P> <P> Bruce Crampton shot a three-under-par 69 to win the Gatlin Brothers Southwest  Senior Classic at Abilene, Tex., by four shots over Lee Trevino.  </P> <P> Crampton had three consecutive sub-70 rounds for a 12-under-par 204 on the  par-72, 6,843-yard Fairway Oaks Country Club course.  </P> <P> Chi Chi Rodriguez and Terry Dill finished tied for third at 210, two shots  behind Trevino.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a precise shot-making round like the other two rounds," said  Crampton, who had rounds of 67 and 68 to enter the final day with a three-shot  lead over Robert Ganoa. The final two days were played in winds that gusted  more than 20 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Crampton never led by less than three, as he started his round with a pair of  birdies. Ganoa pulled to within three on the fifth hole with a 25-foot birdie,  but Crampton topped it with a 20-foot par. Crampton pulled away from Ganoa on  the seventh when Crampton birdied and Ganoa bogeyed.  </P> <P> Trevino got to within three shots, but he bogeyed the 17th hole to deny him a  chance at winning his seventh tournament this year.  </P></p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Jaguar to invest Pounds 700m in five years JAGUAR, the UK luxury carmaker and a subsidiary of Ford of the US, said yesterday that it plans to invest about Pounds 700m during the next five years to develop new models and modernise its production plants, Kevin Done writes. The plan includes the development of replacement models for Jaguar's existing XJ6 saloon and XJS coupe and convertible ranges. Jaguar also aims to produce smaller sporty saloons to compete with models such as the BMW 5-Series and will develop a range of V8 engines to be built at the Ford engine plant at Bridgend, south Wales. The programme to develop a revamped XJ6 saloon has already been approved by Ford.</p>

The report adds that in this  context, the Secretariat maintained relations with more than 300  cities from different countries of the world.    Outstanding among these was Spain, where 200 towns  contributed support. Buses, street cleaning equipment,  ambulances, and school and automotive equipment were part of the  donations made in 1993 in an effort to alleviate the shortages  prompted by the U.S. blockade and the demise of the  international socialist community.</p>

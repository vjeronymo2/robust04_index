			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / SPD lays out tax change plans Germany's opposition Social Democrats yesterday fleshed out their plans for drastic tax changes if they win the October election, promising to scrap the government's 7.5 per cent 'solidarity surcharge' to pay for unification at their first cabinet meeting. They are also promising a big increase in child allowances at once, and a rise in the tax threshold from 1996. The two first measures would come into effect almost immediately - by January 1. To pay for the cuts, higher earners, with more than DM60,000 (Pounds 24,800) a year taxable income, will have to pay a 10 per cent income tax surcharge, and married couples will lose some tax benefits. Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the party's economy and finance spokesman, said the whole package amounted to DM75bn in tax changes, with a neutral effect on revenues, but big benefits for the great majority of low-paid wage earners.</p>

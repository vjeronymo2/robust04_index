			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Tallinn, June 16 -- Estonian Interior Minister  Heiki Arike narrowly won a vote of confidence with 43 MPs  supporting the bill on no confidence while the required number  of votes was 51. Thirteen MPs voted against the bill while five  abstained.    The bill was presented to the Riigikogu [parliament] by Ants  Erm on grounds that the minister had allowed granting arms sales  certificate to a company who had planned to export them to  Azerbaijan.    His move followed a statement by Uuno Ellen, the Director  General of the Estonian Police Board, that he had been advised  to sign the certificate by Arike. Ellen also read a written  suggestion by Arike in a broadcast at commercial KUKU radio.</p>

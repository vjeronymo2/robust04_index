			<p>BFN     [Text] President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano has said  that the issue of an eventual government of national unity has  not been definitely put aside. The head of state said what is  important is that the government to be formed after the October  elections should be able to maintain stability, peace, and  correct operation, so that it can build a better future for the  Mozambican people. President Joaquim Chissano said this in  Maputo yesterday at a concert on the occasion of the 19th  anniversary of national independence.</p>

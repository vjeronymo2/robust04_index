He said the municipality should  make new progress in five fields of scientific and technological  work.    We must make great progress in industries using new and high  technology, focusing on bioengineering and new pharmaceutical  industries. We will strive to establish 200 new enterprises  using new and high technology, increasing the output value of  industries using such technology to more than 20 billion yuan  this year, approximately 6 billion yuan more than last year's  planned target.    We must increase the number of private scientific and  technological enterprises from more than 6,000 currently to more  than 7,000. We must vigorously lead qualified enterprises to  broaden their scale, raise their technological levels,  industrialize new and high technology, form conglomerates, and  internationalize new and high technology.    We must achieve significant breakthroughs in technological  exchanges and establish markets for specialized technologies,  such as computer science, bioengineering, and new  pharmaceuticals. In 1994, we will strive to achieve more than  2.2 billion yuan in trade volume in technological markets.    We must make rapid progress in raising key basic research  projects to world levels. Last year, more than 40 basic  research projects reached advanced international levels. This  year we will strive to make new progress on the basis of last  year's achievements.    We must bring about significant changes in reforming the  scientific and technological structure and grant independent  foreign trading rights to research institutions which have sound  foundations and conditions. We should set up, on a trial basis,  a group of research and development institutions jointly funded  by Chinese and foreigners, and combine basic research with  technological development.    This year, Shanghai will create even better conditions under  which scientists and technicians, the middle-aged and young ones  in particular, will conduct scientific research. It will  provide assistants for some 200 leading figures in various  scientific fields; abundant scientific research funds for  approximately 3,000 researchers of the basic sciences; and  special allowances for around 150 key members in scientific and  technological fields, who will receive an average annual  allowance of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per person.</p>

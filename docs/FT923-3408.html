			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: Sweden draws up contingency plan to bail out banks THE Swedish government is preparing contingency plans to save the country's banking system from possible collapse. Faced with estimated credit losses for all Sweden's banks of up to SKr90bn over the next few years, the finance ministry is drawing up options for action should the position worsen. Mr Urban Backstrom, under secretary at the finance ministry, said the measures included the state acquiring the bank's bad debts or setting up some form of insurance to curb their credit losses. The banks would have to guarantee to repay the state over a number of years. However, Mr Backstrom ruled out taking the banks into state ownership. 'We don't want the government to own banks,' he said. 'We have seen from the experience of other countries that this is inefficient,' referring to Norway and Finland. The cost to the government of any further bank rescues could be substantial. He said: 'Everybody will have to pay for achieving stability as taxpayers and customers. 'Foreigners and creditors to the Swedish banking system should not feel worried because the government will defend it.' Earlier this year the Swedish government carried out ad hoc rescues of Nordbanken, with SKr20bn in loans and guarantees, and Forsta Sparbanken, the savings bank with SKr7.3bn. And this week the government was forced to guarantee all the obligations of Gota Bank, Sweden's fourth largest commercial bank. But Mr Backstrom said the state had to prepare for a 'worst case scenario' with a comprehensive strategy 'taking a whole grip of the banking system'. The troubles of Sweden's banking sector increased yesterday when Moody's Investors Service said it was reviewing the possible downgrading of the long-term debt ratings of the country's leading commercial banks. These are Skandinaviska-Enskilda Banken, Svenska Handelsbanken, Nordbanken and Swedbank, the savings bank. Mr Bjorn Sprangare, chief executive of Trygg-Hansa - the insurance conglomerate which is Gota Bank's chief shareholder - said yesterday his company would continue to provide financial support for the bank as long as this did not put at risk Trygg-Hansa's financial position. His remarks cleared up confusion earlier this week, when it appeared Trygg-Hansa thought the Swedish state would be responsible entirely for Gota's financial rescue. Under pressure from the finance ministry, Mr Sprangare accepted that Trygg-Hansa would continue to 'contribute to a solution which limits the burden on tax payers'. At the same time the Swedish government emphasised it will guarantee all the activities of Gota Bank to individual customers, corporations and other creditors, until a solution is found for its future. This followed the bank revealing that credit losses for this year would mount to SKr8bn, with an operating deficit of between SKr3bn and SKr4bn.</p>

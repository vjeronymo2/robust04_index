			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deutsche Bundespost [DPB] Telekom intends its  ambitious "Metropole Berlin-Brandenburg" project to help Berlin  win back its status as one of the leading telecommunications  cities in the world. The ideas that have emerged from the  Telecommunications 2001 Berlin-Brandenburg land-level initiative  have also been incorporated into the project, which is initially  scheduled for conclusion at the end of 1997. It entails  investments amounting to 8.1 billion German marks [DM], already  budgeted in DBP Telekom's Eastern Expansion program. DBP  Telekom has already invested DM6.6 billion in the greater Berlin  area.  <H5>  Prestige Project for Germany's Capital </H5>   Much has already been done in Berlin with a view to  normalizing telecommunications, but a comparison with other  world capitals still reveals a considerable shortfall. This is  particularly so in view of the future telecommunications demands  that will arise out of Berlin's pivotal position in central  Europe, where it acts as a hinge between east and west, and out  of its new role as Germany's capital and seat of parliament and  government.    Even now, greater Berlin, with its population of about 4.3  million, including 3.6 million in the immediate urban area, is  already by far the greatest conurbation in Germany, larger than  the Munich, Frankfurt, and Stuttgart districts. In view of  this, DBP Telekom has decided to top up its "normal" Eastern  Expansion program with an extra project going by the name of  "Metropole Berlin-Brandenburg" to accelerate the expansion of  telecommunications in the federal capital. Gerd Tenzer, a DBP  Telekom board member, heads the board committee running the  project.    DBP Telekom wants to demonstrate its love of innovation and  its efficiency first and foremost in Berlin. The conditions are  all in its favor. It has about 15,000 employees in the city.  In addition to operational units (directorates and  telecommunications exchanges), Berlin is home to major sections  of DBP Telekom's inhouse Research and Technology Center (FTZ), a  data processing development center, a DBP Telekom technical  training college, a management development center for managerial  staff, and a number of subsidiaries -- e.g., DeTe Berkom, the  German Trunk Cable Corporation (DFKG), and divisions of German  Telepost Consulting (DeTeCon).    DBP Telekom considers that the additional DM8.1 billion that  it will invest up to the end of 1997 will be sufficient to  implement the Metropole Berlin-Brandenburg project.  <H5>  Boom in Berlin and Brandenburg </H5>   The economic structure of the Berlin-Brandenburg area will  undergo profound changes in the near future: Manufacturing  companies will increasingly tend to relocate to the outskirts,  while service industries and administrations will concentrate to  an even greater extent in the city center. The Berlin city  planning authority expects about 200,000 new jobs to be created  within the city boundaries alone.    Berlin's status as capital city and seat of government and  the new importance that this will bestow on the city as an  economic center will also boost its population. The planning  authorities in Berlin and Brandenburg expect a 1-million  population increase over the next 10 to 15 years. This will  bring the population of the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolis up to  over 5 million and make it one of the largest conurbations in  Europe and the world.    A well-developed infrastructure is essential for a  metropolis  of this size, and, now more than ever before, this also means  the telecommunications infrastructure. Berlin's should stand  comparison with those of world-rank cities, such as Paris,  London, or New York, i.e., meet international standards. The  Metropole Berlin- Brandenburg project sets out to create just  such an infrastructure in greater Berlin within the shortest  possible time. This massive task cannot be performed using  standard network tools.    Berlin and Brandenburg are merging to form a single economic  area. New telecommunications services are opening up  considerable development potential for product quality,  quantity, and cost- effectiveness in many branches of industry.  New applications based on metropolitan area networks (MAN's),  broadband communications, intelligent services, and mobile radio  are providing opportunities for raising efficiency. Future  investors in the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolis, be they the  Federal Government, multinationals, or even small craft  enterprises, will have access to a telecommunications  infrastructure commensurate with their requirements. The  Berlin- Brandenburg conurbation is on the way to becoming the  German telecommunications industry's worldwide advertising  poster.  <H5>  Digital Technology for Customer-Oriented Network Expansion </H5>   Over the next few months, work on the project will focus on  analyzing demand in the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolis as closely  as possible. An initial assessment of potential for Berlin and  the surrounding areas indicates that, over and above normal  requirement projections, approximately 1 million extra telephone  lines are likely to be required up to the turn of the century  and as many as 1.4 million more by the end of the year 2010.    Nowadays, one of the main parameters for evaluating the  efficiency of a telecommunications network is its degree of  digitization. In addition to accommodating new services,  network digitization makes for efficient operation with low  operating costs. Berlin is lagging way behind other conurbations  in terms of digitization, so one of the keys to the success of  the Metropole Berlin-Brandenburg project lies in speeding up the  digitization process. New technologies such as Opal [optical  line] (optical fiber systems in the subscriber line sphere), IN  (intelligent networks), SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy), and  ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) will also help minimize costs.    The medium-term goal is to set up a broadband ISDN  [integrated services digital network] with optical fiber cables  and ATM switching systems for voice, data, and image  transmission at high data rates. The introduction of multimedia  applications means that broadband communication is acquiring  increasing importance. Multimedia will substantially modify the  forms in which business and system customers communicate. The  relocation of the Federal Government to Berlin and the arrival  in the area of branches of a multitude of major German and  foreign companies will further raise requirements and demand in  this field.  <H5>  Status of "Telecom 2000" Program </H5>   Since German unification, 2 million telephone lines and over  35,000 data lines have been installed in the new federal  laender. Investments to date, which amount to about DM25  billion, have secured 100,000 jobs in eastern Germany. Of this  sum, DM6.6 billion went to greater Berlin, including DM4 billion  for the city of Berlin itself. Overall, DBP Telekom intends to  invest about DM60 billion under its Expansion East campaign by  the end of 1997. A new telecommunications network has been  created, for which the digital overlay network forms the  skeleton and which is being fleshed out exclusively with the  most advanced optical fiber technology. Approximately 4,500 km  of optical fiber cables have been laid to date, making a total  of 140,000 km of fibers. Over 35,000 data transmission lines  have been provided specially for trade and industry. The  service provided in the new federal laender will be sufficient  to meet demand by the end of the current year. In the meantime,  there are 92 telephones per 100 households in eastern Berlin.  The density in the original federal laender averages out at 112  telephones per 100 households, whereas the average in the new  laender is 57. DBP Telekom intends to invest heavily in  expanding the telecommunications infrastructure in future years  as well: According to the recently drawn-up medium-term budget  for 1994-1998, about DM10 billion will be invested this year  too, DM1.5 billion in Berlin and DM810 million in the  surrounding area. Plans to the end of 1997 include the  provision of about 3.5 million more telephone lines, just under  70,000 data lines, and about 2 million cable lines. The overall  telecommunications service supply in eastern Germany will then  be commensurate with demand.  <H5>  Broadband Communications Between Berlin and Bonn </H5>   The Berkom [Berlin Communications] Bravo project, which  centers on telecommunications for the parallel conduct of  government business in Berlin and Bonn, has now reached the  trial stage, under which broadband communication between the  rivers Spree and Rhine is being tried out. The participants in  this major multimedia field trial are the Federal Chancellery  and the Federal Press Office, the ministries of Finance (BMF),  Posts and Telecommunications (BMPT), and the Family and Senior  Citizens (BMFuS), and the Trust Agency.    The multimedia workstations installed in these agencies in  Bonn and Berlin make it possible, for instance, to conduct  videoconferences between one desk and another or to draft the  same document together. This type of communication saves time  and is effective. Especially since the decision to keep  sections of the ministries and other bodies in Bonn even after  the planned move to Berlin, an efficient information link  between the two cities takes on crucial importance for the  future.    Based on Bravo, DBP Telekom has drawn up a comprehensive  service strategy for a link of this type and submitted an offer  to the Federal Minister of the Interior accordingly: The  "Federal Agencies Network 2000" (BBN 2000). It fulfills two  main requirements -- the distributed organizational units of the  federal agencies must be united by telepresence and  telecooperation facilities, and the agencies' employees must be  accessible at any time from both inside and outside the BBN, if  possible via a central phone number, regardless of their  location. It is thus planned to bring the uppermost federal  authorities in Berlin and Bonn together under a single,  nationwide "area" code, thus creating a Federal Government local  network. BBN 2000 is a corporate network tailored to the  requirements of the Federal Government as "client.'' The  service provides much more than an advanced optical fiber  infrastructure between federal agencies in Berlin and Bonn: In  addition to the network itself, the concept also incorporates  the tele- and value- added services required for the information  link and intelligent network features and services. Special  network solutions of this type will acquire increasing  importance in a metropolis like Berlin- Brandenburg.</p>

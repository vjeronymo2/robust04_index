			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: British Gas Any Sids busy brushing up their maths as a prelude to making sense of British Gas's annual results are wasting their time. The short-term outlook for the shares will be shaped less by the confusing figures announced on Thursday than by the forthcoming deal between Gas and the Office of Fair Trading over the industrial market and the national gas pipeline. Judging by the pointed silence since early February when the gas regulator issued a grim warning about the huge remaining scope for monopoly abuse, Gas may yet walk away with a deal which may make a nonsense of efforts to reduce its powers. If it does, the blame will lie squarely with the OFT. The central issue is whether a monopolist should be allowed to manage the release of a share of its gas supplies to would-be competitors, while at the same time seeking to keep its profits stable. The opportunity to replace a monopoly with a cartel aside, logic suggests that if Gas has a halved share of the industrial market, its profits should fall by the same proportion. Otherwise, customers will face price rises of more than 50 per cent as new suppliers demand the same level of return. Implications for industrial users which presently rely on interruptible gas supplies are obvious. Any benefit to Sid will probably prove transient, if only because it is hard to imagine that the OFT would not have to rectify the position in time. The shares could have an unexpected boost just the same.</p>

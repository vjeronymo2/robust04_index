			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report published in the 49th edition of ETTEHAD-E </F> KAR--Labor Union--the organ of the Feda'i-ye Iran Organization,  Sazman-e Fada'i-ye Iran; date of publication and place of issue  not given]    [Excerpt] In relation with the government's new policy on  privatizing industry, many of the country's industries--both  heavy and light--have been put up for sale or have been sold.  [passage omitted]    The Khomeyni Hospital in Tabriz, which is affiliated with  the  Tabriz University, was reportedly bought for 650 million tumans  and privatized by several bazaar merchants. The public sector  is operating only a small part of the hospital at a very low  cost. It is said that there are no specialists or doctors in  this public sector, which is being run by interns, and that when  a patient in the private ward complains about costs, he is sent  to the public ward, where prices are low.    [passage omitted]    Recently, the sale of kidneys in Iran and in the provinces  has increased. In relation with this, children are sometimes  kidnapped and their kidneys removed and sold. In some cases,  children have been killed and in others, a child is kidnapped  for a week and released after one of his kidneys has been  removed. This has resulted in great insecurity for children,  particularly in Tehran, where parents must take their children  to and from school.</p>

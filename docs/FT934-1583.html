			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies on bargain hunting Wall Street US stocks yesterday staged a half-hearted rally as bargain hunters moved in after two losing sessions, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 9.22 firmer at 3,726.14, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.50 at 463.34. The American SE composite put on 1.50 at 461.44 and the Nasdaq composite added 2.56 at 755.53. New York SE volume was 284.6m shares. Stocks opened on a firmer note, but a further batch of favourable economic news appeared to have less influence on sentiment than did the opportunity for bargain hunting presented by the 48-point decline in the Dow over the previous two sessions. The day's stream of data merely filled in details of a now familiar portrait of the economy. In the most prominent report, the US merchandise trade deficit showed a slight easing in October, but solid gains in both imports and exports suggested heightened business activity. The market has already factored a strong fourth quarter into share prices, and now seems more preoccupied with the prospect of rising short-term interest rates early next year, which could drain funds out of stocks. Among the Dow components, 3M advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to 113, Boeing Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 44 and JP Morgan also Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 71 5/8 . But UAL, parent of United Airlines, dropped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 144 after announcing an agreement under which employees would acquire a majority stake in the carrier. Investors were concerned that the company was giving away too much value to the unions and not adequately compensating existing shareholders for the dilution of their equity. Merry-Go-Round, the most active issue of the day, plunged Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 2 5/8 on 9.7m shares traded amid reports that the clothing chain was unable to make payments to some creditors. In other retailing stocks, The Limited shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17 1/2 after the stock was downgraded by Alex Brown &amp; Sons. Eastman Kodak, a big loser on Wednesday, shed a further Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 54 1/8 . Fruit of the Loom's plunge also continued, the stock dropping Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 24 1/2 after announcing that its earnings would fall short of analysts' forecasts. Canada Toronto ended slightly lower after relatively light trading. The TSE 300 index slipped 9.4 to 4,216.2 and declines outnumbered advances by 410 to 387. Volume came to 59.3m shares. Eight of the 14 sub-indices lost ground, led by transportation, off 1.2 per cent. Airline issue PWA fell 12 cents to CDollars 1.11 on the day's heaviest volume of 1.6m shares.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 3 SAPA -- Conservative Party [CP]  leader Ferdi Hartzenberg, angered by Justice Minister Dullah  Omar's apparent rejection of the CP's petition for new amnesty  provisions, on Friday [3 June] accused Mr Omar of breaking an  agreement with the CP.    Dr Hartzenberg led a delegation to Mr Omar in Pretoria on  Thursday to plead for an extension of the December 6 amnesty  cut-off date. He also asked the minister to consider South  African Communist Party [Secretary General] Chris Hani's  killers, Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus, as ordinary  political criminals.    Although Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement on Friday the  minister had broken his word by releasing a press statement  which categorically turned down the CP's proposals, Mr Omar's  spokesman David Pirogo said the minister's statement was not  related to his meeting with the CP.    The statement said the deadline would not be extended and  that the definition of political offenders may not be so broad  as to include Derby-Lewis and Walus.    "Our statement had nothing to do with the meeting. But Dr  Hartzenberg is free to draw his own conclusions," Mr Pirogo  said. He said he issued the minister's statement before the  meeting "to clarify certain issues regarding amnesty".    Dr Hartzenberg said he was surprised by Mr Omar's statement  which had come immediately after their meeting. He said he had  reached agreement with the minister that no final decisions on  amnesty would be made now. The minister had undertaken to  consider all the CP's proposals and to hold further discussions  with the party. He said the minister had agreed to discuss  final amnesty legislation with the CP.    He said the minister had also agreed that the media would be  told only that discussions had taken place on the CP's proposals  and that follow-up discussions would be held. "While the CP  kept to this agreement and simply made its proposals known to  the media, Mr Omar broke the agreement. Without the promised  consultation and discussions with the CP he unilaterally  announced that the final cut-off date would be fixed at December  5.    "During the discussions the CP asked Mr Omar to not refer in  public to the matter of Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus, and  not to present it as an exception. This request was simply  ignored and in his statement he indicates that the case of  Derby-Lewis and Walus will be handled differently to other  cases. The CP finds this out of place," Dr Hartzenberg said.    CP justice spokesman Jurg Prinsloo said that if Mr Omar  issued his statement before the meeting as Mr Pirogo had  claimed, this in itself implied that the CP had been negotiating  about matters that had already been decided.</p>

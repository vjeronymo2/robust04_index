			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LONG-DISTANCE MARKET BOOSTS AT&amp;T TO 20.6% GAIN IN PROFITS  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., coming off the first annual loss in its  history on the strength of a boom in the long-distance telephone market, today  said its profits jumped 20.6% to $594 million in the first quarter.  </P> <P> New York-based AT&amp;T earned 55 cents a share in the first quarter, compared  to $492 million, or 46 cents a share, a year ago. Revenues rose to $8.66  billion from $8.39 billion, buoyed by robust long-distance and product sales.  </P> <P> Analysts had expected earnings growth from 15% to 20%. By contrast, rival MCI  Communications Corp. reported Tuesday that its profits jumped 132% to $135  million.  </P> <P> Wall Street greeted the news with enthusiasm. Shares of AT&amp;T rose 25 cents  to $33.375 as the New York Stock Exchange's second most-active issue this  morning.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T's long-distance operations are being fueled by aggressive advertising  and sales promotions, an expanded sales force and increased regulatory  flexibility, the company said.  </P> <P> Such flexibility may help the telephone giant's balance sheets later in the  year.  </P></p>

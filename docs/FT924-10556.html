			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Young bull locks horns with mentor: The curious case of two corporate raiders from the same stable aiming at one target but with a different price in mind THE battle for control of RHM presents the classic spectacle of an old bull locking horns with a young one. At 45, Mr Greg Hutchings of Tomkins is a quarter of a century younger than Lord Hanson, his erstwhile employer. Tomkins, the company which he set up after leaving Hanson, is still only one-seventh of Hanson's size. But it is evidently big enough for him to tackle his old mentor head-on. Mr Hutchings would not describe it that way. 'This is not a battle with Hanson,' he said yesterday. 'Absolutely not. He's far too experienced and shrewd to be anything other than philosophical about it. And RHM is peanuts to him. It would be under 10 per cent of his business.' There is an element of tactics here, since it is plainly in Mr Hutchings' interests not to goad Hanson into a higher offer. But he is to be believed in another sense. His bid for RHM is not merely a response to Hanson's. It was conceived in isolation. For some months now, both men have been working independently on the same target. This is rather curious. Both Hanson and Tomkins are large, international conglomerates with a bias towards industrial rather than consumer operations. In seeking their next victim, both had the world to choose from. So why did both end up picking the same rather tired British bread maker? Mr Hutchings shrugs the question off. 'Great minds think alike,' he says. But he strongly rejects the idea that in getting into the food industry, Tomkins is turning its back on its traditional operations. The basic point, he says, is that RHM makes things. 'Products are not relevant. It doesn't matter to us whether it's a bicycle, a lawn mower'  - both of which Tomkins makes - 'or a cake. Raw materials go in one end and products come out at the other. We have a few hard weeks ahead of us to convince the stock market that this isn't a departure from our usual business. But we're not buying an advertising agency or an estate agency, we're buying a manufacturer.' And above all, from Tomkins' viewpoint, RHM was cheap. Ever since its last UK acquisition in 1986, Tomkins claims to have been combing the UK for another target. A year ago, Mr Hutchings remarked there were plenty of UK companies he would like to buy, but they were too expensive. As Tomkins' corporate development manager Mr Geoff Eaton puts it, 'stock market sentiment towards RHM was awful. In other sectors, there are companies which are doing badly but the price is astronomical. There are some engineering companies out there which are being managed bloody badly, but their share prices are sky high.' The reason that such companies are expensive is, of course, that the stock market perceives them as cyclical. It reasons that when the economy recovers, their earnings will pick up sharply. But food companies were supposed to be different. Even in a recession, the argument ran, people have to eat. This thesis came to grief earlier this year when a number of UK food manufacturers, RHM among them, started to produce poor results and profit warnings. Their share prices plunged. For Hanson and Tomkins, this provided the opportunity they had been seeking in vain in other sectors. Let us accept, Tomkins said yesterday, that a company like RHM is indeed subject to the economic cycle. That means that buying it five years ago, in the upswing of the cycle, would have been very risky. But we are now near the bottom of the cycle. This puts Tomkins and Hanson squarely at odds with the stock market's judgment. But this is scarcely the first takeover battle to illustrate the hugely different value put on shares by portfolio investors and industrial managers. A month ago, the stock market thought RHM shares were worth 158p apiece. Then Lord Hanson said they were worth 220p. Now Mr Hutchings says they are worth 260p. Plainly, they cannot all be right. Part of the difference can be justified by the fact that Hanson and Tomkins are in a position to change the top management and let middle management get on with the business. As Mr Eaton said yesterday: 'You're basically empowering a group of people who have been totally frustrated by the fact that the top people don't know what they're doing.' But on this basis, Hanson and Tomkins ought to value RHM more or less identically. Both, after all, have similar techniques for dealing with companies they have acquired, for the very good reason that Mr Hutchings was trained in the Hanson school. This makes the end-game of this bid fascinating. It is not yet known whether Hanson will respond to the Tomkins counter-offer. If it chooses to walk away, it will leave the obvious implication that Tomkins is paying too much. If battle is joined, that question will be raised about whoever proves the winner.

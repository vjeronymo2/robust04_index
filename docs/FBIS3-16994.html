			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Announcer] Head of the Foreign  Ministry information department Grigoriy Karasin commented on  the Russian position on this issue for us.    [Karasin] We would very much not like to bring the situation  to a head, or to sanctions. Evidently the necessity has arisen  to look at the situation attentively and discuss it with our  partners. In particular the Russian and Japanese foreign  ministers discussed this issue yesterday. And we have to find a  quick, effective, and possibly even unusual solution to this  problem.    [Announer] Can Russia, bearing in mind her recent successes  in foreign policy, become an intermediary in the dialogue  between Pyongyang and the countries of the West? Here is  Grigoriy Karasin once again.    [Karasin] To be honest, I am not going to lay all my cards  on  the table. I just want to say that the appropriate senior  Foreign Ministry employees have left for Vienna and are taking  part in the discussions of this problem there. They return to  Moscow tomorrow. We will take a close look at all possiblities  and all approaches, and naturally we will act with energy.</p>

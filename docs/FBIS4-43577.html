			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rosa Paz: "PSOE Acknowledges That Its Voters' </F> Punitive Vote Is Not Superficial or Short Term"]    [Text] Madrid -- The PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers  Party] acknowledges that the punitive vote that its voters cast  Sunday [12 June -- in European Parliament elections], mainly  thorough abstention or support for other political parties, "is  not short term" or a simple warning, but a "much more serious  and profound" reaction that will require changes and corrections  in the government's policy and, in particular, in the  Socialists' stances, as several leaders of the party told LA  VANGUARDIA.    This conviction that the shift in the vote was more  far-reaching than expected and hence the punishment "was not  superficial" yesterday led the PSOE Executive Committee Standing  Committee to decide to begin a process of internal reflection  that will result in a "very rigorous and very realistic"  analysis of the election results, without evading the true scale  of its defeat last Sunday.    The Socialists believe that this is the only way to find the  real causes that have led their voters -- "those who brought us  to power," they say -- to deprive them of their support, and the  only way to get right the corrections that they must henceforth  tackle.    This more rigorous analysis of the defeat will be made next  Monday at the Socialist Federal Executive Committee's plenary  session.  <H5>  Gonzalez Recommends Calm </H5>   At the meeting held at the Moncloa Palace, shortly before  Felipe Gonzalez left for Colombia, where he will be taking part  in the Ibero-American summit, the prime minister recommended  "calm" to the Socialist leadership in order to study the reasons  for the debacle and not to make hasty decisions that could be  wrong. Even so, one of those attending the meeting explained to  this newspaper that "calm does not mean passivity." At that  meeting, which was attended by all the Standing Committee  members plus Andalusian premier Manuel Chaves, a superficial  approach was made to analyzing the causes of the defeat, which  was attributed to the fact that the public still does not notice  the economic recovery, the corruption cases, and the internal  discord.    But as well as accepting the electorate's "severe warning,"  it was made clear at the meeting, as Secretary for Organization  Cipria Ciscar later explained, that the party "is united around  the government's activity and Felipe Gonzalez' leadership."    In that initial urgent analysis, nobody raised the need for  changing the policy of pacts with CiU [Convergence and Union],  although some PSOE leaders believe that that alliance with the  Catalan nationalists could have influenced the results in  Andalusia.    In fact, the electoral setback in that autonomous community,  which has been a traditional Socialist fief, is the reason that  leads the PSOE to believe that the punishment by its voters was  not short term but represented a much more serious voting shift  "because," they say, "they have punished us where it could hurt  us most," especially since in Andalusia the electorate could  have opted for punishing the Socialists in the European  elections but supporting them in the regional government.    Some of the possible solutions to this situation were also  raised at the meeting, always trying to guarantee political  stability. These included the possibility of Felipe Gonzalez'  undergoing a confidence vote in parliament, an option that the  Socialists do not rule out, although their CiU partners  explicitly reject that possibility. In the Socialists' opinion,  a confidence motion would be a gesture to society that they have  understood the message, and would avoid giving the impression of  passivity or of their believing that "nothing has happened."  Whether or not to present one is a decision that the prime  minister will have to take over the next few days, on his return  from Colombia.    However, nobody raised the possibility of immediately  calling an early election, an option that is on the agenda but  that terrifies the PSOE, because it believes that in these  circumstances it would mean "giving away victory to the People's  Party."    Perhaps for this reason, Ciscar reiterated yesterday the  Socialists' pledge to continue to promote political stability,  as well as to apply "the necessary corrections and regain the  public's confidence." To that effect, he also emphasized the  party's and government's pledge to end corruption and "clean up  political life, not just through legal measures but through  ethical attitudes."    In the background to this debate, the Socialists are  considering whether society now views them as an exhausted and  outdated option, and what measures would make it possible to win  back the support of an electorate that has been loyal to them  for years and that has now mostly opted for abstention, with the  aim of winning the next election.  <H5>  Talk With All Political Forces </H5>   The Socialists believe that one of the most immediate  requirements of their electoral defeat is to begin a serious and  calm dialogue with all the political forces, especially those  such as CiU, which give them their parliamentary support, in  order to analyze together the domestic situation created by last  Sundays's election results, but they believe that those talks  should also extend to the People's Party, not only in order to  conduct that appraisal of the new political situation but also  in order to discover what will be its stance in the near future.  For the present, the Socialists are firmly maintaining the  image of internal unity in the face of the electoral setback,  but in private the different emphases that each of the sectors  places on the consequences of the defeat are taking shape. Thus  the Guerraists believe that their voters are demanding, as they  did 6 June 1993, a "leftward shift," and certainly a cabinet  reshuffle to strengthen the country's political leadership and  end the impression of the government's lack of a political  steady hand. The renewalists attribute the defeat both to the  economic crisis and unemployment and to the recent corruption  cases, which have damaged the Socialists' credibility and sown  suspicions about their honesty and their readiness to combat all  forms of unlawful conduct.</p>

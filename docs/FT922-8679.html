			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe to launch Eurolire futures contract today LIFFE, the London futures and options exchange, will today launch the first futures contract on Eurolire interest rates, hoping to harness the rapid growth of the international money market in the Italian currency. The new contract is similar in design to Liffe's existing three-month futures on the dollar, sterling, Ecu, Swiss franc and D-Mark interest rates. Each contact is valued at L1,000m (Dollars 800,000) with eleven firms acting as designated brokers, undertaking to quote a price. The firms are not obliged to make a market, but Liffe said that the designated broker system would contribute to liquidity. According to Bank for International Settlements figures, Eurolire deposits - lire deposits held outside Italy - grew from around Dollars 30bn equivalent in 1989 to Dollars 100bn last year. The growth of the deposits market has spurred the development of money market instruments such as swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and forward rate agreements. Earlier this year the Italian government removed a 30 per cent withholding tax on interbank deposits, and this has increased cash trading volume and narrowed dealing spreads. Eurolire interest rates are volatile compared with most other big trading currencies. Liffe hopes this will stimulate demand for the new contract. Until now, financial institutions have bought tailored, over-the-counter derivative financial products rather than exchange-traded contracts to hedge lire exposures. Mr Roger Barton, business development director at Liffe, said the exchange did not have a target for turnover of the new contract. However, he said Liffe would be happy with a turnover of 3,000 to 5,000 contracts a day. The cost of developing the new contact was relatively low since the specifications are close to existing interest rate futures. Last week Liffe suspended its future on the FTSE Eurotrack index of 100 leading European equities because the contract had an average daily volume of only 13 contracts. Liffe last week completed an oversubscribed rights issue designed to promote the trading of the Eurolire and other short-dated interest rate contracts. The new 'E' shares grant holders the right to trade all but the exchange's most popular contracts. This should make them less expensive than existing shares, and so encourage traders to start dealing in the exchange's new contracts.</p>

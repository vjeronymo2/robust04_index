			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: American Barrick unveils plan for expansion with record result American Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, has signalled an ambition to spread its wings beyond North America with new ventures in China and Peru. Barrick yesterday outlined its international expansion strategy, which will be centred on Latin America and Asia, in tandem with details of its eighth consecutive year of record earnings. Net income was USDollars 213.4m in 1993, or 75 cents a share, up from Dollars 174.9m, or 62 cents, the previous year. Revenues rose to Dollars 667.5m from Dollars 540.4m. However, the momentum slowed in the fourth quarter, with a lower realised gold price, higher costs and sagging output pushing net income down to Dollars 51.8m, or 18 cents a share, from Dollars 65.5m, or 23 cents. Barrick's active gold hedging programme realised an average price of Dollars 409 per ounce last year, down from Dollars 422 an ounce in 1992. In the fourth quarter, the price fell to an average of Dollars 405. Output for the year was 1.64m ounces, up from 1.33m ounces, largely due to expanding production at the flagship Goldstrike mine in Nevada. Barrick said its international drive was prompted by changed attitudes and structures in several countries 'which makes it attractive to review the mining opportunities they may present'. It plans to focus on deposits capable of producing at least 100,000 ounces of gold a year for 15 years or more. Barrick will own 75 per cent of a new gold development venture in China formed in partnership with Power Corporation of Canada, the diversified Montreal-based financial services group. It has also taken an option on a 75 per cent interest in the Corona gold and copper project in southern Peru, and joined two exploration projects in north-central and southern Peru. Barrick said its international expansion would be facilitated by its contacts and strong balance sheet. Several non-mining luminaries sit on its board of directors, including former Canadian prime minister Mr Brian Mulroney. Cash reserves totalled almost Dollars 350m at the end of last year.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Tuesday: The Conference Board's US consumer confidence index for October is expected to rise slightly to 89 after falling for the past four months. Wednesday: US durable goods orders have been a volatile indicator of late because of sharp movements in the transport category. The consensus of analysts' views, polled by MMS International, is for a 0.5 per cent rise in September. Friday: There are few signs of a pick-up in Japanese consumer price inflation. Consensus forecasts suggest the Tokyo consumer price index for October will show a year-on-year rise of just 0.4 per cent, while the all-nation index for September will be just 0.2 per cent up on September last year. During the week: The expected fall in western German consumer price inflation to 2.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis in October, from 2.9 per cent in September, should reflect lower service price inflation. Morgan Grenfell, the UK investment bank owned by Deutsche Bank, expects a 'more convincing downward trend' in German CPI inflation to 2.2 per cent by the end of March next year.</p>

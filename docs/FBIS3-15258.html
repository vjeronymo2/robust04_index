RUIE President Arkadiy Volskiy:    "This document opens up extensive prospects for mutually  beneficial cooperation. The economic crisis which none of the  former Union's republics has succeeded in avoiding was largely  due to the disruption and severing of traditional economic ties.  Therefore establishing these ties will enable industrial  enterprises to autonomously resolve any arising problems without  politicians interfering. All this should undoubtedly help  stabilize the situation and extricate real manufacturers from  the protracted crisis most speedily."    Kh. Gulyamov, head of the Association of Machine Building  Enterprises of Uzbekistan:    "We have fully felt the breakdown of traditional ties.  Therefore there is only one correct route today -- to actively  cooperate with associated plants and create joint enterprises  oriented to the production of finished output.    "We are now actively engaged in this. Several dozen joint  enterprises have already been set up, or are in the making, with  enterprises in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The current  meeting has enabled us to formulate a mechanism for cooperation.    "We have defined certain priority areas for ourselves and  Russian industrialists. These include developing and setting up  an agricultural equipment complex in Ukraine, in particular mini  sugar refineries."</p>

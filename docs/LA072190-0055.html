			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV PLAGIARISM CHARGE  </P> <P> Re "It May Not Be Plagiarism, but It's a Rip-Off," Howard Rosenberg's July 11  column on KCAL Channel 9's unattributed use of the pictures and script of a CNN  feature: Rosenberg quotes Channel 9's John Corcoran as saying he would be  "highly offended to be called a plagiarist." Corcoran, if you're offended you  should study that part of the definition of plagiarism that talks about putting  your name on someone else's work.  </P> <P> And shame on KCAL news director Bob Henry for calling it "a non-issue" because  KCAL pays for CNN services. Perhaps Corcoran and Henry could explain how such a  no-class position is any different from that of some airhead student who claims  that he shouldn't get an F for buying a report from a term-paper mill and  putting his own name on it as its author. Well, I guess if he did retype it  himself. . . .  </P> <P> TOM BURNS  </P> <P> Acton  </P></p>

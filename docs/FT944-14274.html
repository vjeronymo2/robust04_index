			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: A natural order of luxury Sir, I was very much amused by Tony Walker's dispatch on the use of luxury cars by Chinese Communist party cadres ('Chinese officials lose a touch of luxury', October 17). It is not the first time that an attempt to impose austerity on them has been made. I was in Peking in late 1989, when the dust of the infamous Tiananmen Square 'incident' was starting to settle and when a similar directive was issued. It produced a very funny result: high officials were driven in old Chinese-made cars, followed by two or more shining deluxe European cars stuffed with security personnel. After several weeks the natural order of things was quietly restored. I assume the same will happen again. Jorge Eduardo Navarrette, Mexican Embassy, Felix de Amesti 128, Santiago, Chile</p>

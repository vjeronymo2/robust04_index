			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Finance Minister Theo Waigel to the Bundestag </F> in Bonn -- live]    [Text] Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen:    Colleague Klose, you were right in pointing out the  number-one issue, namely mass unemployment in Europe. It is not  true if you imply that we are neglecting this issue. The  opposite is true. There is no issue that has been more in the  focus of all debates and initiatives, both at the summit in  Brussels at the end of last year and at the G-7 employment  summit in Detroit, where, above all, German initiatives for  training, the dual system, advanced training, retraining, were  virtually presented as exemplary, where for the first time a  policy for medium-sized industries was supported and demanded,  as we have demanded for years and decades and in connection with  which we have always said that it cannot and will not be just  the big ones but also the medium-sized and small units that are  able to react quickly and flexibly to these big economic  challenges. We have made this an issue. [applause]    We have adopted a memorandum on this issue. We have outlined  the basic guidelines of economic policy, the growth initiative.  And in particular regarding what colleague Rexrodt has  suggested regarding deregulation -- an initiative, in which  leading industrialists, trade unionists, and scientists are  supposed to participate so as to reexamine secondary legislation  in Europe, just as it is done here in our country, and to check  it for impediments to growth -- I do not understand why you  criticize this, which has met with very broad approval and a  good reception in Europe and now also at the Commission.    I do not know what kind of strangely divided relationship  you  have with the economic development in Germany. We will achieve  a growth of more than 1.5 percent. Even though just a few weeks  ago the IMF, OECD, and others predicted a growth of 0.1, 0.9,  and 1.2 percent for us, today it is certain that this growth  will amount to between 1.5 and 2 percent -- according to some  forecasts rather closer to 2 than to 1.5 percent. We should all  be happy about this. Does this perhaps not fit your election  campaign concept? [applause, unintelligible interjections]    If you -- I did not want to do that now, Mr. Klose -- attack  us in this way and want to hold us responsible for mass  unemployment, then I do not spare you the question about the  biggest impediment to investments. This constellation of  red-green, and red-green with a popular-front character, as you  are aiming for now in Saxony-Anhalt, would mean a disastrous  negative growth initiative. [applause, unintelligible  interjections]    This, colleague Klose, would be a disaster not only for  Saxony-Anhalt, it would be a disastrous sign to the world. And  I can only call on you, as a responsible politician, to make  sure in time in your party that this will not take place in  Germany. It would be good for our election campaign but  damaging to Germany, Ladies and Gentlemen.    [Unidentified Bundestag vice president] Mr. Minister, are  you willing to answer a question from Deputy Weiss?    [Waigel] Yes.    [Weiss] Thank you very much. Mr. Minister, may I reassure  you that the popular front, which you see in Saxony-Anhalt, will  certainly not come about -- simply because the Alliance  90/Greens in Saxony-Anhalt developed out of the resistance to  the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] and has nothing to do  with what the SED did. Together with the Social Democratic  Party, we will pursue a policy for the citizens in Saxony-Anhalt.    [Bundestag vice president] Deputy Weiss, would you please  formulate this as a question so that I do not have any problems  up here.    [Weiss] I asked the finance minister whether I may reassure  him and I would like to reassure him. Thank you.    [Waigel] Colleague Weiss, if Alliance 90 consisted only of  such men and women as you, a different possibility for talks  would exist. But you represent neither the Greens in this  alliance nor did you say a word about the Party of Democratic  Socialism [PDS]. If one depends on the votes of the PDS, this is  a fateful development in Germany and not only in Saxony-Anhalt.  Therefore, I am not reassured. [applause, unintelligible  interjections]    In your speeches up to now, Ladies and Gentlemen of the  opposition, you did not acknowledge the dimensions of Corfu. It  is true that the dispute over persons unfortunately covered the  prospects and dimensions that were created. When we hear  Russian President Yeltsin speaking of a divided continent  growing together again, we can feel a development that 50 years  ago our parents, our older sisters and brothers could only dream  about. And when, through the expansion of the European Union  [EU] by the Scandinavian states there will for be the first time  a joint border between the EU and Russia, and when these deeply  European states such as Austria and the Scandinavian states  fulfill their functions as a bridge and central countries this  is a very important time for Europe, of which we all, and  especially the Federal Government can be proud. [applause]    And if through our constant urging we have succeeded in  making a common European initiative a common initiative of the  G-7 in Naples, and if the whole world finally realizes that what  is happening or could happen in Ukraine, this is part of a newly  acquired international responsibility that extends into the  future. And, Ladies and Gentlemen, in spite of our tight budget  in Germany, if money is required for this, it must be included  in the budget. We owe this to our citizens in Europe, in  Germany, and in the whole world. That has absolute priority.  [applause]    Ladies and Gentlemen, the German presidency will give us the  opportunity, to achieve significant progress for Europe. And  this will be done by stabilizing, dynamizing, and deregulating.  Strict budgetary discipline, the modernization and expansion of  the European traffic infrastructure are necessary to achieve  this. That deficit financing, as was attempted under the  concept of global control in the 1960's and 1970's, is no longer  feasible must also be known in Europe. It would not make sense  to reduce deficits in all member countries to achieve the  Maastricht criteria and to conduct deficit financing in the EU  Commission at the same time. There are various possibilities of  making use of the capital market via the excellent European  Investment Bank. And, dear colleague Klose, a short telephone  call to your former colleague Roth will convince you that the  European Investment Bank is in a position to find the funds for  private financing. [unintelligible interjections] Roth is now  in perfect order in terms of market economy. It has been a long  way, from my having discussions with him on television when he  was chairman of the Young Socialists, up to his becoming a  defender of the market economy in the Social Democratic Party.  No one will see you when you call him. He will be able to  convince you that the funds are available.    Ladies and Gentlemen, one thing must be clear: When we  tackle the convergence process, when we state excessive budget  deficits, as is necessary in preparing the second stage of  Monetary Union, we will make sure that the criteria are observed  strictly. And this must concern everyone, including us. A  watering down will not take place, stability criteria have  priority. [applause] Regarding expenditure programs, these  will be available. And it cannot be true that all the programs  that ever existed in the EU will be continued forever. We will  have to examine these things, let some programs expire and  restructure some. And if by restructuring we can make funds  available for the big European traffic infrastructure program,  this is a necessary starting point for growth and a better  infrastructure in Europe. [applause]    And with great determination we will also support the  sustained fight against fraud to the disadvantage of the common  budget. This is necessary to win the people's acceptance of  Europe. Of course, we will also deal with the issue of  contribution payments. What has been settled in the medium-term  plans up to 1999 will not be changed.    Ladies and Gentlemen; we have to consider very carefully  whether we want more programs. After all, we will be providing  30 percent of the funds for each program but can get back no  more than 19 or 20 percent. Of course, we will have to make  sure that more money flows back to Germany. We have to make  sure that the most stringent criteria and economy will apply for  spending as they do in Germany. Yet, the other European partners  must also be able to rely on us, on what was agreed and will, of  course, continue. Moreover, the advantage of Europe must not  only be seen in connection with the position of being a net  payer, but it also has to be seen in terms of the national  economy. If every German accounts for $7,000 in exports, every  American for $2,000, and every Japanese for $1,850, then  everybody knows what open borders mean for us, and what it means  for us to be able to export to other countries. [applause]    Mr. Klose, as far as the trans-European networks are  concerned, this has been identified in a group of Commissioner  Christopherson, which is where the responsible officials sit  [unintelligible interjections] .... I beg your pardon, but  this was State Secretary Haller, an excellent man...and, of  course, all this will be done in agreement and coordination with  the responsible ministry, which is obvious. We do have such  coordination, which you will first have to introduce in your  Bundestag group.    We will also deal with the following issues -- I just  mention  keywords: tax harmonization, a most important issue for Europe  and beyond. The second issue is the principle of country of  origin with regard to the value-added tax; and the energy tax  was mentioned before by Mr. Haussmann and by the foreign  minister.    We are on a good course as far as the economic situation is  concerned. We have set the course for the political situation  in Europe in an unprecedented way; all that is most closely  linked with our contribution, with what Germany is doing in  Europe without dominating, but in a great spirit of partnership.    In my capacity as finance minister, I also paid a visit to  all our partners in the past few weeks and months; a few days  ago I also spoke with all finance ministers of the new future  members to make preparations for the next six months in a  harmonious process of partnership and cooperation. With Germany  for Europe -- this is the slogan of our presidency, for which we  are well prepared. Thank you very much.</p>

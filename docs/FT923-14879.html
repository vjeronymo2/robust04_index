			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / G7 brush-off for Russia: Britain and Germany cool on 'G8' suggestion GERMANY and Britain yesterday poured cold water on suggestions that Russia should join the Group of Seven industrial nations, making it a G8. British officials said it was unlikely that all members of the group would want to expand the club. In Bonn, Mr Dieter Vogel, the German government spokesman, said it was too soon for Russia to become a member of the annual economic summit group. On Thursday night, President Bush said he was prepared to discuss admitting Russia at next week's G7 summit in Munich. The president did not commit himself to supporting the inclusion of Russia, whose president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, will confer with the Group of Seven leaders on the summit's last day. But he said: 'I will be prepared to discuss this, making it a G8 if you will.' This did not seem, however, to be a considered policy statement. He was responding to a question at a press conference by a Russian journalist and answered, off-the-cuff, that the Russian economy was of sufficient size for the issue at least to be debated. UK officials said yesterday that Russian entry would be premature, adding that Japan was likely to oppose such a move. Japan has outstanding territorial disputes with Russia and the two countries still have not signed a peace treaty to mark the end of hostilities in the Second World War. Mr Vogel said: 'Russia has not yet met the economic conditions, and probably not the political conditions either, quickly to become a member of the G8, or a member of what has been the G7 up to now.' The G7 leaders from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada will therefore meet Mr Yeltsin and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian prime minister, for three hours of talks on Wednesday on a 'G7 plus one' basis. The same procedure was adopted last year when the G7 leaders held talks with President Mikhail Gorbachev of the former Soviet Union. Next week's G7 summit is likely to give a strong message of support for Mr Yeltsin and his efforts to push ahead with economic reform in Russia. It is expected to support a rescheduling of Russia's official debts and the release of a first tranche of Dollars 1bn of International Monetary Fund credits for Russia on condition that the government in Moscow puts forward clear plans for reducing its budget deficit and inflation. Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa arrived in Britain yesterday on a three-day visit ahead of the summit. Mr Miyazawa, on his first official visit to Britain as premier, will meet Britain's Prime Minister John Major, European Commission President Jacques Delors and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney during his stay in London. In the light of a swelling trade surplus with European Community members, Mr Miyazawa is expected to explain his plans to spur a flagging economy to create markets for more foreign goods. He will also seek European support for Japan's demand that Russia returns four islands off northern Japan seized in 1945.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Treading a road to strong profits - UBS's London operation believes it is on track SINCE Union Bank of Switzerland, Switzerland's largest bank, bought Phillips &amp; Drew back in 1985, the road to strong returns for UBS's London operations has been a long one. But in the first half of this year, London contributed more than 20 per cent of UBS's 89 per cent surge in profits for the first half of 1993. Clearly, market conditions helped. 'Brisk activity on the major securities markets, with dramatic rallies in some cases, as well as volatile fluctuations in various foreign exchange rates and lower money market rates, led to record profits,' said UBS's own results report. But Mr Rudi Muller, chairman and chief executive of UBS Limited, the London operation, insists that market conditions are only one factor. 'Our build-up has thoroughly paid off and we are going to be an increasingly important financial institution,' he says. UBS's progress can be measured in both financial and league table terms. The contribution of foreign operations, of which London is the largest component, was 5 per cent 10 years ago, 20 per cent last year and 40 per cent so far this year. With domestic banking under pressure, the growing contribution of institutional banking operations outside Switzerland 'has come at the right time', says Mr Muller. In debt underwriting, UBS ranked sixth in the first six months of this year, according to IFR Securities Data. Even more impressive, UBS ranked second in Acquisitions Monthly's league table of advisers on European cross-border acquisitions completed in the year to June. However, its ranking in the syndicated loans market has slipped to 12th, according to IFR. 'In looking at our results in the last two years, a lot of money has come from traditional products, such as equities and gilts,' says Mr Muller. He says that equities have been consistently profitable since 1991. However, this year it is the merged debt/treasury operation which has been the 'star performer. This has been the big break-through'. In retrospect, Mr Muller admits that mistakes were made on the way. 'It's a bit delicate. If we were today to take over an organisation like P&amp;D, we would most certainly take over the management straight away.' Back in 1985, when the bank already had two London operations, UBS Securities and a bank branch, the decision was taken to 'let the three units (including P&amp;D) run in parallel for a few years, to see how things would develop after Big Bang.' As it turned out, the changes brought about by the Big Bang were more dramatic than had been foreseen. 'The business changed so fundamentally that P&amp;D got into some difficulty with back office administration. They were not able to cope with the new environment.' Then came 1987, a bad year for many financial institutions but a black time for UBS, which, on top of the stock market crash, was caught up in financial scandal over the Blue Arrow rights issue. 'It cost a lot of money and took a lot of time,' says Mr Muller. At the end of that year, he was given the task of reining in the three businesses, scattered among 11 locations around London, and of bringing the administrative side of P&amp;D under control. Finally, early in 1989, UBS Phillips and Drew was formed, and the firm moved into Broadgate, the modern City office complex. 'Moving all the units together created the cornerstone of success,' he says. While the London operation may have come right in the end, other foreign bankers in London find it hard to be benevolent, well aware that they would never have been given the same leeway as Mr Muller by their parent bank, and some remain sceptical. While UBS as a whole exceeded its 10 per cent target for return on equity in the first half, they suggest that London's strong performance would have to persist for some time for UBS to recoup its investment in the business. Mr Muller, for his part, acknowledges the support of head office. 'Without total support from Zurich we would never have been able to do it,' he says. UBS bought in top professionals from prominent London firms. In addition, a 'totally different' top management team was put in place. 'It needed a change: I felt that to be able to go through a fundamental reorganisation we needed new expertise,' he says. This has sometimes created the impression that the doors at UBS are constantly revolving. 'They have hired some good people, but they have lost some extremely good people too,' says one former staffer. Are the improved profits from UBS's London operations the result of markets or management? The answer, from analysts and insiders, appears to be that it is a bit of both. 'They had to do a lot of changing around and a lot of spending, but that is telling now,' says Mr Ian Poulter, a banking analyst at Yamaichi International. But he adds that he wants to see whether these sort of results can be maintained. 'Historically, UBS has a habit of doing very well in good markets, and of not turning around fast enough in bad markets,' said one former UBS banker. Mr Muller admits that the bank may have entered some markets, such as derivatives, rather late. 'We Swiss bankers have some advantages and some disadvantages,' he explains. One advantage, clearly, is staying power.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN HELD AFTER RAID ON SUSPECTED BOILER-ROOM SCAM  </P> <P> A Huntington Beach home was raided early Tuesday morning and an occupant was  arrested on suspicion of grand theft for allegedly operating a precious-metals  boiler-room scam and bilking investors out of about $100,000, Newport Beach  police said.  </P> <P> Eric Matthew Dickey, 24, is suspected of running a telemarketing scheme called  Eastern Financial Services (EFS) from a variety of apartments and condominiums  and the house that was raided, Newport Beach Police Lt. Tim Newman said.  </P> <P> The operation started in Newport Beach and ended up in Huntington Beach, Newman  said. U.S. Postal Service agents and Newport police participated in the raid on  the house at 10202 Beverly Drive.  </P> <P> Dickey, 24, was held on $100,000 bail. The scheme that Dickey is accused of  masterminding was in operation from August, 1987, to December, 1988, Newman  said.  </P> <P> "EFS salesmen would apparently make unsolicited phone calls to potential  investors nationwide, using what investigators are describing as high-pressure  sales tactics to induce clients into investing money with EFS," Newman said.  </P> <P> Clients from New York, Delaware, Texas, Arizona and Ohio sent money to EFS  based on their understanding that it would be used to buy leverage contracts on  platinum and silver.  </P> <P> "It is alleged that Dickey then converted these funds from the clients to his  own personal use and was not investing them as promised," Newman said.  </P> <P> Newport police and postal agents started investigating Dickey in June, tracing  him from condominium to condominium. Postal Inspector Kacy R. McClelland said  authorities believe that Dickey had dealings with about 10 would-be investors.  </P> <P> "He used all kinds of aliases," McClelland said, "and he moved around  frequently."  </P></p>

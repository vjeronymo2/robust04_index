			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE SEES 'BRIGHT FUTURE' FOR AEROSPACE  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle, touring an Orange County laboratory where scientists  simulate conditions in space, criticized on Monday a loss of national zeal  toward space exploration but assured aerospace workers that their industry  "does indeed have a very bright future."  </P> <P> After getting a firsthand look at the "zero-gravity" lab at the McDonnell  Douglas aerospace plant in Huntington Beach, Quayle spoke briefly to employees  and school-age visitors as part of a four-day tour around the state. His wife,  Marilyn, also took part in a mock disaster drill in Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> The focus on space during the vice president's visit came three days before the  20th anniversary of astronaut Neil Armstrong's historic moonwalk and formed a  prelude to what is expected to be a major policy statement on the issue by  President Bush later this week.  </P> <P> Hundreds of employees at McDonnell Douglas jammed the plant's courtyard to  catch a glimpse of the vice president. Many were hoping that he "might give us  some insight into what the future holds for us" at a time when federal funding  for space programs has appeared uncertain, said Troy Richardson of Garden  Grove, a procurement worker who attended the talk.  </P> <P> But Quayle, chairman of the newly re-established National Space Council, which  advises the Administration on space policy, shied away from discussing specific  programs and directions. He did, however, make clear that the Bush  Administration "is committed to a vigorous and energetic space program for  America."  </P> <P> Suggesting several times that past policies in space have fallen short, he said  the Administration intends to see that the United States "gets back into the  space business."  </P> <P> At a talk earlier in the day in Long Beach before the Western Governors' Assn.,  Quayle expanded on his criticism of past policies, saying the government's lack  of financial commitment and direction in the space program has created a  "dramatic decline" in the numbers of aerospace scientists, engineers and others  in the field.  </P> <P> Pointing later to the hundreds of "future scientists" from local schools and  youth groups who heard him talk at the McDonnell Douglas plant in Huntington  Beach, Quayle said the presence of the children marked "a very good sign that  the space program is on its way to recovery."  </P> <P> Marilyn Olin of Laguna Niguel, who brought her Girl Scout troop to hear the  vice president, said: "It was absolutely thrilling for all of them, an  opportunity to be so close to someone of such national importance."  </P> <P> Excited schoolchildren from the summer program at Sowers Middle School in  Huntington Beach shouted, "I shook his hand! I shook his hand!" after the  appearance. But several in the group, professing no interest in space, said  they were disappointed that Quayle had not told them much about what it was  like to be vice president of the nation.  </P> <P> Quayle also faced an occasionally tough audience at a morning breakfast with  reporters in Los Angeles. Asked about his apparent penchant for verbal gaffes,  Quayle blushed deeply, fiddled with his coffee cup and said: "Well, everybody  can make a mistake. . . . If that's the worst thing I do in the next six  months, then the first six months will be in pretty good shape."  </P> <P> Speaking earlier this week about the anniversary of the moonwalk, Quayle  mistakenly referred to former astronaut Buzz Aldrin of Laguna Beach as "Buzz  Lukens." Donald E. (Buz) Lukens was the Ohio Republican congressman who was  recently convicted of having sex with a minor.  </P> <P> And in a recent talk to the United Negro College Fund, he said, "What a waste  it is to lose one's mind," a confusion of the group's slogan, "A mind is a  terrible thing to waste."  </P> <P> Despite the slip-ups, Quayle told reporters that he is winning over those who  doubted his abilities to handle the vice presidency and has learned to trust  his own judgment after a draining political campaign that made him the target  of intense criticism over his National Guard service and other issues.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of skeptics during the campaign about how I would work out,  but now they're seeing it work out in a very normal, comfortable way," he said.  "I think I'm being reviewed well as vice president because people see how I am  performing -- the responsibility I have, the working relationship I have with  the President."  </P> <P> He added: "When you go through that kind of day-in and day-out barrage, you  really have to dig down deep inside and ask yourself what you're made of. 'Do  you have it?' . . . When you looked at yourself in the mirror in the morning  you had to realize that what had gotten you to the place you are is yourself.  And the one critical mistake that I made was to rely on the advice of others.  If I had it to do over again, I'd do it differently."  </P> <P> Also Monday morning, Marilyn Quayle trumpeted one of her own special causes  during a visit in the county. At the Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center,  she got a demonstration of an Orange County-based program that trains  volunteers to respond to emergencies and disasters nationwide.  </P> <P> The local program of the National Disaster Medical System, run jointly by  various federal agencies in conjunction with the local chapter of the Red  Cross, is one of only a half-dozen like it in the country.  </P> <P> Marilyn Quayle, an advocate of greater emergency preparedness, asserted the  need for greater coordination and attention to the program but backed away from  the issue of direct federal funding. "Just don't ask me for money," she joked  to the group of volunteers who attended the visit.  </P> <P> Staff writer Keith Love in Los Angeles contributed to this report.  </P></p>

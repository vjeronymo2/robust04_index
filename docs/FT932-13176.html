			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Fitch losses widen to Pounds 3.9m A SHARP RISE in exceptional provisions left Fitch, a provider of design services, Pounds 3.98m in the red at the pre-tax level for the year to end-December, against Pounds 417,000. The exceptionals amounted to Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 1.18m) and related to redundancies, unoccupied properties, property revaluation and expenses connected with the financial restructure. However, the directors said the benefits brought about by the restructuring were both concrete and substantial. The balance sheet had been 'significantly reshaped and strengthened'. A share suspension last year had affected the second half with turnover for the year falling by 12 per cent from Pounds 18.1m to Pounds 15.92m, of which Pounds 1.62 related discontinued activities. Losses per share were 31.9p (9.4p) and again there is no dividend.</p>

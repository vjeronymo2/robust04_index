			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, February 28 (TASS) -- The command of the  Bosnian Serb Army has categorically refuted a report that air  force planes of the Serb Republic in Bosnia were brought down  somewhere over the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.    "Our air force has only one airfield near Banja Luka, and  military observers from the U.N. force have long been present  there. They could have noticed the taking off of planes from  that airfield without fail," a spokesman for the Serb command  said in an interview with the TANJUG news agency.    The General Staff of the Yugoslav Army also emphatically  rejected a possibility of four planes, brought down by NATO  fighters, belonging to the Yugoslav Air Force.    Strictly following a resolution of the U.N. Security Council  banning flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina, our air force  planes made no flights in that air space. Since the creation of  the union republic of Yugoslavia, not a single plane belonging  to it has ever flown outside its air space, said a spokesman for  the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army.    Meanwhile, according to reports of the Moslem Radio of  Sarajevo, today in the morning military facilities in Moslem  cities of central Bosnia were bombed by Croatian planes. The  time of the bombing concides with the action taken by NATO  fighter planes against planes of the Galeb type.</p>

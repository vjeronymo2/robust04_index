			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Long-dated UK gilts recover lost ground - Announcement of better-than-expected producer prices data prompts positive reaction THE UK government bond market reacted positively to the news of better-than-expected producer prices at both input and output levels. This was best reflected in the very long end of the market. The 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 gained just over a quarter of a point, recovering some of the ground lost when the recent spate of good economic news created gloom in the most inflation-wary camps. An additional Pounds 250m tranche of the 2017 stock, announced on Friday, was sold without difficulty by the Bank of England yesterday, along with Pounds 350m of 8 per cent gilts due 2003. Market sentiment was helped by the demand exhibited for these issues. Some resilience was also shown at the shorter end of the market. The one area to sag was the middle range, where the next auction is expected, although the Bank of England has yet to make an announcement. The 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2007 was down by about  1/8 . While the market seems to have been little moved by the Conservatives' losses in last Thursday's elections, one economist commented that gilts might have responded more strongly to the good news on inflation without the political setback and the consequent weakening of the pound. ELSEWHERE, excitement focused on Denmark, where the government bond market fell sharply in response to a narrowing of the gap between the 'yes' and 'no' camps ahead of the Maastricht referendum on May 18, according to recent opinion polls. A weekend poll showed 46 per cent of Danes intending to vote 'yes' with 34 per cent against. Before last June's surprise 'no' vote, the figures were similar. If the Danes repeat that rejection, a speculative attack would be expected on the Danish krone, which weakened against the D-Mark yesterday. The yield on the 10-year government bond rose to 7.76 per cent, compared with 7.6 per cent on Friday night. The Spanish peseta is seen as the next most vulnerable currency and Spanish government bonds were also relatively poor performers on what was a generally quiet day for continental European markets. Trade in French government bonds was on ice ahead of the mini-budget statement, which came too late in the day for the European markets. There was little impetus in Germany. The next repo rate announcement is due tomorrow but only a thin slice is expected to be cut from the 7.71 per cent set last week. One feature of the continental markets was that Dutch bonds continued to outperform German bunds. With the guilder remaining strong, hopes are alive that interest rates can continue to be cut independently of German ones. Dutch 10-year bonds were yielding 12 basis points less than the German equivalent, putting about 4 more basis points distance between them. One economist said: 'It's a bit like holding German stock without east Germany.' A SURGE in the Nikkei stock market index, pushing it over 21,000 for the first time since March last year, undermined Japanese government bonds. The Nikkei was driven by the view that the Japanese economy would soon show signs of recovery. Other negative factors for the bonds market were an abatement of the yen's rise against the dollar and the rise in US Treasury yields. The yield on the benchmark No 145 bond due 2002 rose from 4.35 per cent to 4.43 per cent in Tokyo trading, and the futures contract fell from 108.27 to 108.00. Both figures weakened further in London trading. US TREASURY prices firmed at the long end of the maturity range on thin trading yesterday on the heels of gains in the futures market. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/16 at 104 1/32 , yielding 6.804 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/16 , to yield 3.758 per cent. In the absence of fresh economic news, the market's attention was focused firmly on the forthcoming quarterly refunding round. Over the next four days, the Treasury is due to sell Dollars 16bn in three-year notes (today), Dollars 10.75bn in 10-year notes (tomorrow), and Dollars 8.25bn in 30-year bonds (Thursday). In addition, more than Dollars 38bn in three-month and six-month bills and cash management bills will also be sold this week. Initially, with so much new supply in the pipeline, participants were reluctant to commit funds to the market, which left prices languishing near their opening values during the morning session. In the afternoon, however, longer-dated prices picked up ground in response to a rise in the June bond futures contract. With the short end staying flat, the yield curve flattened, a reversal of last Friday's trend. Analysts said this may have been the deliberate intention of some of the trading by dealers during the afternoon.</p>

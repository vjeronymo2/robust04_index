PT [Workers Party]  presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva also favors  this idea. Oliveira believes that to close the current  Constitution revision process now and reopen it in 1995 may  solve the impasse of the Constitution revision work.    "I believe it is a solution that might satisfy the people if  the most important amendments are not approved by 31 May," Lula  said.    Lula, who attended a demonstration against the end of the  monopolies in the oil and telecommunications industries in  Salvador, believes the political atmosphere does not favor the  constitutional revision.    "The PT not only supports the postponement of the work, but  also thanks God that the congressmen have had a little bit of  good sense to understand that the revision process cannot  continue under the current circumstances," Lula added. [passage  omitted]    After the dedication of the Sarah Hospital in Salvador,  Oliveira nonetheless admitted there are two obstacles to  Tavola's suggestion: the amendments that already have been  approved and the 31 May deadline approved by the Constituent  Congress.    But Oliveira believes the issue should be taken to the  Federal Supreme Court based on the fact that the temporary  Constitution measures that authorized the amendment process did  not include a deadline for finishing the revision works.

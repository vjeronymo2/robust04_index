			<p>BFN     [Text] Hans Modrow, deputy of the the Party of Democratic  Socialism [PDS], has been expelled from the German delegation to  monitor the elections in South Africa.    Bundestag President Suessmuth today called on the party to  nominate a different deputy. Modrow's participation in the  mission is not in the interest of the parliament because he is  being accused of electoral fraud during the GDR era.    In a meeting earlier of the Council of Elders, all other  parties came out against Modrow. The PDS is considering taking  legal action against the decision by the Bundestag president.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Building revival remains elusive THE REVIVAL in house-building shows little sign of spreading to other areas of construction, many of which which remain stuck in recession, to figures published yesterday by the environment department show. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, one of the country's biggest construction companies, warned this week that a recovery in general contracting was unlikely to occur before 1995 at the earliest. He said competition for UK work was intense so that margins were very low. Wimpey's house sales, by comparison, were 55 per cent higher in the first five months of this year compared with the corresponding period last year. Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said yesterday that the industry remained in a serious recession 'with output set to fall by a further 3 per cent this year and the construction jobless total heading for half a million since summer 1989'. The environment department said total construction work in Great Britain was 5 per cent lower in the first three months of this year than a year before. Private-sector commercial work, mainly offices and shops, was worst affected, with output down 25 per cent. A glimmer of hope from the department's figures was provided by a 5 per cent rise in private industrial work. Contractors say, however, that manufacturers and service industries will not invest in new buildings until they are confident that economic recovery can be sustained.</p>

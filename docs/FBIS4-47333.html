			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. I. Polyanin, A. K. Altynbayev, B. Ye. </F> Karasev, Scientific Research Institute of Engines]    [Abstract] This paper examines the use of electroerosion  machining (electic discharge machining, EDM) on current-carrying  materials (copying and piercing operations). Conclusions reached  from experience using EDM are expressed. Methods of improving  EDM equipment are outlined, and include: increasing the range of  pulse characteistics, better monitoring of the machining  process, more flexible control, specialized machinery, new  materials, special liquids for the machining process, and expert  systems to design procedures. Flexible modules for piercing  operations are described in detail. Current equipment achieves  an accuracy of 0.01 mm. A number of machines in the SEP series  have been developed for EDM. In one pass the machines can make  up to 15,000 perforations; depending on the number and diameter  of the holes this can take 30-70 minutes. The SEL-1 is a  specialized machine tool with a semi-automatic mode, and it is  described. It has two independent heads and machines the  channels between the blade of monorotors. The accuracy achieved  in 0.05 mm; the roughness ratio is 2.5. References 3 (Western).</p>

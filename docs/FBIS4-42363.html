The military transport planes currently in service in  Europe (Transall C-160, Hercules C-130, and Alenia G-222) are  aging and no longer have the adequate capacity and flexibility  for the military or humanitarian missions which the European  armed forces must now fulfill and should be replaced from the  year 2003.    The Western European Union (WEU), the defense organization  which brings together most of the members of the European Union  [EU], has commissioned a feasability study which should be  completed by the end of the year. The European aeronautical  industry, which is very interested in this project, has formed a  consortium for this purpose known as Euroflag SRL, based in  Rome, in which Deutsche Aerospace (Germany), Aerospatiale  (France), Alenia (Italy), British Aerospace (Britain), and Casa  (Spain) each have a 20 percent share. Three other companies are  associated with the enterprise: Flabel (Belgium), Ogma  (Portugal), and Tusas (Turkey).    German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe stressed the need to  entrust the major part of the development of the projet to the  industry which already has the experience of the Airbus civil  airplane program. According to DASA [Deutsche Aerospace  Airbus], the requirements of the WEU countries are estimated at  between 300 and 350 planes which could be delivered from the  year 2003 and produced until the year 2015. The firm estimates  that between 300 and 400 additional planes could be sold for  export. The total development cost is estimated at $6 billion.  The construction of the aircraft would make it</p>

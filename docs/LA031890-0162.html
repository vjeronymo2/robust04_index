			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT / WEST REGIONAL;  </P> <P> UNLV FINALLY GETS DEFENSIVE, TIPS OHIO STATE;  </P> <P> WEST REGIONAL: REBELS MAKE UNUSUAL SWITCH TO ZONE AFTER FAST START BY THE  BUCKEYES.  </P> <P> On a day when second-ranked Nevada Las Vegas was beatable, the Rebels were not  beaten.  </P> <P> Instead, they moved into the NCAA tournament's Sweet 16 for the fourth time in  five years with a 76-65 West Regional victory over Ohio State before 12,896 at  the Huntsman Center Saturday.  </P> <P> The Buckeyes, with a starting lineup of one freshman, three sophomores and a  junior, started fast and kept coming, fighting back after a 9-0 UNLV run erased  their four-point lead in the first half and again after a 14-1 run put them  behind by 13 with eight minutes to play.  </P> <P> But after Ohio State pulled to within 67-62 on Perry Carter's inside shot with  2:07 left, UNLV finally shut the door.  </P> <P> The Rebels went to a spread offense with about two minutes remaining, and Greg  Anthony made a three-point shot to give the Rebels an eight-point lead with  1:23 to play. Anthony finished with 14 points.  </P> <P> "Great teams have a way of winning ball games down the stretch," Ohio State  Coach Randy Ayers said. "That's what UNLV did today."  </P> <P> Anthony, playing despite a broken jaw, left the game earlier in the second half  after suffering a cut that later required stitches when he dived for the ball.  </P> <P> "We still had a chance until Anthony hit the three," Ayers said. "Good players  step forward, and that's what Anthony did."  </P> <P> It was a game in which UNLV needed people to step forward, one that started  with Ohio State sophomore guard Mark Baker and freshman forward Jimmy Jackson  making UNLV's man-to-man defense look slow-footed.  </P> <P> "They just blew right by us," Rebel Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. "We were  terrible. I couldn't get a timeout fast enough."  </P> <P> Tarkanian then made an unusual move: After the first five minutes, he switched  to a zone defense for most of the game, playing less man defense than the  Rebels had all year.  </P> <P> "I think Coach Tark made a great move when he switched to the zone," Ayers  said. "It slowed us down quite a bit."  </P> <P> UNLV (31-5) had to overcome several problems. Anderson Hunt missed all seven of  his three-point attempts. Forward Larry Johnson and center David Butler both  said they were feeling the effects of colds and the high altitude.  </P> <P> Johnson still finished with 23 points and 16 rebounds, seven of them offensive,  in only 28 minutes. Butler had 14 points and seven rebounds in 29 minutes.  </P> <P> "I thought Larry and David did a great job inside for us," Tarkanian said.  "Overall, I thought when the game got tight we kept getting the ball inside,  because we couldn't hit from the outside."  </P> <P> Carter led the Buckeyes (17-13) with 15 points.  </P> <P> For UNLV, it was a victory that gave the team confidence going into the West  Regional at Oakland, where they will play Ball State Friday.  </P> <P> "The biggest thing is (we didn't play that well and) we still won," Anthony  said. "The only way we feel we can lose is if we don't play hard."  </P></p>

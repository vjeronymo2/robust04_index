			<p>BFN     [Text] While carrying out investigations and studies in  Guangxi recently, Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau, state councillor, and director of  the State Commission for Restructuring Economy, pointed out:  There are inherent laws governing economic development. Areas  inhabited by minority nationalities must make use of the  favorable opportunity resulting from industrial transference  from more advanced areas of the country to take the initiative  to readjust their industrial setups in light of their own local  conditions. This is of great significance to speeding up their  economic development.    From 21 to 26 April, Li Tieying went deep into enterprises  in  Beihai, Nanning, Liuzhou, and Guilin to carry out on-the-spot  inspections, and held discussions with responsible persons of  relevant local units and entrepreneurs.    Since last year, cadres and masses of various nationalities  in Guangxi have implemented the spirit of the remarks of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping made during his southern tour and of the 14th CPC  National Congress to further emancipate their minds and speed up  the pace of reform and opening up. Guangxi has entered a period  of rapid development. Last year the region's GNP was 19.6  percent higher than in 1992. This was the best year in its  history. Total incomes of township and town enterprises  increased by 140 percent, and the margin of increase had ranked  first in the whole country for three years running. The amount  of foreign capital actually used increased by 300 percent, and  the margin of increase also led in the coastal areas. People's  livelihood had been markedly improved, and per capita income of  residents in cities and towns grew by 38.5 percent. Per capita  net income of peasants rose by 20.9 percent.    Li Tieying held: As long as we promote reform through  expanding opening up, promote opening up through deepening  reform, seize on the fine opportunity of industrial  transference, and exploit Guangxi's regional strong points, we  can follow a suitable path for our efforts to speed up economic  development. He pointed out: When economic development is  speeded up, industrial transference can definitely be quickened.  At present, more advanced areas are speeding up their  industrial transference to less advanced areas. For the latter,  this is their fine opportunity. The fact that sugar production  is being shifted from the east to the west is a good example.  Guangdong was a big sugar-producing province. In recent years,  it is making efforts to develop other undertakings with higher  additional value. Guangxi is now making great efforts to  vigorously develop its sugarcane planting undertaking, and cane  sugar processing industry as well. Its sugar production output  now rank first in the whole country. Taking the initiative to  seize the fine opportunity of the more advanced areas'  industrial transference is a good idea for promoting economic  development. Promoting industrial transference in a region  itself is also a good idea. Readjusting product mix in  accordance with international market demand aimed at increasing  its market share is a good idea too. For instance, Guangxi  produces more than 800 kinds of tropical fruit. The  fruit-processing industry can be spread from key cities like  Nanning and others to other prefectures, counties and cities.  Guilin's watermelon frost [a kind of Chinese medicine] is warmly  welcomed by consumers. If a city noted for tourism can develop  its main production of souvenirs to meet the demand of both  Chinese and foreign tourists, it can have more opportunities to  occupy the market. Organization and development work in a  planned way can form unique industrial strong points of areas  inhabited by minority nationalities.    Li Tieying said: It is necessary to carry out various kinds  of reforms on an experimental basis in a number of selected  enterprises in townships and cities, do a solid job, and score  achievements. He added: Under the new situation of reform,  cadres must participate in transformation and carry out profound  investigations and studies. It is unnecessary for them to devise  a certain kind of pattern. They must conscientiously sum up  experiences. Factory directors and managers must study hot and  difficult points in reform, and become all-round entrepreneurs  noted for their effective operations. Areas inhabited by  minority nationalities must proceed from reality to actively and  steadily carry out reform in systems regarding enterprises'  property rights and the establishment of modern enterprises.    Li Tieying stressed: Guangdong has fully exploited its  strong points of being adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao,  adjoining international markets, and having quick access to  information to promote its economic development. Guangxi also  has the strong point of adjoining the Southeast Asian market.  It must grasp well infrastructure projects to fully make use of  its strong point as a sea passageway of the vast southwestern  region to invigorate its economy and cause it to serve the vast  southwestern region. It must firmly seize the fine opportunity  of the flow of commerce, commodities, qualified personnel, and  information brought about by its position as a sea passageway to  make itself prosperous and flourishing through reform and  opening up.    When Comrade Li Tieying was carrying out his inspection in  Guangxi, regional CPC Secretary Zhao Fuli, who was conducting  investigations and studies in prefectures and counties, reported  to and briefed him on our region's reform and opening up, and  economic development in recent years. Liu Mingzu, regional  party deputy secretary and chairman of the regional people's  congress standing committee, accompanied Comrade Li Tieying  during the entire inspection tour.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DIFFICULT MATTER OF GIL LINDSAY  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council is set to ease out their veteran colleague,  Gilbert Lindsay, who can no longer serve the residents of the 9th District.  Councilman Lindsay is paralyzed and unable to speak.  </P> <P> It has become a pressing matter of compassion, and necessity, to replace him.  </P> <P> Because the City Charter makes no provision for the removal of incapacitated  members, the council must take a roundabout method to get Lindsay out of  office. The charter does allow the removal of a member who is absent from the  city for 60 unexcused days. Lindsay is technically out of the city because he  is in an Inglewood hospital. If he remains there through the first of next  year, the council should remove him.  </P> <P> Lindsay, the first black member to serve on the council, was appointed in 1963.  During his tenure, he has aided greatly in the commercial rebirth of downtown.  </P> <P> During the years, however, he has paid less attention to his own back yard.  There has been scarce redevelopment in the poor and working-class neighborhoods  that stretch south from downtown.  </P> <P> The 9th District needs more jobs, major stores and banks, affordable housing  and services for the older black population and the younger, Latino families.  Gangs, drugs and other crime also plague much of the district. These problems  require the attention of a strong advocate.  </P> <P> Councilman Lindsay, who will turn 90 next week, can no longer provide adequate  representation. The council's move to provide new vigorous leadership is  appropriate.  </P></p>

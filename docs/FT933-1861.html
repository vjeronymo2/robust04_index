			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Lib Dems split on energy tax A DILUTION of the party's commitment to an energy tax was approved yesterday after a debate on environmental taxation dominated by concern about what the plans could do to Liberal Democrat support in rural areas. The move represents a slight setback for Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, who had hoped that the conference would accept without amendment the plans to shift taxation on to pollution and the use of resources. But the discussion revealed the split within the party over the impact of the energy tax, particularly on people in rural communities who need to use cars. It also highlighted concerns among Liberal Democrats themselves that unless they were careful the plans might well resemble the government's imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel, against which the party has vigorously campaigned. Party strategists fear that a debate on pensions tomorrow could also hand the Conservatives a weapon. If the conference rejects plans to link the future uprating of the state pension with prices rather than earnings, then the party will be vulnerable to Tory charges that it would have to raise taxes significantly to pay for the higher increases. Yesterday, Mr Simon Hughes, the party's environment spokesman, sought to pre-empt another prospective Tory attack by emphasising that the energy tax plans were 'revenue-neutral', and that the first call on the money raised would be compensation for those most affected. He said the paper, Taxing Pollution, Not People, was the base for further discussion within the party and was only an interim statement of policy. Even so, representatives insisted that the motion accepting the consultation paper should not recommend that a carbon tax be implemented immediately. They also resisted the idea of a tax which would be phased in more quickly or have a wider base than the proposed EC tax. As senior Conservatives stepped up their recent series of attacks on the party, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said Liberal Democrats had shown themselves as 'shameless'. In a single debate they had both attacked the government's VAT on fuel proposals and supported an energy tax, he said.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: Toronto-Dominion Bank slips 7% as loan losses mount TORONTO-DOMINION Bank, Canada's fifth largest chartered bank, has reported a 7 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profits and an 18 per cent drop for the full year ended October 31. Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 113m (USDollars 88.2m) or 35 cents a share against CDollars 120m or 37 cents a year earlier. Return on equity was 9.2 per cent against 10.1 per cent and on assets 0.61 per cent against 0.70 per cent. Full-year earnings were CDollars 408m or CDollars 1.25 a share against CDollars 497m or CDollars 1.51 a year earlier. Total assets at October 31 were CDollars 74bn, up 7 per cent, fuelled by growth in securities holdings and residential mortgages. Loan losses increased 10 per cent to CDollars 543m, though the personal lending sector stabilised. Net non-performing loans were CDollars 1.7bn, up CDollars 228m and equal to 2.98 per cent of total loans against 2.6 per cent a year earlier. It was the bank's third successive year of falling profits. The bank does not have any loans to Olympia and York, the troubled developer, but took an undisclosed provision against its holdings of Edper group preferred shares. Bank of Nova Scotia posted net profit of CDollars 676.2m or CDollars 2.94 a share for the year ended October 31, up 7 per cent from CDollars 633m or CDollars 2.81 a share in fiscal 1991. Fourth-quarter profits were up 1 per cent to CDollars 163.3 m or 72 cents a share despite sharply higher loan and loss provisions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Kyo-chun from the column "Central </F> Tower"]    [Text] President Kim Yong-sam on 25 May received a report  from Navy Chief of Staff Kim Hong-yol on his promotion to  four-star admiral and affixed a badge of rank to him. By this,  President Kim filled all the nine posts of four-star generals of  the ROK Armed Forces with the generals he himself promoted and  appointed. Presidential Spokesman Chu Ton-sik said, "All the  three-star generals who number over 20 are also those whom  President Kim promoted."    The three- and four-star generals reported their promotion  at  Chongwadae [presidential offices], with President Kim himself  affixing the badge of rank to them. Therefore, all the senior  generals of the Armed Forces have become 'President Kim's  generals.'    Spokesman Chu said, "A considerable number of two-star  generals have also been promoted or appointed to their present  posts by President Kim. This shows how rapidly reform in the  military has been carried out." Spokesman Chu added, "This  concludes the personnel actions for military reform."    President Kim, receiving a report from Navy Chief of Staff  Kim and sharing coffee with him, said, "I am gratified that the  military is keeping step with the new order of reform and change  and is carrying out its duties well in a stable condition." He  added, "Only the Navy's chief of staff was a three-star admiral,  while the chiefs of staff of the Army and Air Force were  four-star generals. This imbalance has now been resolved."</p>

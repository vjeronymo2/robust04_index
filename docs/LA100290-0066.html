			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEWART UNFAZED BY 2-0 SETBACK;  </P> <P> ANGELS: OAKLAND ACE OUTPITCHED BY GRAHE, BUT HE'S ALREADY THINKING ABOUT THE  PLAYOFF OPENER.  </P> <P> Twenty minutes after the Angels' 2-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics, Dave  Stewart erased the game from his mind.  </P> <P> With a quick nod to Angel rookie Joe Grahe, who allowed Oakland only three hits  over 8 1/3 innings Monday night and "pitched pretty darn good," Stewart  pronounced himself ready for the A's American League playoff opener Saturday.  </P> <P> "I like to pitch in Boston because it's fairer and you know how the ball is  going to carry, but I'd much rather go to Toronto if the weather is a factor,"  Stewart said. "It really doesn't make any difference."  </P> <P> While Stewart and the A's go to the playoffs and perhaps to the World Series,  Grahe goes into the off-season with an outstanding finish to his rookie season.  </P> <P> Grahe (3-4), once a draft choice of the A's, lingered in the Angels' clubhouse  long after the game, still wearing his cap and a smile.  </P> <P> "They threw their best lineup out there and I'm happy they did," said Grahe,  who was skipped over twice in the rotation and used his time to develop a cut  fastball that baffled the A's. "It's something I needed. It made me concentrate  on each hitter."  </P> <P> The Angels also shut out Rickey Henderson in his bid to steal the four bases  that would tie him with Lou Brock for the all-time lead.  </P> <P> Henderson's fifth-inning single to right was one of three singles given up by  Grahe, but catcher Lance Parrish threw out Henderson trying to steal second.  </P> <P> Henderson went one for four to and is batting .326, two points behind AL leader  George Brett.  </P> <P> Henderson has six stolen bases against the Angels this season, but Parrish --  who has thrown out 53 of 117 base stealers -- is determined to keep Henderson  from getting the record against the Angels.  </P> <P> "He'll never do it against us," Parrish said. "First of all, he's got to get on  base that many times and he's not going to do it. It won't be an issue in this  series."  </P> <P> The Angels were locked into a fourth-place finish when Seattle lost, but can  finish at .500 if they win their last two games.  </P> <P> Luis Polonia tripled and Donnie Hill singled to provide the Angels with a run  in the first. A two-out double by Dick Schofield and a single by Jack Howell  produced the insurance run off Stewart (22-11) in the sixth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Angel notes  </P> <P> Bert Blyleven underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder Monday at  Centinela Hospital. He will be re-evaluated in a week and could begin a  rehabilitation program if no complications arise. Kirk McCaskill will undergo  arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow Thursday.  </P> <P> Mike Fetters' start in Wednesday's season finale will be his first start since  May 19 at Toronto.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Senator Fernando de la Rua from the Radical </F> Civic Union, UCR, for Buenos Aires, by Analia Argento in Buenos  Aires; date not given]    [Text] [Argento] Is the internal party election in Buenos  Aires unavoidable?    [De la Rua] We want to participate in the party convention  and present a homogeneous discourse there. We believe we must  attend the convention without feeling subjected to the pact and  having the possibility of voting against the clause on  reelection of a president who is in office and of reassessing  the Buenos Aires Government's autonomy.    [Argento] Wouldn't it be more convenient to present a  homogeneous discourse at the national level?    [De la Rua] Generally speaking it would, but with regard to  this issue it would not be advisable because not everybody is of  one mind. Here we have been presented with a fait accompli --  there was no prior debate on it.    [Argento] You lost the debate when the UCR party convention  approved the Democratic Pact. Shouldn't you conform to what the  majority wishes?    [De la Rua] That is precisely what we are demanding in  Buenos  Aires City. You must bear in mind that programs and platforms  for this type of election are put together by each constituency.    [Argento] Why do you think the pact is detrimental to the  UCR?    [De la Rua] Because it has bowed to the government's wishes.  What the pact has incorporated in the constitutional reform does  not limit the monopoly control of power. On the contrary, it  increases it by vesting the president with the power to issue  decrees in cases of extreme necessity or emergency; by seeking  to make all terms of office the same length; by incorporating  the partial veto and the position of prime minister, which is a  hybrid that has no power of its own. And above all, because it  makes the role of the opposition wishy-washy and presents it as  if it were backing the government.    [Argento] [Raul] Alfonsin contends that had the pact not  been  signed the country would have lurched toward chaos.    [De la Rua] The government was then considered a threat. Why  should one trust it now? There is a contradiction in terms.  The long and short of it is that the government has brought  pressure to bear on us and we, the leading opposition party,  instead of withstanding it, have surrendered our stronghold.    [Argento] Are you saying that the UCR "got cold feet?"    [De la Rua] Oh, absolutely.    [Argento] Given the UCR's infighting, how will you be able  to  keep the promise of being the guarantors of the constitutional  reform pact?    [De la Rua] It has nothing to do with that. That is an  election slogan that people can accept or reject. To gain  credibility in our capital we have to base our campaign on the  stance we have always had, namely being against the president's  reelection and a constitutional reform that serves the  government's interests and purposes.    [Argento] Criticism has been voiced of certain positions  like  that of Alberto Kohan [secretary general of the Justicialist  Party National Council] concerning the possibility of  Constituent Assembly members having different positions from  what the pact establishes. What image will the UCR give then if  it also fails to present a united front?    [De la Rua] I have never changed either my stance or my  discourse. The government, however, signed a pact and some of  its officials say they can disregard it. Now, on closer  examination, Article 6 of the law does not say that voting must  be in keeping with the terms stipulated in the previous articles  but rather that everything that does not fall under the rules  established in Articles 2 and 3 will be considered null and  void. Therefore, there are constraints on the fields, i.e. the  issues that can be discussed, and not on the resolution made  there.    [Argento] Are you going to head the list of Constituent  Assembly members?    [De la Rua] I would love to.    [Argento] Can it be interpreted as a strategy to recover the  ground lost in the October parliamentary elections?    [De la Rua] No, it is rather my duty vis-a-vis Buenos Aires  residents. Now if my fellow party members want me to be a  Constituent Assembly member (this issue does not rob me of my  sleep; this is not my overriding concern), I will be one.    [Argento] [UCR Deputy] Leopoldo Moreau some days ago said  that de la Rua "has no chance" of becoming a presidential  candidate.    [De la Rua] He shares President Menem's views and it is only  natural that he should do so.    [Argento] Will there be a rift within the UCR?    [De la Rua] Absolutely not. We have always wanted to have a  united party and we will continue struggling within our party.    [Argento] Would you leave the UCR?    [De la Rua] Never.    [Argento] Alfonsin denied that he intended to intervene in  the Buenos Aires City constituency. Do you think there will be  sanctions?    [De la Rua] (He laughs) That would be just the thing that is  missing to deepen the crisis we are enmeshed in due to the  current UCR leadership.    [Argento] What is your forecast for the 10 April elections?    [De la Rua] Some public opinion polls show that the  Justicialist Party has an overall majority. This process is  already under way; the constitutional reform has for all  practical purposes been passed, the government already has got  it at hand since it is already discussing who Menem's running  mate will be in 1995.    [Argento] Do you then think the UCR will limp badly?    [De la Rua] I wish just the opposite, but I must be  pessimistic.</p>

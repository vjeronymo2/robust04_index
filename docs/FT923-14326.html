			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Evidence claimed on Bush role in 'cover-up' THE chairman of the House banking committee yesterday disclosed new documents which he claimed showed that President George Bush played a direct role in White House efforts to thwart congressional investigations into US policy on Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait. Mr Henry Gonzalez, the committee chairman, also disclosed a secret 1989 report by the CIA to the White House and State Department that indicated loans from the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) were being used to fund Iraq's nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programmes. The disclosures could embarrass the Bush administration, which is already facing a possible call by the House judiciary committee to name a special prosecutor to investigate the BNL affair and US policy on Iraq. Mr Bush's Iraqi policies are already under fire from Mr Ross Perot, a potential independent presidential candidate, and congressional Democrats. The six-page CIA report, 'Iraq-Italy: Repercussions of BNL-Atlanta Scandal', concluded that a failure to approve a pending Dollars 1bn US loan guarantee for Iraq would harm US-Iraqi relations. Mr Gonzalez said the CIA report was sent to the National Security Council and the State Department on November 6 1989, just two days before a White House meeting agreed to approve the loan guarantee. Mr Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, noted in a statement before the House of Representatives that President Bush had recently denied that US funds helped to enhance Iraq's weapons capability. Mr Gonzalez claimed the president's assertion was 'untrue'. Mr Gonzalez also told Congress he gained access to Treasury Department notes which revealed that the chief US prosecutor in Atlanta investigating the BNL affair received a telephone call in 1989 from the White House and got the impression there was concern about the 'embarrassment level'. The Atlanta prosecutor was not provided with the November 1989 CIA report about BNL until August 1990, a full year after the investigation had begun, Mr Gonzalez claimed. Mr Gonzalez released documents to buttress his assertion that President Bush was directly involved in a cover-up of 'embarrassing and potentially illegal' activities related to US Iraqi policies. Among these were notes from a White House meeting about how to deal with congressional investigations that said: 'The president will want to meet with all cabinet secretaries one-on-one to work it out adequately internally. Very sensitive ..' Mr Gonzalez said Mr Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, and Mr Robert Gates, the CIA director, also played direct roles in limiting congressional access to documents relating to US exports to Iraq of militarily useful technologies.</p>

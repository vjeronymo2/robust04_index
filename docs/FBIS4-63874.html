			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nataliya Ablova article: "If I were Nursultan.... Having </F> Swallowed Sovereignty, It Seems the Central Asian Republics Do  Not Wish To Set Up a Eurasian Union"]    [Text] A meeting between [Kyrgyzstan President] Akayev,  [Uzbekistan President] Karimov, and [Kazakhstan President]  Nazarbayev at the beginning of May on the shores of Lake  Issyk-Kul created much fuss and bother in the CIS, particularly  in Russia. Moscow journalists tried to call their colleagues in  Bishkek, but the latter had no idea themselves about what was  happening in Cholpon-Ata -- the meeting was closed to  journalists.    Recently a number of Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] politicians have  started thinking about the problem of reestablishing the former  Union, stipulating that this new union will be quite a different  sort of association. Unfortunately there cannot be another  kind: It is either one or the other. Either we go back to the  old unitary state, and in doing so shed the blood of all those  who disagree with this idea. Or we must independently swallow  the troubles and savor the joys of our new existence. The  prospect of a Eurasian confederative state is still a long way  off and will only be realized given very intelligent leaders and  very patient peoples. And it must be agreed that this prospect  is more of a wish than a possibility.    Calls by various Kirghiz parliamentarians, and also by the  leaders of the newly fledged parties, to at least begin this  process by uniting the Central Asian states therefore sound  extremely naive. Even these countries which are so close in  ethnocultural and geographical terms have in the space of under  three years of independence had enough time to go their separate  ways. Let us ask ourselves whether the peoples and rulers of  the Central Asian states want to establish a confederation with  common borders and supranational organs of government and  justice, and let us try to answer this question honestly.    The situation is clearest of all in Turkmenia.  What the people of this republic think is "a complete and utter  mystery." In conditions of totalitarian censorship and the  suppression of the slightest political activity, it is  impossible to say anything about the expression of the popular  will. For the time being the Turkmenbashi [President Niyazov]  speaks for the people, and he is unequivocally opposed to  uniting with anyone in the solar system. During a recent CSCE  seminar a certain person "close to the emperor" let it be known  openly that the commanding elite of Turkmenia had made a simple  calculation: The money earned by selling off oil and gas would  suffice until 2030. It would then be clear whether a market  economy should be introduced and whether or not Turkmenia should  unite with anyone.    Everything is also clear as far as Tajikistan is  concerned. Nobody in their right mind would take steps to  unite with a state where a civil war is far from over. Clan  feuds, the onslaughts of the intransigent opposition, refugees,  Afghan infiltration.... Outsiders want to put an impenetrable  wall between themselves and all these problems, they are in no  mood for unification!    Three countries remain: Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, and  Uzbekistan. It was the presidents of these three states who  attended the get-together at Issyk-Kul.    Kazakhstan. Everyone knows that Nursultan  Nazarbayev is a convinced supporter of any form of unification  with former Union states. But he is more interested -- indeed  principally so -- in union with Russia. Such an association  would resolve some of Kazakhstan's economic problems. It would  take the heat out of the problem of the northern oblasts, where  the population is primarily Russian. This is an unbearable  burden, despite the shared expenditure on maintaining Baykonur  and reprofiling the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, a burden  which is pressuring the Kazakhstani president and pushing him  toward integration. However, Russia (or its present government,  to be more precise) is not desperate to unite with Kazakhstan or  with Central Asia as a whole. We will not dwell on Russia's  reasons, but the Kazakhstani population is by no means entirely  on its leader's side. The ruling elite has already had time to  savor the sweet taste of independence, and is not keen to see  the status quo changed just like that.    Uzbekistan. Of all Kirghizia's closest  neighbors, this is the most complex partner Karimov  undoubtedly dreams of leading the region. He is extremely  irritated both by the popularity of the pragmatic Nazarbayev and  by the favors being shown by the West to Askar Akayev, "pupil  No. 1" in the school of democracy; Karimov currently realizes  that there is nothing he can do to oppose the strength and  prestige enjoyed by the Kazakhstani leader, whereas he is  perfectly well aware of Kirghizia's weak points: The Uzbek  population in the south of the republic, which sets its watches  to Tashkent time, and Kirghizia's dependence on deliveries of  Uzbek energy sources. Like the wise politician he is, the Uzbek  president is skillfully playing his trump cards in his contacts  with Kirghizia, managing without too much difficulty to secure  its silence and submission. But fear is not a basis for  possible unification.    So what about Kirghizia? Does it want a union of  Central Asian states? Kirghizia needs transparent borders,  freedom of trade, a common economic area, and stability. And no  more. It is frightening even to think about the establishment  of common supranational structures in the elective, executive,  and judicial branches.</p>

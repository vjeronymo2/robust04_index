			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpt] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has  said that he has serious doubts that the sacrifices involved in  the economic stability program will be distributed justly or  that the measures will be definitely implemented by the current  government.    In a statement after the ANAP Chairmanship Council meeting,  Yilmaz said that Turkey has needed a stability program since the  end of 1991, but that a very important period of time was  wasted. He pointed out that the necessity was felt more  strongly at the end of 1992. He stressed that this issue was  not considered even in the 1994 budget. Yilmaz maintained that  the economic stability program was delayed as a result of  coalition negotiations.    [Begin Yilmaz recording] Before everything else, a stability  program needs a consensus that a program is necessary. There is  a consensus in our public today that these measures are indeed  necessary. However, we are concerned that an incomplete  stability program might destroy this consensus.

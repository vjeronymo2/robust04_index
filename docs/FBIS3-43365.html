			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cabinda Provincial Governor Augusto da Silva Tomas  has expressed satisfaction about the fact that separatist  organizations in the province have chosen the path of dialogue,  rather than the armed struggle, to solve problems linked to the  future of the enclave.    [Begin Tomas recording] The efforts being made by the  government, all men of good will -- notably those in the  churches and international organizations represented here -- and  the people of Cabinda Province at large, have finally allowed  consensus to be sought on the basis of majority so that  Cabinda's problems can be settled at the negotiating table,  rather than by taking up arms.    To us, it has been a source of satisfaction and pride to  learn that, finally, our brethren in the Renewed Front for the  Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave, the Cabinda Democratic Front,  the Movement for the Liberation of Cabinda, the Movement of  Resistance for the Total Independence of Cabinda [words  indistinct] have decided to build a common front called the  Cabinda Nationalist Forum, Fonac, that will seek to create  favorable conditions for future talks with the government of the  Republic of Angola. This is a patriotic stand. Taking into  account the suffering of their people, they have decided to  write yet another brilliant page in the history book of our  heroic people of Cabinda, in line with our ancestors' teachings.  We sincerely hope that this initiative will not be aborted, as  has happened with so many other initiatives in our recent  history.    We would also like to convey to our Cabinda brethren our  wish  that the negative influence of the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola will not harm their interests.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commission Feels Russian Accession </F> to EU To Be Unrealistic"]    [Text] Brussels, 06 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- Although no  formal conclusions were drawn at the brain-storming meeting held  by the European Commission on Wednesday [6 April] to examine  relations with the Republics of the CIS (former U.S.S.R.),  observers believe that the commissioners did reach some general  conclusions. As expected, the commissioner's study focused  mainly on relations with Russia. This was based on discussion  notes by Mr. Christophersen, Sir Leon Brittan, and Mr. Van den  Broek and on a memorandum on industrial policy by Mr. Bangemann  (who is in the United States), as well as technical annexes.  Although no information was made public on the results of the  seminar, EUROPE has reason to believe that:     -  All of the  Commissioners who spoke felt that it was not realistic for  Russia or the other CIS Republics to consider joining the  European Union [EU];    -  Therefore, efforts should focus on how  cooperation between the [European] Union and these countries can  be strengthened;    -  Economic cooperation should be both bilateral  (by means of different agreements the Union has already  concluded or is envisaging with the different republics) and  multilateral in nature, notably through improvement of the TACIS  programme [Technical Assistance Program for the Republics of the  Former U.S.S.R.]. This programme should be made  multiannual;    -  Political cooperation should include stepped-up  political dialogue, which, in particular with Russia, should be  wide-ranging and systematic;    -  A certain degree of cooperation  should not be excluded in areas covered by the "third pillar" of  the Treaty of Maastricht (home and justice affairs) in specific  sectors, such as efforts to combat drugs and organized crime and  monitoring of the recycling of dirty money. Several  commissioners highlighted the scope of industrial cooperation  (see the example of aluminium with Russia) and scientific  cooperation.</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Management: Legend behind the cash cow Few people have had as much impact on international business in the second half of the 20th Century as the founder of the Boston Consulting Group, Bruce Henderson, who died last week aged 77 in the city where he was born, Nashville, Tennessee. Though this might be disputed by US General Electric and BCG's top consultancy rivals at the longer-established McKinsey &amp; Co, Henderson's greatest claim was to have put the concept of competitive strategy on the map. Until he founded BCG in the early 1960s, the competitive element of strategy was conspicuous in most corporate analyses by its absence. Henderson was the father of two analytical tools for which BCG had become famous - even notorious - by the late 1970s: the 'experience curve' and the portfolio 'growth share matrix'. These, in turn, launched BCG's gospel about the all-importance of high market share. They also gave rise to such graphic expressions as 'cash cows' (businesses which can be milked for cash) and 'dogs' (those which should be sold or eliminated). By the time he retired in 1985, his empire had grown to 500 employees and nine offices. In the last seven years, its size more than doubled, to 1,300 employees in 19 offices around the world. That growth rate spells manifest success with clients. Yet, many executives who have never used BCG's services still view the firm critically, as an arch-exponent of the discredited pedalling of packaged solutions. This is an unfair allegation - witness, BCG's recent sophisticated work on quality and 'time-based management'. But it is one which several former colleagues felt Henderson brought on himself, by being such an arch-simplifier and salesman of his own and his firm's ideas. Henderson belonged to that sizeable branch of the strategy world whose first degree was engineering, rather than arts, social science or economics. Hence, his deep interest in complex systems - a field which is only now having an impact on business through the concept of 'organisational learning.' He had little time for economists, arguing - with much justification - that 'Darwin is probably a better guide to business competition than economists are.'</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (10): Trade barriers foster overseas growth / A look at the secure home base of the country's car manufacturers The growing number of new Korean cars appearing in western cities from London to Los Angeles is a sight that enrages European and US motor companies. While western carmakers worry that South Korea may repeat the success of Japan in posing a serious challenge in their home markets, they are virtually shut out of Korea, which is the second biggest car market in Asia after Japan. Korea last year imported only 1,984 passenger cars, which is almost the same as the number of cars sold in a single day in the country. In contrast, Korea exported a record 639,000 vehicles last year, with one third being shipped to western Europe and the US. Korea's restrictions against car imports are cited as one example of how the country has used trade barriers to foster the growth of its main industries by protecting them against foreign competition. The complete domination of the domestic market by Korea's big three carmakers - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo  -has helped transform the country into the world's sixth largest vehicle producer. Korean car manufacturers are now launching an aggressive export offensive in Europe and the US from their secure home market. Hyundai Motors, South Korea's largest car manufacturer and biggest vehicle exporter, already has a strong presence in the US and Europe, which accounts for 63 per cent of the company's overseas sales. Its marketing strength reflects Hyundai's status as the only Korean car company that has been able to sell vehicles under its own badge abroad through an independent dealer network. Kia Motors and Daewoo Motors, Korea's second and third largest car companies, have also been shipping vehicles to the industrialised world by supplying them on an original equipment manufacturing (OEM) basis to their respective partners, Ford and General Motors. They are now starting to establish an independent presence in Europe and the US. Kia started marketing in western Europe last autumn and recently announced that it would start producing its popular Sportage four-wheel sports utility vehicle in Germany early next year in a joint venture with Karmann, an automotive engineering group. Kia also plans to expand its US distribution network to 330 dealers by 1996. Daewoo will enter western Europe next year and the US in 1996 following the recent collapse of its joint venture with GM, which had imposed export restrictions on the Korean motor company. The prospect of increased Korean vehicle exports is provoking European and US car companies to demand that Korea open its market to foreign competition or face retaliation. European motor companies are calling on the EU to revoke the generalised system of preferences (GSP) that lowers tariffs on Korean cars. The US is asking that Korea cut its import tariff on passenger cars from 10 per cent to 2.5 per cent and revise vehicle taxes that discriminate against foreign models. Restrictions on the number of distribution outlets available to importers and a complex certification system are regarded as the main non-tariff barriers to foreign cars. Korea has already made a few concessions on the issue. The government says it has abandoned tax audits of foreign car customers, a practice that importers claim was meant to discourage their purchase as part of an official crackdown on conspicuous consumption. Seoul is considering some of the other demands made by Washington. US officials expect that the luxury tax on executive cars will be cut and limits on TV advertising will be eased. The promise of lower barriers is already prompting more western car manufacturers to open showrooms in Seoul. But most analysts believe that the increased presence of European and US cars will not seriously threaten Korean car companies. 'European carmakers will only have a minimal impact on the market,' says Mr Gilles Anouil, head of the EU office in Seoul. The American Chamber of Commerce in Korea estimates that if car imports increase from their current market share of 0.14 per cent to 4.9 per cent, the same level as in Japan, it would represent 70,000 vehicles with annual sales of Dollars 1bn. A greater potential threat to the Korean motor industry would be opening the market to Japanese car imports, which are now virtually banned. 'Korean car companies at their current stage of development cannot compete against the Japanese,' says Mr Kim Moo, a vice president at Samsung Heavy Industries, which is planning to enter the passenger car industry. For a start, Japanese cars have a quality advantage over their Korean competitors. They might even be price-competitive despite the high yen due to better productivity in Japanese car factories and low transport costs from Japan. The government is considering dropping the import ban on Japanese cars in 1997, a measure that could disrupt Korea's ambitious programme to become one of the world's five largest carmakers. In spite of trade protection, Korean car companies suffer from low profitability. Hyundai and Kia reported 1993 earnings of Won58bn and Won18bn respectively, while Daewoo lost Won60bn. Although all had improved earnings performance last year, analysts believe profits could have been much higher given the 20 per cent rise in total sales. Increased marketing costs and heavy debt burdens have cut into profits. Competition in the domestic market is already expected to increase with the entry of Ssangyong into the passenger car industry in 1996, followed possibly by Samsung a year later. Although Korea remains one of the world's fastest growing vehicle markets, there are doubts whether a nation of 42m can support five car companies. Growing pressure in the home market is the main cause for the Korean motor industry's rapid expansion overseas. Besides western Europe and the US, Korea is focusing on China as a new market. Car ownership in China is expected to triple to 3m in the next decade. 'Korean vehicle makers view China as the source of their future salvation,' says Mr Brian Gold, of Euro-Asian Business Consultancy in Seoul. Western car companies, frustrated about entering Korea, can at least take comfort from the fact that their Korean rivals are having similar problems in breaking open the Chinese market. In what one Seoul-based western motor analyst calls 'the height of audacity given Korea's own record,' Seoul recently asked Beijing to drop barriers against Korean car imports. Korea is also seeking to establish car factories in China as a means to penetrate the market. But Beijing is demanding that the Koreans establish joint venture automotive component plants as a first step, while postponing approval for the car factories. Some Korean car companies are resisting the request, believing that the supply of components could give the Chinese the technical capability to create an independent motor industry that might eventually challenge Korea.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen held  talks in Bonn today with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on  European integration. Salolainen, whom we contacted a short  time ago, confirms that the European Commission has in practice  completed its detailed stances on agriculture.    [Begin Salolainen recording] Well, yes, Federal Chancellor  Kohl has the opinion that this is still fully possible [as  heard] and he viewed very sympathetically the fact that Finland  and the other countries applying for membership would become  members in the European Union within this timeframe. In  addition, he promised his full personal support, his strong  support, toward the success of this. He saidthat this is  necessary also regarding the general development in Europe, in  other words, that a positive signal could be given to the rest  of Europe about the fact that the European Union is a developing  organization which can expand, and which would also be an  example for the Central and East European countries, indicating  that they, too, can progress further in the market economy and  also toward future membership of the European Union.

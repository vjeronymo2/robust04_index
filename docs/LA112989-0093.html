			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> New Construction Down 6%: New construction contracts were down 6% in October to  $262.58 billion, compared to $279.72 billion in September, the F. W. Dodge  construction report said. The October figures reflected the tone set in the  industry in the past two years, and followed a strong September performance  reflecting an unusually large number of public works projects, the report said.  The October decline mostly reflected an 11% drop to an annualized $46.8 billion  from $52.88 billion in September in the public works and utilities construction  sector. Residential building held steadily in October at $121.5 billion.  </P></p>

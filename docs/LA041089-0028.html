			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Berkeley Peace Wall, two slabs of concrete covered with painted ceramic  tiles, was dedicated as the Rev. Jesse Jackson told the crowd, "War will not  work." The wall, actually two 4-foot-tall semicircular concrete arcs in a patio  at Martin Luther King Jr. Park, was the brainchild of local artist Carolyn  Marks, who came up with the idea about five years ago and calls it a "basic  human family quilt." The tiles came from more than a dozen countries, including  the Soviet Union, and carry slogans and artwork aimed at promoting peace. One  tile reads "Peace through learning about each other;" another said "Humanity is  one." Some of the estimated 2,000 tiles were no so clearly peace-oriented. One  just said "Oakland A's", and another was simply a shadow portrait of two  children holding hands and jumping. About 2,000 people, from preschoolers to an  elderly woman wearing a Gray Panthers button, gathered to view the wall and  hear a parade of dignitaries, including Jackson, extol peace.  </P></p>

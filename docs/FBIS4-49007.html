			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Comment" page: "A Positive Message"] </F>   [Text] Lu Ping's snubbing of the Governor of Hong Kong on  his visit here next week sends a depressing message to the  people of the territory. It seems to say that China has no  interest in bridging the political divide. For the sake of an  insult, China is prepared to risk damaging its own credibility  as a calm and pragmatic sovereign power.    The snub is compounded by his decision to meet civil service  associations, although at least this shows he is prepared to  hear the views of those will be expected to make Hong Kong work  after 1997.    The main purpose of the visit--attending the ceremony  marking  the Bank of China's debut as a note-issuing bank here--shows the  Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office is also a man  who cares about the territory's economic well-being. He is  putting his anger at Britain's alleged perfidy aside and taking  part in one of the most important gestures of confidence in the  Sino-Hong Kong relationship either side has been prepared to  make since the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on the  Airport in July, 1991.    Whatever the tensions of the political relationship, the  Bank  of China's new role is more than just a symbol of the return to  Chinese sovereignty. The bank has acquired the prestige of  being one of the three institutions privileged to issue notes  and has the prospect of becoming the main note-issuer in years  to come. But it also has accepted responsibilities and  obligations. It has taken on a commitment to helping maintain  Hong Kong's economic equilibrium.    In an ironic twist not intended when Hong Kong agreed to the  note-issuing function in 1991 (when the political through train  was rocking dangerously but still on track) the bank's new role  shows that the economic through-train is still firmly on the  rails.    With the growing economic integration between Hong Kong and  Southern China, and the large volumes of Hong Kong currency in  circulation there, the Bank of China's higher profile in the  territory is no more than a belated recognition of China's  existing economic role here.  <H5>  Reaffirm Commitment </H5>   Mr Lu's decision to officiate at the note-issuing ceremony  is  an ideal opportunity for him to reaffirm China's commitment to  making that integration work still more efficiently, for the  benefit of both sides.    His visit, coupled with his less than diplomatic behaviour  towards Mr Patten, is symbolic of China's much-vaunted  determination to separate politics from economics. It is  symbolic, too, of its commitment, three years before the change  of sovereignty, to ensuring a smooth economic transition.    Symbols alone, however, are not enough. Despite the pious  phrases from both sides about the need to knuckle down to  business as if the political impasse did not exist, their  inaction has often spoken louder than their words.    Hong Kong is still waiting, with a patience born of  necessity, for agreement on the airport and rail link financing  package. Yet almost three years have passed since the signature  of the Airport MOU [Memorandum of Understanding], which was  supposed to put an end to the squabbling.  <H5>  Watching Helplessly </H5>   Hong Kong is still hoping for a resolution of the row over  Container Terminal 9, although the delay is already threatening  to affect the territory's economic prospects.    Hong Kong is still watching helplessly while the stalling  over international air service agreements erodes confidence in  its future as an aviation hub and undermines the public's  confidence in the viability of Chek Lap Kok.    Aside from the CT9 [Container Terminal 9] row, co-operation  within the Sino-British Land Commission has been excellent. But  in the Joint Liaison Group, where economic and political matters  are intertwined, progress has been painfully slow.    It is the infrastructure row, however, that has been a  particular hobby-horse of Mr Lu's ever since Sir David Wilson  announced his Port and Airport Development Strategy [PADS] as a  confidence-boosting measure in October, 1989. In Mr Lu's memory  of the period, it was the announcement of PADS, without prior  consultation with China, which marked a serious deterioration of  the Sino-British relationship. Yet that misunderstanding was  supposed to have been cleared up by the Airport MOU.    Mr Lu long ago recognised the value of Hong Kong's economic  and infrastructural developments to China and to the expansion  of its role as a gateway and service hub to the entire region.    It is time Mr Lu gave some new positive impetus to the  economic development of the territory and the region it serves  by overcoming the psychological hurdle the airport seems to  represent for him and giving the go-ahead for these much needed  projects.    Next week's note issuing ceremony would be the perfect  occasion for such a bold new initiative. And that would be the  most positive message he could give the people of Hong Kong.</p>

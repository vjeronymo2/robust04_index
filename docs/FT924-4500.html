			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Row over Lamont's legal fees continues LABOUR kept up the pressure on the government over Mr Norman Lamont's personal legal costs yesterday by demanding that the prime minister should consult parliament over new guidelines on the use of public funds. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, argued that the decision by the National Audit Office, the independent watchdog on government spending, to hold an investigation into the payment, and the fact that the NAO had not been told specifically about it, meant that there was an urgent need for new ministerial guidelines. In a letter to the chancellor Mr Brown also said that Mr Lamont should have consulted the law officers before taking action last year through his private solicitors, and asked for a note of what their advice had been. The rules for ministers stated that the law officers should be consulted before ministers' own solicitors, so that they could express a view about how far the public interest was involved or take charge of the proceedings, he said. The row arose from Mr Lamont's action last year to evict a self-styled 'sex therapist' from his London home. Mr Brown also queried what information was provided to the National Audit Office. The NAO's investigation into the Pounds 4,700 government contribution to the Pounds 23,000 legal bill was announced on Monday. The National Audit Office said yesterday that the terms of its inquiry were into 'the basis behind the payment; how the amount was apportioned; and the way the money was accounted for'.</p>

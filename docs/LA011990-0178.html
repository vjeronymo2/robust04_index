			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN OFFICIAL WAFFLES ON RICE  </P> <P> Japan should continue to ban rice imports, the trade minister said today,  reversing comments he made Thursday that the ban violated the spirit of free  trade.  </P> <P> "Japan's refusal to import any rice at all cannot be understood abroad and  contradicts GATT's (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) goal of a free  trading system," Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Hikaru  Matsunaga said in Tokyo on Thursday.  </P> <P> But today Matsunaga said Japan should continue its ban on rice imports to  maintain self-reliance.  </P> <P> He said that he made his earlier comments to explain how difficult it is to  reach an agreement on the agricultural trade issue outside Japan and that he  did not mean Japan should liberalize its rice market.  </P> <P> Matsunaga's comments Thursday spurred considerable criticism in Japan,  especially within his own party, the ruling Liberal Democrats.  </P></p>

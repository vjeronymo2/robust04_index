			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> SCAVENGING BANNED AT RECYCLING BINS  </P> <P> The City Council has approved an ordinance prohibiting scavenging from  recycling bins that will be used for the city's curbside recycling program that  begins next month.  </P> <P> "We had to take the precaution," said Mayor Christian W. Keena.  </P> <P> "We had some concerns about people going through the city in trucks and  emptying the curbside bins."  </P> <P> Those violating the ordinance would be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a  fine and jail time, said Damian Hopp, assistant city manager. Other county  cities, including Irvine, have adopted similar municipal laws.  </P> <P> Income from sale of recycled materials will help pay for the program, which is  scheduled to begin Dec. 17, said City Manager Fred Sorsabal.  </P> <P> "With the scavenging ordinance we are establishing a means of dealing with a  potential abuse of the recycling program if action becomes necessary," he  said.FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

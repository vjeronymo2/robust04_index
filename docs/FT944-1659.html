			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / International Company News: Burlington raises bid for Santa Fe The stakes in the contested bid for the Santa Fe Pacific railroad were raised yesterday with an increased offer from Burlington Northern valuing Santa Fe at Dollars 3.8bn in cash and shares. The bid is a sharp increase on the offer from rival railroad company Union Pacific of around Dollars 3.2bn in cash and shares. Burlington and Santa Fe said they would both make cash tenders for Santa Fe stock, amounting to around a third of the equity, at Dollars 20 a share. Thereafter Burlington would offer a stock swap for the remainder of Santa Fe's equity. Whereas the cash element of the transaction would take place next month, the stock swap would not take place until government approval of the merger. The offer from Union Pacific, although lower, has the advantage of having been provisionally cleared by the authorities. Its offer is allowed to proceed immediately, with Santa Fe's shares being placed in an independent trust pending official clearance. Santa Fe also said its agreed deal with Burlington involved a poison pill payment to Burlington of up to Dollars 60m if the agreement fell through. Santa Fe said it would repay Dollars 400m of its outstanding debt.</p>

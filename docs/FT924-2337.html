			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Records: CDs for 30somethings - An ever-widening classical range WHAT TO do when the kids are shut away in another room with the latest Nintendo blockbuster? They say the over-35s are the least likely group to spend their money on video games and the record companies certainly seem to be waking up to that fact: this year has brought an ever wider range of classical music on to the CD market. The major achievement in 1992 has been the completion of the series devoted to Purcell's Odes and Welcome Songs by The King's Consort. I do not know if this enterprise was intended as the beginning of a long-term retrospective of the composer's work, but it has turned out that way. As Purcell's tercentenary year approaches in 1995, other large-scale projects (including the same company's choral music series) look set to follow its lead. In the end, the complete set of Odes (Hyperion CDS 44031/8) has stretched to eight volumes. Most include works never previously recorded, of which this year's Volume 7 (CDA 66587) has some particularly good examples. All are typical 17th-century ceremonial pieces, written with wit, grace and invention to amuse their audiences. If only the custom of greeting individual members of the royal family with 'welcome songs' had lived on; whatever would today's poets and composers make of such a delightful duty? Another project well underway is EMI's undertaking to issue all of Elgar's electric recordings on CD. Two volumes have appeared so far (EMI CDS 754560-2 and CDS 754564-2) and both make highly recommendable purchases. The sound, dating from the 1920s, is far better than one might expect thanks to the quality of these CD transfers and no subsequent performances have ever equalled the exhilaration of hearing Elgar conducting his own music. What can too often sound heavy and ponderous today was never meant like that at all. At first, it may come as a surprise to hear the composer himself slice ten minutes off the usual duration of the Enigma Variations, but delight soon takes over, as today's listener gets into the spirit of it all. That comes on the second volume; Volume 1 contains the symphonies and is the essential buy of the two. A series which still has a lot further to go is the Hyperion Schubert Edition. This has arguably been its most successful year to date. Some of the best-known singers in the series so far have been discovering some of the lesser-known Schubert songs. Individual volumes, each offering a programme of manageable size, are easily the best way of coming to know and love this unrivalled song treasury. Both Thomas Hampson's theme of classical antiquity (Hyperion CDJ 33014) and Margaret Price's songs of sunset (CDJ 33015) make very rewarding CDs. A couple of the duets on Hampson's disc remind me that the unforgettable collection of Schubert duets by Janet Baker and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau has re-appeared, though with the dull vocal trios and quartets added to make a double-CD pack (DG 435 596-2). A brief recommendation also for the latest volume of the Gershwin musicals, Lady, Be Good] (Elektra Nonesuch 7559-79308-2), a 1920s show, which includes the song 'Fascinating Rhythm' and echoes of the charleston. That would set the toes tapping over Christmas. The new opera sets have generally been less exciting, but after a gap of about a decade Massenet suddenly seems to be in favour again. His Cherubin, the further adventures of Mozart's Cherubino, had its first ever recording this year. The story is pretty weak, but as soon as he comes across a passage with amorous leanings, Massenet is able to turn up the heat under the music's collar. The cast, including Frederica von Stade in trousers yet again as the lusty young hero, is starry (RCA 09026-60593-2). Finally, a choice that looks to the past and the future. Tchaikovsky was composer of the year at the Edinburgh Festival just gone and Mariss Jansons the most exciting conductor there. We did not actually get Jansons in The Nutcracker, but EMI's new recording (CDS 754 600-2) has remedied that - ideal music for the festive season and a foretaste of 1993, the centenary of the composer's death. By next Christmas you probably will not want to hear another note of Tchaikovsky ever again.</p>

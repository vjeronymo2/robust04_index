			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market tests support GOLD'S PRICE dipped briefly below Dollars 348 a troy ounce in London yesterday, a psychologically-important level because some technical analysts suggest the metal will suffer a substantial fall, perhaps to below Dollars 300, if it is conclusively breached. On this occasion the price recovered to close in London at Dollars 348.90, down 80 cents from Friday. 'Gold has not been seriously below Dollars 350 an ounce since the mid-1980s, so chartists have drawn their lines at about Dollars 347.50,' said Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at stockbroker Durlacher &amp; Company. 'If the price does not hold at Dollars 347.50, they feel that bear raiders might try to push the price down another Dollars 20 or so.' However, Mr Coulson pointed out that gold's price had been falling for the past 12 years 'so it is a pretty tired bear market. I would not want to bet big money on trying to push it further down.' Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, also said yesterday's price slip was not likely to precipitate a substantial fall. Middle East gold market participants were out of the market during the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan, which had just started. In six of the past seven years during Ramadan, gold's price was 1 per cent lower than in the previous month and the trading range had narrowed.</p>

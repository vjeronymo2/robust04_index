In second place,  according to the research, would be the Civic Democratic  Alliance (ODA) with 14 percent of the vote. The Czech Social  Democratic Party (CSSD) would gain 13 percent, the Communist  Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) 9 percent and the Christian  Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) 6 percent.    Those parties winning less than 5 percent of the vote -- the  cutoff for parliamentary representation -- would be the radical  right-wing Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican  Party (SPR-RSC) with 4 percent, the Free Democrats (SD --  formerly the Civic Movement) with 2.5 percent, the  Moravian-Silesian Centrist Party (MSS -- formerly the Movement  for Self-Governing Democracy for Moravia and Silesia) with 2  percent, and the Greens and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS)  with 1.5 percent each.    The four parties making up the current governing coalition  are the ODS, the ODA, the KDU-CSL, and the KDS.    The research indicated that 63 percent of eligible voters  would take part in the elections, while 14 percent would  definitely not vote and 23 percent are still undecided. The  ODS, the KDU-CSL, and the KSCM show the greatest stability of  voter preference. The CSSD has experienced a drop in  popularity, while the ODA has gained favor among voters.  Supporters of the ODS are the most strongly convinced of their  preference, and 83 percent would vote in elections.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Philippines congress agrees to IMF terms THE Philippine government is to ask the International Monetary Fund to release Dollars 250m under a suspended financing programme after congress approved measures to cover the projected budget deficit. In its final session under the government of President Corazon Aquino, congress passed five of the six remaining tax enhancement measures sought by the administration. Approval of the measures provided the government with new sources of finance which will almost cover the projected budget deficit for 1992 of Pesos 27.4bn. Failure of the senate to pass a bill proposing refinements in the value-added tax system left a gap of Pesos 1bn. The bill was designed to expand the scope of VAT coverage, but finance officials said it was felt the measure would effectively create new taxes, a politically unpalatable move in an election year. Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary, said, however, that the remaining gap could be covered with proceeds from the sale last week of state-owned Philippine Airlines. Mr Estanislao also said a proposal to override Mrs Aquino's veto on a budget provision to limit foreign-debt payments to 10 per cent of export earnings was 'dead'. He claimed the last-minute support for the tax measures 'came from all party lines'. Mr Estanislao expressed confidence that the IMF would formally approve the release of the credit 'by Monday'. Mr Jose Cuisia, the governor of the central bank of the Philippines, was waiting for the IMF response before leaving for New York. The Philippines is seeking to restructure Dollars 5.3bn of commercial debt. The release of the IMF's credit should reactivate talks between Philippine debt negotiators and its bank creditors. It should also pave the way for a meeting of a consultative group of the country's traditional donor-countries next March in Hong Kong. That meeting is not intended to be a pledging session, but Mr Estanislao said: 'We will not stop anybody making pledges.'</p>

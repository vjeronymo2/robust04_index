[see 28 March  Terrorism Report]    A high-ranking officer serving in north Cyprus claimed that  the assassination of Yeoryiadhis, the head of the Committee for  Solidarity With Kurdistan and of the Greek Cypriot information  department, was planned by the Public Security Unit (KGB)  attached to the Presidency of the General Staff.

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / South African Elections: Radical policies alienate whites - PAC One thing is certain about any assessment of the appeal of the Pan Africanist Congress, led by Mr Clarence Makwetu: it will not win white votes. Its radical economic policy  - which stresses the need for a redistribution of farmland, the 'One settler one bullet' slogan which the party's leadership has yet convincingly to disavow  - and the killing of several whites last year by the military wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army, confines its appeal almost exclusively to black South Africans, and the unemployed youth in particular. The PAC, which broke away from the ANC in 1959, may be biding its time, accepting that it will make at best a modest showing in this week's poll  - few observers predict more than 5 per cent  - but keeping its powder dry, so to speak. Senior officials argue that the new government, almost certain to be dominated by the ANC, will not be able to deliver on its promises. It will also emerge, says the PAC, as a party that has entered into an unholy pact with the white minority, with senior ANC leaders settling down into a comfortable life and alienating their followers. Support for the PAC outside the townships comes mainly from the eastern Cape, home of the black consciousness movement which was so influential in the 1970s and in which the party has its roots. Its greatest potential is in the former homeland of Transkei, where several APLA bases exist thanks to the tolerance of Maj Gen Bantu Holomisa. His stance enhanced his credentials but the former homeland leader chose to give his support to Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader who, like many other ANC officials, was born in the Xhosa-speaking region. Gen Holomisa has succeeded in turning the region into something approaching a no-go area for all but the most intrepid of campaigners other than those of the ANC.</p>

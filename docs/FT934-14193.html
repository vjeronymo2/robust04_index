			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (5): Where modesty is out of place / Company profile of EDS Unigraphics IN 1989, the Indian company Bharat Forge, which makes automotive components ranging from axle beams to steering knuckles, decided it wanted to introduce Cadcam (computer aided design and manufacturing) software to support its die design and manufacturing activities. Now, having taken the plunge into Cadcam, Bharat is claiming to be among the world's five most technically advanced commercial forge shops. It is modelling the dies on screen and then machining them directly, using numerical control programs generated by the Cam process. Bharat has reduced its tooling develop- ment time from six to two months, and has improved the speed and accuracy of its machining. When Bharat selected its Cadcam system the range of choices available in India was limited. But it is a nice accolade for its supplier, EDS Unigraphics, that Bharat says it would still opt for it even though several more Cadcam packages are now available. Apart from being an encouraging sign of how the importance of Cadcam is being increasingly recognised in the industrialising countries, the story is also an illustration of EDS Unigraphics' global strength. There is no place for modesty in the market for selling computers and software to industry, and EDS Uni- graphics says it 'provides the most comprehensive Cadcam/cae (computer-aided engineering) offerings available and leads the market in the breadth of its related products and services. The Unigraphics system is a major manufacturing tool for aerospace and automotive industries and is used in producing a wide range of industrial equipment and consumer goods. Along with many Cadcam companies, it has had a chequered past, but the key recent event came in 1991 when the EDS subsidiary of General Motors bought McDonnell Douglas Systems Integration in the US and the Cadcam side of McDonnell Douglas Information Systems outside the US, acquiring in the process the Unigraphics product range. Mr Jim Duncan, general manager for EDS Unigraphics in Europe, says EDS knew a lot about Unigraphics because of the participation of McDonnell Douglas in GM's C4 project, an internal engineering and design initiative. EDS had also been successful in industries such as banking, insurance and health, but less so in manufacturing, which was and remains the great strength of Unigraphics. Further reorganisation followed, and research spending has risen sharply under the new owners. According to a recent study of the company by Mr Dave Weisberg in Engineering Automation Report, initial fears about the merger have proved unfounded. One concern was that Uni- graphics would focus on the needs of GM, giving a lower priority to other customers. In fact, says Mr Weisberg, current product development and business activities clearly indicate that EDS Unigraphics are quite interested in pursuing traditional Cadcam markets. EDS has also avoided one of the big mistakes that can be made in acquiring a high-tech company, and has not made large-scale personnel replacements or changed the personality of the company. Mr John Mazzola is still president and most of the key Unigraphics people are still in place. The key strategic development since the takeover has been the repositioning of the company to offer a much broader range of services than is the norm for a Cadcam vendor. The aim is to satisfy customers' current need to view product modelling via Cad as an one element of the entire business process rather than simply a means to raise productivity in the design department. Apart from product modelling, therefore, the company has three other closely inter-related areas of activity. Because concurrent engineering requires unrestricted data sharing and systems that can operate with each other, EDS Unigraphics produces a software tool called Information Manager which manages product and process definition data throughout the product life cycle, and makes sure information reaches the right people at the right time. It also offers the EDS advanced computing and communications technology to make the product modelling and product data management more valuable. Finally, there is a collaborative approach to enable companies to develop their products and processes, including expert help on process engineering and productivity. Overall, EDS Unigraphics rather grandly calls this its Unique Perspective on Productivity. The aim, says Mr Duncan, is for the company to secure its future as one of perhaps only four or five global players in the Cadcam market. And that means being global in a geographic sense too, while recognising the differences between industries and countries and avoiding the dangers of becoming over-centralised. 'So much of our business comes from multinationals,' says Mr Duncan. 'Unless a vendor can support the customers in all the countries where it is operating, it won't stay in the premier league of suppliers.' Mr Duncan says EDS Unigraphics is experiencing a healthy year in a difficult business environment. In a European market forecast to grow by 4 per cent this year, the value of orders received in the first half of the year grew by more than 10 per cent, compared with the same period of 1992. 'The business has benefited enormously from the new global organisation,' he says. But the company is happy to admit that even with the muscle of EDS, and, ultimately, GM behind it, it cannot do everything itself. Accordingly, it has formed several strategic partnerships with smaller companies which Mr Duncan calls 'best in class' companies, such as ICAD with its Knowledge-based Engineering software. Some of these relationships are acquiring new importance this year because of the launch by EDS Unigraphics of V10 - the 10th version of its Unigraphics Cadcam software. This involves much more than the usual incremental improvements found in new versions of software and is the result, says the company, of constant probing for ways to help manufacturers bring products to market faster, more cost-effectively and with built-in quality. Features include the ability to switch between different design processes, such as wireframe, surfaces and 3D solids, and a new easy-to-use Motif-based user interface. V10 was launched in May, and is the most important result so far of the increased R&amp;D spending since EDS took over. Last month, in a significant development that was a response to the wishes of EDS Unigraphics customers, the company said that V10 is being 'ported for,' or made to run on, workstations made by Silicon Graphics, one of the leading 3D graphics workstation vendors. On the near horizon for EDS Unigraphics is the full implementation of a concept called virtual product development, which is related to one of the current buzz-phrases in US corporate-speak, the 'virtual' factory or corporation. This is the trend for companies to form ever-shifting relationships with other corporations without geographic barriers, getting a job or part of a job done wherever it can be done best and quickest, and cutting out the fixed cost of a heavy infrastructure. Virtual product development is similar in that it means people from different companies and countries will work concurrently, and even on an ad hoc basis, to design and manufacture products. The key to the success of such an idea is a communication network which can distribute information about the product electronically - which is why EDS Unigraphics believes there is so much more to Cadcam than just throwing out the drawing tables.</p>

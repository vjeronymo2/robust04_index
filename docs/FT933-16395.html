			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Three-year leaders - Offshore Bond Funds THE TABLE shows the 10 largest offshore sterling denominated fixed interest funds with a three year performance record. The funds shown are recognised by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief regulator for the financial services industry in the UK. Some, such as Hambros EMMA sterling bond fund and Gartmore's Capital Strategy Sterling fund are sub-funds of umbrella funds. The funds are quoted on an offer-to-offer price which measures the performance in terms of the change in the price at which the units or shares were bought. It does not take charges into account because some funds have a single price but add a charge. Quoting on this basis gives an enhanced performance figure, compared with onshore funds.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                Largest 10 offshore sterling bond funds  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                          Size           Yield????

He was elected  by 78 votes for him and one vote against. Marie-Jose Niyonziman  has the details of the proceedings which led to the election:    [Begin Niyonziman recording] There was a continuation this  evening of the ordinary session which began on 4 October and was  interrupted on 21 October following the events which took place  in Burundi. On the agenda was the election of the head of state.    The election of Cyprien Ntaryamira as president of the  Republic took place in the presence of all members of the  government and the diplomatic and consular corps. Of 81  representatives, 76 were present. The election is the result of  two days of consultations carried out by Prime Minister Sylvie  kinigi with political, moral, and social forces to find a  resolution to the crisis in Burundi.    On behalf of the Union for National Progress [Uprona]  parliamentary group, Jean-Baptiste Manwangari briefed the guests  and the National Assembly on the evolution of contacts carried  out during the two days. The central objective was the drafting  of a schedule and the management of the administration and  security services, especially for political and ethnic  minorities. They also agreed on the profile of the candidate,  who would have to be a person who brings together and reassures  all the components of Burundi. There was also agreement on the  creation of openness in provincial and communal administrations.  The personalities involved in the massacres would not be  allowed to join them.    During the talks, there was a decision on a political truce,  during which some political activities are to be suspended. It  is worth recalling the freeing of public media, the creation of  a framework for dialogue, and the current election of the  president. At the moment, as I speak to you, the ceremonies are  continuing at Kigobe. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (1): Survivors from the storm - Many companies are producing better and more competitively priced products thanks to technical and managerial innovation and workforce flexibility.  This issue of Ingenuity examines changes in the UK and other parts of Europe / The state of the industry Any hard-pressed engineering company executive wondering whether it is worth putting years of effort into developing successful businesses while staving off recession and adapting to change would have found some answers at a birthday party in Cambridgeshire last month. The occasion was the silver jubilee of the Caparo Group, the steel and engineering products business built up by Dr Swraj Paul from a small company in Huntingdon - hence the lunch in nearby St. Ives, attended by the local MP, Mr John Major, the Prime Minister. Dr Paul began with Pounds 5,000 in 1968 and has built Caparo into one of the largest family-owned businesses in the UK, basically by adding value through turning steel into engineered products such as fabrications, forgings and fasteners. 'There are those who once wrote off the steel business and advised against continued investment in it,' said Dr Paul. 'I think we have proved that there is no such thing as a bad business, there is only bad management. Times may be difficult and conditions may be adverse, but managers with skill and with faith in human resources will always be able to prosper.' Dr Paul said the importance of Mr Major's attendance went well beyond celebrating Caparo's success. It signified the Prime Minister's direct endorsement of a 'vision in which we all participate - the revival of prosperous, modern British manufacturing'. Mr Major, in turn, made it clear where he stood on the importance of manufacturing. 'There are some who regard manufacturing as almost marginal, and some who regard it as fundamental,' he said. 'I take my stand with the second school. I don't regard manufacturing as a cinderella industry - making things matters.' Mr Major's remarks must have been a relief to people in engineering who endured the 1980s when service industries were all the rage and must have wondered if an incumbent of 10 Downing Street would ever talk like that again. Even so, there are many who still feel the government is only paying lip service to the importance of the engineering industry. The Prime Minister also talked about the success, innovation, skill and far-sighted judgment he had seen as he went round manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities in the UK. Too little is heard of some of these remarkable successes, he complained. Today's second FT Ingenuity Survey chronicles some of the success stories in the UK engineering industry as companies use innovation, in the form of new products and new manufacturing methods, to enhance their productivity and competitiveness. It looks, for example, at new product development at the six engineering companies which the FT has recently been tracking out of the recession. It also includes examples from continental countries such as Germany and Sweden, where the phrase 'making things matters' is taken as read but important changes are underway as engineering companies react to new circumstances. In Germany, for example, the changes in manufacturing and organisation at Siemens are an attempt to mitigate the effects of high labour costs by further exploiting the advantages of manufacturing in Germany - notably a highly-skilled workforce. The survey also looks at the suppliers of equipment to engineering companies  -notably machine tools and robots - and what they are doing to help customers increase their productivity, and hence profits. This is perhaps of crucial importance in the UK, where the decline in the manufacturing and engineering base over the past 15 years makes it all the more important that what is left is internationally competitive, even world class. As Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industries, said in a lecture last month at the City University, the UK's manufacturing base has declined more and faster than those of other countries. In 1960, the UK accounted for 16.5 per cent of world trade in manufactures, while Germany had 19.3 per cent and France had 9.6 per cent. By 1990, the UK share had fallen to 8.6 per cent while Germany's rose to 20.2 per cent and France's edged up to 9.7 per cent. The Japanese made the biggest gains during the period but the US lost only about a quarter of its share while the UK's fell by nearly half. Mr Davies described engineering's contribution to the decline as significant, with a third of the sectors that make up engineering moving into a trade deficit during the 1980s, joining the one sixth that were already showing a negative balance. The decline in the manufacturing base has had two important effects, he said: first, a very significant change in the shape of the economy is likely to leave a large number of casualties in its wake, and secondly, the UK has found it difficult to benefit from the newly-growing areas of the world economy. With the emergence of new competitive threats from low-wage economies, Mr Davies foresees two significant pressures on the engineering industry. First, even though wages in industrialising nations will not stay at the current levels as the aspirations of their populations rise, there will be cost pressure, especially on manufacturing wages. Secondly, he says, 'we will face an absolute requirement to upskill our workforces and move up the value chain. We will need to compete not just on cost, which will be difficult if not impossible to do, but also on the quality of our product, its design, its marketing, and overall, its inventiveness. Engineering will play a key role in that upskilling, upgrading process.' Evidence from the battlefield in the engineering sector confirms these pressures: negotiating price increases is virtually a thing of the past, and there is constant pressure to reduce costs and yet increase quality and service in the supply chain. Hence the efforts to improve processes and - to use modern management-speak  -to 're-engineer' engineering. The process will continue irrespective of short-term market conditions. Fortunately, the evidence from this Survey shows that the re-engineering is occurring throughout the engineering industry, and not just in the automotive and aerospace sectors where many of the best ideas in world class manufacturing first take root. Clearly, engineering companies are taking the view that their long-term competitiveness relies as much on their own efforts as it does on the creation by the Government of the conditions in which manufacturing can prosper. There is still plenty more to be done, of course. But one of the most encouraging things to emerge from this Survey is the extent to which the acceptance of the need to improve has permeated all levels of engineering companies. Energised by teamwork, shopfloor workers are making their contribution by coming up with suggestions for improvement. Even five years ago, most would have said that was a job only for management.</p>

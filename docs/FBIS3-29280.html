			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] On 15 February, North Korea officially notified  that it will accept full-scope [chonmyon] inspection of seven  nuclear facilities as demanded by the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA]. Therefore, full-scope inspection on North  Korea is expected to be resumed from early next week at the  earliest.    North Korea held working-level contacts with the IAEA on two  occasions on the afternoon of 15 February, and officially  notified that it will accept the IAEA's full-scope inspection of  its seven nuclear facilities.    The IAEA revealed that the resumption of the full-scope  inspection on North Korea is to closely examine whether North  Korea diverted the nuclear material of its seven nuclear  facilities for military purposes since normal [chongsang]  inspection on North Korea has been suspended since February  1993. The inspection team plans to carry out a series of  inspection activities including the overall replacement of  monitoring devices and replacement of sealing devices to  safeguard the continuity of the inspection which has been  damaged.    With the acceptance of the full-scope inspection by North  Korea, the IAEA notified the North Korean side by letter that it  will dispatch the inspection team as soon as procedures are  completed for the team to visit North Korea. If North Korea  actively cooperates in the inspection team's preparations to  visit North Korea, the inspection team consisting of six or  seven people will be able to go to Pyongyang sometime this  weekend and thus carry out inspection activities in Yongbyon  from early next week when the IAEA Board of Governor's meeting  takes place.    Counselor Yun Ho-chin, the working-level delegate of the  North Korean side, said that the decision to accept the  full-scope inspection was made with utmost flexibility by the  North Korean side to achieve denuclearization on the Korean  peninsula and was achieved by making concessions with the IAEA.</p>

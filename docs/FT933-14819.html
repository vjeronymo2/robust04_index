			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Serb forces tighten grip on UN 'safe area' SERB forces yesterday seized the strategic village of Trnovo to the west of Gorazde in an effort to tighten their stranglehold on the Moslem enclave proclaimed a United Nations 'safe area'. Bosnian Serb fighters yesterday celebrated what they called the 'liberation' of Trnovo and the seizure of the Rogoj mountain pass and surrounding villages. Radio Belgrade said General Ratko Mladic, the nationalist Serb commander, had personally conducted the campaign for Trnovo, 18 miles south of Sarajevo. The Bosnian capital is now even more vulnerable to its Serb besiegers on the surrounding hills. The latest Serb advance drives a wedge between Gorazde and Sarajevo, both Moslem enclaves supposedly under UN protection. At least 12 people were killed and 15 wounded in the Dobrinja area of the capital when a Serb mortar exploded in a crowd queueing for water. Serb forces have cut supplies of water, electricity and fuel. The water supply is about a half litre per person each day. Fighting intensified in most parts of Bosnia, according to local media reports. Radio Sarajevo said the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) was deploying reinforcements to Mostar, the southwestern city. It said the Moslem-held towns of Fojnica, Jablanica and Konjic were under Croat attack. A British UN soldier was wounded near Gornji Vakuf, central Bosnia, when his vehicle hit a mine on an aid route. Serbian radio said Moslem fighters had 'retreated in panic leaving behind scores of dead and large quantities of weapons and ammunition. . . . These successful activities dealt a serious blow to the Moslem forces, smashing their dream of linking by violent means through centuries old Serbian territory.' Moslems comprised 69 per cent of the 6,900 population of Trnovo. As the international community tries to press the Bosnian presidency to accept the republic's ethnic partition, Serb forces are pushing to enlarge their state, which covers some 70 per cent of Bosnia. Croats, too, are consolidating territory for their ethnic mini-state. A Bosnian Serb army statement yesterday claimed its offensive was prompted by Moslem attempts to widen a corridor used to transport supplies to tens of thousands of Moslems trapped in Gorazde. Hopes for progress at the Geneva peace talks were made more remote after bilateral talks broke down between Zagreb officials and Serb rebels from Croatia. Croatia plans to set up a pontoon bridge on July 18 which Serbs have vowed to destroy raising fears of the re-ignition of the war. Britain said yesterday it was increasing its bilateral aid to Bosnia by more than 50 per cent, giving an extra Pounds 18.5m for food, logistical assistance and infrastructure projects, Reuter reports. Baroness Chalker, overseas development minister, made the announcement after a meeting in London with Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Islamic foreign ministers meeting yesterday promised more than 7,600 troops for a UN protection force in Bosnia, a spokesman said. He declined to name which of the 16 countries at the two-day meeting in Islamabad made the offers.</p>

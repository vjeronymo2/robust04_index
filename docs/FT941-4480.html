			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Spanish MPs in voting row Spain's parliament was suspended for two hours yesterday amid angry accusations from opposition deputies that ruling socialists had voted more than once during a debate on labour reforms. The house was voting on opposition amendments to the government's labour reforms, which sparked a 24-hour general strike earlier this year. The opposition Popular party lost the amendments by just two votes, but said socialists had voted for absent colleagues by secretly pushing the buttons which electronically register the votes. Deputies stamped and hissed when it was revealed that six more votes were counted in one ballot than in the next. The matter was referred to the House Committee who will investigate the charges of vote-rigging. Reuter, Madrid.</p>

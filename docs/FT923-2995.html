			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Wilson rejects pacts A VIGOROUS warning that the Liberal Democrats should resist 'siren calls' for any form of political realignment came yesterday from Mr Des Wilson, who was the party's campaigns co-ordinator during the April general election, Alison Smith writes. At a party rally last night, Mr Wilson said that it was politically unrealistic to discuss deals with other parties, given the Labour party's present attitude. It represented a destructive waste of time that should be spent discussing policies that were important, and also denied the party's historic role as 'the upholder of principle in politics.' 'What's the point of compromising so much to get power that you haven't the freedom to do what's right when you've got it?' he asked. He condemned the Labour party for reacting too readily to election defeats by trying to become an even safer option to the electorate than the Conservatives. Mr Wilson hinted that the speech after the general election in which Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, raised the possibility of dialogue with other parties, might have been an error. He rejected the idea that disappointment with the election result might have given rise to talk about co-operation with other organisations. Instead, Mr Wilson - who left his unpaid post with the party after the election - insisted that the party's 'success' in winning 20 seats and just under 20 per cent of the popular vote across the country was consistent with the 'outside hope' throughout the planning and carrying out of the campaign. He urged the party to retain its independence and ability to face up to difficult questions. Much like a pressure group, he said, having a platform and organisation from which to campaign could lead to changes even without conventional political power.</p>

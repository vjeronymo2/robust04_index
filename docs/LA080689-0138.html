			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Crime across the nation jumped 3% last year -- rising to more than five  offenses for every 100 U.S. residents -- with murder and rapes increasing more  than cases of arson and theft, the FBI said. In its annual "Crime in the United  States" report, the FBI compared figures to 1987 and showed the number of  crimes known to law enforcement authorities was 17% higher than five years ago  and 14% above the level a decade ago. Violent crime was up 6% overall from  1987, with each offense in that category increasing. Property crime such as  arson, larceny and motor vehicle theft climbed a slower 3%, and burglary  declined slightly. An estimated 13.8 million arrests were made for all crimes  other than traffic violations, a 1% increase from 1987, the FBI said.  Authorities resolved 46% of the violent crimes.  </P></p>

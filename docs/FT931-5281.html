			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading LONDON's enthusiastic reception for the easing in repurchase rates in Germany was fully reflected in the derivates markets yesterday, writes Terry Byland. The March contract on the FT-SE Index continued to show its strong premium against the cash market. Trading volume was reduced somewhat, but the market stood up well to a bout of selling by one source. News of the Bundesbank's move came soon after the opening of the stock index future, and the March contract quickly soared to a day's high of 2,938, holding a 13 point premium against the underlying Footsie. The seller then drove the contract all the way down to 2,908 but the 2,900 mark was safely held. The final official quotation of 2,931 showed the contract at a premium of around 9 points to cash, with the fair value calculation at a four point discount. Dealers reported renewed activity on the spread now showing between March and the June contract. Of total volume of around 8,400 contracts some 1,500 deals reflected intra-contract spread trading.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DEFENSE PUTS PISTONS BACK ON WINNING TRACK, 104-99  </P> <P> Having lost four consecutive road games, the Detroit Pistons sought a return to  their winning ways by concentrating on defense.  </P> <P> Piston Coach Chuck Daly told his players if they held the Atlanta Hawks under  100 points Thursday night, Detroit almost could be assured of getting back on  track.  </P> <P> Mark Aguirre came off the bench to score 25 points and Isiah Thomas hit four  free throws in the final 31 seconds as the Pistons defeated the Hawks, 104-99,  at Atlanta.  </P> <P> "Everybody knows the Pistons play tough," Aguirre said. "We played tough  defensively down the stretch and we made some big shots."  </P> <P> Spud Webb brought the Hawks to within 100-98 with a three-point shot with 12  seconds left, but Bill Laimbeer made two free throws one second later to help  secure the victory.  </P> <P> Vinnie Johnson, starting in place of the injured Joe Dumars, played 43 minutes  and scored 20 points for the Pistons.  </P> <P> Dominique Wilkins led the Hawks with 17 points.  </P> <P> Chicago 111, Orlando 104 -- Michael Jordan scored 16 of his game-high 38 points  in the fourth quarter at Chicago, and the Bulls won their 50th game of the  season.  </P> <P> Otis Smith pulled the Magic to within 104-102 on a 17-foot jump shot with 1:27  left, but a basket by Jordan and free throw by Horace Grant clinched the  victory for the Bulls, who have won five games in a row and 12 of their last  14.  </P> <P> Smith scored a team-high 21 points for the Magic.  </P> <P> Seattle 101, Utah 91 -- Dana Barros and Sedale Threatt combined for 36 points  and led a late 10-0 run to lead the SuperSonics at Seattle.  </P> <P> John Stockton of the Jazz scored 23 points and had 12 assists, giving him 1,001  for the season. He became the first player in NBA history to have 1,000 or more  assists for three consecutive seasons.  </P> <P> Karl Malone had a game-high 26 points for the Jazz.  </P> <P> Threatt scored 19 points.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Savings Bank of Belarus issued a report for  Supreme Soviet consideration concerning [word indistinct] the  indexation of individual deposits. This document is a reply to  Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich's statement regarding the  necessity to issue 100 percent compensations for people's  depository losses prompted by inflation.    According to experts' estimates, over 1 trillion rubles is  required to cover the losses -- caused by the devaluation of  individual deposits -- by 100 percent. It goes without saying  that it is necessary to repay the population what it lost not  through its own will, believes Alyaksandr Barkun, deputy  chairman of the Savings Bank of Belarus. However, two issues --  by exactly what sum the deposits will be increased and who will  pay -- remain unresolved.</p>

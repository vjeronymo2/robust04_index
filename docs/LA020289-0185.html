			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DAY CARE FOR SICK CHILDREN;  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE HOSPITAL GIVES PARENTS ANOTHER OPTION -- DAY OR NIGHT  </P> <P> When Debbie Koslowsky's 6-year-old son Alex was too sick to go to school, she  would bring him to work to lie on the floor of her office at the West Valley  YMCA in Reseda, or she would stay home with him.  </P> <P> Since Northridge Hospital Medical Center opened its Kids Care program for  mildly sick children, she has another option, which she has used twice in the  past six weeks, when Alex had two cases of strep throat.  </P> <P> "The last time Alex was there, I was wondering if he could also have an ear  infection. The doctor checked Alex at no charge, which not only saved me the  trouble and the $44 cost of going to the pediatrician after work, but I knew  that if he had had a problem, I would have known about it early in the day,"  said Koslowsky, 38, a physical education director.  </P> <P> The Northridge Kids Care program, open since November, is set up to care for  mildly sick children, from 6 weeks to 15 years old, 24 hours a day, at a cost  of $3.25 per hour, or $2.75 for hospital employees.  </P> <P> The program, which operates as an outpatient service under Northridge's  hospital license, "does not accept children for Kids Care who have chicken pox,  lice, measles or high temperatures that are not responding to Tylenol," said  Cindy Albright, a registered nurse and coordinator for Kids Care. Parents do  not have to call ahead to say they are bringing a child in, but it is  encouraged, and pre-registration forms that include the child's medical history  help speed the 10-minute registration process.  </P> <P> One hospital staff nursing assistant is assigned to care for every four  children. Registered nurses oversee the care and give the necessary  medications, either over-the-counter drugs or medications already prescribed  for the child. Physicians from the hospital's UCLA Family Residency Program  examine the children each morning and notify parents if they find medical  problems that they think need more evaluation.  </P> <P> The Kids Care facilities, in the pediatric wing on the fifth floor of the  hospital, are divided into a quiet room, a crafts room and a kitchen. Most  children become involved in crafts, directed by a part-time child activities  coordinator, or take the video route, playing an ever-popular Nintendo game or  watching TV and videotapes. Some bring their own treasured blankets, backpacks,  books, dolls or other toys.  </P> <P> Carrie Reitz, 12, was recently at Kids Care after a night of high fever and an  upset stomach. Although Carrie was feeling better, her mother hesitated to let  her go to school. The day she was at Kids Care, she played with the other three  children there, who were from 1 to 8 years old.  </P> <P> Was it scary to come to a hospital for the day? "No," she said. "I wasn't real  sure when I came in. There's a lot of things to do. You can read books, help  the little kids color. . . . It's better than home."  </P> <P> Carrie's mother, Beverly, is a teacher at First Lutheran Pre-School across the  street from the hospital. "Parents who work tend to bring their children to the  nursery school even if the children are not 100%," she said. She thinks that  the hospital's program provides the added care and reassurance parents need to  leave their children to go to work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Started for Employees  </P> <P> According to Don Adams, administrator of Northridge Hospital, the Kids Care  program was started largely to attract and retain hospital employees.  Northridge Hospital and Valley Hospital Medical Center in Van Nuys, both owned  by Hospital Corp. of America, employ a total of 1,600 people, Adams said. The  center cares for an average of four or five children a day.  </P> <P> Two Los Angeles hospitals -- California Medical Center and Orthopaedic Hospital  -- have recently closed their sick-child care programs. Another, at Torrance  Memorial Medical Center, the model for Northridge's program, is going strong,  caring for an average of five to 18 children a day.  </P> <P> Patsy Lane, child-care coordinator for the city of Los Angeles, said closure of  these programs may be because "it's hard for people to bring an ill child to a  place that's relatively unfamiliar. It's a tough concept for parents to bring  their children for day care to a health-care facility."  </P> <P> Lane said the most successful sick-child care programs have been in suburban  areas, geographically and administratively connected to the sick child's  regular day-care or nursery school program. On a sick day, the child doesn't go  to an entirely different place, just to a different room or wing at the same  school. Rainbow Retreat, a day-care center run by a private company, has such a  setup in Irvine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Potential Risks  </P> <P> Are there risks involved in bringing a mildly ill child to a hospital setting  for care? Helen Lederer, an Encino pediatrician, said the question has yet to  be answered. But she thinks that the license requirements for such programs --  mildly ill day-care children are kept separate from hospital patients, and  employees who care for the day-care children do not also care for hospitalized  children -- minimize the risks.  </P> <P> "But the risks of sick-child care just haven't been delineated; it's an  emerging field that's now getting increasing attention," Lederer warned.  </P> <P> What is well-known, Lederer said, is that the demand for sick-child care is  tremendous. "Every day, at least four times a day, parents ask me: 'Can my  child go to school yet?' 'Is he ready to go back to day care?' The need is  there."  </P> <P> For parents who want their children to be cared for at home, availability and  cost can be an issue. The cost to have someone trained in basic nursing come to  your home to care for your child, according to the firm At Home Health in La  Canada, is $11 an hour for three to eight hours of care. A 12-hour shift runs  $154. And not all visiting nurse associations provide this type of care; most  provide nursing visits rather than all-day care.  </P> <P> At Kids Care, the children are sent home with a daily log sheet showing what  the child did, when he ate or slept, what medications were given and when, what  food was eaten and when, and other information related to the illness.  </P> <P> To receive a pre-registration packet on the Kids Care program at Northridge  Hospital, call (818) 885-5324. Although walk-in care, without pre-registration,  is provided, parents must provide proof of the child's immunization history.  </P></p>

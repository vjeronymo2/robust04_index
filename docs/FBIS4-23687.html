			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] After recent fierce fighting, the town of  Gitarama is entirely in the hands of the Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF]. Our colleague, Jean-Paul Habineza, reports.    [Begin Habineza recording] Gitarama is entirely in the hands  of the RPF. Fighting had been fierce of late in Gitarama.  After realizing that the RPF had captured Kabgayi, 2 to 3 km  from the town, government forces reinforced their positions with  additional troops mostly from Ruhengeri. They even lightly  pushed back the RPF. The RPF soldiers then surrounded Gitarama  town and closed all entry roads. The fighting increased. Some  government soldiers lost their lives while others fled.    The chief commander of the Rwandan Patriotic Army, Major  General Paul Kagame, said it was this morning that the RPF  clearly captured Gitarama town. Our friend Louise Kayibanda,  who sent us the news, informed us that she visited Murambi the  headquarters of the so-called government and said that the area  looked like a farm, so it is clear that the so-called government  left the place long ago. On the significance of capturing  Gitarama, Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame said the meaning was both  political and military. Politically, it is clear that the  government, which is continuously on the run, is useless.  Militarily, Paul Kagame said, this victory, along with others  shows that the RPF troops are doing well at the front. Paul  Kagame said the continuing fighting was aimed at stopping the  killings.

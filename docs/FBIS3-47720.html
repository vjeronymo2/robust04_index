According to sources at the foreign affairs department, the  OIC will not renege on its vow to help Mindanao on its path to  economic recovery, since it was convinced that President Ramos  is sincere in peacefully settling the decades-old Muslim  secessionist movement in the southern Philippines.    Earlier, a high-ranking OIC official, Secretary-General  Hamid  al- Gabid, had committed to the president during a meeting at  Malacanang that the 52-nation OIC would bring in investments to  Mindanao.    Officials said OlC's commitment to the Ramos administration  was a giant step in helping improve Mindanao's economy. The  commitment is also doubly significant, according to officials,  since the government's previous bids to seek the support of the  OIC to assist Mindanao, were fruitless.    Al-Gabid, however, has committed to the president the OIC  leadership's strong support for the Philippines' investments'  pitch during the annual OlC foreign ministers meeting which will  be held in Tunisia this April.    According to officials, al-Gabid had been satisfied during  his visit here in seeing for himself that the president was  committed to Mindanao's economic development and the grant of  autonomy to Muslim-dominated areas in the region.    Foreign affairs officials said this view has not changed  despite the bombings in recent weeks in Mindanao, particularly  in Christian and Muslim religious sites.    Last December, the San Pedro Cathedral in Davao City was  bombed leaving scores of people killed and hundreds injured.  The cathedral bombings was followed by explosions which rocked  two Muslim mosques.    Aside from supporting the Ramos' administration's economic  programs for Mindanao, the OIC had also assured the government  that it will not tolerate any moves to violate the territorial  integrity of the Philippines.</p>

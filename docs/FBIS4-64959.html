			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed FDS: "Coalition 10 Percent Below `Black </F> Sunday' Level -- Dimarso Poll Forecasts European Losses for  Flemish Socialist Party and Christian People's Party, Gains for  Flemish Liberal Democrats"]    [Text] The Flemish majority parties SP [Flemish Socialist  Party] and CVP [Christian People's Party] are doing unusually  poorly. And the PS-PSC [French-speaking Socialist Party-Social  Christian Party] tandem is doing no better. A good month from  the European elections, our latest Dimarso opinion poll appears  deeply disturbing for the sitting coalition: On both sides of  the language border the Catholic-Socialist partners are looking  together at another 10 percent loss compared with the end  results of "Black Sunday," 24 November 1991.    Dimarso took a telephone survey of 1,000 Flemish voters, an  equal number of Walloons and 400 Brussels citizens. The poll  was taken between 9 and 28 April, a period including the Easter  holidays during which no polling was carried out. The Antwerp  BBTK [Socialist Union of Employees] scandal is still affecting  the SP badly: In April, the Flemish Socialists did not recover  from the heavy blow they received in our March poll. They even  dropped a little lower (a statistically insignificant 0.1  percent) to 15.2 percent. This is more than 4 percent lower  than the results of November 1991. The CVP stands at 21.5  percent and has made a 0.5 percent gain from March. But it  remains a good 5 percent below the previous vote.    Taken together, the Flemish majority parties are not doing  worse than in the previous month, but considerably worse than  just before the end of last year when the Dehaene government  started to benefit briefly from its anticrisis policies.  Immediately afterward, it got lost in scandals.    Translated into forecasts for the European elections of 12  June, then both majority parties would at present lose a  Strasbourg seat. The forecasts remain somewhat rough and ready,  because Dimarso is not making any forecasts: "These voter  intentions must not be interpreted as a prediction, but as a  thermometer of the political climate," it says. The CVP could  even lose a second seat in this state of affairs: It is no  longer certain that outgoing MEP [Member of European Parliament]  Raf Chanterie, number four on the list, will be reelected.    The VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] (29.2 percent) are  remaining gently stationary: They no longer exceed the 30  percent barrier, but this result would still be enough to get  them at least two seats in Strasbourg, and give them an outside  chance of three seats. The possible third extra seat for the  liberals depends largely on what the VU [People's Union] will do  on 12 June. The VU (now at 7.4 percent) has gained a good 1.0  percent from March.    The resurrection of ROSSEM is striking: It now stands at 2.9  percent, or 1 percent more than last month.    In parallel with the percentage point gain for ROSSEM,  Agalev  [Flemish Greens] has dropped (roughly) one point to 11.7  percent. If there was no ROSSEM list, then the reallocation of  these voting intentions could help give the Greens another  European seat. At least, if this additional seat is not taken  by the Flemish Bloc. Support for Dillen also dropped by (close  to) 1 percent, according to our poll, and comes out at around 11  percent.    Then there are the French-speakers. The PS, with 31.6  percent, is showing a 1.1 percent improvement. But after the  Agusta scandal, the Carlier affair in Henegouwen also has to be  digested. The PSC has dropped below 20 percent again to 19.3  percent, down 1.2 percent. The PRL [Radical Liberal Party] has  not moved at 23.1 percent. And with 15.8 percent (down 0.1  percent), nor did Ecolo [French-speaking Greens] manage to beat  its provisional high point of February.    Does that share out the European cards? Perhaps not. The  success ratio (the relationship between voting intentions and  potential) of the VLD is close to its ceiling with 60 percent.  Number 2 on the success ranking, the CVP, could improve from 47  percent. But not by much: Since last summer, the Christian  Democrats have not had a success ratio of more than 50 percent.  Apparently the CVP will be unable to do more than safeguard its  fourth European seat, one less than it now has.    All the other parties can in theory dream of a turnaround,  according to this political thermometer. For example, the SP is  getting a share of only 42 percent in the Socialist potential.  Agalev has no more than 35 percent. And the VU has only 23  percent. In other words: The market is still wide open for  them. But attention must be attracted; it is urgent to score  and time is gradually running out.</p>

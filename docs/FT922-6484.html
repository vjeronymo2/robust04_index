			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / The Long View: Who gets what in pensions WHICHEVER ACTUARY naively coined the tempting word 'surplus' to describe the financial condition of occupational pension funds has no doubt suffered the vengeance of his professional peers, should he ever have been identified. The terminology is important here, because the so-called surplus is not a pot of gold but a purely theoretical construct based upon hazy projections of future salary-linked liabilities and future investment returns. Yet although it may be intangible and even unreal, people are prepared to fight for it, and with reason. The pensions industry is now getting ready for an official inquiry - even, perhaps, a Royal Commission - and eventual legislation. The investigations may well focus not only on the obvious security issues arising from the Maxwell scandals but also other hotly-contended topics, of which the ownership of surpluses is one. There will be an important but opaque subsidiary debate here over the future of final salary-linking (the pattern for the vast majority of British schemes) as opposed to the simpler money purchase alternative, which is more of a what-you-pay-is-what-you-get arrangement - or WYPIWYG as a computer man might say. Some of the dark secrets of all this are barely acknowledged by pensions managers and consultants. Today's occupational pension schemes are hugely profitable for the bosses and the top managers, who get far more out of them than they ever contribute. But they are often a swindle for many people who change jobs frequently and for long-serving employees who are declared redundant some years before retirement. Indeed, one of the most sinister features of the final salary scheme is that it makes it very expensive for companies to continue to employ people through their fifties and early sixties, and is an important explanation for the early retirement pressures which have become so pervasive. A survey just published by the consultants Noble Lowndes shows that the average Briton suffers a much greater fall in income on retirement than elsewhere in Europe: even if he pursues a full, uninterrupted career his income after tax will fall by 24 per cent against the EC average of 15 per cent. But it is different for high earners. They enjoy proportionately higher pensions than elsewhere in Europe. Final salary plans provide the key. They were originally invented by the Civil Service, where lifetime employment and progressive salaries were the rule. Those who made it to Permanent Secretary could enjoy the pay rewards after retirement as well as before; and presumably it was these Sir Humphreys who persuaded ministers to approve the design of the pension schemes. But final salary schemes are not at all suitable for, say, manual workers whose earnings are likely to peak quite early in their working lifetimes. They are much better off with schemes which focus on their best years and then use indexation to protect the benefits against inflation. The state earnings-related scheme SERPS is like this. Or they could do better in money purchase schemes so long as the contributions are securely invested over many years. Private sector schemes used to be on a money purchase basis but when inflation began to rise seriously in the 1960s they were switched to final salary linking. This was much cheaper than indexation because so few employee members stayed as long term contributors. Company bosses, like the Whitehall Mandarins, also came to realise that a final salary scheme could be milked for their own benefit. A big pay rise in the last year before retirement could be the trigger for many years of correspondingly fatter pension payments, with no nonsense about WYPIWYG. Compare the plight of the ordinary employee declared redundant at, say, 55 with frozen pension rights and liable to lose up to ten years of inflation protection. Over the past few years the government has been forced to step in to control several of these abuses. The most controversial measure came three years ago with the 'cap' on qualifying salaries - now Pounds 75,000. Above this limit incomes are non-pensionable in the ordinary way, on the very reasonable grounds that the state should not offer generous tax reliefs to people retiring on Pounds 50,000 a year or more. The pensions industry reacted with astonishing fury to a measure which affected only a tiny proportion of scheme membership. Few pensions managers themselves earn anything like Pounds 75,000 a year. But they realise that the popularity of final salary schemes has been very largely founded on the self-interest of company bosses. The cap only applies to those top executives who have changed jobs since 1989. But progressively it will bite ever harder. Top executives may start to wonder whether the traditional schemes are really such a good idea. A common criticism of money purchase schemes is that they are riskier for members and do not protect against future inflation. But it is, of course, possible to invest in index-linked gilts. These were originally introduced by the government because there was supposed to be a demand from pension funds. In fact pension funds have only 3 per cent of their assets in index-linked gilts, because they have preferred riskier but more lucrative equities. You have to ask whether the hostility to money purchase schemes is really because of the investment challenges they represent, or because it is impossible for top executives to scoop the pool. Money purchase schemes have no surpluses to be fought over. Meanwhile, let battle commence. But if the actuaries had had the sense to describe surpluses as, say, implied negative contribution adjustments or residual terminal accrued balances, they might have avoided a lot of trouble.</p>

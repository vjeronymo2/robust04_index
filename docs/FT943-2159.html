			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Asean may raise free trade pace The six members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) are expected to accelerate the establishment of their proposed free trade zone when economic ministers meet in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, later this week. Ministers are likely to approve a plan drafted by senior officials to shorten the phase-in period for the Asean Free Trade Area (Afta) to 10 years from 15; this would put Afta formally in place at the beginning of the year 2003 instead of 2008. 'The sooner it's effective the better,' Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the Malaysian finance minister and deputy premier, said yesterday during a visit to Bangkok. Asean comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Afta's aim is to reduce tariffs on trade within Asean to between zero and 5 per cent. But its relevance has been questioned because of the low volume of intra-Asean commerce (most trade is with Japan, the US and Europe), because of global tariff cuts by Asean members and above all because each country has the right to exclude from Afta any items it regards as sensitive. So many products have been exempted from the Afta tariff cuts that some Asean governments are trying to draft rules to restrict the practice. Some unprocessed farm products, hitherto excluded from Afta, may in future be included. According to the latest draft agreement, tariffs on so called 'fast-track' products will be cut to between zero and 5 per cent within five or seven years, depending on whether the starting tariff is below or above 20 per cent; for 'normal track' products, tariffs will be cut within seven or 10 years. Asean's economic ministers will also discuss the protection of intellectual property rights in the region and the future of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum. Mr Jesus Estanislao, a former finance secretary who represents the Philippines at Apec, said recently Afta could become a 'building block' for a broad Apec free trade area mooted for the year 2020. Malaysia, however, is resisting attempts to make Apec into a formal free trade zone that would include Australia, the US and Canada as well as Asian countries, and has sought to win support for a proposed Asians-only organisation known as the East Asian Economic Caucus.</p>

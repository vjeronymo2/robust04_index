The Japanese  Government will hold a meeting of cabinet ministers in charge of  economic affairs early next week to discuss specific action  programs to promote Japanese imports, increase public  investment, and cut the trade surplus. The idea is being  floated of sending a special envoy to the United States right  after the specific action programs are mapped out. The  government wants to prevent any U.S. sanctions on Japan from  decisively worsening bilateral relations. But the government is  struggling to come up with specific measures which might  represent a trump card and help break the impasse. The  restoration of the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade  Act is regarded as unavoidable.  <H5>  Japan's Responses </H5>   In a bid to break the deadlock in Japan-U.S. framework  talks,  the government has decided to speedily design a package of  measures focusing on four areas -- government procurement,  competitive policy, the promotion of imports, and deregulation.  A senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]  official said on 19 February that "we can present vision for the  macroeconomics area." The government has suggested the  possibility of increasing the 430-trillion-yen "Basic Plan For  Public Investment." The Japanese Government promised the United  States in June 1990 it would spend that figure on public  investment. Every government ministry and agency has begun  studying a package of firm measures.    The "Basic Plan For Public Investment," to be implemented  between 1991 through the year 2000, was agreed between Japan and  the United States at the structural impediment initiative talks.  The idea is quickly surfacing that the government should set  the public investment increase to be incorporated in the fiscal  1995 budget while promoting debate among the ruling coalition  parties on a sweeping reform of the current tax system. Its  subsequent plan to increase public spending should then be  speedily presented to the United States.    Ways to expand "the government procurement action program,"  which was decided by the cabinet on 4 February, will be studied.  In the particular area of government procurement of  telecommunications gear and medical equipment, the government  will adopt a comprehensive appraisal system under which  consideration will be given to the function of some items, in  addition to their price, when choosing among final tenders. The  government is likely to look at the possibility of reducing the  level of procurement spending that government-controlled  organizations are obliged to announce publicly in early January  each year.    At the framework talks on competitive policy, the United  States strongly urged Japan to "address noncompetitive practices  by Japanese enterprises." The government is expected to examine  the possibility of strengthening the Fair Trade Commission's  inspection function and rigorously enforcing the Antimonopoly  Law. In a bid to prevent a recurrence of bid-rigging, the  government will also examine ways to expand public works  projects subject to open competitive tender.    The government will consider additionally constructing  foreign access zones, expanding permanent exhibitions of  imported housing, and creating information centers to help  foreign firms eager to export to Japan. The government will  study integrating the current customs clearance and import  procedures into a single procedure and increasing the number of  imported goods exempted from import inspections.    It is highly likely that the government will relax the  import  certification and standard system for automobiles, which the  United States lobbied for strongly at the framework talks. The  government will study ways to expand access to loans extended by  government-backed financial institutions for enterprises  starting business following deregulation. In the financial  area, the government will establish a public hearing system to  deal with complaints filed by foreign-affiliated insurance  companies. It will also introduce an insurance brokerage system.  <H5>  Future U.S. Moves </H5>   In reaction to the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework  talks, the U.S. Government quickly reached a consensus on taking  a hard-line trade policy toward Japan. The U.S. Government,  which has already begun taking action to impose sanctions on  Japan over the mobile phone issue, will announce on 17 February  a set of new trade measures against Japan centered on  restoration of the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade  Act. Influential Republicans and Democrats in Congress support  a tough stand against Japan and the Congress will start full  deliberation of a bill against Japan on 22 February, once the  current recess is over.    The U.S. Government has harshly criticized Japan for  rejecting objective criteria to gauge the openness of the  Japanese market. At the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks, the  United States presented a compromise proposal under which "Japan  would maintain its trend of import growth." The Japanese side  showed no intention of compromising with the United States and  flatly rejected the U.S. compromise, saying: "We cannot go  along with the U.S. proposal to set numerical targets."    Tokyo's rejection of objective criteria has reinforced  criticism of Japan in the United States. Even American  champions of free trade, including Trade Subcommittee Chairman  Gibbons of the House Committee on Appropriations, have begun to  think "we have no choice but to take a hard line against Japan."  Small businesses and labor organizations that previously  criticized President Clinton's trade policy, now intend to  support his administration.    The Clinton administration is being cautious about "imposing  actual sanctions on Japan" in order to avoid further clashes  with Tokyo. The National Economic Council (NEC) is in charge of  mapping out a package of concrete trade measures against Japan  and the U.S. Government will make a decision on 17 February.  The U.S. Government is trying to apply the maximum pressure on  Japan, and this is likely only to heighten tensions in  Japan-U.S. trade relations.</p>

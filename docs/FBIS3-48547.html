"Our discussions with our Japanese counterparts yesterday  and  today did not produce agreement," a somber-faced senior U.S.  official told reporters after the talks. The official, who did  not want to be identified, said any agreement with Tokyo must  contain provisions "of substantial opening of the Japanese  market along with objective criteria to assess progress toward  that goal."    Japanese and U.S. officials are supposed to draw up a  progress report on the framework trade negotiations by the time  Hosokawa and Clinton meet February 11 in Washington.    U.S. officials reiterated that "objective criteria" are  essential for defining a new framework of trade relations with  Japan, which runs a 50 billion dollar trade surplus with the  United States. "If there are no objective criteria, there is no  agreement," a senior U.S. official said.    Members of the Japanese negotiating team, headed by Deputy  Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura, acknowledged that the U.S.  insistence on quantifying the openness of the Japanese markets  reflects a "lack of trust" between the two trading partners.    Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international  affairs and a key member of the Japanese negotiating team, said  he feels the U.S. negotiators "understand Japanese reasoning"  for opposing import targets but still want to use indicators to  quantify the openness of Japan's markets.    U.S. officials contend that past agreements by Tokyo to  lower  trade barriers have failed to produce the desired results. The  U.S. wants Japan to accept the import levels of other  industrialized countries as benchmarks to prove that its markets  are truly open to foreign goods.    Japanese officials say Japan will oppose the use of any  indicators, arguing that governments in market economies have no  power to dictate the level of imports for specific industries.    Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, Japan's Ambassador to  the U.S. Takakazu Kuriyama called the U.S. expectations of  predetermined market shares "unrealistic" in market economies.    "The United States should understand that putting up a  certain quantitative goal and trying to achieve it isn't  something that can happen in the real business world," he said.    Kuriyama, who is due to fly back to Tokyo Sunday for  consultations ahead of the Clinton-Hosokawa summit, urged  Washington not to "lose sight" of the principal purpose of the  framework agreement -- how to make the Japanese market more open  to foreign goods and services.    The framework accord, concluded last July, calls for a  "highly significant decrease" in Japan's current account surplus  and promised "tangible progress" in the access and sales of  foreign goods in the Japanese market.    The two governments designated the Japanese automobile  market, insurance, and Japanese Government procurement in  telecommunications and medical equipment as priority areas that  must be settled by the February 11 summit meeting.    U.S. officials said the two sides have reached a "complete  impasse" on negotiations involving the auto industry sector and  described progress on Japanese Government procurement and the  insurance market as "marginal."    Japanese and U.S. officials are scheduled to hold more  working-level talks this week in Washington, but there is no  agreement yet on a further round of senior-level talks prior to  the summit meeting.    U.S. officials said the Japanese side has proposed another  round of high-level talks in Tokyo but the U.S. Government will  have further consultations before deciding on the next move.  "We intend to do all that we can between now and February 11 in  anticipation of a successful summit," a senior U.S. official  said.    But the official added, "in our view, we would prefer not to  have agreements than to have bad and cosmetic ones."</p>

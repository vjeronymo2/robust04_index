			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SPRING VALLEY  </P> <P> The convicted killer of a former Los Angeles Rams football player was sentenced  Wednesday to 44 years to life in state prison.  </P> <P> The sentence given to George Cunnington, 27, of Spring Valley, also included a  term for a second murder committed hours before he killed Rey Nicholas  Phillinganes, the former football player. Phillinganes, 23, was shot about 7  a.m. on Nov. 18, as he and his fiancee were leaving her apartment in La Mesa.  </P> <P> Cunnington tried to rob Phillinganes at gunpoint, and Phillinganes was shot in  the chest as he tried to wrestle the gun away.  </P> <P> The other victim, Robert Hetmer, 51, was shot to death in his ransacked, Spring  Valley home, where Cunnington was also living.  </P> <P> San Diego Superior Court Judge Andrew Wagner imposed consecutive sentences for  both murders.  </P> <P> Last month, Cunnington pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the death of  Phillinganes, and second-degree murder in Hetmer's slaying.  </P> <P> In an interview with the probation department, Cunnington said he accidentally  shot Phillinganes. He said he encountered the former football player while  under the influence of crystal methamphetamine, marijuana and possibly cocaine.  </P> <P> Cunnington maintained that the gun "went off" during the struggle for control  of the weapon.  </P> <P> The defendant also said he did not remember killing Hetmer, according to the  probation department.  </P></p>

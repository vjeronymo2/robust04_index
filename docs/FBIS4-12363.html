			<p>BFN     [Text] Lawyer Muntasir al-Zayyat announced at the Lawyers  Association last week the conditions of the political violence  groups, better known as the "Islamic Group" and the "al-Jihad  Group," for ending the acts of violence in Egypt, which  al-Zayyat described as "reactions" to the authority's violence.    Al-Zayyat called for giving the "religious groups" freedom  to  express their opinions peacefully, unconditionally releasing all  members of these groups who are detained, stopping referring  defendants to military courts, and enabling what he described as  "Islamic preachers" to practice and express their views through  all means.    Al-Zayyat, a lawyer representing defendants belonging to the  religious current, claimed that there is no animosity between  the "Islamic groups" and Copts and that they are not against  tourism in Egypt. He justified the recent bombings by saying  that they were meant only to put pressure on the government.  Al-Zayyat's remarks came in a seminar organized by the Youth  Committee of the Lawyers Association.</p>

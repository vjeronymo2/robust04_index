			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi and Kohl Review European </F> Union Enlargement, G-7"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 31 -- Italian Premier Carlo  Azeglio Ciampi on Thursday [31 March] met in Bad Hofgastein,  Austria, with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for informal talks  which focused on the enlargement of the European Union [EU] and  participation of Russia in the summit of the West's Group of  Seven (G-7) most industrialized countries, which Italy will host  in Naples in July.    The premier's office here said that Ciampi had gone on an  invitation from Kohl who is vacationing at the Austrian resort  and would also review the results of the recent G-7 summit of  finance ministers in Detroit, which focused on employment.    The talks on EU enlargement were expected to have dealt with  the changes in voting procedure, especially veto powers, once  Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland join the European Union,  January 1, 1994 if current time-tables are respected.    Both Ciampi and Kohl, the premier's office, share the view  that the "concept of Europe" must be re-launched with steps made  towards advancing European integration and in the fight against  unemployment.    The G-7 summit will be held July 8-10.</p>

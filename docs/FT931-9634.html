			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Leading Article: How to raise UK taxation NO BRITISH government has the credibility to pile up liabilities at the rate of some 10 per cent of gross domestic product for very long. This is the main reason why the chancellor has to act on the structural fiscal deficit both decisively and soon. The question facing him can only be how best to start closing the gap. The amount by which the structural budget needs to be improved over the next few years is some Pounds 15bn-Pounds 20bn (2 1/2 -3 per cent of GDP). Not entirely coincidentally, Pounds 20bn is also roughly the amount by which the government's new 'control total' - the non-cyclical element in public spending - was allowed to rise, in 1991-92 prices, between 1990-91 and 1993-94. Almost all of the adjustment will have to come from taxation rather than lower public spending. The review of public spending announced by Mr Michael Portillo this week may well prove important, but only in the longer term. Ideally, the chancellor would announce a substantial proportion of the Pounds 20bn adjustment in March, but postpone implementation to January, after the second Budget of the year, or 1994-95. An adjustment of Pounds 12bn (2 per cent of GDP) would be a useful start. How might such sums be raised? The main instruments would have to be income tax, value added tax and national insurance, which now account for 26, 17 and 17 per cent of total revenue, respectively. Increasing the basic rate of income tax to 30p would raise Pounds 8.3bn in a full year. Increasing higher rate to 50p would raise Pounds 3.3bn. Either would also create hysteria on Mr Lamont's backbenches. This is a pity, since nothing could better demonstrate the absurdity of wanting both higher public spending and lower taxation. Eliminating mortgage interest relief on housing  -for which there might never, given current low interest rates, be a better opportunity - could raise Pounds 4bn-Pounds 4 1/2 bn. There are more covert, though longer-term, ways of raising revenue from income tax: one, notes the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is non-indexation of the basic rate limit, which would push more taxpayers into the 40p band. This could raise an additional Pounds 1.7bn in 1992-93 prices by 1996-97. Also progressive would be restricting all allowances to the basic rate, which would raise Pounds 1.3bn in one year. A more regressive move would be to freeze all allowances, which would raise Pounds 1bn. The IFS says that Pounds 10.7bn could be raised by imposing standard-rate VAT of 17.5 per cent on expenditures that are now zero-rated. A uniform VAT would be economically more efficient than the present diversity. Announcement of future increases in VAT would bring spending forward as well, though this effect would be modest, since most zero-rated items are perishable. But increasing VAT on this scale would raise prices by 3.7 per cent. It would be politically explosive as well and require compensation for those on low incomes. National insurance contributions are little more than a regressive income tax. If Mr Portillo's review does, as it should, obliterate the contributory principle, it might become possible to merge national insurance into income tax. In the meantime, substantial sums - up to Pounds 2 1/2 bn - could be raised by eliminating the present anomalous upper earnings limit on national insurance contributions. This is, unfortunately, no time for fine-tuning the fiscal system. It is not, given the amount of money that must be raised, even one for imaginative fiscal reform. It is a time for plucking the geese as efficiently as possible. The government will have to announce its intention to raise large sums by a mixture of higher taxes on spending and higher taxes on income. It will not be much fun. But it has to be done. This is the third in a series of leaders on the March Budget</p>

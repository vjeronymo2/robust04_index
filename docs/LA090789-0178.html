			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH OKS PUBLIC GOLF COURSE PLAN  </P> <P> Despite strong objections from equestrians, runners and environmentalists,  Huntington Beach is moving forward with plans to build an 18-hole public golf  course on an undeveloped tract of land in the city's sprawling Central Park.  </P> <P> Construction of the golf course, to be built and operated under a 40-year  contract with the American Golf Corp., is tentatively scheduled to begin next  June. The target date for opening is January, 1992.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach City Council approved the golf course plan by a 5-2 vote  after a heated public hearing Tuesday night attended by about 200 people.  </P> <P> According to a report by an ad hoc committee set up to study the proposal, the  course will bring in a minimum of $200,000 a year to city coffers over the  first five years, and annual revenue should jump to more than $500,000 after 20  years. The committee said the golf course will attractively develop an area  that is "currently an eyesore."  </P> <P> At the meeting, however, more than 30 residents spoke out against the proposal  in a 3 1/2-hour debate focusing on its environmental and aesthetic  ramifications on Central Park, a 380-acre tract on both sides of Golden West  Street at Talbert Avenue.  </P> <P> Some speakers expressed fear that the golf course would further encroach on the  park's shrinking open space and force out joggers, horseback riders, mountain  bike enthusiasts and school cross-country teams in favor of golfers. Opponents  said golfers account for only 8% of the city's population.  </P> <P> Others warned that fertilizers and pesticides used to maintain the course would  leach through the soil and contaminate ground-water supplies and nearby Lake  Huntington. Some questioned whether the area's diminishing water supply could  even meet the maintenance demands of more than 90 acres of fairways and greens.  </P> <P> Mayor Wes Bannister, however, replied that even if the city does not build the  golf course it is still liable to maintain and clean up the area, which would  require the use of city water and cost taxpayers an estimated $5 million to  remove contaminated soil, abandoned oil derricks and garbage.  </P> <P> Moreover, Bannister said that even with the golf course the city would still  possess more than 1,800 acres of open space in the form of wetlands and parks,  plus nine miles of public beaches.  </P> <P> Some speakers demanded that the city honor three city surveys that they claim  overwhelmingly show public opposition to the golf course.  </P> <P> Bannister countered that the surveys were either dated, incomplete or poorly  worded and entirely unrelated to the golf course. He also noted that even  though the surveys made no mention about a possible public golf course, many of  the respondents wrote in that they would like to see the city build one.  </P> <P> About 25 people spoke in favor of the proposal, saying that the only other such  public facility, Meadowlark Golf Course, is so overcrowded that on busy days a  four-hour wait is not unusual.  </P> <P> The proposal was passed with amendments requiring golf course revenues to be  used to repay any related city costs and fund future park acquisitions. The  council also amended the proposal to include civic associations and interest  groups in future negotiations regarding the course.  </P> <P> Voting to move ahead with the golf course were Bannister and council members  John Erskine, Don MacAllister, Tom Mays and Jim Silva. Casting dissenting votes  were council members Grace Winchell and Peter M. Green.  </P></p>

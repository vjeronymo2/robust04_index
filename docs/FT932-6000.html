			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Former Rank chief dies SIR John Davis, former chief executive, chairman and president of the Rank Organisation, died last week, aged 86. His astute investment in the copying machine company Xerox meant that Rank Xerox became one of the UK's most successful conglomerates. He became managing director of the Rank Organisation in 1948, controlling more than 500 cinemas in Britain. He drove the group to diversify at a time of British cinematic decline into a wide range of other leisure and technical businesses, forming Rank Xerox in 1956. Photocopying eventually came to account for more than 40 per cent of the group's turnover.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Overburden can also be removed by hydraulicking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Hydraulicking consists of the loosening of material by water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  delivered under pressure through a hydraulic giant (monitor).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The material then flows, usually by gravity, to the sluice box if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  overburden is to be processed with the mineral bearing material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  below. Overburden consisting of barren material may be directed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  away from the sluice box so that only mineral bearing material is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  processed in the sluice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mining Methods.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Placer mining methods range from dredging systems to open-cut mining. Dredging systems are classified as hydraulic or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanical, depending on the methods of digging. A floating dredge consists of a supporting hull with a mining control system, excavating and lifting mechanism, gold recovery circuits, and waste disposal system. They are all designed to work as a unit to dig, classify, beneficiate ores and dispose of waste. Suction dredges, the most common hydraulic dredging system, are quite popular in Alaska with the small or recreational gold placer miner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A bucket-line dredge has been the traditional gold placer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  mechanical dredging tool in Alaska. Excavation equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  consists of a chain of buckets, traveling continuously around a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  truss or plate-girder ladder, that scoop up a load as they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  forced against the mining face while pivoting around the lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  tumbler and then dump as they pivot around the upper tumbler.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The ladder is raised or lowered as required by a large hoisting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  winch through a system of cables and sheaves. About six placer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  miners operate bucket-line dredges in Alaska.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Processing Methods.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A large percentage of the present gold placer mining operations use some type of sluice box to perform the primary processing function, beneficiation. An increasing number of jig plants are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also being used. Many operations make use of feed size classification which involves the physical separation of large rocks and boulders from smaller materials such as gravel and sand. The object of classification is to prevent the processing of large-sized material which is unlikely to contain gold values. Commonly used classification equipment includes: grizzlies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trommels and static or vibrating screens. The most common gold recovery method is sluicing. A sluice is a long, sloped trough into which water is directed to effectuate separation of gold from ore. A slurry of water and ore flows down the sluice and the gold, due to its relatively high density, is trapped in riffles along the sluice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Suction Dredging.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A suction dredge is a mechanical device which floats on the stream surface and which pumps stream water and stream bed material through a suction intake conduit to a sluice box from which gold or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other minerals may be recovered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The discharge from suction dredges consists totally of stream water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and bed material. These discharges are becoming numerous in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state. The discharge limits and monitoring requirements are identical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the majority of these discharges. This category of discharges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets the qualifications of 40 CFR 122.59 for the issuance of General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Discharge Permits. This general discharge permit will expedite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing the numerous applications and provide the same regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls over the discharges as an individual permit would.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Effluent Characteristics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Discharges from placer mining operations consist of water and the naturally occurring materials found in the alluvial deposits (e.g. sand, silt, clay, trace minerals and metals, etc.). Some of the elements measured in placer mine effluent are derived principally from sulfide, oxide, carbonate, and silicate mineral species, and include antimony, arsenic, cadmium, copper, iron, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc. Most of these parameters are found in trace amounts and are of little significance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on review of sampling data collected by EPA and upon evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Alaska Water Quality Standards (WQS), EPA has concluded that the pollutants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  of primary concern are settleable solids, turbidity, and arsenic. Arsenic is the only toxic pollutant of concern due to its naturally occurring abundance in most Alaskan soils.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. Basis for Effluent Limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Effluent limits required in this permit for the control of pollutants are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  published in 40 CFR part 440, Subpart M_Gold Placer Mine Subcategory, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  was promulgated May 24, 1988, in 53 FR 18764. Additional information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  regarding the basis for establishing the effluent limits is summarized in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  EPA publication titled ``Development Document for Effluent Limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards for the Ore Mining and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Dressing Point Source Category_Gold Placer Mine Subcategory'' (May  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule establishes effluent limitations guidelines and standards based on the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT), the best available technology economically achievable (BAT), and new source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  performance standards (NSPS) based on the best available demonstrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  technology. The BAT and NSPS limitations represent the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  technology required to be in place for all placer mining operations covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  under 40 CFR part 440, subpart M.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

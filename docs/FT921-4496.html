			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Corruption is 'dagger that twists deep in my heart' says Collor BRAZIL'S President Fernando Collor has admitted for the first time the damage caused by the wave of corruption scandals surrounding his government. In an interview with O Globo newspaper at the weekend, Mr Collor said: 'It's as though there was a dagger in my heart that cannot be pulled out. It just twists and twists further in, but I tell myself: Bear it, Collor, bear it'. Mr Collor came to power two years ago on an anti-corruption ticket, pledging not to make the numerous ministerial changes of previous governments. However, all but one of his original cabinet have been sacked or resigned, most under a cloud. Police are currently investigating the health and labour ministers, who were dismissed last month. Mr Alceni Guerra, the former health minister, allegedly favoured friends with contracts at highly-inflated prices. Mr Antonio Magri, the ex-labour minister and union leader, was allegedly taped explaining to a subordinate how he had received Dollars 30,000 from a company for parcelling out its social security dues. Describing it 'like money falling from the sky,' he allegedly suggested they work together. He now claims this was an 'honesty test'. For the first time, Mr Collor referred to his former economy minister, Ms Zelia Cardoso, who resigned last May, shocking the country with publication of an authorised biography detailing her personal life while in office. Mr Collor said: 'It was the first time a woman had held such an important position. No super-minister of previous governments had so much power. She wasted an historic opportunity.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _India market access for textiles: India severely restricts imports of textiles and apparel, and maintains high tariffs. In implementing the Uruguay Round, the Administration has agreed to take all appropriate measures to obtain market access commitments from any signatory to the WTO Agreement that is a significant exporter of textiles and apparel to the United Sates and that we consider has failed to provide adequate access to its market for U.S. textile and apparel products. We are currently engaged in negotiations with the Indian government and will continue to seek improvements in market access for textiles and apparel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Korea market access for automobiles: Actions by the Korean government have built and reinforced perceptions among Korean consumers that the purchase of a foreign car will lead to government harassment. Other barriers to imports include excise taxes, high tariffs, standards barriers, distribution restrictions and a ban on  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage --> &blank;private sector retail financing. The Korean government has taken some steps to address these barriers and has pledged to take others. Our continuing consultations are aimed at ensuring that the remaining barriers are addressed and that the Korean government's actions result in improved access for imported motor vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Intellectual property rights protection ion China: On June 30, through the ``Special 301'' process under Section 182 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2242), the Trade Representative designated China as a priority foreign country, and initiated a section 301 investigation of China's failure to provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights and fair and equitable market access to persons relying on intellectual property protection. Negotiations with the Chinese government to address these concerns are ongoing. By December 31, 1994, the Trade Representative will be required to determine whether China's failure to address our concerns represents an unreasonable or discriminatory burden or restriction on U.S. commerce and whether trade action is appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Financial services market access negotiations: The WTO Agreement provides for continuing market access negotiations in the financial services sector, to conclude six months after its entry into force. The United States is seeking commitments from a wide range of commercially important developed and developing countries to reduce or eliminate barriers to the supply by U.S. financial services firms of financial services including banking, securities, insurance and other financial services. If we do not achieve our objectives, we would maintain an exemption from the most-favored-nation obligation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Telecommunications market access: The WTO Agreement provides for continuing market access negotiations in the basic telecommunications services sector. These negotiations cover local, long-distance, and international basic telecommunications services. In these negotiations, we will seek to ensure that U.S. firms may provide basic telecommunications services in foreign markets both through facilities-based competition_including the right to build, own, and operate domestic and international network facilities_and through the resale of services on existing networks. We will also seek to ensure that U.S. companies can compete in foreign markets on reasonable and non-discriminatory rates, terms, and conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Negotiations on accession to the World Trade Organization: The United States will also continue to seek market opening for our goods and services, and to achieve protection of intellectual property rights abroad, in negotiating with countries that are seeking admission as members to the World Trade Organization. The Agreement Establishing the WTO requires that all members must provide market access, and the Administration is committed to gaining appropriate market access from every applicant for membership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ira Shapiro, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> General Counsel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25213 Filed 10&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3190&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

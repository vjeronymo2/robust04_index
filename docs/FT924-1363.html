			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Observer: Easy come So what does the man who beat Europe's central banks during the autumn currency crisis do with his money? Today George Soros, the Hungarian-born American financier, will give away Dollars 50m to help Bosnia. It will be administered by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. While it is impossible to think of a more generous single donation by a private individual, the sum of money is overshadowed by the profits that Soros and his fellow investors are rumoured to have made on Black Wednesday. Forbes magazine estimates that Soros made Dollars 1.5bn in September's currency upheavals by selling Dollars 7bn of sterling short and buying Dollars 6bn of D-Marks.</p>

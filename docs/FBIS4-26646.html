			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] An official Chinese denial of a report on the  paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, has created a rift with a  Beijing-controlled newspaper in Hong Kong.    China's Foreign Ministry yesterday denied a report in WEN  WEI  PO that the patriarch recently visited the Shandong province  seaside resort of Qingdao.    "This report is not accurate," a spokesman, Wu Jianmin, told  a regular news conference in Beijing. Switching from Chinese to  English for emphasis, he added: "It is not true."    Sources in Qingdao added they were sure Deng had not been  there.    "We would have known the day he arrived and been immediately  instructed by city officials whether we could reveal it or not,"  a journalist in Qingdao said. Another source in the city added  that no senior official from Beijing had stayed recently at the  Eight Great Passes Scenic Area Resort, the official residence  for senior leaders visiting the city.    The report may have been an attempt to contradict growing  rumours of Deng's deteriorating health, which have been fuelled  by television pictures of an emaciated and stunned-looking  figure shuffling along the streets of Shanghai supported by his  two daughters during the lunar new year holiday.    The Chinese leader's health has been of particular concern  in  Hong Kong, where "the Deng factor" has a strong effect on  markets, business and politics.    The report quoted Deng, 89, as saying China's economic  reforms and its policy of opening to the outside world would not  change "unless there is an unavoidable large-scale war". It was  reported that Deng also ruled out a multi-party political system.    WEN WEI PO's editor-in-chief, Liu Zaiming, said yesterday  the  paper stood by its report.    "I know about the Foreign Ministry statement. But what we  have reported is what we believe," he said.    The newspaper is controlled by China's Communist Party  through the Hong Kong branch of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY  (XINHUA).    It would not be the first time it has printed an erroneous  story about the patriarch.    Last December, it reported Deng had gone to vote in Beijing  municipal elections when it was widely known that he was in  Shanghai.</p>

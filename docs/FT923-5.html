			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bic rises 11% despite loss at fashion subsidiary ENCOURAGING first-half results have been reported by three French companies, Bic, the producer of disposable pens and razors; Au Printemps, the department store; and Poliet, the building materials group. Bic produced an 11 per cent increase in net profits to FFr241m (Dollars 47.25m) in the first six months of the year, due chiefly to its French, US and Brazilian operations. This comes after a FFr49m loss from Guy Laroche, Bic's fashion arm, most of which is due to restructuring and write-downs on assets. Au Printemps, recently the subject of a takeover by Pinault, the distribution group, reported more than doubled first-half net profits of FFr206m, as against FFr87m in the same period of last year. These figures do not include the FFr1.87bn gross profit which Au Printemps made last year from selling Euromarche, the hypermarkets chain. Group sales rose 33.5 per cent from FFr14.14bn to FFr18.85bn. Poliet, a subsidiary of the Paribas banking and industrial holdings group, saw net profits rise by 9.8 per cent to FFr290m in the first half. Sales were almost stagnant at FFr9.99bn, as against FFr9.02bn in the first six months of 1991.</p>

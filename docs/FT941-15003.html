			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Truro bus staff to hold third strike vote The RMT transport union is holding a third postal strike ballot of its 500 members who work for the Western National bus company after facing a court injunction threatening sequestration of funds and fining of union officials. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, has called off a planned one-day strike tomorrow at the Truro-based company after consulting union members there. A High Court judge granted the company an injunction last week after a second ballot produced only a 188-185 vote in favour of a strike. Western National said 12 employees had either not received ballot papers or had received them but not had enough time to return them. The union said there had been a problem caused by changes of address and the slowness of postal deliveries over Christmas. The ballot was conducted by the independent Electoral Ballot Services. The union had called the second ballot after the first ballot produced a 176-164 vote for a strike. A number of members had failed to receive voting papers in the first ballot, the union said. Aslef, the train drivers' union, yesterday decided to call a strike ballot of its 2,000 members at London Transport after the breakdown of talks on the introduction of a five-day working week.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: KLM In the light of the European Commission's recent report on the aviation industry, KLM's rights issue raises questions about what constitutes state aid. The Dutch government, which owns 38 per cent of KLM, has agreed to subscribe for its share of the national carrier's Fl 1bn fund raising. This stark change to its previous attitude appears to be a response to the collapse of the Alcazar European collaboration project. Yet rival airlines will scarcely complain. KLM is among the most market-oriented of all European airlines. Its rights issue price has been determined by prevailing stock market conditions. Air France lies at the other end of the spectrum, being wholly-owned by the government. Yet in the past, it too has raised money by way of a rights issue. Not surprisingly, its cash call has been fully taken up by the government. That looks suspiciously like state aid. But where is the dividing line to be drawn? The picture grows confused in cases such as Lufthansa. The German government has a 51 per cent shareholding in its national carrier and retains obligations over its DM3bn pension scheme. The government may be keen to privatise Lufthansa fully but it retains considerable influence over its commercial destiny in the meantime. The suspicion must be that governments will continue to support national carriers no matter how hard the European Union tries to ban state subsidies. Is it really possible to imagine Air France going bust?</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: The need for facts - Diary of a Private Investor / Shareholders are being sold short AS A PRIVATE investor, I find it very easy to miss some of the warning signals which an institutional investor can notice much more readily. Take Toye &amp; Company, in which I had a small shareholding for a number of years. It gave shareholders a useful 15 per cent discount on jewellery and other items at its retail outlets. I thought the company had a profitable niche activity: the manufacture and sale of civil and military regalia. I also believed it had takeover potential. At 4.27 pm on Friday, April 30, however - the day before the bank holiday weekend - the stock exchange received and released details of Toye's dreadful figures for the year ended December 31 1992. Institutional investors could see this information on their monitor screens but the poor private investor had to rely on the press or direct contact from the company. But the timing of Toye's release meant it was not picked up by the press. And Toye, like most companies in a similar situation, did not send a circular to its shareholders; instead, it waited until its annual report had been printed and sent them that. Thus, the first many of them knew of Toye's Pounds 1,051,438 loss (compared with a profit the previous year of Pounds 203,401) was when the report dropped through their letter boxes on June 2. By then, Toye's shares had fallen from 130p on April 30 to 100p. Toye's interim report, published on October 30, had revealed half-year losses of Pounds 659,718. The chairman's statement pointed out some of the problems the company faced, outlined the action it was taking and said: 'The company expects to curtail the losses by the end of the second half-year.' So, investors knew they might face a bumpy ride, and the shares fell from 190p in late October to 165p in January. By the end of March, though, the price had dropped to 145p, and by April 22 it was 140p. The next day, it plunged by another 10p. Which led me to wonder . . . Last year, Toye announced its full-year results on April 24. Did someone, this year, ask the company for the date of its announcement? And did that someone sell out after discovering the results were to be announced on the day before the bank holiday weekend - and drawing the conclusion they would be bad? In April, I had overlooked that Toye's results were due. It was mid-May before I remembered, and when I 'phoned one of my stockbrokers to ask what had happened, I was surprised to be told the results had been released already. As soon as I got the details, I sold most of my shares, achieving 128p for my modest holding. Toye is a small company and its share dealings take place via SEATS: the Stock Exchange Alternative Trading Service. Dealing spreads can therefore be sizeable. I am determined not to be caught out again and have written down the dates of expected interim and final announcements for companies in which I have shares. But I feel also that the authorities should insist that when companies announce bad news to the stock exchange, they should at the same time mail details to all shareholders by first-class post. Just a photocopy of the statement to the exchange would suffice. Another warning sign I should have noticed about Toye was its change in definition of its activities. In the 1990 report, this stated simply: 'The manufacturing and sale of civil and military regalia ..' In 1991, this changed to: 'The group operates in one principal area of activity, that of identity.' Such 'PR-speak' should have alerted me to the dangers ahead. Toye's activities had not changed - just the way they were described. Looking back over the years, there are several other warning signs that have alerted me to potential problems with various companies. A move to plush new headquarters, or the chief executive's involvement with various government quangos, can sometimes indicate problems ahead. So, too, can the sudden appointment of members of the 'great and the good' to the board. Why does the company need window-dressing? Another good indicator is looking at the announcements of directors' share dealings. Hefty share sales by them can, quite often, presage a slump in a company's share price. Every Saturday, the Weekend FT has a column of Directors' Transactions produced by Directus Ltd (1 Rothesay Terrace, Edinburgh EH3 7UP). It can also provide private investors with a more detailed weekly and monthly services. Another service is Press Watch, which summarises the coverage given to major companies in the UK's national newspapers. Each company has points awarded (or taken away) depending on how much praise or criticism they get. This annual publication costs Pounds 350 and is obtainable from Press Watch, Bridge House, 126a High Street, Whitton TW2 7LL. The company also publishes a quarterly guide at Pounds 425 a year. Theoretically, if a company receives a bad press its shares ought to go down; this can be used as an indicator of when to sell. A good press should, at least in the short term, make the shares perk up - but this does not necessarily mean a company will perform well. It could be that it simply has skilled PR professionals, or perhaps no one has taken too close a look at it. There are other sources of information, although many are so costly that only institutions can afford them. It is, therefore, crucial that companies recognise they have a duty to all their shareholders and distribute corporate information as widely and rapidly as possible.</p>

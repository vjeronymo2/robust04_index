			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Blenheim advances 51% to Pounds 27.8m BLENHEIM GROUP, the organiser of trade exhibitions and conferences, increased pre-tax profits by 51 per cent, from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds 27.8m, in the six months to February 29. The share price gained 33p to close at a new high of 508p yesterday. The shares were trading at less than 200p little more than a year ago. Mr Neville Buch, chairman, said the group had a diverse portfolio of exhibitions in each of the main countries in which it operated. Turnover grew by 45 per cent to Pounds 103m (Pounds 71m). About half of it lay in France, while the UK and the US accounted for nearly 20 per cent each. German language venues accounted for most of the rest. Even in the recession-hit UK sales had increased by more than 16 per cent. Mr Buch said there had been a drift to quality - trade customers had continued to attend what they regarded as the definitive shows in their sectors. So far this year, the total number of visitors at all the group's events had increased to 412,261 (381,086). The average per show had gone up to 14,216 (13,141). Acquisitions accounted for about 10 per cent of turnover and profit. Since 1987, Pounds 311m has been spent on building up what the group sees as brands in the trade exhibition market and on overseas expansion. Mr Buch said the rate of company purchases had moderated. 'We are now in a phase of running the business better, making selective acquisitions, deriving full benefits from economies of scale and our databases, and replicating events in different markets.' Goodwill write-offs left the group with negative net worth of nearly Pounds 75m at the half-way stage, about Pounds 15m down on the year-end. Net debt grew from just under Pounds 24m to Pounds 42.1m in the six months. Mr Christopher Crowcroft, finance director, said acquisitions totalling Pounds 14m and variations in the level of advance payments from customers accounted for this. The underlying trend was downwards. Operating profit of Pounds 30.7m (Pounds 20.5m) covered interest payments nearly 10 times. Mr Crowcroft said the group was working on further improvements to operating margin by cutting its promotion costs and using its databases to refine the targeting of customers. The change of year-end to December would even out the seasonal impact on the business. Under the old period, to August 31, both the autumn and January-February high seasons for exhibitions fell in the first half, giving it about two thirds of the profit. Under the new arrangement, each half would have one of the peaks. Earnings per share advanced by 30 per cent to 20.5p (15.8p). The interim dividend goes up from 2.33p to 2.7p. See Lex</p>

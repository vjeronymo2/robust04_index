			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Tao Jie (7118 2638): "Gu Jinchi Goes to </F> Universities and Scientific Research Units To Conduct  Investigation and Study"]    [Excerpts] Soon after visiting 14 cities of the province,  Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, who had  assumed his post for merely three months, went to Liaoning  University, Dongbei University, the Shenyang Institute of Metals  Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Shenyang's  Nanhu Scientific and Technological Development Zone to conduct  investigation and study on 10 and 11 January. [passage omitted]    During the forums held at the two universities, Gu Jinchi  analyzed why most schools still experienced strained supplies of  funds even though Liaoning's growth of education funds was  greater than the growth of revenues every year. He said: The  major reason was that, under the old systems, establishment of  schools has been duplicated in all localities, which leads to  disperse of funds. In addition, the contingent of teachers is  so large that it is disproportionate with the number of  students. He held that only by deepening reform, can the  difficulties in running schools be resolved. He called for  concentrating efforts on making a few key universities  successful. He expressed the hope that the universities reform  will be conducted in better coordination with the economic  development plan, and personnel with both scientific and  technical ability and economic knowledge will be trained; that  old professors will make more contributions to training  outstanding young teachers; that teachers will attach importance  to the political and ideological training of students and  educate them to have enterprising spirit and strong sense of  responsibility in addition to training them with specialized  knowledge; and that greater steps will be made in the  coordination between the scientific research of universities and  enterprises. He said that the provincial party committee and  government would make utmost efforts to support these two  universities to enter the state's "211 project."    At the institute of metals research and the Nanhu Scientific  and Technological Development Zone, Gu Jinchi said: The work  that people throughout the province are most concerned about is  how to accelerate Liaoning's economic development. They are  worried about Liaoning's decline in the country's rating. He  realistically analyzed the reason for this and said firmly:  Liaoning used to rank second in the country thanks to its  strength and was able to accomplish what other provinces and  municipalities could not. For this reason, people called  Liaoning the equipment department of the country. Things  changed later, and some provinces and municipalities surpassed  Liaoning. What should Liaoning do? The most important thing is  to clearly understand science and technology as the primary  productive forces, transform traditional industries with high  and new technology, and continue to be able to accomplish what  other localities are unable to. Only in this way, can it regain  its magnificence.    Gu Jinchi repeatedly talked about transformation of  scientific and technological achievements, urging efforts to  give wider publicity to science and technology and scientific  units to integrate science and technology with industrial  production and trade. He hoped that a road to rapid  development, rapid transformation, and good efficiency of high  and new technology would be blazed. He urged for efforts to  learn from the achievements and experiences of scientific and  technological development zones to promote Liaoning's economic  work.    Accompanying Gu Jinchi during the investigation and study  activities were Wang Huaiyuan and Zhang Guoguang, deputy  secretaries; and Xu Wencai, standing committee member and  secretary general of the provincial party committee.</p>

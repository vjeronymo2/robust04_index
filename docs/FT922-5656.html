			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Mody to step down as Tata Iron chief TATA Iron and Steel (Tisco), India's largest privately held company and the flagship of the Tata group of companies, announced that Mr Russi Mody would step down as chief executive on July 22, Reuter reports from Bombay. Mr JJ Irani, his deputy, will take over as managing director. Mr Mody, 74, will continue as chairman and also oversee Tisco's overseas ventures. 'In view of the importance of globalisation of the company, the board required Mody to continue to head its overseas development, including exports and imports,' the company said. In the year to end-March, exports jumped 117 per cent to Rs4.49bn (Dollars 167m), from Rs2.07bn. The company added that Tisco would launch a Dollars 100m Eurobond issue in the third quarter of 1992. It said it also proposed to launch a rights equity issue in late June in the domestic stock markets, but did not give details. Tata is a company in transition, writes RC Murthy. Mr J. RD Tata retired from Tata and Sons, the holding company, a couple of years ago, naming Mr Ratan Tata as his successor as group head. Mr Mody's move marks the first significant success of Mr Ratan Tata to tighten his grip on the group. Analysts say Mr Mody may soon leave Tisco.</p>

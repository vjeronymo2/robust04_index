			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK may veto paternity leave The UK is threatening to veto a European Union directive giving fathers time off for the birth of their children, Mr Michael Portillo, the new UK employment secretary, said yesterday. He may also seek a UK opt-out from the parental leave directive at today's meeting of the EU social affairs council in Brussels. Mr Portillo said: 'I had hoped to go to my first council meeting with a more co-operative attitude but unfortunately the revival of the parental leave directive makes that impossible.' The EU directive on works councils for consulting workers could be passed at today's meeting. The directive - which affects large companies operating in more than one EU country - would be the first for which the UK can opt out.</p>

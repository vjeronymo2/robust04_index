			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: Rationalisation costs leave Jourdan Pounds 519,000 in the red THOMAS Jourdan, the industrial conglomerate, traded at break-even in 1991 but after exceptional charges ran up a loss of Pounds 519,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 1.21m. The final dividend is again 1p, but that means a cut from 2.5p to 1.5p in the total. Losses per share were 1.47p (earnings 5.92p). Sales dropped by 16 per cent to Pounds 25.5m but four of the five subsidiaries traded profitably. However, losses at Woodstock Furniture and Pounds 539,000 exceptional rationalisation expenses (Pounds 322,000 credits) led to the year's deficit. The scale of Woodstock's operations were cut back sharply both in 1991 and early 1992 but, like other luxury kitchen makers, it suffered from much lower domestic demand because of the inactivity of the housing market and lack of consumer confidence. In the other sectors (electric appliances, household textiles, china and pottery, brushes) action taken was a combination of seeking additional business and cutting back fixed overheads at least in line with the decline in sales. Despite the adverse trading gearing was cut from 20 per cent to below 10 per cent through control of working capital and particulary by control of stocks.</p>

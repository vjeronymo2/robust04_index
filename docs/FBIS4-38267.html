			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza, 28 Jun (MENA) -- Hasan 'Usfur, official in  charge of directing negotiations in the Palestinian National  Authority [PNA], has accused Israel of trying to implement the  Cairo agreement signed by the two sides on 4 May in a way that  is not compatible with its spirit and of trying to put obstacles  before the PNA.    In an exclusive statement to MENA, 'Usfur, who is a member  of  the Palestinian delegation now negotiating in the  Palestinian-Israeli security committee, said that Israel is  trying to exploit the security aspect in order to stop or impede  the Palestinians' movement on the pretext of "security issues."    He added: We regard these practices by the Israeli side as  an attempt to depict the PNA as impotent and incapable of being  a strong authority and therefore inciting the Palestinians  against the PNA.    He noted that the Israeli side's objective is to put the  Palestinian side in a weak position when future negotiations  start between the two sides.    'Usfur also accused the Israeli side of blatantly violating  the Cairo agreement on a number of security matters. He said  the Israeli side sometimes stops the Palestinians from moving  around in the areas under its control or in the areas where they  have security privileges. He added that the Israeli side is  doing this in a way that completely violates the agreement. He  added that the Israeli side also carries out actions that annoy  the Palestinian citizens in the Jericho area, such as  complicating traffic along the Jericho-al'Awjah road, which  belongs to the self-rule authority, the Palestinians' travel  from the West Bank to Jericho and vice versa, and not yet  completing the security passageway between the Gaza Strip and  Jericho.    He noted that Israel has come up with a concept that  contradicts the agreement. He said that the Palestinian side  was surprised by this behavior because it realizes that it is  waging a new battle to build the Palestinian Authority under the  shadow of political complications and the complications of the  agreement itself.    Hasan 'Usfur said: We believe that building the National  Authority is an historic challenge for the Palestinian people  and we fully realize that Israel will not be a peaceful state  that will give the Palestinians the opportunity to build its own  developed and civilized entity.    He expressed his belief that there are mentalities inside  Israel that believe that Israel is the only advanced country in  the region and the only country that has the proper human  conditions and therefore it tries to put obstacles before the  future evolvement of the Palestinian entity.    Regarding the issue of the release of Palestinian prisoners  and detainees, 'Usfur said that the Israeli side was not sincere  when it came to implementing the recorded or unrecorded  agreements between the two sides. He added: Discussion of this  issue began with the Oslo negotiations and there were more than  one Israeli promise to solve it. It was also discussed during  the Taba and Cairo negotiations. The Israelis tried to restrict  the release of some detainees. We understood some of these  restrictions but they, regrettably, used this understanding to  complicate the release of the detainees.    Hasan 'Usfur said that the Israeli side has interpreted some  aspects of the Cairo agreement as it pleases. It is exploiting  the fact that the PNA [Palestinian National Authority] needs to  have the Palestinian prisoners released and the difficult  conditions the prisoners live under in prison.    He clarified that as a result of this, Israel began to set  new conditions on the prisoner-release process. Some of these  conditions are the pledges the prisoners sign before their  release, and the place they are taken to after they are  released. None of these conditions were stipulated in the  agreement.    'Usfur noted that currently there are attempts to restore  dialogue and negotiate over this issue.    He said that the arrival of Palestinian president Yasir  'Arafat to the PNA area is encountering some difficulties as a  result of the complications Israel is creating, particularly  since they are complications of a political nature.    In his interview with MENA, Hasan 'Usfur said that the  Palestinian side believes the Cairo agreement is the first stage  to finding a final solution. We were hoping that this stage  would mark the beginning of the end of a long era between the  Palestinian and Israeli sides.    He said that upon assuming authority in the self-rule areas  in Gaza and Jericho, the Palestinian side worked on providing  the necessary conditions to keep the commitments that were  stipulated in the recent Cairo agreement.    He expressed his belief that important progress was made in  a  record time period, especially in the security field. The  Palestinian side succeeded in asserting the prestige of the  Palestinian security authority. This closed the door before all  wagers that the PNA will not be able to succeed easily, since  there will be strong opposition to the agreement.    He said that there were some people who believed that a  civil  war will erupt. But what has happened is the exact opposite.  The PNA was given a very warm welcome and the people responded  positively to it. Everyone realized that there is only one law:  the law of the Palestinian Authority.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / AT&amp;T acts to fend off telecoms contest AT&amp;T is campaigning to hold back further competition that could significantly cut prices in the transatlantic telecommunications market. The move by the largest US telecoms operator comes a month after AT&amp;T was granted a draft licence to operate in the UK. AT&amp;T is urging the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecoms regulator, not to allow a new form of competition called international simple resale. Under this system, operators lease international lines and connect them to the public networks on both sides of the Atlantic. The resale system is expected to bring cuts in transatlantic call prices at the expense of established carriers, notably AT&amp;T and British Telecommunications. As AT&amp;T pursued its case with the US regulator, telecoms analyst Mr Laurence Heyworth of Robert Fleming, predicted BT would try to pre-empt resale competition by making 'massive price cuts on international calls' later this year. BT has already been told by Oftel, the UK telecoms regulator, that it must cut charges by about Pounds 400m before the end of the year. It had been widely assumed that competition on the transatlantic routes would open up after the UK's decision last month to grant a draft licence to AT&amp;T. This followed the US regulatory authorities' approval of BT's Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.4bn) alliance with MCI, the second-largest US operator. The two companies planning to offer the cheap resale services, MFS and ACC, already have licences to operate in the UK and are asking the Federal Communications Commission for permission to offer international simple resale from the US. AT&amp;T's argument to the US regulator is that 'while the UK has made progress over the last year' it is still not as open as the US. This is denied by MFS and ACC, who have told the commission that Britain offers telecoms resale operators 'opportunities equivalent to those available under US law'. The resellers' claims are broadly supported by US regional telecoms companies with substantial UK interests, which have recently put similar claims to the US regulator. Through its MCI alliance, BT wants to become the leading international operator for multinationals. A loss of international business to new competitors could hamper its ambition. Mercury, BT's largest UK competitor, stands to be the main loser from a transatlantic price war. It earns nearly half its income from international calls. A ring that sounds like profit, Page 13</p>

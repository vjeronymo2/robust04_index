			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Thailand is seeking to become a coordination centre  for intellectual property protection in the region, Deputy  Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said yesterday. Mr Churin  said he will discuss the issue with the Vietnamese Government  during his short visit to Vietnam early next month. He said he  has asked the Intellectual Property Department to draw up a  structure of operations for Thailand, Vietnam, China, Laos,  Cambodia and Burma.    Cooperation between countries of the region is needed  because  trade between them will expand, and the problems of violation of  patents, copyrights and trademarks need to be tackled.    As a first step, Thailand is expected to cooperate with each  country bilaterally before expanding operations across the  region. Thailand can help Vietnam in patent registration  procedures, in which the Thai side is more experienced. The  other countries will have the same or different cooperation  agreements depending on their respective economies.    Concerning local protection of copyright works, Mr Churin  said the Government may apply the Price Fixing and Anti-Monopoly  Act of 1979, which requests that tapes, compact discs and  videotape producers submit costs of production to the Internal  Trade Department for use as a basis for considering whether  producers have taken advantage of consumers.    Mr Churin said the Economic Crime Investigation Division has  reported that the crackdown on infringement of copyright works  in February increased 27 percent from January, and 21,043 pieces  of illegal copyright works were seized.    The Singapore-based representative of the Motion Picture  Exports Association of America, who recently visited Thailand,  reported that violations of copyright laws were fewer in the  first two months of the year.</p>

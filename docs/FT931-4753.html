			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / West German economy shrinks by 1%: Powerhouse of Europe weakens markedly as recession fears grow WESTERN Germany, the powerhouse of the European economy, saw a fall of 1 per cent in gross domestic product in the last quarter of 1992, compared to the previous quarter. The figures underlined 'recessive tendencies', the federal statistics office said yesterday. Conditions had worsened steadily following a relatively strong showing in the first three months of last year, when mild weather helped gross domestic product to grow by a seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent. Excluding that anomaly, growth has now been shrinking since the summer of 1991, yesterday's figures showed. While the fourth-quarter fall is less than the 1.5 per cent estimated by the Bundesbank recently, it demonstrates that economic activity is weakening markedly. Independent economists now expect the economy to shrink by up to 2 per cent this year. The statistics office pointed out that capital investment in the quarter under review had fallen by 4.6 per cent: the biggest drop since mid-1984. Meanwhile, the number of people employed in the west had fallen, by 89,000, for the first time in nine years. A 2.5 per cent increase in domestic demand in the last three months of 1992 helped push imports up 4.7 per cent while exports rose by only 0.6 per cent, the office added. Meanwhile, investment in construction was 6.7 per cent higher due mainly to continuing demand for housing. Private consumption rose 1.8 per cent, partly under the influence of the increase in value added tax on January 1, which spurred demand for consumer durables.</p>

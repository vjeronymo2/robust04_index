			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: US placing by Finmeccanica Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering group, yesterday completed the second of two cash-raising exercises by placing 40 per cent of its Union Switch &amp; Signal subsidiary in the US. US&amp;S was bought by Finmeccanica's quoted Ansaldo Trasporti unit in 1988 to broaden its coverage of the railway equipment and signalling business. The flotation, raising almost Dollars 49m through the sale of 3.25m shares at Dollars 15 each, will give Ansaldo a Dollars 30m boost via a special one-off dividend. The remaining proceeds will be used to reduce US&amp;S's short-term debt. Yesterday's transaction echoes last week's US initial public offering of Finmeccanica's Elsag Bailey Process Automation subsidiary. The transaction involved the flotation of 8.12m shares at Dollars 19 each, raising more than Dollars 150m. About 35 per cent of the total share capital was placed, with an option to sell a further 5 per cent. The proceeds will be used to cut debt at both Elsag Bailey and the Finmeccanica parent company. Both deals are part of a rapid income raising drive by Finmeccanica, which is facing a depressing year because of the recession and heavy losses at its Alenia aerospace subsidiary. Finmeccanica announced a first half pre-tax loss of L159.9bn (Dollars 94.5m), against net profits of L180.5bn in 1992. Analysts say the group should reach break-even in the full year, boosted by the extraordinary receipts from this month's two US transactions.</p>

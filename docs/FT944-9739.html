			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (2): The patient seems cured - The economy is becoming more cyclical In the end, the French will not like it. But the fact that the French economy is becoming more cyclical has, for the moment, its pleasant upside - with Insee, the official stat- istics agency, recently raising its 1994 growth forecast to 2.2 per cent and its prediction for 1995 to above 3 per cent. Previously paranoid that its estimates for 1994-95 would be considered influenced by the imminence of presidential elections and therefore over-optimistic, the govern- ment was thrilled to find its growth predictions exceeded by more neutral bodies. Insee, for instance, has predicted that by next month the French economy will be growing at a year-on-year rate of 3.1 per cent. In its 1995 budget, the government also had a figure of 3.1 per cent - but as average growth for the whole year, rather than the initial momentum with which Insee now forecasts the French economy will enter the 1995 election year. Two other institutes - OFCE and COE - are estimating growth next year at 3.5 per cent and 3.2 per cent respectively. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, concludes that all this showed 'our diagnosis and therapy were the right ones'. And, indeed, the government deserves praise for not letting the gloom and doom of 1993 rush it into an indiscriminate stimulation package for the economy. However, the government's wise self-restraint also stemmed from the yawning deficits of the central government and welfare system, and from the need to bring them eventually within the bounds prescribed by the Maastricht treaty. The nature of the French recovery has now changed. One of the factors frightening many French companies last year was that they found themselves holding stocks which were actually falling in price. So they started to shed stocks, which in turn cut production even further and so aggravated the mini-recession of 1993. At the start of this year, this destocking started to slow down inside France, but internal demand was still weak and the main boost to growth came from strong external demand for French goods. But the economy is now beginning to fire more strongly on its internal demand piston, and, aptly, nowhere more vigorously than in the automobile sector. This has provided the big surprise. 'It was generally expected that car sales would fall back after a strong second quarter,' said Insee in its mid-October fore- casting note. 'Not a bit of it - registrations, seasonally corrected, have stayed at the same level in the summer as in the spring.' But it is not just Renault and Peugeot benefiting from the upturn. Other more humble leading indicators of recovery, such as demand for packaging cardboard, indicate the breadth of the improvement, which has been sustained through the summer. Output of manu- factures in the July-August period was 1.2 per cent higher than in April-June. And Insee forecasts that household consumption will rise by 1.7 per cent in the second half of this year, after a 0.5 per cent increase in the first half. Psychologically, what has persuaded the French to dip into their wallets and purses has been the stemming, at least, of what had seemed an inexorably rising tide of unemployment. According to Insee, some 120,000 jobs were created in the first half of the year, and perhaps a total of 180,000 to 200,000 over the whole of 1994, thereby slightly shortening the dole queues. Linked to this marginally rosier employment picture is the behaviour of savers. Since mid-1993 France's high savings rate has been falling, reflecting either people's belief in imminent pay rises or, more likely, their relief at not having to keep 'precautionary savings' to guard against imminent unemployment. After falling year on year in the early 1980s, like water cascading down a series of fountains, investment is at last picking up and is expected to accelerate. For instance, OFCE predicts that, on an annual average, 1994 will see only a 0.7 per cent growth in investment, but that by the end of 1994 the level will be 5 per cent higher than at end-1993. This year's rise in long-term rates would have cramped the investment increase, if it were not the fact that most French companies have more than enough cash on hand to fund new capital spending without the bank manager's help. But some experts cast doubt on the duration of this recovery in investment - forecast to increase by 7-9 per cent in 1995. Another worry for the medium-term future is, of course, the budget deficit, which the government intends to rein in to FFr275bn next year or 4.6 per cent of gross domestic product, but which most analysts expect will turn out nearer 5 per cent. In addition to the central government budget, there is also the chronic shortfall in the social security system, which leads a large number of observers to predict tax increases after the May 1995 presidential election. These will probably take the form of a rise in the so-called contribution sociale generalise, a tax levied on all forms of income (earned and unearned) and more and more necessary to balance all the loopholes in the income tax system. But apart from these longer-term shadows, the sky is reasonably clear over the French economy, with one exception - the persistent clouds over French financial markets which have seen 2.5 percentage points added to long-term rates this year and some 15 per cent shaved off the Bourse's 250-company index. There is just an outside danger that further trouble on the markets could hurt the real economy; a further fall in equities would make people feel poorer, with knock-on effects on the property market.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Texaco's Canary Wharf move is on TEXACO, the international oil company, yesterday announced that its UK headquarters will, after all, move to Canary Wharf. One thousand employees will move to the London Docklands office complex in the first quarter of next year. The lease signed by Texaco is a boost for the insolvent office scheme that cost more than Pounds 1.5bn to build. It has suffered a succession of setbacks in recent weeks including the withdrawal of American Express and Chemical Bank, two of its most prominent tenants. Mr Alan Bloom, a joint administrator, said that attracting an international tenant of the standing of Texaco 'will provide a significant boost to our efforts to ensure the scheme's viability'. The agreement followed months of negotiations that started when Canary Wharf went into administration in May. Shortly afterwards Texaco postponed the move to Canary Wharf that it had planned for August, saying that it was 'determined to ensure our relocation is conducted at the right time, in the right way and on the right terms'. Texaco said it was pleased with its new agreement, which met its 'requirements for a headquarters appropriate to the company's long-term needs'. The company's decision to move into Canary Wharf reduces Barclays Bank's Pounds 200m exposure to the project by an estimated Pounds 60m, as the bank had acted as a third party guarantor for Texaco's lease. Texaco is believed to have paid about Pounds 30m for a 1,000-year lease on a 230,000 sq ft building at 1 Westferry Circus, with an option to buy the building or break the lease after six years. It will also rent an extra 30,000 sq ft on two floors at 7 Westferry Circus, the adjacent building. Texaco's decision was not affected by uncertainty surrounding the future of the extension of London Underground's Jubilee Line to east London. 'Although we would like the Jubilee Line extension to be built, we have made our decision on the strength of transport links that are already there,' Texaco said. 'We always had in mind that the Jubilee Line would not be in place until the mid to late 1990s.'</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS PULSE;  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS IN ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> RISKY BUSINESS;  </P> <P> NOT ALL ENTREPRENEURS FIT THE STANDARD DESCRIPTION  </P> <P> So you think you're an entrepreneur?  </P> <P> Well, if you own your own business, you most likely are, even if you don't  quite match the popular perception of the entrepreneur as a quintessential  risk-taking, reward-seeking, enterprising innovator. For while someone like  computer maven Steven Jobs is without question an entrepreneur, not all  entrepreneurs are like Jobs.  </P> <P> Most, however, are small-business owners.  </P> <P> A study by the National Science Foundation shows that most of the innovations  in American business and technology in the past 15 years have come from small  businesses.  </P> <P> And The Times Small Business Poll shows that 64% of all Orange County  small-business owners consider themselves to be risk takers, with 7%  characterizing their management style as "very risk-taking."  </P> <P> But even if your business has succeeded with no risk to your health or wealth,  and even if you wouldn't know an innovation from an innuendo, don't fret.  </P> <P> Not all small-business owners are out to get rich or to take the world by  storm.  </P> <P> There are the mom-and-pop proprietors who want only to have a business that  enables them to pay the bills and live a comfortable life.  </P> <P> There are the middle managers who flee the corporate world to try their hand at  calling all the shots and bearing all the risks.  </P> <P> There are the ambitious immigrants who start a business because they lack the  necessary language and cultural skills to assimilate into the mainstream work  force.  </P> <P> There are those lucky ones who have found in small business a way to pursue and  pay for other, more consuming interests, such as skiing or sailing or  collecting art or antiques.  </P> <P> While small-business owners come in all psychological shapes and sizes,  business specialists say most of them share certain common traits.  </P> <P> "People who start small businesses are creative thinkers, risk takers, people  who are willing to lay it on the line either because they are fed up with what  they are doing or are convinced they have a good idea and can make it work,"  said Terry Hill, spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business.  </P> <P> "They are the people with a passion for what they're doing," said Arthur  Perrone, vice chairman of the Geneva Cos. in Newport Beach. "It often costs  them several families and part of their stomach, but they have that passion."  </P> <P> Appearing on this page and the next are profiles of Orange County proprietors  who embody the many characteristics of small-business owners everywhere.  </P> <P> The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates  of Irvine. For this survey, a mail questionnaire was sent March 24 to a random  sample of small businesses. The survey sample was selected from the "Commercial  and Industrial Directory" provided by the Orange County Chamber of Commerce.  Surveys were addressed to the highest officer named for companies in Orange  County with 50 or fewer employees. Before the sample was selected, branch  offices and franchises were removed from the mailing list. By the close of the  study on April 21, 522 surveys were returned. The distribution of responses  closely reflects the company characteristics of the original mailing list and  survey sample.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Risky Business  </P> <P> How Did You Get Started?  </P> <P> Family Business: 10%  </P> <P> Hired into Firm: 19%  </P> <P> Bought In: 15%  </P> <P> Founded the Company: 56%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Your Approach?  </P> <P> "How would you describe your approach to management?"  </P> <P> Somewhat Risk-Taking: 57%  </P> <P> Somewhat Cautious: 31%  </P> <P> Very Cautious 4%  </P> <P> Very Risk-Taking: 7%  </P> <P> Source: Times Small Business Poll  </P></p>

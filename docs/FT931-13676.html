			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Letter: Coal: cabinet tinkering when competition should be the aim Sir, One of the justifications often advanced by ministers for the government's privatisation programme was the removal of the various undertakings' tariffs to a place of safety in the private sector. No longer, we were told, would cabinets be able to tinker with utilities' prices to achieve fiscal objectives as they had done in the past. Politicians should re-read their old speeches before they adopt the pusillanimous option of subsiding coal through a levy on electricity bills. The honest approach would be to identify any assistance as a component of the public sector borrowing requirement. That would have the added virtue of avoiding an unfair hike in the running costs of my members' many products to the artificial benefit of the gas appliance and supply industry.

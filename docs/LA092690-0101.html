			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: BRADLEY, BARRETT NAMED TOP WSC PLAYERS ON OFFENSE  </P> <P> Freddie Bradley of Moorpark College and Jeff Barrett of Santa Monica have been  named the Western State Conference's co-offensive players of the week.  </P> <P> Bradley rushed for 205 yards in 19 carries and scored three touchdowns in a  41-10 victory over Valley on Saturday night.  </P> <P> Barrett, a sophomore from Burroughs High, completed 16 of 21 passes for 302  yards and five touchdowns in a 53-26 victory over Compton. Barrett was named  the conference's offensive player of the week the previous week.  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge women's volleyball team will take on U.S. International in  San Diego tonight at 6. The Matadors (10-5) are coming off a three-game sweep  of the University of San Diego in which Marianne Dixon had 17 kills and six  blocks. USIU is 4-9.  </P> <P> Right-side hitter Shelly Swalec is doubtful for tonight's match because of a  strained muscle.  </P> <P> "We feel like we're ready, tactically," CSUN Coach Walt Ker said. "The key for  us tonight is to execute. Our outside hitting has been a bright spot, but it's  also been inconsistent."  </P> <P> Greg Seiler has resigned as Cal Lutheran sports information director to take a  similar position at Mars Hill College in Mars Hill, N. C.  </P></p>

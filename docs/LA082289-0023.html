			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> BOLIVIAN ENSEMBLE PRESENTS QUECHUAN MELODIES  </P> <P> With the help of amplification and a few chord progressions and rhythms not  necessarily indigenous to the Andes, a jazzed-up version of Quechuan music from  Bolivia was handsomely displayed by the quintet Rumillajta (pronounced  khoo-mi-YAH-ta) Sunday evening at the Wadsworth Theater.  </P> <P> The native-Bolivian ensemble -- Adrian Villanueva, Juan Jorge Laura, Nester  Tintayea, Juan Carlos Cordero and Miguel Angel Puna -- performed a lively,  spirited set of eight original selections, all with short titles such as "The  Condor."  </P> <P> Several different sizes of antaras -- a Quechuan form of panpipe -- produced a  wide range of different sounds from a breathy whisper in which pitch was almost  indiscernible to loud reedy blasts executed with such force that wind blew the  players' bangs into the air. Puna, Tintaya and Villanueva huffed and puffed on  the antaras, along with other various recorders and flutes, deftly exchanging  notes of a melody (much like a hocket) and punctuating with scattered  vocalizing and beating on a drum called the bombo.  </P> <P> Laura fluidly provided virtuosic pluckings on his charango, a 10-string  mandolin-like instrument made from an armadillo shell. Cordero accompanied on  guitar with appropriate strums and passages idiomatic to Latin folk music.  </P> <P> The only glaring shortcoming of the evening was in programing. Rumillajta's  tuneful, rhythmic music, indeed accessible to the ethno-pop world, was  awkwardly paired with Brazilian pop crooner-guitarist Dori Caymmi.  </P> <P> Caymmi's headlined part of the program, broadcast live over jazz radio station  KKGO, contained little that matched the originality or virtuosity of  Rumillajta. Backed up by a rock quartet, Caymmi hoarsely but sincerely sang a  collection of original songs, all in an innocuous, middle-of-the-road pop  style. GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Palestinians secure Dollars 600m aid package INTERNATIONAL donors have agreed a Dollars 600m aid package in grants and loans for the occupied territories for 1994, according to Mr Avraham Shochat, Israel's finance minister. The sum is part of a five year Dollars 2.5bn external financing programme, agreed in Washington this month, for the interim period of Palestinian self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank. Mr Shochat said the incoming Palestinian authority might be able to draw money from the budget before 1994 to assist in the creation of a Palestinian police force. A substantial part of the budget would also be allocated to spending on education, health and social services by a Palestinian authority which will take over from the Israeli military-run administration when the Israelis withdraw from the Gaza Strip and Jericho by April 13. An international steering committee will meet in Paris on November 5 to hammer out details of disbursing the aid. The committee is expected to be chaired by Norway and assisted by the World Bank, which is carrying out extensive research on the needs of the occupied territories and the possible mechanisms of disbursement. Two crucial problems facing international donors are the lack of a Palestinian implementing authority and the question of who will sign for loans to a Palestinian administration, which will not be recognised as a government. Mr Shochat said that Israel, which is contributing Dollars 25m of aid and Dollars 50m of political insurance or guarantees to Israeli investors over five years, was concerned about the possible shortfall of taxation revenues in the early days of a Palestinian authority and was stressing the importance of meeting recurrent expenditures currently paid for from tax revenues collected by Israel in the territories and subventions from the Israeli treasury. 'To enable the population in the territories to support the peace agreement they must see something change from the economic point of view in investments, job creation and standard of living,' Mr Shochat said. The minister said the steering committee would try to avoid approving projects which did not directly serve the pressing economic needs of the territories and would press governments to provide insurance cover to private companies which would have to be the engine of growth. A separate Palestinian-Israeli ministerial economic committee would also meet soon, Mr Shochat said, to discuss the broader issues of macro-economic policy between the two sides such as migrant labour, harmonisation of taxation and currency. Mr Shochat said multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the European Development Bank would be the key implementing agencies of infrastructure projects.</p>

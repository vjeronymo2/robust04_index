			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: McCaw reduces first-quarter loss to Dollars 14m MCCAW Cellular, the largest cellular telecommunications company in the US, yesterday reported strong increases in revenue and cash flow from its cellular operations, along with a much-reduced first quarter net loss of just Dollars 14m, against Dollars 99m last year, writes Martin Dickson in New York. The fast-growing, heavily indebted business, which prefers analysts to focus on cash flow from its cellular interests - income before depreciation and amortisation and interest charges - said this figure totalled Dollars 163.6m, up from Dollars 113m. Cellular revenues rose 31 per cent, from Dollars 276.6m to Dollars 363.1m. Mr Craig McCaw, chairman, said the company was pleased with the continued growth in subscriber revenues and operating cash flow.</p>

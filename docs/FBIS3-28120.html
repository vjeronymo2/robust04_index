			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The government of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa faced the possibility of collapse on  Thursday [3 February] after the largest coalition partner  threatened to quit the cabinet over his new tax plan.    The crisis delayed the announcement of a long-awaited  economic stimulus package because the new "national welfare tax"  is designed to finance a planned 6 trillion yen reduction in  income and residential tax, the focus of the economic  pump-primer reportedly totaling some 15 trillion yen.    Representatives of the seven coalition parties continued  last- ditch negotiations to try to break the deadlock Thursday  night.    Hosokawa expressed willingness to modify the new tax plan  following a threat from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of  Japan -- SDPJ], the largest force in the coalition, that it  would withdraw its six cabinet ministers unless Hosokawa drops  the new tax plan.    The premier said the SDP is "important" for the coalition,  adding, "If the ruling coalition tells me to do something, I am  not concerned about saving face," according to Akio Nakajima, a  House of Representatives member of Hosokawa's Japan New Party  [JNP].    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news  conference the government is ready to change the details of the  new indirect tax.    The chief cabinet spokesman said the administration is ready  "to correct the wrong" if it helps to ensure the unity of the  coalition and alleviate public distaste for the new tax proposal.    Hosokawa announced early Thursday without getting consent  from the SDP that his coalition government has decided to  introduce the 7 percent "national welfare tax" to finance the  planned 6 trillion yen tax cut in place of the consumption tax.    Hosokawa said the government wants to introduce the new tax  on goods and services on April 1, 1997.    The SDP said the "welfare tax" is nothing more than the  renaming of the 3 percent consumption tax because its mechanism  is almost identical to that of the consumption tax.    The SDP, which has insisted on the abolition of the  consumption tax, bolstered its parliamentary strength in a 1989  House of Councillors election shortly after then Prime Minister  Noboru Takeshita introduced the tax.    In the negotiations the SDP demanded nullifying the rate of  7  percent and the timing of implementation of the new tax and  setting up a consultative body to discuss the tax.    But the talks stalled because the Finance Ministry stuck to  the rate of 7 percent, coalition sources said.    Aside from the SDP, opposition to the new tax was voiced by  the JNP and Sakigake (Harbinger), both coalition partners, at a  meeting of their legislators.    SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo and his Democratic  Socialist Party counterpart Takashi Yonezawa agreed that it  would be best to nullify the new 7 percent tax, coalition  officials said.    Yonezawa conveyed the accord to Hosokawa by telephone and  urged renewed talks on the tax plan.    Shinseito, a key party in the coalition, and Komeito took  the  leadership in formulating the new tax, and the subsequent row  has revealed a power struggle within the coalition, political  analysts said.    The political crisis came after the six-month-old fragile  Hosokawa government overcame another crisis over political  reform last week.    Hosokawa managed last Saturday to hang onto power by  reaching  a last-ditch deal over the government's political reform bills  with the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party.    The prime minister told reporters after the passage of the  bills that he had no intention of raising the consumption tax.    Hosokawa scored high public approval ratings following his  success in enacting the political reform bills in late January.    Some political analysts attributed the crisis to his  arrogance.    The SDP has been frustrated after being forced to accept  compromises over key issues such as the opening of Japan's rice  market last year and political reform in January since joining  the seven-party coalition last August.    The party said in December that it opposed a GATT compromise  proposal on partially opening the rice market, but had no choice  but to abide by Hosokawa's decision to accept the plan.    The party was forced to accept a compromise plan on  political  reform bills reached between Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei  Kono for fear that SDP opposition might bring about the collapse  of the coalition government.</p>

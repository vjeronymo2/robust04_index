			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Slovak Foreign Affairs Minister </F> Eduard Kukan by an unidentified correspondent; place and date  not given]    [Text] Eduard Kukan said that his official visit to three  Arab countries, which to a certain extent followed the January  official visit to Israel of Jozef Moravcik, who was then Slovak  foreign minister, had two main objectives.    The first was to demonstrate Slovak support for the Middle  East peace process, although our country does not overestimate  its influence on developments in this region. What was more  important was to demonstrate interest in developing mutual  relations, which had been stagnating after the demise of  Czechoslovakia, as well as a certain enhancement of the economic  dimension of our foreign policy.    The Arab world is a prospective trade partner and is very  interested in cooperating with our country. This was confirmed,  among other things, for example, during the talks our foreign  minister had with Egyptian President Mubarak and Syrian  President al-Asad.    It should be added in this connection that the Slovak  economy  has a chance of stepping up cooperation with the Palestinian  autonomous regions, which will start building their  infrastructure in the near future. Through Egypt or Jordan, our  companies might start getting involved even in this direction.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Architecture: Palladio attracts pilgrims - The influence of an oddly neglected Venetian genius I think it must be because you know that you are in the presence of perfection. At this time of the year Italy beckons to anyone interested in architecture and it is as good a time as any for a Palladian pilgrimage. Palladio was born in Padua in 1508 and he died in Venice in 1580. His career spans the whole period of the High Renaissance but somehow throughout his working life he retained a rare humility and did not enjoy the kind of fame that was received by the great Renaissance architects Michelangelo and Bramante. You only have to visit the Veneto and read a little about his life to realise why. He never trained as an architect but learnt first the skills of a stonemason. It is an astonishing career - rising up from the solid foundations of the workshop to become the leading architect of Venice. His work was regionally based, confined to the north of Italy - mainly in Venice and around Vicenza. He built palaces and great churches as well as villas. It took time for the young architect to become accepted and his gradual rise follows the acceptance of Renaissance classicism as the style of the day. In Vicenza you can see the classical style creeping up on the gothic. It may just be some Corinthian columns on a gothic loggia but gradually full bloodied classicism arrives. Look at the Palazzo Thiene in Vicenza which Palladio gradually modified in the 1540's. In its inner atrium are the familiar Palladian vaults and on the upper storey the composite pilasters, balustrade and cornice are the first signs of a typical Palladian design. At the beginning of the sixteenth century the Venetians faced a severe collapse in their fortunes through war against their trading empire and papal interdict. Rich Venetians looked for ways of multiplying their wealth by investing outside the city. As the century progressed, agriculture and land were the preferred investments over trade and it was this that marked the beginning of the growth of the villas of the Veneto. It was luck that the right architect was around to design these villas and to define them as one of greatest contributions to Western civilisation. There was also interest in the idea of a civilised country life and a humanist fascination with the conjunction of arts and agriculture. The Palladian villa was born. Palladio's influence in this area is so great that it continues to influence the country house and a particular ideal of life in the country. At the Villa Gazzotti Marcello Curti, at Betesina near Vicenza, Palladio stuck a classical facade onto the front of a brick box. It was the first use of temple pediment and in its use of brick and sandstone represents the early essence of the Palladian style. It was also an early villa where the farm was at the centre of things and the granary was likely to be in the roof of the villa itself. The Villa Saraceno at Finale near Vicenza is a near-perfect example of the genre just restored by the British charity, the Landmark Trust. It still has some of its farmland and is an example of a house built by someone in the 1540s who did not have a great deal of spare money to spend on the facade. Its austerity is, to my eyes, magical. The frescoed rooms remain and to stand in the painted portico is to experience an understanding of the nature of arcadian life and art. As the Landmark Trust lets the villa for holidays, this experience is now available to any one wanting a 'Landmark holiday.' It is important not to miss the Basilica in Vicenza where Palladio underwent a crucial architectural test. In 1546 the city fathers decided democratically to complete the arcades of the city's palace. But Palladio did not get the job that easily. A trial bay of the arcades was built on the site in the form of a full-size wooden model. The city had a chance to look and to criticise the scheme before there was any hope of it going ahead. No modern architect ever has to undergo such a rigorous process of approval today. The end result is one of the finest civic buildings in Europe. Proof of the wisdom of popular taste? Once you have seen Vicenza and all the villas of the Veneto, it is time to leave terra firma and cross to Venice. Here the Palladian masterpieces are churches. If you stand by the Punta della Dogana, better known as the Old Custom House, at the entrance to the Grand Canal you see one of the finest architectural panoramas in the world. Along with the glories of the Doge's Palace and the Library of San Marco, there stands San Giorgio Maggiore and to the west the church of the Redentore. Both of these are by Palladio and both are calm masterpieces. Inside, both of these gloriously composed buildings are austerely beautiful. The interiors are cool, grey and white. Their limpid beauty lit by the reflected light from the canals of Venice is something no one ever forgets. Palladio has recently been thoroughly examined in a brilliant new book that should be read before undertaking any tour. Palladio, The Architect in his Time by Bruce Boucher is published by Abbeville Press and John Murray.</p>

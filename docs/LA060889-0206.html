			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ROSTENKOWSKI MAY ACCEPT DEAL ON CAPITAL-GAINS TAX  </P> <P> Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, who traditionally has viewed the capital-gains tax  preference as the ultimate plaything of the rich, is signaling a change of  heart may be on the way -- if the price is right.  </P> <P> The price might require President Bush to back away from his campaign pledge  not to raise taxes. Even in that unlikely event, some members of the House Ways  and Means Committee, which Rostenkowski chairs, said today that they would be  reluctant to accept any such bargain, even as part of a deficit-reduction  measure.  </P> <P> For the moment, however, Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) is indicating a willingness to  at least discuss the question with Bush, a former committee colleague.  </P> <P> "He doesn't like a lower tax rate for capital gains," an aide to Rostenkowski  insisted today. "But could it ever be acceptable? The answer is yes -- if the  President offered in return something so attractive to Democrats that they  couldn't turn it down."  </P> <P> The aide said he is not sure that Rostenkowski's position has changed all that  much. Despite a long record of criticizing the capital-gains benefit,  Rostenkowski "never says never," the staff member said.  </P> <P> The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 80% of the tax cut  under Bush's capital-gains proposal would go to those with incomes of more than  $100,000 a year.  </P></p>

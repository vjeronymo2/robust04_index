			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] On 23 May, ROK vernacular newspapers  carry articles on the current situation of the money flow to  North Korea by the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) and its power struggle.    On page 23, the moderate HANGUK ILBO carries an 800-word  article by reporter Hong Yun-o on the 39th anniversary of the  founding of Chongnyon which is 25 May. The article starts off  by noting that there are moves in Chongnyon's organization  because of the fact that the work to repatriate Korean residents  in Japan to North Korea has failed, that North Korea is falling  into isolation, and that moves are being made for sanctions  against North Korea by the international community. Citing  NAEWOE News Agency, the article notes that celebrations of the  39th anniversary of Chongnyon's founding will be held without  its chairman, Han Tok-su, who is currently in Pyongyang amid  various rumors. It notes that currently the responsible Vice  Chairman Ho Chong-man is actually leading the group since it  changed its organization in 1992 to a one-man chairman and a  nine-men vice chairmen system. The article concludes by saying  that a stumbling block in normalizing Japan-North Korean  relations stems from the fact that North Korea has even  prohibited Japanese women married to Chongnyon members from  visiting Japan freely.    On page 8, the pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries a  900-word  article by reporter Ku Pon-yong from the "North Korea Today"  column on the intense power struggle within Chongnyon. The  article begins by noting that since Chongnyon Chairman Han  Tok-su returned to Pyongyang, internal discord has intensified.  The article continues to speculate why Han Tok-su, who has  diverted Chongnyon's assets to his aides and under his name,  returned to Pyongyang, noting that since he has a hold of  Chongnyon's assets, he must not be irritated. It notes that  there are signs that Ho Chong-man, who emerged as Chongnyon's  responsible vice chairman, is being supported by Kim Chong-il,  and his opposing forces will be at odds with each other for  power within Chongnyon. It notes that originally First Vice  Chairman Yi Chin-kyu was to take Han Tok-su's place, but rather  Ho Chong-man, who is well versed in Chongnyon's money flow, was  appointed. The article says Chongnyon's businessmen speculate  that the appointment of Ho Chong-man is an advance measure to  shelter Chongnyon's assets for North Korea, thus some Chongnyon  businessmen are filing lawsuits to recover real estate which  they donated to Chongnyon. The article concludes by saying that  movements to urge to guarantee human rights within North Korea  and others which are being promoted centering on human rights  organizations in Japan are other elements that are accelerating  unrest within Chongnyon.    On page 4, the moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries a  1,200-word article by reporter No Ung-kun on the scale of  Japan's remittance of money to North Korea. The article  introduces an article carried by Japan's contemporary economic  journal, NIKKEI BUSINESS, on how much money is actually being  sent to North Korea by Japan. It notes that no one knows the  exact amount of money being remitted, but experts predict it to  be around $1.8 billion annually. The article continues to cite  NIKKEI BUSINESS saying that the money sent to North Korea by  Chongnyon is about $600-700 million, and that a larger amount of  money is remitted to North Korea through a third country.    On page 20, KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries a 1,400-word article  by  reporter Kim Pung-son from the "North Korean News" column on why  Han Tok-su, Chongnyon's number one man, was returned to North  Korea. The article starts off by saying that the reason for his  return may be to bring in Chongnyon's assets to North Korea.  The article carries an analysis made by NAEWOE News Agency on  why Han Tok-su returned to North Korea. The first analysis is  that if Han Tok-su remains in Japan, it may have a bad influence  in consolidating the Kim Chong-il succession system. The second  analysis is that it is to restructure Chongnyon's organization  and return Han Tok-su's enormous assets to North Korea. The  analysis then writes about Han Tok-su's influence and about  appointing Ho Chong-man as Chongnyon's responsible vice  chairman. It continues to write about Ho Chong-man's ambition,  his position at Chongnyon, and his faithfulness to Chongnyon.</p>

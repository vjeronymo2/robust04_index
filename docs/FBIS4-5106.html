			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [NAEWOE Press Agency] </F>   [Text] It was learned that smuggling in the border area  between North Korea and China has increased rapidly, lately.    Major items for smuggling are China's chief daily  necessities, such as training suits, fabric for Western clothes,  underwear, and socks. These goods are smuggled into black  markets in Pyongyang and other major cities of North Korea.    In cities bordering China, particularly in Sinuiju and  Hyesan, even youth and students are involved in the smuggling.  So much so that the saying "senior high school students are  excellent smugglers" is very much in vogue in these cities.    The smuggling in the border area is being conducted mainly  by  the ethnic Koreans living in China, and it has rapidly expanded  since it is possible to smuggle those Chinese articles into  Pyongyang with only a small bribe. As a result, smuggled  Chinese items have become so popular that almost all residents  in Sinuiju and Hyesan are wearing at least one Chinese item of  clothing.    Meanwhile, it has been learned that South Korean goods are  among the contraband smuggled into North Korea from China.  South Korean trademarks are torn off prior to being smuggled  into North Korea, and training shoes and socks seem to be some  of the major South Korean items being smuggled in, according to  a source. Those South Korean goods sell at high prices -- two  or three times the price of Chinese goods -- because of their  good quality.    Those found to be using South Korean goods are regarded as  political criminals and are sent to a camp for political  criminals. Despite this regulation, the number of users of South  Korean goods is ever increasing because of a shortage in daily  necessities in North Korea.</p>

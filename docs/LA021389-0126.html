			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 4 JAPAN EXECUTIVES ARRESTED IN STOCK AND BRIBERY SCANDAL  </P> <P> The founder of Recruit Co. and three other businessmen were arrested today in a  stock-trading scandal that has shaken Japan's governing party and contributed  to its loss in a special parliamentary election.  </P> <P> Recruit reportedly sold tens of thousands of unlisted shares of stock at  bargain prices to politicians, their aides and other prominent people. The  purchasers then profited when the stocks were publicly traded and skyrocketed  in value. The scandal has also involved direct political donations by Recruit.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said they today arrested Hiromasa Ezoe, founder and former chairman  of the information services conglomerate. Also arrested were a vice president  of a Recruit subsidiary and two former officials of Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone, Japan's largest company.  </P> <P> The Recruit officials were arrested on suspicion of giving bribes, the two  Nippon officials in connection with receiving bribes, news reports said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taken From Hospital  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Ezoe was taken from a hospital where he had been under  treatment for exhaustion since the scandal was uncovered last summer.  </P> <P> Three Cabinet ministers and more than a dozen other prominent politicians and  businessmen have since resigned in the scandal, which has led to broader  questions about political fund-raising and links between business and politics.  </P> <P> The country's largest opposition party, victorious in Sunday's by-election,  demanded today that Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita resign or dissolve  Parliament "so the people can express their will" about the Recruit scandal.  </P> <P> Takako Doi, head of the Japan Socialist Party, told Parliament that her party's  victory in the election in Fukuoka in southern Japan showed that the public has  lost faith in the corruption-tainted Takeshita administration.  </P> <P> The balloting was widely seen as a test of the damage done by the scandal.  </P> <P> Takeshita refused to dissolve Parliament, which would mean calling new  elections for its lower house.  </P> <P> "The election (Sunday) showed that people in Fukuoka won't put up with any more  (of Takeshita's policies)," Doi told cheering opposition lawmakers today.  "Either the entire Cabinet must resign, or the prime minister must dissolve  Parliament so the people can express their will."  </P> <P> A dissolution of the Diet, Japan's Parliament, would force an election for the  lower house, where Takeshita's governing Liberal Democratic Party has more than  300 of the 512 seats. An election is scheduled in July for half of the seats in  the upper house, which cannot be dissolved.  </P></p>

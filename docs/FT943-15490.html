			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: RBOS bought deal Big market action in Royal Bank of Scotland shares led to intense speculation that Smith New Court, one of the London market's most aggressive marketmakers, had taken on a block of 20m RBOS shares, equal to 2.5 per cent of RBOS's issued capital, via a bought deal and sought to place them in the market. No details of the trade were forthcoming, but the Seaq ticker revealed that upwards of 15m shares had been placed in the market at 412p and that there was a strong possibility that the remaining stock was left with the securities house. Talk that the stock had come from Schroders, the merchant bank, were dismissed by the market, but there were strong suggestions that Scottish Equitable, the investment institution, might be the seller. RBOS shares lost 8 at 418p. Other banks eased as institutions reduced holdings in order to pick up what was seen by some fund managers as cheap stock. Lloyds dipped 2 to 538p. General Accident was again actively traded, the stock sliding 5 to 566p amid strong market rumours that one of the City's biggest agency brokers had tried in vain to place a block of 5m shares in the insurance group, around 1.1 per cent of the issued capital, at 570p a share. There were also suggestions that the stock would be offered in the market this morning at 560p a share. Other composites were unsettled by talk that one big UK integrated house had published a bearish note on the sector. Royal slipped 6 to 246p. Merchant banks gave another strong performance, still boosted by the recent BZW buy note. Schroders, after announcing that it was acquiring the rest of Schroder Wertheim, the US investment bank, rose 14 to 1165p. Kleinwort Benson put on 15 at 457p, while SG Warburg added 9 at 706p. Profit-taking saw Wellcome shares dip 7 to 601p. Smith &amp; Nephew consolidated recent outperformance on perception that the company has managed to avoid the margin pressures faced by more high profile rivals. The shares edged ahead to 141 1/2 p. A buy note from Robert Fleming Securities continued to drive BT shares, which rose 10 more to 393p on heavy turnover of 10m. The partly-paids added 8 1/2 to 273p, on 5.9m. Media conglomerate Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, bounced 12 to 582p after sustained weakness. BZW said the shares were worth 620p in the short term and dealers said Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were also recommending the stock. Advertising agency Gold Greenlees Trott put on 5 at 182p after full year profits came in lower than the previous year's but above forecasts. Analysts were also heartened by new UK accounts won by the company. GKN advanced 12 to 581p after James Capel reiterated its buy recommendation following news of a joint venture with Fiat. The broker also favours T &amp; N, a penny ahead at 236p. Lucas Industries rose 8 to 182p after a favourable presentation at Credit Lyonnais Laing. British Airways and airports group BAA powered ahead after a Smith New Court recommendation and favourable passenger traffic figures. Shares in the former put on 9 at 412p on volume of 7.6m, while the latter gained 15 at 918p on 1.6m. Volume in industrial group BTR rose to 5.3m and it closed 5 ahead at 372p after news that the European Commission had reduced its 1992 fine on subsidiary Dunlop Slazenger.</p>

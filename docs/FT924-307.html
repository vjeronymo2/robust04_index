			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Inner cities win easier terms on loan guarantees The government is to ease the terms of the Loan Guarantee Scheme in inner city areas from next April, writes Charles Batchelor. It will make the scheme available on more advantageous terms in a larger number of areas and reduce the premiums charged. At the same time, it will tighten up on other terms of the scheme. It will set a minimum level of Pounds 5,000 on the size of loan which can be guaranteed in all areas outside the inner cities and will ban loans in sectors where existing firms may be pushed out of business. This ban applies to the entire country, including inner cities, and covers retailing, hairdressing, taxi and cab hire and motor vehicle repair. Under the scheme, the government guarantees 70 per cent of loans made by banks to businesses which do not meet conventional security requirements. In inner city areas the guarantee covers 85 per cent of the loan. The government has paid out Pounds 177m in guarantees since the scheme was launched in 1981 and has made possible loans worth Pounds 980m to more than 32,000 small firms. When the scheme was first launched the banks and the government had to write off many loans and the terms of the guarantee were tightened up. Despite the large number of loans made, the scheme has not been popular with many bank managers. It has also been criticised by business support organisations because, far from providing low-cost loans to businesses on the lines of similar schemes in other countries, guarantee scheme funding has been more expensive. From next April, the 85 per cent guarantee will be extended to include the 31 successful City Challenge areas as well as the 16 task force areas at present covered. The premium payable on new loans in all these areas will be reduced from 2 to 1 per cent. Outside the inner cities a Pounds 5,000 minimum level will be set on loans because small amounts of loan capital are available from other sources. The decision to exclude certain types of business from the scheme has resulted from studies which showed that new start-ups in sectors such as hairdressing simply put existing firms out of business.

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Buoyant' aluminium forecast ALUMINIUM INDUSTRY demand will soon recover and the industry will experience a period of buoyant prices, which will enable it to deal with a large backlog of investment that needs to be undertaken, according to the Anthony Bird consultancy organisation in its latest market review. Primary aluminium demand is forecast to grow at an annual 3.4 per cent during the next ten years, fractionally less than the 3.6 per cent growth Bird sees for world industrial production growth. Demand will increase in bursts rather than in a steady stream. Exports from the former communist countries, at present a hugely disturbing factor in the market, are forecast by Bird to disappear by 1999. It estimates that exports from the old eastern bloc reached 818,000 tonnes last year, are likely to fall nearly one third to 567,000 tonnes in 1992, and then fall down to 407,000 tonnes next year. Bird points out that presently low aluminium prices have caused smelter construction to slow sharply. When projects in the pipeline are completed, capacity will stop growing for a time. It suggests the planned rate of annual capacity growth to 2002 is 1.7 per cent, well below forecast demand growth. However, Bird believes more high-cost European smelters will close unless they make substantial cost savings. Bird calculates that western smelters need 69 cents per lb to cover operating costs and this will soon rise to 77 cents. However, the London Metal Exchange spot price is forecast to average only 57.6 cents a lb, rising to 66.8 cents in 1993. The report says: 'Aluminium prices must rise towards a level that will make investment possible'. It predicts that the average price during the 1994-2002 period will be slightly more than 86 cents a lb in constant March 1992 money and at current exchange rates.

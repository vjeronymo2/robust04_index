			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladivostok, May 30, RIA -- A TNT-5 tanker with  liquid radioactive wastes has been tugged to far roads in the  Pavlovskiy harbour from the wharves of the "Zvezda" plant in the  city of Bolshoy Kamen. The operation to move the vessel to a  safe place was ordered by the Pacific Fleet command after the  workers of the plant and the mass media spread concern over a  possible spill of radioactive wastes into the sea. Even though  after a careful inspection of the vessel specialists did not  register any increased radioactivity or the penetration of sea  water into the containers with wastes, it was decided to take  the tanker away from the shore.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Khartoum, 25 May (SUNA) -- The Foreign Ministry  yesterday summoned the Egyptian ambassador to Khartoum to convey  the ministry's protest over two statements issued by the  Egyptian Foreign Ministry on legal action taken by the relevant  Sudanese authorities against various establishments housing  Egyptian nationals in Khartoum. This move was consistent with  Sudan's tenancy and leasing laws.    The ministry stressed to the Egyptian ambassador that these  actions were taken within the framework of Sudan's tenancy and  leasing laws and that the issue should not be misinterpreted and  politicized. The ministry also emphasized that no one had been  expelled, contrary to the contents of the two above-mentioned  statements.    The ministry told the ambassador that the Egyptian media had  treated the issue with exaggerated sensitivity and had accused  the Sudanese Government of tackling the issue in a manner which  went against international norms.    The ministry stressed that the Egyptian side's issuance of  two different statements on the same subject, which were  distorted, was inconsistent with international and diplomatic  norms.

Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, said  yesterday. He has ordered a two-year study into whether the  spending of billions to protect this country and its servicemen  abroad would be justified.    Mr. Rifkind added that a study was also under way to examine  the possible purchase of stand-off cruise missiles, another  expensive option. He emphasised that ballistic-missile  technology was not confined just to those countries that Britain  had "traditionally regarded as threatening us".    The need for a ballistic-missile defence system is based on  the assumption that such countries as Libya or Iraq, within  potential range of Britain, could pose a threat within ten years  or so. More than 20 countries are known to be buying or  developing ballistic-missile systems.    During the Cold War, Britain's strategy against a Soviet  missile attack was based on deterrence. The possession of  Polaris and its replacement Trident missile system was thought  sufficient to deter the Soviet Union from launching a nuclear  attack.    In the post-Cold War era, the threat could come from  countries prepared to call Britain's bluff and launch an attack,  gambling that the Government would not retaliate with a  strategic Trident missile. Partly to meet this threat, the  Ministry of Defence intends to convert some Trident missiles  into sub-strategic, shorter-range systems.    The new study will examine which countries are likely to  acquire effective missile systems, whether they pose a threat to  Britain, what warheads they might have (nuclear, chemical,  biological or conventional) and if a defensive system is  affordable. Although there is no estimate, a national system  could cost several billion pounds.    Addressing the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College,  London, Mr. Rifkind said ballistic-missile defence had moved  from the "Star Wars" projects of Cold War days to programmes  with more limited scope.

These accidents differ  substantially from the circumstances that caused the catastrophe  in the completely different type of reactor in Chernobyl,  according to the reply to a written question from the group  "Alliance 90/The Greens." The tests were preceded by lengthy  and thorough preparations and had been approved by the  authorities. The experimental core meltdown was taking place in  a test capsule which is placed in the core of the research  reactor and screened from the effects of heat and pressure.  According to the federal government, the reactor supplied only  the neutron radiation of the test capsule required for the  experiment. The radioactive substances produced in this capsule  would be discharged from the reactor in pipelines. Their  behavior would then be examined in pipelines and containers  representing on a smaller scale the primary circuit and the  safety vessels of light water reactor nuclear power stations.    The experiment was being carried out to identify all the  chemical and physical processes that are important for fission  product behavior. The data will be used to test and if  necessary, improve computer programs with which extremely  unlikely accident courses with core meltdowns can be described.  The purpose of these programs was to analyze the cause of  accidents in nuclear power plants and to assess the efficiency  of countermeasures. Control over the test procedure would be  guaranteed by temperature measuring points which do not heat up  outside the screened test facility. The project is being funded  by institutions from France (55 percent), Japan, South Korea,  and the USA (together 15 percent) and the Commission of the  European Community (30 percent).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese official in  charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs Lu Ping here today  encouraged women and other people here to make contributions to  the smooth transfer of power of Hong Kong in 1997.    During his visit to Hong Kong Federation of Women here this  afternoon, Lu Ping, deputy director and secretary-general of the  preliminary working committee (PWC) of the Preparatory Committee  of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, urged the  organization to unite more women to work for the transition,  including publicizing the principle of "one country, two  systems" and the Basic Law.    The establishment of the PWC provides opportunities for Hong  Kong people to do their shares in this regards, he said.    Lu Ping completed a busy schedule today after attending the  political and economic affairs panels' meetings of the PWC from  Monday to Thursday.    He had discussions with PWC members, deputies to the Chinese  National People's Congress and members of the national committee  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He  delivered a speech at a luncheon given in his honor by five  major chambers of commerce here and had discussions with  representatives of the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association  this evening.</p>

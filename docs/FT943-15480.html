			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: When investors just have to pay - It's decision time at Kleinwort Decision time is approaching rapidly for holders of shares in the Kleinwort European Privatisation investment trust. The second 50p instalment is due on August 1 but the shares start trading as fully-paid from July 18. So, anyone selling after this date will have to stump up the extra 50p in any case. The basic choice for shareholders is between paying the instalment and keeping the shares in the hope the lost ground will be regained, or cutting losses and selling up before the extra cash is due. Both strategies have their price: the former carries the 50p a share cost while the latter involves waving goodbye to the 36 per cent of your original investment lost since the trust was launched. Investors initially bought packages at 250p, including five half-paid shares and one warrant. The same package is now worth about 159p. Your choice should depend on your long-term view of the fund's prospects, but the one option not recommended is complete inaction. That way, you could forfeit your shares altogether. An alternative strategy if you cannot afford (or are not willing) to pay the cash call, but still believe in the fund's investment strategy, would be to sell the shares but keep the warrants, which were issued 'free' in the initial offer. They have traded as high as 49p, just after the fund was launched, but are now down to 25.5p. Each warrant allows you to subscribe for one share at 100p on January 31 in any of the years between 1995 and 2006. When the actual share price rises above 100p, the warrants' intrinsic worth leaps up. Investors can either exercise the warrants when the time is ripe or sell them in the open market. By retaining just the warrants, your level of immediate exposure to the fund is low, but you keep a highly-geared stake in its capital growth. The huge quantities of money attracted by the fund's first instalment have taken some time to place in European markets, but it is now 98.5 per cent invested. At end-June, the main holdings were in France (24 per cent), Germany (21), the UK (18) and Scandinavia (15). By sector, the greatest weighting is in utilities, with 23.3 per cent. Financials account for 20.3 per cent, followed by telecommunications (14.5) and capital goods and basic industry (10.1 each). The largest single holding is in KPN, the recently privatised Dutch posts and telecoms group, with 4.5 per cent, followed by the Danish Teledanmark and Austria's VA Technology, each with 3.7 per cent.</p>

Unfortunately, when they arrived, the only  vehicle on show was a BMW; of the Rover there was, initially at  least, no sign.    Rover's departure is something BAe executives have been  privately looking forward to for some time. But it will be fear  that Rover, submerged within BMW, may eventually disappear from  the UK, taking with it technological expertise and jobs, that  will concern the Labour party, trade union leaders and Rover's  30,000 employees.    Among City analysts, though, there was a sense almost of  exhilaration. "It's pretty much what I predicted last year,"  said Chris Tarry, of Paribas Capital Markets. "I thought the  buyer would be Volkswagen, but BMW was my second choice."    The sale of Rover by BAe is unquestionably an historic event  in British manufacturing. In 1986, when Paul Channon, then  industry secretary, tried to sell Land-Rover and Austin Rover to  General Motors and Ford of America, respectively, there was  public outrage. So furious were the Tory supporters in the  shires, that Lady Thatcher's administration was forced to back  down. Debarred from an overseas sale, Lord Young, a subsequent  industry secretary, turned to Britain's biggest manufacturing  company, and in August 1988 concluded a sale of the entire Rover  Group to BAe.    Professor Sir Roland Smith, then chairman of BAe, described  his 150 million pound purchase as the "deal of the decade."  Even though BAe was subsequently obliged by the European Court  to repay 48 million pounds in illegal sweeteners, yesterday's  agreement to sell Rover to BMW for 800 million pounds is a  tribute to the accuracy of his assessment.    Of course, Sir Roland was at his most ebullient in those  days, gathering acquisitions into BAe almost willy-nilly, so  long as they could be bolted on somewhere. Perhaps it was  unsurprising, given BAe's history. Formed in April 1977, BAe  was a nationalised corporation designed to bring together the  aerospace interests of the British Aircraft Corporation, Hawker  Siddeley Aviation, Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and Scottish  Aviation in a single "national champion" company.    Although the incoming Conservative government privatised the  company in February 1981, it became increasingly acquisitive as  the restructuring of British industry gathered pace. In April  1987, the group picked up Royal Ordnance, the munitions group.  Ballast Nedam, a Dutch construction company, was added in  December. The company diversified into property (to maximise  revenue from land released by restructuring),  telecommunications, wind farms, airports. Subsidiaries  mushroomed until the autumn of 1991 when the recession exposed  how overstretched the group had become. Shareholders reacted  with fury when it plunged into loss and called on them for 432  million pounds to bail it out.    Sir Roland was ousted in a boardroom coup and Sir Graham  Day,  the Rover Group chairman, was asked to draw up a new strategy  and find a new chairman. The man he chose was John Cahill, from  the conglomerate BTR. Since he arrived almost two years ago  Cahill has set about the restructuring and rationalisation that  Sir Roland so conspicuously failed to achieve.    In classic BTR style, BAe has focused on markets where it  can  command a dominant position, and endeavoured to become a  low-cost producer. In little more than two years, the company  has shed 25,000 workers, taking total employment down to some  95,000, and made a string of disposals, including corporate jets  and Ballast Nedam.    Once Rover is sold, the defence business will once more be  the heart of the group. Annual sales last year are thought to  have been 3.8 billion pounds, only a whisker below Rover's 4  billion pounds. But unlike car-making, manufacturing weapons has  been consistently profitable. United Kingdom defence spending  is set to fall 16 percent in real terms between 1991 and 1997.  But aided by government ministers, BAe has secured massive  long-term export deals around the world in Saudi Arabia,  Indonesia, and elsewhere. Its Hawk aircraft is the best-selling  jet trainer in the world, the Harrier vertical take-off fighter  is a winner, Tornado is the mainstay of several European air  forces and the Eurofighter project remains a long-term  moneyspinner. The profitability of defence will be reinforced  by job cutting, especially in Royal Ordnance. The deepest  retrenchment has occurred in civil aircraft, where profits have  been devastated by a fall in aircraft demand triggered by the  recession. A loss of 337 million pounds on sales of 1.5 billion  pounds is predicted by independent analysts for 1993. The core  of BAe's civil business is its 20 percent stake in Airbus  Industrie, the pan-European planemaker which is now the world's  second largest after Boeing. BAe builds the wings, profitably,  for every plane in the range.    In an effort to secure the future of its regional jet range,  BAe wasted 15 months talking to Taiwan Aerospace Corporation  about joint-venture production. In the end, TAC walked away.  But capital-cost write-offs, concentration on a single site at  Woodford, in Cheshire, and modernisation of the plane and the  manufacturing process appear on course to restore profitability  and the status of the Avro RJ series as the world's most  successful regional jet. Avro has already sold seven this year.    BAe's biggest remaining problem on the civil aircraft side,  and the source of continuing losses, is Jetstream Aircraft, at  Prestwick in Scotland. Although the smaller Jetstream  turbo-prop planes have been a commercial success, the larger  Jetstream 61, derived from the ATP, has not. Talks are in hand  with a rival manufacturers [as published] around the globe.    The sale of Rover will provide the opportunity to focus  attention on solving the weaknesses of the defence and civil  aerospace businesses. The combined effect of an 800 million  pound cheque from BMW and removal of Rover's borrowings should  leave BAe modestly in the black with its bankers. Removal of  Rover's 700 million pounds of off-balance sheet borrowings from  the liabilities will simultaneously give BAe headroom to borrow  any funds needed to conclude a deal on the Jetstream business.    But there should also be more cash and management time to  devote to BAe's remaining broad spread of activities. Top of  the disposal list is believed to be the space systems business,  with the retail side of Arlington, the property company, a close  second.    Talks with Matra-Hachette of France about a joint company  embracing their missile manufacturing interests are also well  advanced. Some other disposals are expected to follow when  circumstances permit, such as the sale of BAe's 30 percent  interest in Hutchison Telecommunications, the mobile telephone  company.    But many questions about BAe's stewardship of Britain's most  advanced technologies remain unanswered. BAe can take no credit  for Rover's revival. That was achieved by the combination of  Rover employees and Honda engineering.    Defence has been successful at winning overseas orders,  thanks in part to strong backing from government ministers. But  after the sale of Rover, which BAe repeatedly insisted was a  "core" business, and the vacillation over Avro, the company's  determination and ability to remain a player in civil aviation  is open to question.    Civil aircraft manufacture, historically, has been a way for  companies to maximise government investment in military  technology. But the current over-capacity among state-sponsored  regional aircraft manufacturers around the world accentuates the  need for collaboration and joint ventures. The bitterness of  Rover's former partner, Honda, over yesterday's events, combined  with the failure of discussions with TAC over Avro, may well  cause any would-be BAe joint venture partners to have second  thoughts.    John Cahill has shown he is good at rationalising  businesses,  and not bad at selling them. But he has yet to show that the  new BAe can run high-tech companies successfully for long term  growth, either alone or in partnership.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (3): Cautious leader of a hesitant party - Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's prestige has collapsed. But is it all his own fault? MR PV Narasimha Rao's political fortunes are at their lowest ebb since he became prime minister. Brought in hurriedly to lead the ruling Congress (I) party in mid-1991 after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, Mr Rao proved remarkably adept at enhancing his own and his party's power during his first year in office. He won praise at home and abroad for supervising the launch of India's most extensive economic reform programme. But Mr Rao's reputation has slumped since last summer: financial scandal, growing party concern about the impact of reform on political patronage, and, above all, Ayodhya have undermined the prime minister's reputation. He is pilloried as the leader who cannot lead, as a man who cannot take difficult decisions at a time when India faces hard choices. There is some truth in the criticisms. But Mr Rao's reluctance to make these choices is as much a reflection of his party's weaknesses as of his own. It is as much Congress as Mr Rao which is cautious about pushing ahead further with economic liberalisation and about mounting a coherent challenge to the forces of Hindu militancy in the opposition Bharatiya Janata party. For better or for worse, Congress has the leader which it deserves. Mr Rao, who was born into a high-caste Brahmin family in 1921 and is a lawyer by training, won acclaim as a scholar and a poet before going into politics in his home state of Andhra Pradesh, in the south, in the late 1950s. He worked his way up the Congress party, winning praise for his skills as a backroom organiser rather than a platform politician. His first job in Delhi was in 1974, when he became general secretary of the All-India Congress Committee. He served Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi as foreign minister, home minister and minister for human resource development. But while he worked well in the salons of Delhi, he rather neglected his home state and, unlike other Congress leaders, never built a strong personal power base. Loyalty to the Gandhis made Mr Rao an ideal candidate to replace Rajiv Gandhi in the midst of a general election. He was best able to capitalise on a wave of public sympathy which brought Congress back to power, propelling Mr Rao into the prime minister's chair. At the time, many Congress members did not expect Mr Rao to stay in office long, with other leading figures such as Mr Arjun Singh, the human resources development minister, and Mr Sharad Pawar, then defence minister, angling for the top post. But Mr Rao has skilfully contained the ambitions of both: Mr Pawar has been sent back to his home state of Maharashtra to deal with the aftermath of the riots and terrorist bombs in Bombay. Mr Singh remains in Delhi, a thorn in the prime minister's side, but one he has learnt to live with. Mr Rao did not have the slightest intention of promoting economic reform when he came to office. But the reform agenda was thrust upon him by the mid-1991 balance of payments crisis. It also provided a good opportunity to steal some of the thunder from the BJP, which had openly advocated economic liberalisation from the late 1980s. Mr Rao borrowed their policies wholesale. Mr Rao's low-key approach helped Dr Manmohan Singh, his finance minister, secure the support needed for reform. Mr Rao patiently persuaded Congress members that there was no option but liberalisation if India was to pull out of the crisis. But caution and clever tactics have not proved enough to deal with the next two pressing problems on the agenda - how to pursue further economic reform and how to deal with the BJP. As far as further reform is concerned, Mr Rao is probably more than happy to postpone difficult decisions. His party shows little inclination to make controversial moves, such as selling loss-making public enterprises, modernising bankruptcy laws or permitting employers to dismiss redundant workers. With economic growth now back at about 5 per cent, foreign exchange reserves high and exports soaring, Congress members are not at all convinced that further radical reforms of any kind are necessary, let alone the kind which might bring job cuts. The BJP is quite a different matter. Mr Rao has tried to ride out the storm caused by the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque. Whether his policy has been right will be shown in the state elections in the four northern states in November and December. But there are strong indications that Congress has lost ground to the BJP in the last year and to the left-of-centre parties including Janata Dal. For this, Mr Rao is now under intense, if largely silent, pressure from critics inside Congress, including Mr Arjun Singh. If Congress fares badly at the polls, these critics will want Mr Rao out. Congress as a whole is as much to blame as Mr Rao for failing to confront the BJP successfully. Like the prime minister, the party is plagued with doubts about whether it is better to confront Hindu militancy or to compromise with it. The prime minister's personal shortcoming has been his inability to promote with sufficient force an alternative agenda to the BJP's religious zeal. Economic reform is such an alternative. But, apart from Dr Manmohan Singh, no-one in the present cabinet has staked much political capital on liberalisation. Certainly not Mr Rao.</p>

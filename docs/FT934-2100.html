			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: UAP gets go-ahead for lifting equity 5% Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurance group, has secured the government's consent to increase its equity by 5 per cent as part of the payment for its acquisition of Colonia, the German insurer. The additional capital will be given to Suez, the French financial and industrial holding company with which UAP recently concluded months of negotiations over Colonia's ownership. UAP sees the deal as a prelude to privatisation. UAP, which as a public-sector company requires the government's authorisation for any capital increase, had for years been trying to use its minority stake in Victoire, the French insurer controlled by Suez, to take over Colonia. The two groups eventually reached agreement in October by striking an intricate deal whereby UAP will relinquish its Victoire shares, pay up to FFr3bn (Dollars 515m) in cash and cede part of its own equity in return for Victoire's controlling holding in Colonia.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to a comment in the August 30, 1991 final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the prospective payment system for inpatient hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital-related costs (56 FR 43424), we stated that interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on any funds that do not qualify as funded depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account funds, which would include funded depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits of less than 6 months duration, must be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offset interest expense. Section 226.3 of the Provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reimbursement Manual (HCFA Pub. 15&hyph;1) provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment income earned prior to the elapse of the 6-month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period will not be offset unless the deposits are actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawn during this period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are proposing to revise &sect;413.134(e)(1) to state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically that investment income earned during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6-month period will not be used to offset interest expense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless the funds are withdrawn for an improper purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during this period. Under this change, if a provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdraws funds from the funded depreciation account before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the expiration of the 6-month time limit, and the withdrawal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is made for an allowable purpose as described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;413.134(e)(3)(i)(A), the investment income earned on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds is not offset against allowable interest expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Loans to the General Fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We propose to revise and clarify our policy regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans from the provider's funded depreciation fund to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider's general fund. Sections 413.153(b)(3)(ii) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)(2) permit a provider to lend its funded depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds to its general fund. Moreover, these sections provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that interest expense incurred on such loans are considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable costs. Section 226.1 of the Manual amplifies this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy by explaining that, in order for the interest expense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred on such loans to be allowable, the interest expense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must meet the ``necessary and proper'' tests (set forth in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations at &sect;413.153(b) (2) and (3), and in the Manual at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 202.2 and 202.3). This section of the Manual also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explains that the funds loaned to the general fund must not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used to acquire depreciable assets used to furnish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient care because the provider is expected to use its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funded depreciation, rather than to lend it, for that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose. Finally, this section of the Manual explains that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits to the funded depreciation fund will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized to the extent that loans of funded depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds to the general fund are outstanding. Rather, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits will be considered repayments of the loan to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three other sections of the Manual address loans from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider's funded depreciation fund to the provider's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general fund. Section 226.C of the Manual, in discussing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the availability of funded depreciation funds, provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans made from funded depreciation do not alter the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that funded depreciation must be available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the acquisition of the provider's depreciable assets used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnish patient care, or for other capital purposes related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to patient care. Section 226.3 of the Manual, in discussing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the application of the 6-month rule for a deposit to become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a valid funding transaction, provides that a loan of funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciation funds to the general fund is considered a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawal for purposes of applying the 6-month rule. That  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is, if the provider borrows from funded depreciation for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working capital purpose, and some or all of the funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowed were not on deposit in the funded depreciation fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for at least 6 months, the borrowing would be considered a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawal from the funded depreciation account. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, if a deposit did not satisfy the 6-month rule any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment income earned on the deposit would have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to offset otherwise allowable interest expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 226.4B of the Manual, in an example of applying of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the last-in, first-out basis to withdrawals from funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciation for an improper purpose, also characterizes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan to the general fund from the funded depreciation fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a withdrawal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recent years, we have received a number of inquiries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggesting that loans from the provider's funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciation fund to the provider's general fund are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterized more appropriately as investments of funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciation, rather than withdrawals. We agree with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inquirers. The term ``withdrawal'' implies that the funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been removed from the funded depreciation account and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used, either for a proper purpose (for example, acquisition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a depreciable asset) or an improper purpose (for example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to purchase office supplies). In contrast, the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``investment'' implies that the funds have not actually been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed from the funded depreciation account and used;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather, they have been temporarily converted to one or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income producing vehicles (for example, the purchase of U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury bills). Because loans from the funded depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds to the general fund generate investment income for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funded depreciation fund, we believe that such loans more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly should be considered as investments, rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conjunction with this change, we had to decide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether such loans would have to meet the ``readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketable'' test for allowable funded depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investments expressed in &sect;413.134(e) and section 226 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manual. We believe that, because we require that loans made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from funded depreciation do not alter the requirement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the funded depreciation be available for the acquisition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciable assets used to furnish patient care, or for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other capital purposes related to patient care, application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the ``readily marketable'' test would be redundant. That  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is, if a provider loans funded depreciation to the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fund, and while that loan is outstanding the provider needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds to acquire a depreciable asset related to patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care, the provider may not borrow funds to acquire the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciable asset. Rather, the provider must recall the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds from the general fund loan to use to acquire the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asset.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, we propose to add paragraph (e)(4) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;413.134 to address loans from the funded depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account. New &sect;413.134(e)(4) would both consolidate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies now set forth in the manual sections cited above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and revise our policy regarding the characterization of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans from the funded depreciation account. Such loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be considered investments, rather than withdrawals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices tumble further on New York fund selling LONDON COFFEE prices tumbled further yesterday following the dramatic fall in the New York market overnight as commodity funds liquidated their positions. But there were signs of an end to the decline, which has dismayed delegates from producer countries in London this week for talks on renewing an international coffee agreement. The London March robusta contract opened nearly Dollars 50 a tonne down, before recovering to close at Dollars 840 a tonne, down Dollars 15. The nearby New York arabica contract fell by 6.75 cents to 56.05 cents on Monday, with 22,000 lots traded. Yesterday it touched a low of 54.10 cents in early trading, but began to recover in the afternoon. Last August the New York market fell below 50 cents, but then began an advance which culminated in a closing peak of 81.55 cents on December 21, when London reached Dollars 1,081 a tonne. 'This market is not trading on fundamentals, but is being moved by the weight of money wielded by the funds,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker yesterday. 'I think we have seen the bottom today - but with volatility like this it would be a brave man who takes a position,' he added. The volatility of the market was such that the London Clearing House took the unusual step of making a margin call during trading hours. This requires market players to cover any paper losses showing on their positions. 'The market has taken such a battering that it's very jumpy,' said one London trader. But he pointed out that, while the London market was down, it had closed at the day's high. 'This indicates that the liquidation is coming to an end.' The fund liquidation in New York fed on itself, sparking chart-based selling and forcing players out of the market. In such conditions, progress or lack of it at the International Coffee Organisation talks over the next fortnight becomes a side issue. ICO delegates have got off to a slow start, according to the Reuter news agency. The ICO has until the end of March to reach a new agreement.</p>

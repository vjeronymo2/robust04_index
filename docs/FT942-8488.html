			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Sky steps up war against pirates British Sky Broadcasting, which runs Sky Television, has switched to a new subscription card in an attempt to beat the pirates selling unauthorised cards. The cards are used by subscribers to decode the satellite broadcaster's scrambled signals. Sky said yesterday that the new cards would 'put all existing pirates out of action'. There has been evidence of a growing number of pirate cards becoming available in the UK. A year's subscription to all BSkyB's services costs Pounds 240 but some pirate cards have been offered for just Pounds 40. Some pirates have promised customers that for a small additional fee they will send updated cards every time a change is made by BSkyB - a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake.</p>

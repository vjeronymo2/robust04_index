			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: French see faults in Blair House foundations - Why feelings are running so high over the farm trade accord AT THE heart of France's differences with Brussels as well as Washington over the Blair House agreement on farm trade is the fact that it starts from different assumptions. To begin with, French agriculture weighs far more heavily in the political and emotional life of the country than the 3.5 per cent it contributes to gross domestic product. Equally important for the tricky transatlantic negotiations now in train, the French also adopt differing technical assumptions about the course of the European Community's's common agriculture policy over the intended six-year life of the Blair House accord. It is, of course, taken as read in Paris that the EC should not agree to anything in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that constrains its farmers more than CAP reform already does. Yet in the most important commodity - cereals - the calculation in Paris is that by 1999, likely to be the final year of a Gatt farm accord, the EC will have a surplus of at least 15m tonnes, which it would be unable to sell on the world market because of the Blair House requirement for a 21 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised exports by the end of the century. By contrast, the European Commission reckons that at worst the community will end up with a surplus of around 1.5m tonnes, which could easily be offloaded as food aid. Why the big difference in Paris and Brussels' guesstimates? As a senior French official explains, there are two reasons. First, in contrast to Brussels, which is forecasting productivity gains by cereal farmers of 1 per cent or less over the next six years, France predicts that the average EC cereal yield will continue to grow by 1.5 per cent a year. 'This corresponds to average EC yield growth, and to rather less than French producitivity gains, in recent years,' says the official. Why the continued growth in yields when CAP reform is supposed to make European agriculture less intensive, and when French use of fertilisers has been declining from its 1989-90 peak? 'Many of our farmers have realised, partly for environmental reasons, they were using too much fertiliser on their land, and with the help of an agriculture ministry campaign known as 'Fertimieux' we have been showing them how to grow as much with less input,' the official says. 'We also expect continued yield advances from genetics and the use of hybrids.' Secondly, Paris is more pessimistic than Brussels about how much of their home market EC farmers will be able to take back from imports, mainly from the US. 'The commission thinks this 'reconquest' of the home market will amount to 12m tonnes by 1999,' the official says. 'We reckon it will only be 7m-10m tonnes, partly because of recent agri-monetary developments and the competitiveness of US cereal substitutes like corn gluten feed.' On the agri-monetary issue, Paris is hardly innocent, having recently voted to back Bonn's request for a farm price rise outside Germany to neutralise the possibility of a farm price cut inside Germany. Confronted with this, French officials merely chuckle, implying that this move had to be the trade-off for Germany backing France's campaign to re-open the Blair House dossier. On the issue of imports into the EC, however, France is pushing for either a tariff quota to be placed on corn gluten feed (present quantities getting a duty free quota and any extra imports being hit by a tariff), or for the EC to balance any extra imports with compensating freedom to export. Here France has support from many member states, and the community has some margin of manoeuvre in the current transatlantic talks, because market access was not dealt with in the Blair House accord. If the US proves unshakable in its Blair House commitment to the 21 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised exports, and if the EC therefore ends the century with an annual 'non-exportable' surplus of some 15m tonnes, the community has only two choices, according to the French government. Either it doubles its acreage set-aside provisions to 30 per cent; 'One per cent of land set aside would reduce output by about 1m tonnes', says the official - but many French farmers already contest, or detest, having to take even 15 per cent of their land out of production; or the EC could move to much lower prices with an American-style deficiency payment system to make up the loss in farmers' incomes. 'But such payments would be very expensive for the community budget and taxpayers, while even lower prices would pose particular problems for certain member states like Germany, where small-scale, high-cost farmers in its western region would find it hard to sell anything,' says the official. On beef, Paris and Brussels are not far apart in their appreciation of the problem, with the commission recognising that the EC might still have a difficult-to-export surplus of some 400,000 tonnes by 1999. But poultry production has soared in recent years - up by 30 per cent from 1986-89, used as the base period for the Blair House deal - in reponse to world-wide demand for white meat. Behind its demand for some flexibility on the timing of the Blair House volume cuts is the French government's concern that 'a strict application of Blair House would give a reduction of 25 per cent in the first year alone'. For all their own number-crunching about Blair House's nefarious effects, when it comes to painting their nightmare scenario French officials reach for a recent Canadian Wheat Board study. This, they claim, postulates a 2 per cent increase in world demand up to the year 2002 - which is reasonable given that some world market estimates reckon on demand growing as much as 5 per cent. The US and Canada would be able to respond to this greater demand because a Gatt deal would bear far less heavily on their exports (deficiency payments being an allowable form of direct income support), while the EC would be stuck with much of its present support system and therefore a large unexportable surplus. The upshot is that the EC share of the world cereals market would drop from its present 20 per cent to 8-14 per cent. 'We just couldn't allow that', concludes the French official.</p>

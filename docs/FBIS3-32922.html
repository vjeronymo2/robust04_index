The self-styled Zapatist National Liberation Army's decision  to stop charging this "tax" where they are present, improves the  climate for the first peace meeting with this group, Camacho  Solis stated. The commissioner observed that this measure and  the group's previous decision to release former Chiapas Governor  Absalon Castellanos on Wednesday morning, indicates that the  channels for dialogue remain open. "We are witnessing a new  demonstration of their political will in favor of a true  dialogue," said Camacho Solis, who has maintained communication  with the armed groups through public and confidential messages  since the second week of January.    On 2 January, the armed group kidnapped Castellanos  Dominguez, forcing the Mexican Army to intervene one day after  the conflict began in north central Chiapas, where the armed  group violently seized several communities to present Indian  demands. The clashes between the armed group and the Army were  virtually suspended on 12 January, when President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari ordered a cease-fire and initiated efforts to further  pacification and reconciliation.    In a communique distributed to the Chiapas residents in San  Cristobal -- 1,200 km southeast of Mexico city -- the  commissioner indicated that the suspension of the "tax" is an  additional step in favor of the peace meeting.    Military authorities asserted on 11 February, that area  residents, who were dislodged by the conflict, have charged that  the rebels took all their animals, crops, and properties, and  constantly harassed them, "because they refused to join" the  armed group.    Camacho Solis said on Monday that the delegates appointed by  the armed group for the direct dialogue are on their way to a  meeting area from where they will be transferred by the  International Red Cross to the center where the peace meeting  will be held.    Chiapas Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who is the liaison between the  commissioner and the armed group, said on Monday that the date  and place of the first peace meeting will be announced Thursday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Renate Koecher: "Back to the Big Ones"] </F>   [Text] Until recently, there seemed to be only one trend  for the big parties: a downward one. Every election and almost  every opinion poll showed low ratings for the Social Democratic  Party [SPD] and the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], while  right-wing extremist groups, the Party of Democratic Socialism  [PDS], and other protest parties won remarkable successes in  land and municipal elections. To many people it seemed certain  that an increasing number of voters would turn away from the big  parties in the Bundestag elections. With the German tendency to  feel terror in anticipation of possible events, memories of the  Weimar Republic were evoked.    In this process, most people did not realize that the  weakening of the popular parties is by no means a law of nature.  There are two settings that decrease popularity of the small  parties and concentrate voters' attention on the big parties.  If a problem affecting national fate is to be decided in  elections and if the two popular parties take clearly defined  oppositional views on it (this was the case in 1990 when the  CDU/Christian Social Union's [CSU] unrestricted commitment for  unification stood against the SPD's tendency to slow down the  process), then a polarization between the two popular parties  in a question that deeply concerns the nation strengthens these  parties and decreases interest in new groups. The second  setting is competition between two big parties, a situation,  where voters consider a change in power possible, but by no  means certain. This is the case today.    It is, therefore, hardly surprising that the trend toward  small parties and protest groups has been stopped for the time  being. Over the past few weeks, the CDU/CSU and the SPD have  gained support, while all other parties have lost potential  voters. In December, 8.4 percent of those polled wanted to give  their second vote in the Bundestag elections to the Free  Democratic Party [FDP]. By the end of January, only 7.7 percent  intended to do so. The share of those who wanted to vote for  Alliance 90/Greens sank from 10.2 to 9 percent; support for the  PDS went down from 5.3 to 3.4 percent. Support for the  Republikaner has declined by almost 50 percent, from 4.6 to 2.7  percent, the lowest figure since January 1992. In contrast to  that, the SPD has gained just under 4 percent, the CDU/CSU 2  percent. For the first time since 1991, the SPD is supported by  more than 40 percent of the population. Together, the two  popular parties currently achieve 76 percent, distinctly more  than the 1993 average, which was 69 percent.    Parallel to growing support for the two popular parties, the  conviction is increasing that one of them will reach a majority  capable of forming a government, together with a small coalition  partner. Only 26 percent of those polled expect a grand  coalition, while 47 percent consider such an alliance unlikely.    The strong fluctuations in party preferences and the great  number of undecided voters show that the outcome of the  elections is completely open. At the moment, the SPD is in the  lead. Its candidate, Scharping, gets more support from the  voters than Chancellor Kohl. But when Rau and Lafontaine ran  against Kohl, the starting position was the same. Just how  unstable the preference for a particular candidate is, can be  seen from the answers to the question in whom those polled would  put the most confidence in case of a foreign policy crisis: If  the situation in Russia gets more critical and this threatens  Germany, the population favors Helmut Kohl as chancellor at a  proportion of two to one.</p>

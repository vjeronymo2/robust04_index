			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Bush returns to work today says spokesman PRESIDENT George Bush will go ahead with a second round of summit talks in Japan today in spite of collapsing at a state banquet in Tokyo yesterday. This morning the president was in good spirits and otherwise in 'excellent health' after fainting during an attack of 'common 'flu', Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said. 'The president is human, he gets sick,' he said, adding that Mr Bush would continue with most of his schedule today, including a meeting with the Japanese premier and a joint press conference. House described The incident - shown live on Japanese television - had reignited fears about Mr Bush's health ahead of his campaign for re-election this year. The 67-year-old president keeled over before his horrified Japanese hosts after complaining several times of feeling sick. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, cradled Mr Bush's head briefly before US Secret Service agents surrounded the stricken president. After 10 minutes, Mr Bush, looking ashen-faced and shaky, got to his feet and was wrapped in his coat. Smiling, he saluted his audience, shook hands with Mr Miyazawa, and was taken by limousine to the Japanese prime minister's official residence at Tokyo's Akasaka Palace. The White House tried to play down the episode, which came during a series of trade talks with Japan at the end of a gruelling 12-day, 26,000-mile tour of the Pacific which began on December 30. The president had billed the trip as a mission to bolster the struggling US economy by creating jobs for Americans through prising open Japanese and other east Asian markets. The president's popularity at home has slumped amid a collapse in public confidence over economic prospects. Mr Fitzwater said there was no connection between Mr Bush's collapse and the thyroid problem diagnosed last year for which he was hospitalised briefly with an irregular heart-beat. 'There's no special concern,' he said. In Washington, Vice-President Dan Quayle, 44, was notified about Mr Bush's collapse and went immediately to the White House. No arrangements for a transfer of power were made, according to a spokesman for Mr Quayle. Mr Quayle went ahead with a planned trip to New Hampshire, where next month's primary elections will provide the first important test for Mr Bush in the 1992 election campaign. 'There is no reason to be concerned,' said Mr Quayle yesterday. 'The president is doing well, resting well.' News of Mr Bush's illness had little impact on the dollar. On Wall Street, share prices were unsettled initially but soon picked up and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just 0.89 lower at 3,203.94. Shortly before yesterday's banquet, Mr Bush had said in a US television interview that he felt well. Earlier in the day, he had played tennis with Emperor Akihito, Crown Prince Naruhito and Mr Michael Armacost, US ambassador to Tokyo. Mrs Barbara Bush and others in the president's entourage were evidently relieved when Mr Bush got to his feet. Mr Fitzwater quoted the president as saying: 'I just wanted to get a little attention.' Mr Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser, read Mr Bush's prepared speech.

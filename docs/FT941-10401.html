			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Government struggles to control Seoul's advance - The rally looks set to continue Government intervention, helped by the three-day lunar new year's holiday that begins today, has temporarily halted a recent surge on the Seoul bourse. But analysts believe that the Finance Ministry will eventually have no more success in controlling the market than Canute had in stopping the waves. The ministry has announced three sets of measures in the last three weeks to curb stock speculation, which has sent the general index climbing towards its record peak of 1,007, set on April 1, 1989. The result of the ministry's labours began to bear fruit a week ago when the index reached 974 and then went on a decline - although it rebounded yesterday, ending at 923, up 8 points. The government has offered several economic reasons for cooling the market. It fears that the bull run could cause distortions in economic growth by diverting funds from industrial investments. It has also expressed concern about inflationary pressure as investors start spending their newly acquired capital gains, which are not subject to taxation. Foreign capital flowing into the Seoul bourse - still considered undervalued by Asian standards - has heightened inflationary worries, since it would increase the money supply. The measures also reflect the 'back to basics' approach on economic issues favoured by the administration of President Kim Young-sam, who has preached that hard work rather than financial spec-ulation should be the guid-ing principle of Koreans. But the government only has itself to blame for the stock market's buoyancy. Its success in curbing inflation has depressed interest rates and, consequently, the bond market. An anti-corruption campaign has dampened speculation in the unofficial lending and property markets. The government last year also sought to encourage the public to liquidate their anonymous bank accounts and transfer the funds to the stock market by offering to maintain its tax-free status for five years. The bourse has been riding on a wave of liquidity ever since, matched by expectations that corporate earnings will improve significantly this year. The cooling-down measures include requiring institutional investors to make a 40 per cent deposit on purchase orders and individual investors 80 per cent. Financial institutions, which operate under close state supervision, are being required to sell shares and buy monetary stabilisation bonds instead. The amount of authorised new share issues is being raised to soak up excess liquidity. But they appear to have little long-term impact, at least on domestic investors. Stock deposits, a key indicator of potential buying power, remain high. The measures, however, appear to be discouraging foreign investors since the deposit requirement makes share purchases cumbersome, or even illegal in the case of US institutional funds, the largest bloc of foreign investors in Seoul. Some foreign brokers believe that is a deliberate goal of the policy. Foreigners are already barred from acquiring more than 10 per cent of a company's stock and the foreign quota was expected to be exhausted for almost all shares by the end of the month. A western broker said: 'If nearly all Korean stocks had their foreign shareholding limits filled, that would have put increased pressure on the government to raise the shareholding ceiling. These measures have put off that day by forcing foreigners to halt or slow down buying.' The result is that there is renewed questioning among foreign securities houses about the government's commitment to financial liberalisation and its willingness to rid itself of its traditional desire to meddle in financial markets. But other analysts argue that those doubts about state intentions may be misplaced. Recent efforts to liberalise foreign exchange rules are likely to encourage pent-up capital to flow out of the country, which will lessen worries about inflation and persuade the government to relax its grip on the market.</p>

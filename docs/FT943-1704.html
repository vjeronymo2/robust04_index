			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Ashdown hints at closer Labour links Mr Paddy Ashdown yesterday signalled his hopes that the Liberal Democrats would provide the reforming edge in a post-election partnership with the Labour party. In a coded message to Labour leader Tony Blair, Mr Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats had 'enough confidence in our own strength to make common cause with others to achieve the best for the future'. The government after the next election should be one in which the Liberal Democrats provided key policies. Addressing the party conference at Brighton, the Liberal Democrat leader said the party's 'historic role' was to act as the catalyst for constitutional change in Britain. That meant dismantling the 'centralised state' and introducing proportional representation. But Mr Ashdown (pictured with his wife, Jane, after his speech) ducked an explicit offer of an anti-Tory pact and gave no details of his strategy to secure closer co-operation with Labour.

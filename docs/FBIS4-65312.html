			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn,  membership in the European Union [EU] does not change Finland's  security policy toward neighboring countries. Speaking in  Vienna, Austria, Rehn gave assurances that cross-border  countries will continue to hold an important position in  bilateral relations irrespective of the EU. She addressed a  meeting of the second government party, the People's Party.  Defense Minister Rehn pointed out the end of the Cold War had  not changed the situation in northern Europe. For Russia, the  strategic importance of its northwestern corner had only grown  following the breakup of the Soviet Union and nuclear  disarmament. Rehn reiterated Finland's stance that a country  could retain an independent defense and military nonalliance  within the EU.</p>

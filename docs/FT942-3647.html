			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Major blames low poll turnout on disillusionment Mr John Major yesterday blamed the low turnout in the European elections on public disillusionment with Europe and pledged to campaign for a fresh start for the European Union. Speaking to journalists in the garden of 10 Downing Street, Mr Major strongly defended his campaign decision to commit the government to a multi-speed Europe. He said the concept, first floated last month by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, offered a 'middle way' for Europe between federalism and disintegration. Mr Major denied that the critical tone of the election campaign amounted to an endorsement of the Eurosceptic views of Conservative opponents to the Maastricht treaty on European integration. 'I am not bowing either to the Euro-enthusiasts or the Eurosceptics. I am saying and doing precisely what I believe is right for Europe,' he said. Mr Major said that the election results showed that people throughout the EU were concerned at the way the union had developed. 'The turnout was rotten in other countries as well as here. People are frustrated. All the governing parties did badly. I think, therefore, we have to think afresh about how to make Europe a success,' he said. 'I don't believe, myself, that the ideal lies on either extreme - tearing down what exists or building it up to some unreasonable federalist centre. There is a middle way, a practical way for Europe.' Mr Major said he was confident that the government could recover from its poor election performance, which was roughly the same as the Conservatives' opinion poll standing when he became prime minister in 1990. He said there would be no changes in policy, and claimed that the Conservative performance in the elections had 'discredited' the opinion polls, which had forecast a Labour lead of between 21 and 33 percentage points. 'I believe it has been clear for some years that many people are simply not frank when asked questions by opinion-pollsters,' he said. 'I suspect they resent the prying nature of the questions, and it seems that the answers are not always accurate. Perhaps a lower salience for opinion polls in the future would be welcomed by quite a lot of people.' Mr Bob Worcester, head of the MORI polling organisation, said Mr Major's criticisms were 'self-serving' and urged him to listen to the message from the polls and the voters. However, the prime minister's strategy is likely to be endorsed by the Conservative party's centre-left majority, which sees it as a way of uniting the warring pro-Europe and anti-Europe wings. One senior centre-left minister said he believed the issue would 'go away' now that the election campaign was over because there was no immediate trigger for further divisions. This was regarded as an unduly optimistic outlook by other centre-left MPs, who pointed out that the prime minister's manoeuvring skills would be tested as early as next week, when the EU Council of Ministers is expected to choose a successor to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. Pessimists on the centre-left also pointed to legislation, expected later this year, which will increase the UK's contribution to the EU budget by about Pounds 200m a year by 1999. The increase, agreed at the 1992 Edinburgh summit of EU leaders, is bitterly opposed by many Eurosceptics, including the hard-core rebels who almost defeated the government over the Maastricht bill.</p>

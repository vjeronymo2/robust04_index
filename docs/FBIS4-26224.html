			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China, made  up of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces, has become the  largest grain production base in the country, supplying about  one-third of China's total grain.    The northeast China plain, about 16 million hectares of  fertile land stretching across the three provinces, now provides  about 25 billion kilograms of grain for the whole nation. It is  also supplying meat, eggs and milk for about 100 million  urbanites each year.    Over the past four years, the total output of grain has  reached 50 billion kg each year on average, with the grain  output last year topping 60 billion kg. The three provinces can  now release more than half of the grain produced here for  consumption in other parts of China.    The central government used to supply more than one billion  kg of grain to Liaoning, which is one of the most industrialized  regions in the country. However, that situation ended two years  ago. Liaoning Province now offers over one billion tons of grain  for the nation each year.    Experts here said that grain produced in this area has  played  a vital role in stabilizing the nation's grain prices since the  government lifted price control on grain a few years ago.    "Grain transported from the northeast to other parts of the  country greatly eased the grain price hikes in some major cities  last year as some southern grain-producing provinces witnessed a  decline in output," said an expert here.    Animal husbandry in the region has been growing fast too as  a  result of more grain. Last year, meat production topped three  million tons, making the area self-sufficient in meat supply.  Extra meat was sold to many other parts of China.    The output value of animal husbandry grew to some 30 billion  yuan, 25 percent of the total farm production value. About one  million farm households now live on raising livestock. More  than one-third of the 30 billion kg of corn produced in the  three provinces were used for raising livestock.    Several years ago, there was virtually no animal husbandry  industry in northeast China because of cold weather and  traditional means of raising animals. The area was China's  largest meat-importing region as over 100,000 tons, one-third of  the meat consumed there, came from other parts of China,  especially southwest China's Sichuan Province.    Officials said the grain output increase was the result of  years of efforts. Heilongjiang Province has spent 1.6 billion  yuan in the past few years transforming the lower-productive  fields. Jilin and Liaoning provinces have spent years  constructing irrigation projects.    Grain output was often affected by natural disasters such as  early frost. More than 20 items of new technology in  cultivating grains, including the development of new species,  the use of plastic film covers, proper application of fertilizer  and water-saving techniques, were exploited.    Experts attribute over 40 percent of the grain output  increase to the use of new techniques.    The three provinces have also increased investment in  farming  annually. Jilin Province spent 18.4 billion yuan in the past  four years on farming, with an annual increase of 11 percent.  Investment in agriculture in Heilongjiang and Liaoning  provinces also grew significantly.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREMATORY OPERATOR UNEXPECTEDLY PLEADS GUILTY, DRAWS 5 YEARS  </P> <P> A Pasadena crematorium operator who had long maintained his innocence of grisly  charges that he mutilated corpses, conducted mass cremations and stole dental  gold from bodies unexpectedly pleaded guilty to 21 charges and was sentenced to  five years in prison, prosecutors said Thursday.  </P> <P> David Sconce, 33, appearing before Pasadena Superior Court Judge Terry  Smerling, also pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges of hiring thugs to beat up  three competing morticians, failing to bury the remains of a baby girl and  stealing a 1985 Chevrolet Corvette.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Sconce, who already has been held two years in Los Angeles  County Jail, will probably serve no more than 10 months in state prison.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Faced 11-Year Sentence  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office had opposed giving Sconce the  chance to plea-bargain his case, maintaining that he should have been sentenced  to the maxiumum 11 years in prison.  </P> <P> "We didn't concur and we didn't come up with the agreement," said Deputy Dist.  Atty. Nancy D. Aronson, a co-prosecutor in the case. "I personally thought he  should have been given the maximum."  </P> <P> Despite the objections, Smerling approved the agreement with Sconce, ending a  major portion of the 2 1/2-year-old case.  </P> <P> Sconce still faces seven felony counts, including charges that he bribed  witnesses to lie in court and tried to hire someone last year to murder Deputy  Dist. Atty. Walt Lewis, who was then handling the case.  </P> <P> But as part of the agreement Wednesday, Judge Smerling told Sconce that he  could plead guilty to those charges and receive no additional prison time,  Aronson said.  </P> <P> "We're not totally unhappy with the outcome," Aronson said. "Here's a guy who  has been pleading his innocence all this time and now he pleads guilty. It  certainly saved the taxpayers and everyone a lot of time."  </P> <P> Sconce's attorney, Guy E. O'Brien, was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> There is still a possibility, meanwhile, that the Ventura County district  attorney's office will file murder charges against Sconce in connection with  the death of Burbank mortician Timothy Waters, who died in 1985.  </P> <P> At the time, the Ventura County coroner's office believed his death was due to  natural causes. During court hearings last year, however, witnesses testified  that Sconce had bragged about poisoning Waters.  </P> <P> A new autopsy was performed and traces of deadly oleander poison were found in  Waters' blood and tissue samples. His death was reclassified as a murder and is  under review by Ventura County prosecutors.  </P> <P> The labyrinthine case of Sconce and his cremation operation began in the high  desert city of Hesperia on Jan. 20, 1987.  </P> <P> Sconce owned a small corrugated steel building that neighbors thought was being  used to manufacture ceramic panels for NASA's space station project. They were  puzzled by the putrid odors that occasionally emanated from the site at night.  </P> <P> After receiving several complaints, Hesperia fire officials entered the  building. They found barrels of human ashes and bone, along with several  partially cremated bodies loaded "like cordwood" in kilns at the unlicensed  crematorium, one fire official said.  </P> <P> Sconce and his father, Jerry Sconce, were arrested the next week. His mother,  Laurieanne Lamb Sconce, was arrested later.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pasadena Institution  </P> <P> The arrests were startling not only because of the nature of the discoveries,  but also because the Sconces operated one of the oldest and most respected  funeral homes in the area, the Lamb Funeral Home in Pasadena.  </P> <P> The Sconces were eventually charged with 68 felony and misdemeanor counts. The  most grisly concerned removal of body parts for sale to a scientific supply  company and theft of dental gold from bodies, a procedure that former employees  said was called "popping chops."  </P> <P> Other charges included embezzling funeral trust accounts, commingling cremated  remains and falsifying death certificates.  </P> <P> Several of the charges were dismissed after the preliminary hearing last year  and 27 more counts were dismissed by Smerling in June and July, although  prosecutors are appealing those dismissals.  </P> <P> Laurieanne Lamb Sconce still faces 18 felony and misdemeanor counts and Jerry  Sconce eight counts, Aronson said. Their trial is tentatively scheduled to  begin in October.  </P></p>

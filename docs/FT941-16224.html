			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Jitters over new supply leave long-dated gilt prices lower Auction jitters pushed UK government bond prices lower yesterday and, although the market recovered slightly, long-dated gilts still ended the day about a quarter of a point lower. Dealers expect the Bank of England to announce the preliminary details of the January gilt auction this week. The market expects the new supply to be at the very long end, with either a new 20-year or a new 25-year gilt as the auction stock. Such an announcement is likely to depress long-dated gilts, dealers said, especially since it would probably be interpreted as signalling that the Bank sees little scope for a further reduction in long gilt yields. The economic news released yesterday had little impact on gilt prices and economists said it provided confirmation of a recovery, although the consumer credit figures were slightly weaker than expected, with net consumer credit rising by Pounds 290m in November. Looking ahead this week, the gilt market will focus on the unemployment figures tomorrow and the meeting between the Mr Kenneth Clark, the chancellor of the exchequer and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, for a signal on interest rates. Among the high-yielding European government bond markets Italy closed three-quarters of a point down, rattled by further political scandals, dealers said. The Liffe March futures contract ended 0.78 down at 117.10, off the low price of 117.05. The bond market fell on rumours that top politicians were involved in an alleged attempt to hush up a scandal over secret service slush funds. Spanish bonds saw some weakness, dealers reporting foreign selling of Spanish paper because of worries about the peseta and unease over the Banesto debacle. German government bonds ended the day almost unchanged, showing little response to news that western Germany's gross domestic product shrunk by 1.9 per cent in 1993, following growth of 1.6 per cent in 1992. Elsewhere in Europe, the French market fell back on disappointment over the lack of an interest rate cut. Swedish government bonds, which had rallied strongly last week as details of the government's budget proposals leaked into the market, ended yesterday little changed as expectations were generally confirmed, dealers said. After early profit-taking following last Friday's strong rally had pushed US Treasury prices lower in the morning, the bond market rallied in the afternoon to leave longer-dated issues little changed. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down only 3/32 at 100 1/4 , yielding 6.226 per cent, and the two-year note unchanged at 100 11/32 , to yield 4.049 per cent. The selling of longer-dated Treasuries began overnight on foreign markets and, after a brief rebound, continued into the morning in New York. Traders were not concerned by the activity, which they categorised as natural profit-taking.</p>

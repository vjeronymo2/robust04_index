			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Local Government Elections: Party that failed to get off the ground - Higher-than-usual turnout as voters reject recovery claims THE Natural Law party yesterday made its second concerted attempt to win an election, fielding 96 candidates in the 98 contested seats on Lancashire County Council. The campaign came completely unstuck, with every seat lost. Instead, Labour went over the top to gain an absolute majority just after midnight. The Tories had thought Lancashire was its best hope for a gain - in the event Labour took 53 of the 99 seats, with four net gains against the Conservatives' seven net losses. The Liberal Democrats gained four from the Tories and lost one seat to Labour. Overall the Tories emerged with 35 seats, the Liberal Democrats with 10, and one seat remained vacant. The only clear pattern was the rout of the Natural Law party, which made its first attempt at power last year. Formed to fight the general election, they failed to get off the ground. Mr Stuart Withers, chairman of the Lancashire party, said: 'We are convinced that natural law will eventually be running the show.' 'Who? Never heard of them (the Natural Law party),' said Mrs Margaret Cropper, from Bickerstaffe, a teller for the Conservatives, at a polling station in Ormskirk. She was enjoying a friendly chat with Mrs Barbara Bourne, who was counting voters for Labour. Both were more concerned that by 2pm yesterday polling had been 'very slow', in spite of fair weather. However, at Labour's Ormskirk committee rooms Mr Colin Pickthall, MP for West Lancashire, was upbeat. Only 5 per cent of the electorate had voted by lunchtime, but tellers had reported Labour two-to-one ahead. In 1989 Mr Pickthall scraped home in Ormskirk by just four votes after three recounts. It enabled him to establish his power base and win West Lancashire for Labour by 2,077 votes at the general election. Yesterday he was campaigning for Mr John Fillis to succeed him on the council. He only just made it, squeezing home by 67 votes.</p>

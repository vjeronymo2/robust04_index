			<p>BFN     [Text] Fighting has resumed in Kigali. The Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels this afternoon shelled one of the  last positions held by the government army, which caused a huge  fire on Mount Kigali. Major Jean-Guy Plante, the UN mission  spokesman in Kigali:    [Begin recording] [Plante] This afternoon, especially late  this afternoon, fighting was extremely fierce in the center of  Kigali. I myself saw explosions in the town of Kigali, but not  on Mount Kigali. Mount Kigali, it is true, is a strategic  (?point) which is held by the government forces. The rebel  forces are trying to get hold of Mount Kigali, and the  information I currently have shows that Mount Kigali is still  being held by the government forces.    [Correspondent Ghislaine Dupont] Does the UNAMIR [UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda] believe that the RPF, the Rwandan  Patriotic Front, has taken new positions in the capital?    [Plante] I would say that, given the information that I have  and what I saw with my own eyes this afternoon--because I went  for a walk in the town of Kigali--I would say that the front,  the front line, the positions are almost the same as they were a  week or 10 days ago despite the extremely (?fierce) and bloody  fighting that has been going on over the last few days.

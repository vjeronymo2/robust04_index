			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODERNIZING OF NATO A-ARMS GETS TEPID OK;  </P> <P> ENDORSEMENT WITHOUT COMMITMENT TO DEPLOY  </P> <P> NATO defense ministers on Thursday offered a lukewarm endorsement of the  politically unpopular drive to update the alliance's nuclear weapons in Europe.  </P> <P> While saying that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization intends to reduce its  overall stockpile of nuclear weapons, the defense chiefs reaffirmed in a formal  communique the desire to maintain "diversified, survivable and operationally  flexible nuclear forces across the entire spectrum."  </P> <P> The statement said that NATO plans to increase the range of ground- and  air-launched missiles to compensate for the loss of medium-range missiles  banned under the new Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the  United States and the Soviet Union signed in 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Explicit Promise  </P> <P> The ministers, however, did not explicitly promise to deploy new nuclear-tipped  missiles in West Germany because of intense domestic opposition to the weapons  there. British and American officials had hoped for a stronger commitment to  future deployment of the new weapons.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said at the conclusion of the two-day meeting  that West German objections to the new missiles had been vigorously aired.  </P> <P> "I'm not surprised that there are differences of opinion within the alliance,"  he told reporters in an interview aboard his Air Force jet while returning to  Washington on Thursday.  </P> <P> "In the face of Mr. Gorbachev's very successful public relations activities and  efforts to convey the notion that the Soviet threat is reduced, it's not  surprising there is a lot of ferment, political ferment on these issues in  Europe."  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has promised to unilaterally reduce  Soviet military forces in Europe and has spoken of adopting a new defensive  military posture. His statements have won broad public support among European  populations that have lived for decades along a heavily armed border between  East and West.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said recently that the first reductions -- withdrawals of 10,000 men  and 1,000 tanks from East Germany -- will begin May 11.  </P> <P> Cheney has repeatedly expressed skepticism about Gorbachev's moves and said  Thursday that he wishes Europeans were not so swayed by the Soviet leader's  soothing words. But, he said, he intends to press his campaign to upgrade NATO  forces while seeking negotiated reductions in arms talks with the Soviets.  </P> <P> There will always be conflicts within the alliance, he said, "but you have to  play the ball where you find it."  </P> <P> Cheney also said Thursday that he is "reasonably confident" that Congress will  go along with his request for funds for the new weapons, despite NATO's vague  endorsement. Some lawmakers have complained that the United States should not  commit hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and build new short-range  missiles if the West Germans reject them.  </P> <P> Cheney has asked Congress for $150 million over the next two years to develop a  replacement for the Lance missile now deployed in West Germany.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 80-Mile Range  </P> <P> The Lance, which has a range of about 80 miles, will be obsolete by the  mid-1990s, U.S. defense officials say. The United States must decide by 1991 or  1992 which missile system it will build to replace it, officials said.  </P> <P> As part of his campaign to sell the American missile modernization plan, Cheney  also made public a description of Soviet efforts to improve their own  short-range nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> According to the Pentagon summary of an extensive intelligence briefing given  to the NATO ministers, the Soviets possess a 16 to 1 advantage over NATO in  short-range nuclear missile launchers.  </P> <P> The report also says that the Soviets are replacing old Frog and Scud missiles  and artillery shells with more accurate, longer-range weapons and are building  a new nuclear air-to-surface rocket.  </P></p>

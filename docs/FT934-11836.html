			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Property: Break with the past - Planning rules on historic buildings in the UK must be reviewed How many relics from the past should be preserved and how long should they be retained before seeking more contemporary replacements? This dilemma is particularly acute in relation to historic buildings in the UK. Tough choices are inevitable; and lack of resources limits the number of conversions of buildings that do not fit with current lifestyles or economic needs. Yet there is a danger that the approach to the listing of buildings could backfire. The whole process is threatened by the increasing practice of listing buildings which cannot be viably used. Earlier this year Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the City of London Corporation's policy and resources committee, warned that planning controls on listed premises were deterring potential occupants. He has asked English Heritage, which advises the government on these matters, to support a code drawn up by the corporation designed to fill as many historic buildings as possible. Behind the code are the City's twin aims: that important buildings are places where people should be encouraged to live and work; and that planning regulations should not, in effect, lead to unused and empty premises. A check must be placed on the listing process by: inviting experts on the occupation of buildings to advise on whether a listing should be imposed; ensuring that candidates for listing status pass a test on whether conserving the building is viable; encouraging schemes which might alter existing listed buildings. About one in every 40 buildings in England and Wales enjoys statutory protection through listing. Although rarely enforced, the accompanying legislation makes it an offence to demolish or even damage a listed building. A 1992 report by the National Audit Office, the government watchdog, on England's heritage property found that 14 per cent of protected buildings are vulnerable to neglect and in need of repair, with a further 7 per cent in a poor or bad state of repair. In total, some 100,000 listed buildings, or more than one in five, are not being maintained in the manner envisaged by the legislation. Yet the number of listed buildings is growing rapidly. In 1970 there were 12,000 listed premises in England and Wales; today there are 500,000. Architectural groups such as the Twentieth Century Society are lobbying the Heritage Department to widen the scope of listed buildings. English Heritage has launched an initiative to list more buildings, especially modern buildings. The Royal Fine Arts Commission, which assesses the aesthetic merit of proposals for listings, has suggested that it too should be authorised, alongside the heritage secretary, to accord a listing status and to acquire listed buildings. Critics argue that placing more authority in the hands of unaccountable bodies such as the RFAC is a retrograde step, as it loads the dice still further in the favour of preservation rather than realism. Yet amid the public debate, one question remains unanswered: who is going to pay for the maintainance and refurbishment of such premises. The National Audit Office indicated in its report that the UK is already struggling to maintain its existing listed buildings. If the number of listed buildings is to be increased then it must be accompanied by a rise in the level of aid (currently Pounds 120m a year) to heritage groups; other fiscal incentives should also be introduced, such as raising the level of rating relief which is available to listed buildings. The Department of the Environment recently took the unprecedented step of compulsorily acquiring a grade one listed building, a former spa hotel in Buxton, because of the failure of its owner to do anything about its neglect. If this is a precedent, then the DoE's budget will have to be increased to meet the needs of similar cases of neglect. There have been 16 acts of parliament designed to conserve important buildings. Mr David Curry, UK local government minister for England, says that 'the planning system must balance the need for economic growth with the need to protect our historic buildings'. This statement, however, made in the context of a draft policy guidance on listed buildings, does not signal any 'bonfire of legislation', as a prelude to a new approach. The alternative is to try and inject some confidence into the architectural profession by inviting it to exercise a freer role in the development process. One encouraging move was the victory by Lord Palumbo to redevelop One Poultry in the City. The project would mean the demolition of several listed Victorian buildings and the creation, according to the government official's recommendation, of what 'might just be a masterpiece'. We must be conscious of our duty to keep important relics. But rather than the prevailing scholarly approach to listed buildings, what is required is an injection of a more creative force. This could be just the encouragement for architects and developers to improve or replace ageing buildings with developments more suited to contemporary needs.

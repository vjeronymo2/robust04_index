			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E. van Wyk] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 27 SAPA -- Freedom Front leader  Constand Viljoen was accompanied by a large group of former  police and defence force generals when he cast his vote for his  party at the Voortrekkerhoogte Town Hall on Wednesday [27  April]. Gen Viljoen told the media that he condemned the Jan  Smuts Airport bomb blast and urged those responsible to stop the  bombings and rather vote for the Freedom Front to strengthen the  party's hand in future negotiations. Gen Viljoen described his  voting in the country's first ever democratic election as the  "last possible peaceful way to achieve the goal of  self-determination".</p>

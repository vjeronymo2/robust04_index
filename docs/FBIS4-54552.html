			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Sonya Angelova: "Berov Will Call the Tune for </F> a Few More Months"]    [Text] Despite the permanent talk regarding early  parliamentary elections, the current prime minister can be calm  about his post for a rather long time. There are at least three  reasons for this. The rivalry between the president and the  parliament is just one of them.    [President Zhelyu] Zhelev's intensive efforts to fix a  "suitable" cabinet, or to transfer the power to a caretaker  cabinet, as well as the readiness of a dozen of politicians  loyal to Zhelev to head such a cabinet, prompts a large part of  the deputies to look with suspicion toward the White House [the  Bulgarian Presidency]. In the past few months, they plan to  curb the president's prerogatives, and only the unexpected  illness of the prime minister spoiled their plans.    Amending the Bulgarian Constitution, however, is not a  simple  job. This is a delicate thing, related to subtle negotiations  and precise arithmetics because part of the people's deputies  really fear the long hands of the Presidency. The weakness of  the head of state, however, to publicly settle the account with  the Socialists and the rapid disintegration that engulfed the  camp of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], facilitated  turning the Presidency into the only significant opponent of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. The deformations in political  life evoked analogies of the time of the Third Kingdom. Most of  the caretaker cabinets of that time managed to win the elections  regardless of their platforms. Therefore, the idea of  increasing control over the president appears to be a task of  supreme importance. There are two variants of this: either the  parliament should continue its activity and thus keep an eye on  the caretaker cabinet conceived by Zhelev, or the parliament  should be entrusted with the task of forming this cabinet. Both  variants require several months for their realization. Until  then, Professor Berov will be protected from various votes.    The second reason for his temporary immunity is related to  the unresolved internal problems of political forces. The SDS  preserved its coalition character long after similar formations  in other East European states disintegrated. The deadlock  between the National Coordinating Council and the parliamentary  faction, however, prompts the two camp to openly long for  democratic centralism, the one-man-command, and something that  resembles party discipline. The issue that preoccupies the SDS  headquarters more than anything else is who will lead the future  blue [SDS] party. The final term allocated to Filip Dimitrov and  Stefan Savov is 15 May. Until now, it appeared that only the  chief of the parliamentary faction [Stefan Savov] is pressed for  time. The national conference is expected to be the triumph of  the apparatus games, and the apparatus is fully controlled by  Filip Dimitrov. Recently, however, the hardliners also  demonstrated nervousness. Several times, Edvin Sugarev demanded  proposing a vote of no-confidence and pressed for adopting a  decision to walk out of the parliament. The discussions related  to composing the election lists will accelerate those processes.  If Filip Dimitrov's plan to propose SDS candidates and  determine their place in the lists succeeds, the outcome of the  battle will be determined. The central leadership will close  its doors to the Democratic and Radical-Democratic Parties, the  blue Agrarians, and a part of the United Christian Democratic  Center. Even if Savov himself passes through the sieve, the  next parliamentary faction will already be totally dominated by  Filip Dimitrov, while the faction's present leader will become a  respected but tiresome pensioner. Everyone understands the  situation. The split in the SDS appears to be a matter of time.    The third, and perhaps the most important reason is  privatization. Preparations for privatization began before 10  November, and yet it does not seem to materialize. The owners  of the former national wealth are determined by violence or in a  Byzantine manner. No one is tempted by the political  consequences of the privatization. Regardless of the formula  that will dominate the privatization, there will be  bankruptcies, people will the thrown into the street, an attempt  will be made to ban the trade unions, and conflicts will emerge  among economic groups that divided the country in their  interest. Diminishing the role of the state produces dividends  in the long run, however, under the present socioeconomic  situation, the country could find itself in a catastrophic  situation in the short run.    All this is obvious even from the vintage point of the  government hospital. Therefore, as a man of character, in the  near future, Professor Berov will dictate his conditions. For  the time being, the political forces do not appear to have much  of a choice.</p>

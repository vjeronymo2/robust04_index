			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Yeltsin seeking special IMF deal PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia is using the acclaim he received from last week's deal on nuclear arms cuts with the US to persuade foreign governments to press the International Monetary Fund to treat Russia as a special case. This would mean allowing it access to Dollars 24bn (Pounds 12.9bn) in aid even though its economic reform programme does not observe IMF conditions. Mr Yeltsin said in Canada on Saturday that he would try to persuade the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries, whom he will meet in Munich early next month, to 'throw their weight behind persuading the IMF into opening the Dollars 24bn credit line'. He said that because of the effects of communism and the consequent difficulty of the transition to democracy and free markets, 'the standard IMF project should not be applied to us to the letter'. His statement sets the stage for a struggle between the IMF, whose officials are concluding talks with government ministers in Moscow, and the Russian government - with the G7 leaders invited to take one side or another. The IMF wants to apply the same criteria to Russia as to other member countries, thus holding Russia to account for rising budget deficits, for its decision to hold down energy prices, for the Rbs2 trillion (million million) debt which state enterprises have accumulated and for the non-payment of principal and interest on its more than Dollars 60bn foreign debt. IMF officials flew in to Budapest yesterday for crucial talks to bring Hungary's government finances under control, Nicholas Denton writes from Budapest. Hungary's missing of its IMF targets sets the scene for the two sides' most difficult negotiations since democratic elections in 1990.</p>

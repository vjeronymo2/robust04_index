			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Burundi coup plotters waver TUTSI paratroopers who murdered President Melchior Ndadaye of Burundi in a coup last week appear to be ready to surrender power in return for an amnesty, writes Leslie Crawford. Lt-Colonel Jean Bikomagu, Burundi's army chief of staff, disowned the plotters, in a radio broadcast at the weekend, saying: 'The military men have accepted that the government of Frodebu (Ndadaye's party) should rule again, but it should examine the question of amnesty for those who participated in the coup.' Members of Mr Ndadaye's government who have taken refuge in western embassies said they would not negotiate with the plotters while the Tutsi-led army continued to massacre Hutu peasants. Aid agencies said more than 200,000 Hutus - Burundi's main ethnic group - had fled into Rwanda and dozens of people, including children, had died since Thursday's coup. Diplomats said the coup plotters had lost control of the army and were now frightened of the violence they had unleashed. But they could not see a return to civilian rule while the Tutsi tribe continued to dominate the army.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] (Ramos Ruiz Cubiles), regional director of the  Spanish Information Science Regional Training Center, CREI  [Centro Regional de Entranamiento Informatico], has stated in  this capital that cooperation between CREI and our country has  increased both in quality and quantity.    (Ruiz Cubiles) added: Since we began these relations 14  years  ago, we have passed through several stages. The first was  advisory and course-oriented; the second, over the past five  years, involved the implementation of some projects, with others  still pending approval. Now we can say that the '94 Information  Science Conference represents the starting point of a third  stage, during which the Cuba-Spain-Unesco triangle can hopefully  facilitate greater participation by public and private companies  in these projects.    (Ruiz Cubiles) said that these companies must take a more  entrepreneurial view, more concerned about the projects' profits  and economic gains.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II urged world leaders to take advantage of an emerging "moral  awakening" to jointly combat international problems ranging from drugs and AIDS  to poverty and pollution. The Pope, speaking to diplomats in Copenhagen on the  seventh day of his trip to Scandinavia, said the 20th Century has brought war  and "seemingly intractable sources of suffering," including AIDS (acquired  immune deficiency syndrome). "Yet many will agree that the world is living  through a moment of extraordinary awakening," he said. "The old problems remain  and new ones arise, but there is also a growing awareness of an opportunity  being offered to give birth to a new and better era." The Pope will leave  Denmark today for his final stop, Sweden.  </P></p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Venezuela volunteers to mediate in banana exporters' dispute VENEZUELA HAS volunteered to mediate in the simmering dispute between Latin American and Caribbean banana producers over access to the European Community market. The offer was made by President Ramon Velaquez during a meeting in Port of Spain, capital of Trinidad and Tobago, with the presidents of Colombia and Mexico and the leaders of the Caribbean Community and Suriname. It followed an attack at the conference on the Latin American producers by Mr James Mitchell, the prime minister of St Vincent, who said that the economies of the Windward Islands of the Caribbean and of other traditional banana suppliers to Europe, were threatened by 'indiscriminate flooding of the market by supplies from Latin America'. 'Should our economies be destroyed by this, then relations between Latin America and the countries of the Windward Islands are quite likely to suffer irreparable damage,' Mr Mitchell said. The row between the Latin Americans and the EC's traditional suppliers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific group is over the community's banana import regime, implemented in July, which imposes a 2m tonnes-a-year quota for Latin American fruit. Imports up to that level attract duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 78) a tonne while a duty of Ecu850 a tonne is applied to above-quota imports. The community's traditional suppliers in the ACP group have tariff-free access for the remainder of the EC's needs of about 1.5m tonnes a year. The ACP producers say many economies dependent on banana exports face damage through reduced market access while the Latin Americans say they are more efficient producers and should benefit from an open market for the fruit. 'Market intelligence since the introduction of the new regime is indicating that the banana situation in Latin America is not turning out, for Latin America, to be as negative as those countries have been asserting,' Mr Mitchell said. 'The survival of the Windward Islands' economies depends on banana exports. We produce less than 2 per cent of the bananas in the Western Hemisphere and supply only 20 per cent of the European market.' Mr Patrick Manning, prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago and chairman of the summit meeting, said that the leaders of Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela had understood the arguments of the Caribbean banana producers and others in the ACP group. 'Venezuela has undertaken to co-ordinate discussions with the Latin American producers, while St Lucia will do the same for the Caribbean producers,' Mr Manning said. 'The plan is for a ministerial meeting with an agenda to discuss the matter and find common ground.'</p>

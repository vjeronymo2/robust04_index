			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- The government at  today's session approved the proposal for a modification of the  Market Regulation Fund in Agriculture, Agriculture Minister  Pavel Koncos said at a press conference today. The fund should  be financed by a 50 percent share from proceeds from  privatization of agricultural companies and should start  operating in June.    It will be administered through the National Bank of  Slovakia  by some of the banks that have granted loans to agricultural  producers in the past. Koncos said Polnobanka (Agricultural  Bank) and Vseobecna uverova banka (General Credit Bank) were  under consideration. The fund is to provide money particularly  for technological equipment for agricultural, forest and water  management companies.    Koncos also said the ministry was working on food  legislation  which includes stricter criteria for inspecting the quality of  food products, in line with European Union regulations. He said  that Slovakia, in contrast to the Czech Republic, had already  adopted a number of norms corresponding to regulations in the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which had also brought  about the introduction of certificates on imported food products.</p>

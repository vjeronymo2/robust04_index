			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: A violinist to treasure EVEN FOR seasoned concert-goers this recital climaxed with a moment to treasure. Nobody in the audience at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Thursday could have predicted the unique surprise with which the evening was to end, though they might have had an informed guess at the quality of the rest, given that Lydia Mordkovitch has a fine reputation as a recitalist. With the Wigmore Hall closed for renovation, the administrators of London's other concert-halls only now seem to be waking up to the dearth of recitals at the moment. The South Bank is starting a vocal series in the Purcell Room and the QEH will also host a few more solo events. The problem there is that a recitalist has to be able to project not only the sound but also the personality into a far larger hall. On both counts Lydia Mordkovitch succeeds admirably. Among today's violinists she is one of the bigger players in terms of her tone quality, a heart-warming Russian bear-hug of a sound. There is no danger that quiet playing will sound thin or the loud become strident. A range of warm colours is always ready to embrace the music, almost too much of a good thing in her opening Beethoven sonata, where one sensed the full musical personality biding its time. With Szymanowski's extravagantly romantic Sonata its time came - a splendid performance. In this piece the composer is ever turning up the heat to more ecstatic heights of lyricism. It is easy to imagine some violinists paling at the thought of being asked to raise their playing one more degree up the thermometer's passion scale, but Mordkovitch manages to do so and suggest that she has capacity to spare. She also brought some authority to the finale, a showy piece of rabble-rousing on Szymanowski's part. The second half opened with five minutes pause for reflection in Rakhmaninov's Romance Op. 6 No. 1 (the very special tone quality the violinist found for this I can only describe as the sound of tears). After which Mordkovitch and her fine accompanist, Marina Gusak-Grin, closed their programme with Saint-Saens's First Sonata, Op. 75. In the lyrical music Mordkovitch carefully corseted her tone to form a slimmer and more stylish sound, but it is the dexterity of the finale that suits her best. With the semiquavers racing past, clouds of resin started to rise in the air. And then, just as the violinist reached the last bar, the bow flew out of her hand and away over her shoulder, leaving the pianist aghast to play the final chords. That is just the sort of player Miss Mordkovitch is - generous, giving the music unabashedly her all, which is why her recitals are becoming such a pleasure to attend.</p>

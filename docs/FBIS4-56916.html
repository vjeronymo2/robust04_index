			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez said last  night at the headquarters of the Guatemalan Air Force: When I  speak of a cease-fire, which hopefully will be definite in all  areas where guerrillas are present, how joyful this would be,  because I believe all of Guatemalan society and even  international opinion would be satisfied, even though the URNG  [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] does not have the  resolve to carry it out.    Enriquez added: "I have never asked for a definitive  cease-fire in all areas where there is a guerrilla presence. I  have spoken exclusively of the areas between Ixcan and Xabal  Rivers, Quiche Department, where the refugees are returning and  where the CPR [Communities of Resistant People] are displaced. "    "If they (URNG) defend these people and want those who  complain the Army has them surrounded to live in peace, they  will, hopefully, show their political resolve with a cease-fire  in all of the Ixcan area, because this would help the people  join civilian life," Enriquez said.</p>

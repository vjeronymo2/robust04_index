			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Greece prepares first issue of sterling-linked bonds The Republic of Greece is preparing its first issue of sterling-linked drachma-bonds for launch in mid-December. The issue is the latest in a series of foreign currency-linked bonds designed to attract foreign investors, writes Tracy Corrigan. This week, the Greek government is launching a second issue of DM and dollar-linked bonds maturing in one, three and five years. The subscription period runs today and Thursday. The government is also considering a yen-linked issue in the new year, Mr Peter Doukas, deputy minister of finance, said. While the bulk of Greece's debt is concentrated in the domestic market, most of it is short-dated. The foreign currency-linked structure has allowed the republic to extend the maturity profile of its debt. The withholding tax-free, bearer bonds are denominated in drachma, but the interest and principal payments are indexed to the foreign currency. Although Greece is a member of the European Community, the drachma is outside the exchange rate mechanism. Greece has increased the yields on its three-month Treasury bills by 1 1/4 per cent to 19 1/4 per cent and the yields on its six and 12-month bills by 1 1/2 per cent to 21 1/4 per cent and 23 per cent.</p>

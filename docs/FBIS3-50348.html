			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a session of the Macedonian Parliament today, a  deputy from the Albanian Party of Democratic Prosperity [name  indistinct] accused the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian  Revolutionary Organization-Party of Macedonian National Unity]  of following an anti-Macedonian policy. He claimed that members  of the VMRO-DPMNE leadership frequently visited Bulgaria and  obtained large amounts of money from there.    In reply to the charges, Dosta Dimovska, deputy chairman of  the VMRO-DPMNE, accused the Albanian party, asserting that its  leaders often travel to Albania to receive instructions and  that, in practice, they place themselves at the service of a  foreign state.    Stojan Andov, chairman of the Macedonian Parliament, offered  his services as an arbitrator. He declared that Macedonia is a  democratic state and everyone can travel anywhere he or she  likes, but that people's deputies must conduct themselves in  word and deed in their country's interests.</p>

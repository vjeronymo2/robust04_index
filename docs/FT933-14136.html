			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Celanese Canada quadruples profit CELANESE Canada, the synthetic fibre and chemical products group controlled by Germany's Hoechst, said first half profits quadrupled from a year earlier because of strength in textiles and industrial products and a lower Canadian dollar. The pace of growth is expected to hold throughout 1993. Net profit was CDollars 28.2m (USDollars 22m), or CDollars 2.06 a share, up from CDollars 7.3m, or 50 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 213m against CDollars 207m. Second-quarter earnings were CDollars 15.5m, or CDollars 1.14, against a loss of CDollars 900,000 a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 111m against CDollars 117m.</p>

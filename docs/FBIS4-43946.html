			<p>BFN     [Text] Iceland's minister for social affairs has resigned  over differences with her party leader, the Icelandic Foreign  Minister Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson. Johanna Sigurdardottir has  been in conflict with Mr Hannibalsson and has challenged his  leadership at this month's Social Democratic Party conference.  In a controversial move the party recently adopted eventual  membership of the European Union as its aim. Johanna  Sigurdardottir has been a member of the Icelandic parliament  since 1978 and was the only woman in the current government.</p>

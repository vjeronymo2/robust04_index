			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is refusing to supply additional Russian gas  and raw oil to Georgian oil processing factories. "Extraction of  fuel and energy in Russia is falling, investments for the  development of the oil and gas industry are being reduced and  this cannot but affect our relations with our partners," a  top-ranking employee from the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry  reported to the Oil Information Agency.    He added that "if there is a surplus, gas will be pumped via  Ukrainian territory to Western Europe to prevent the disruption  of exports."    A total of 6.9 billion cubic meters of gas are shipped  annually along the Vladikavkaz-Tbilisi pipeline, 2.7 billion  cubic meters of which are intended for Armenia.    Officials at the Fuel and Energy Ministry recognize that  shipments of Russian raw oil to Georgia for re-processing in the  republic are not possible due to the fact that Russian oil  processing enterprises do not work to their full capacity.    Observers believe that this problem can be partially solved  thanks to the setting up of joint Russian-Georgian ventures to  extract or re-process oil in the Tyumen region. The ministry is  ready to render assistance to interested enterprises both in  Russia and Georgia.    "The issue of Russia's participation in the corporatization  of the Georgian port of Poti cannot be solved positively because  Russia intends primarily to render its financial support to  Russian sea ports for their reconstruction and development,"  reported the employee.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to Oranut Osathanon, director of the  Foreign Trade Department, the latest development in the  negotiations between Thailand and the United States on extension  of the textile quota which expired on 31 December is that the  Thai side has asked for a new round of negotiations on 21-22  February in the United States. The United States has not  responded yet.    Earlier negotiations failed to reach agreement because the  U.S. side wanted to include punitive action against countries it  found to have exceeded quotas by using quotas of third countries  by immediate reduction of the offending countries' quotas. If  the quota violation is large, the reduction would be threefold.  The Thai side felt the punishment to be unfair. It also sought  quota enlargement and thus refused to sign an accord. The Thai  side has been trying to organize other ASEAN countries to  enhance its bargaining power.    Oranut said the fact that the Philippines accepted the U.S.  conditions and signed an accord early last month could make it  more difficult for Thailand to negotiate quota enlargement and  punitive clauses. In any event, the accord reached between the  United States and the Philippines will be studied to aid  Thailand's negotiation position.    Oranut said an alternative is to not sign a quota accord,  the  course which Thailand chose three years ago.</p>

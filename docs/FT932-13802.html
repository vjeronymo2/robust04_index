			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Hani murder 'a conspiracy' SOUTH AFRICAN police said yesterday they believe there was a right-wing conspiracy to murder black activist Mr Chris Hani, who was buried on Monday. In a pre-dawn raid they arrested five more right-wing whites, including Mrs Gaye Derby-Lewis, Australian-born wife of Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, a leading Conservative party member already in custody for the same reason. The Conservative party is the official parliamentary opposition, and the new arrests lend weight to suspicions that the conspiracy to murder Mr Hani extended well beyond extreme-right fringe groups, to the top of the right-wing establishment. They have provoked a crisis in the Conservative party, whose leader, Mr Andries Treurnicht, seems likely to retire after a heart bypass operation earlier this week. Political analysts say the Conservative party's defeat in last year's white referendum left white radicals with no constitutional avenue for resistance. Yesterday's arrests suggest that some, at least, may have turned to violence. Meanwhile, at least nine people were injured when a car bomb exploded in the coastal town of Amanzimtoti yesterday.</p>

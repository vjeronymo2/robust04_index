			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Reinhard] </F>   [Text] The first estimates available yesterday at 2200  hours based on initial tallies seem to point to a major  political change. Within the majority, the list led by Dominique  Baudis comes in first. However, it definitely falls short of  achieving its goal as a "union" list, since it seems to have  done less well than Valery Giscard d'Estaing's list in 1989.  And, above all, Philippe de Villiers wins his gamble: There is  indeed a place for him at the fringes of the majority. Should  final tallies also confirm that his list ("The Other Europe")  outstrips [National Front leader] Le Pen's, it would become  impossible to ignore Mr. de Villiers in the run-up to the  impending [1995] presidential election. The majority still must  pay for relegating Jean-Francois Deniau to the sidelines.    Not that this paradoxical result should be a hindrance for  right-wing presidential contenders. Neither [Prime Minister]  Edouard Balladur nor [Rally for the Republic (RPR) President]  Jacques Chirac have condemned Mr. de Villiers' behavior, even  though the RPR's two virtual candidates did not go as far as  Messrs. Pons and [Interior Minister] Pasqua in encouraging the  dissident.    This morning, Mr. de Villiers' results have settled the  question as to whether or not he belongs to the majority. Some  may now realize, albeit belatedly, that his performance may drag  the majority further to the right than would be necessary to  ensure victory for one of its members in 1995.    However, the major event is to be found within the Left.  [Socialist Party (PS) Secretary General] Michel Rocard is doing  only slightly better than Bernard Tapie [Left Radical Movement].  The failure of his "little big bang" tactics is so plain that  he can obviously no longer be the PS presidential candidate.  That is, unless Socialist leaders choose to stick to the rule:  "One does not change a losing team." Nevertheless, since  Bernard Tapie, despite all his difficulties, managed to snap at  Michel Rocard's heels in such a decisive manner, the verdict is  clear: Mr. Rocard is now out of the running.    There will be time tomorrow to scrutinize results and  compare  them with those of our neighbors, since, after all, this was a  European election. For the future, on a European scale, this  election is fraught with information. But as far as France is  concerned, and here all that matters from now on is the  presidential election, the 12 June election has drastically  simplified the issue for the Left by eliminating Rocard, while  in return it has contributed to complicating things for the  Right, except for Philippe de Villiers...and Charles Pasqua.</p>

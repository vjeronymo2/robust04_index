			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / TV groups ordered to surrender riot film THE BBC, Sky Television, Independent Television News and London News Network were yesterday ordered by a judge to hand to police transmitted and unscreened footage of a riot in Whitechapel, east London, last month. Judge Gerald Butler, Southwark crown court's senior judge, ruled that establishing the guilt or innocence of those involved in the riot 'far outweighed perceived loss of integrity' of the television companies. Issuing production orders under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, he said public interest demanded that they supply police with footage. The disturbances on September 10 came during a vigil by more than 300 mainly Asian demonstrators outside the Royal London Hospital for Mr Quaddas Ali, a student who was in a coma on a life-support machine after an attack two days earlier by a white gang. The judge said he had heard evidence from police how members of the crowd had 'run through the streets of Whitechapel assaulting members of the public and police and causing damage to property and motor vehicles. 'Thirty-one police officers and five members of the public were injured, some seriously. Nine arrests were made. They have been charged variously with public order acts and other offences.' LNN and ITN had refused to hand over film but made no submissions to the court against the issuing of production orders, the judge said. The BBC and Sky News - part of BSkyB, the satellite television venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake  - argued through counsel that such orders would 'put in question' their 'integrity and impartiality', as well as 'imperilling' the safety of journalists and photographers. Judge Butler said: 'This material is crucial to these matters. I do not see how the integrity and impartiality of those involved should be affected when it is an order of the courts. Public interest far outweighs the perceived loss of integrity.' The judge went on to reject suggestions by counsel for the respondents that the material was not likely to be of substantial value to the investigation or be relevant evidence. He made no order as to costs.</p>

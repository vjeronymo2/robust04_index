			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Military base guards to lose union rights SECURITY GUARDS at military installations are to lose the right to be represented by unions affiliated to the Labour party. The TGWU and GMB general unions have been told by the Ministry of Defence that the rules will change in April. The MoD said the decision had been taken because it was 'the government's view that political affiliation by a trade union would run counter to the need for the political neutrality of the Civil Service'. The move led to protests in the Commons from Labour MPs. Mr Gerald Bermingham, Labour MP for St Helens South, called for an early statement by Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary. He accused the government of seeking to extend the ban on union membership already applied to white-collar staff at GCHQ, the government communications centre at Cheltenham. The eighth anniversary of the ban is to be marked with a rally in Cheltenham today. The TGWU and GMB represent 2,400 security guards at military bases and MoD offices throughout the country. All security guards at such establishments are vetted for security purposes. Last April the MoD said it wanted to rationalise its employment of security guards, many of whom were locally employed on varying terms and conditions. The MoD said the unions had been consulted over the rationalisation. Attacking the decision on Labour-affiliated unions, Mr Danny Bryan, a TGWU national officer, said guards were worried about losing their jobs as a result of the rationalisation. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said: 'This is a clear denial of their civil liberties, preventing them from being a member of their chosen union after they have been members for many years without any complaint.' The NUCPS civil servants union, which represents a small number of supervisory guards but is not affiliated to the Labour party, will be allowed to continue negotiating pay and condition for its members.</p>

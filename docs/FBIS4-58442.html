			<p>BFN     [Text] An understanding was reached in Cairo overnight  whereby the Gaza-Jericho agreement would be signed even if the  last outstanding issue -- positioning a Palestinian policeman on  the Allenby Bridge -- is not settled.    Our correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that Israel agreed last  night to expand Jericho's autonomous area and include an area  west of al-'Awja' in it. Both delegations are pursuing their  contacts in a bid to solve the question of the Palestinian  policeman by the time of the signing ceremony.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Dollars 7bn-Dollars 12bn bill for Gaza, West Bank BETWEEN Dollars 7bn and Dollars 12bn will be needed in external resources over the next 10 years to rehabilitate the economies of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, according to preliminary estimates by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Among the priority needs of the area identified by Unctad are immediate action to revive activity in the Gaza Strip, where half the workforce is unemployed, as well as extensive investment in infrastructure, health and education, an overhaul of the tax and finance systems and establishment of an efficient and effective public administration. Unctad's estimates of the cost of reviving the Palestinian economy, in a report yesterday to its executive board, range from Dollars 3bn to Dollars 7bn for Gaza alone, depending on how many Palestinians might return to the area, and another Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn for the West Bank. This is far more than World Bank estimates of at least Dollars 3bn over 10 years for both areas combined. The US has called an international conference early next month on financial help for Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURANCE POLICY PLAYED A PART IN KEEPING ELWAY ON SIDELINES  </P> <P> A Lloyd's of London insurance policy played a part in keeping Denver  quarterback John Elway sidelined last week when his knee brace disappeared in  San Francisco, Bronco owner Pat Bowlen said.  </P> <P> According to Bowlen, the policy on Elway becomes void if the quarterback plays  without the custom-fitted brace on his left knee.  </P> <P> Saturday, the brace disappeared from Elway's locker at Candlestick Park before  the game, in which the 49ers defeated the Broncos, 35-17. Team officials said  they didn't want Elway to play without the brace in case of an injury.  </P> <P> Bowlen said another factor in the decision to keep Elway out of the game was  the insurance policy. "John is fortunate," he said. "Not a lot of players can  get a policy, but he can."  </P> <P> Bronco General Manager John Beake said the team took out the policy when the  Broncos played an exhibition game in London two years ago. The clause  specifying the use of the brace is the only such qualifying one.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Jeff Townsend of Bakersfield, Calif., who designed Elway's brace,  said a new one would be in Elway's hands by today.  </P></p>

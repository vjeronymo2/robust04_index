			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Executives of the ruling  coalition parties on Saturday agreed on the need to select a  candidate to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  and inaugurate a fresh cabinet by the end of next week.    "We all agree that we have to form a new cabinet within next  week," Social Democratic Party (SDP) secretary general Wataru  Kubo told a news conference.    The No. 2 man in the largest contingent in the coalition  voiced hope that the ruling seven-party union can inaugurate a  new cabinet and finish the next premier's major policy speech  and a questioning session by representatives from all parties  before parliament next week.    Kubo also spoke of the need for the new government to open  deliberations on the state budget for fiscal 1994, which started  April 1, in the week beginning April 17.    The ruling parties' officials will resume talks on Sunday  morning over the selection of a candidate to succeed Hosokawa,  who on Friday offered to resign after eight months in office  because of controversy over his personal financial deals and  stalled Diet budget debate.    At Saturday's meeting, the coalition executives continued  discussing a proposal for further coordinating basic policies  among the partners of the current coalition before setting up a  fresh administration, Kubo said.    The present coalition, an alliance of seven parties spanning  a wide political spectrum, set sail last August after the  parties in July hammered out an accord on basic policies to  establish a government.    The SDP believes the intercoalition agreement should be  honored even if the ruling forces move to narrow down their  differences on other policy matters, Kubo said.    Some coalition parties contend that now that the Hosokawa  government's intention to implement anticorruption political  reform has been achieved, the next government should be created  on the basis of a new policy accord to institute new reforms.    This concept could result in forcing the SDP out of the  coalition due to its lingering policy differences with other  coalition partners.    The SDP secretary general, however, said coalition  executives  are working to pick a possible successor to Hosokawa while  maintaining the current framework of the union.    Also at Saturday's meeting, the officials of the ruling  parties listened to a call from an official of a newly created  parliamentary group in the House of Representatives on other  ruling forces to join the group.    The new group "Reform," consisting of members of Hosokawa's  Japan New Party (JNP) and the United Social Democratic Party,  was established Friday after the JNP dissolved its parliamentary  affiliation with new party Sakigake (Harbinger).    Behind the establishment of the group is Hosokawa's  intention  to create a new large parliamentary group of current coalition  forces as a step toward launching a new party to keep the  once-dominant Liberal Democratic Party at bay, political sources  said.    Each party of the coalition will consider the call from the  new parliamentary group on their own, Kubo said.    Shinseito and Komeito are expected to join "Reform" next  week, while the SDP, Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party  will not take part in the parliamentary group, coalition sources  said.    Shinseito and Komeito are envisioning a new government to be  made up of parties with full accords on key policies, such as  tax reform and policy toward North Korea, party officials said.    The SDP disagrees with their stand, saying the top priority  should be how to maintain the seven-party coalition and keep it  in power, SDP lawmakers said.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, also vice premier, is  emerging  as the front-runner for the premiership, coalition sources said.    In interviews with news organizations, former Foreign  Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP hinted at allying with  Shinseito and other parties with which he shares views on  Japan-U.S. relations, tax reform and North Korea's suspected  nuclear weapons program.    He said the Japanese people want to see an alliance of  parties that can execute policy objectives.    Asked about the possibility that some senior Shinseito  members may ask Watanabe to run for the premiership if he quits  the LDP, Watanabe replied, "Ask the Shinseito members."</p>

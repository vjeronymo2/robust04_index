The Orioles have  until Dec. 15 to exercise a 1991 option on Kittle.  </P> <P> The San Diego Padres prevented first baseman Jack Clark from becoming a free  agent by offering him salary arbitration.  </P> <P> Also, Jack Morris' agent said that the pitcher did not exercise his  $2.1-million option for 1991 so as not to jeopardize his position in the third  collusion case. The Tigers had offered him arbitration.  </P></p>

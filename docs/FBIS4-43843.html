			<p>BFN     [Text] Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys will end his  official visit to Sweden late this afternoon. Our special  correspondent accompanying the minister, Klara Stejskalova, has  telephoned this dispatch to us from Stockholm.    [Stejskalova] Minister Baudys had another tete-a-tete  meeting  with his Swedish counterpart Anders Bjorck shortly before  midday. This is what Bjorck said about the outcome of this  meeting:    [Begin Bjorck recording in English with superimposed Czech  translation] I think the signing of the memorandum on mutual  understanding, which deepens contacts between us, is the most  important outcome of this visit. Sweden's interest in and  approach to solving the security situation in Europe is similar  to those of the Czech Republic. [end recording]    [Stejskalova] Like our Republic, Sweden regards the  resolution of relations with Russia, which have been of some  concern recently, as the issue of paramount importance at the  present time.    Naturally, the situation in the former Yugoslavia was also  discussed. The two ministers said jointly that they had found a  common language.    Prior to leaving, the Czech delegation headed by Antonin  Baudys will meet Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas.</p>

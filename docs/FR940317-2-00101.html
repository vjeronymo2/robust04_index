			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Broader public participation in the form of written comments is also essential to this process and is being solicited through this Notice. Comments received by May 2, 1994 will be considered by the five industry working groups in preparing the reports which then will be presented by SBA at the second Forum. Public comments should be as specific as possible and should focus on possible constructive solutions to any problems presented. Each submission should identify the industry affected, so as to facilitate a referral to the appropriate industry working group. SBA, OIRA and the participating agencies are particularly interested in comments concerning the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Specific ways in which existing regulatory programs and the regulatory process can be made more ``user-friendly'' to small businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Constructive suggestions for reducing forms and paperwork, particularly where they are duplicative, overly complicated or otherwise burdensome for small businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Effective ways to communicate with small business owners and to assist them in their understanding and implementation of complex regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Non-punitive methods for ensuring compliance with regulatory objectives or requirements, including preinspection programs, advisory services, greater reliance on communication and dissemination of information, and industry self-regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _More effective ways to elicit participation from the private sector in efforts to simplify and clarify regulations so that they are not overly complex or unduly difficult to interpret or implement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Systematic ways to identify proposed regulations which are inconsistent with or duplicative of other regulations of the issuing agency or other Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Suggestions for involving small business owners and their representatives in the rulemaking process in a more meaningful way. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments must be received no later than May 2, 1994, in order to be incorporated into the industry working group reports to be presented at the second Small Business Forum on Regulatory Reform to be held in late June 1994.

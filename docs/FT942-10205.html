			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Hurd seeks truce with rebels before European election Mr Douglas Hurd yesterday sought to call a truce with the Tory Euro-sceptics before next month's European elections and insisted that Mr John Major would defeat any attempt to oust him as prime minister even if the party suffered heavy losses. 'He will continue as prime minister. He will not be defeated. He will not resign,' the foreign secretary told the Scottish Conservative conference in Inverness. Mr Hurd's unqualified support for Mr Major reflects a growing consensus among senior cabinet ministers that the party would be seriously damaged by a leadership election in the autumn. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, is expected to deliver a similar pledge of loyalty when he addresses the conference today. Significantly, Mr Major was also given outspoken support by Mr Michael Forsyth, the Thatcherite employment minister, who is tipped to enter the cabinet as Scottish secretary if Mr Ian Lang becomes party chairman in a summer reshuffle. Mr Forsyth called Mr Major 'a man of steel', and warned 'windy backbenchers and retired generals' to give their advice 'in private, not transmitted through enemy lines'. Mr Hurd warned the conference that the Conservatives would avoid disaster in the elections on June 9 only if the party stopped 'scratching at old wounds' over Europe. Mr Hurd tried to appeal to Euro-sceptics by pointing out that the European Union was increasingly accepting the need for 'variable geometry' - code for a more flexible community of nation states. He said: 'This is a multi-track, multi-speed, even multi-layered approach which will increasingly be the way of the future. It threatens no one.' Mr Hurd said the EU was already developing an emphasis on competitiveness, deregulation and subsidiarity which would be encouraged by the accession of Austria and three Nordic applicants next year. He said the union's growing flexibility was reflected in Britain's opt-outs from the Maastricht agreements on monetary union and social policy, and the exclusion of some EU members from the Western European Union defence agreement and the Schengen border treaty. There was no question of Britain being left in a 'slow lane or outer circle' of the EU. 'There may be areas in which some members of the union see advantage in closer integration, while others choose to stand aside. Beyond the core disciplines, we want Europe to develop in tune with the sentiments and interests of its separate peoples.' Mr Hurd's speech, however, followed an acrimonious debate in which Euro-sceptics demanded a referendum on any move towards British participation in a single European currency, and accused the party hierarchy of trying to stamp out dissent.

This has been stated in an interview with foreign journalists  by Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, commander of Ukraine's Navy. He  emphasized that the protocol signed in Massandra by Presidents  Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk was only a protocol of intent.  The handover of the Ukrainian part of the Fleet has never been  a way out of the situation that has come about.    According to the commander, the issue has been studied and  rejected. The handover of the Ukrainian part of the Fleet to  Russia is no longer being discussed. Instead, both sides are in  agreement on creating a commission to inventorize the ships and  other fleet property for the purpose of dividing them up in  accordance with the yet earlier accords between the presidents  of the two countries. In Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy's opinion the  Fleet should be divided equally before the end of 1995.</p>

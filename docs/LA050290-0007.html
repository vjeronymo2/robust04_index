			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Nancy Hoover Hunter's retrial on fraud and conspiracy charges linked to the  collapse of the J. David &amp; Co. investment firm, due to begin Tuesday, was  postponed for a week after a brief hearing in San Diego federal court.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam put off the start of Hunter's trial until  May 8 to give defense attorney Richard Marmaro, out of state on another case,  time to finish the other matter.  </P> <P> Hunter, a former Del Mar mayor, was convicted in December -- after an  eight-month trial -- of four counts of tax evasion connected to the giant J.  David fraud, which cost some 1,500 investors about $80 million. In March,  Gilliam sentenced her to 10 years in federal prison.  </P> <P> She faces a retrial on 192 other counts, primarily fraud and conspiracy  stemming from her role at the failed La Jolla firm.  </P></p>

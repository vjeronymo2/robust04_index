			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Media groups to join lottery bid CARLTON Communications and Associated Newspapers are about to join the Granada-led consortium planning to bid for the licence to operate the new national lottery. An announcement is expected today that the groups have joined the consortium, The Great British Lottery Company. Carlton, which holds the London weekday ITV licence, and Associated Newspapers, which publishes the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, are each believed to be taking a 10 per cent stake in the venture. The main members of the consortium are Granada, the leisure group, and the Vodafone Group, the mobile telecommunications concern, each with 35 per cent. Hambros, the merchant bank that put the consortium together, also has a 10 per cent stake. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, is executive chairman of the consortium. The new shareholders should help to make the consortium one of the leading contenders for the lottery, which is due to be launched late next year or early in 1995. The lottery, which could eventually have annual revenues of Pounds 3bn-Pounds 5bn, is designed to raise money for charity, the arts, sport, national heritage and celebrating the millennium. The national lottery bill is due to receive royal assent in October. So far, the lottery licence's other main contenders include NM Rothschild, the merchant bank, in a joint venture with Tattersall's, the Australian company which runs the state lottery in Victoria; the Rank Organisation; and a consortium put together by GTECH of the US, which supplies lottery equipment and runs lotteries all over the world. Bids are also expected from the leading football pools companies Littlewoods and Vernons, part of Ladbroke's. The National Heritage Department is expected to announce by the middle of next month the appointment of a regulatory adviser, who would also probably become director-general designate of the Office of the National Lottery.</p>

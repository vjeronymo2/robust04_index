			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 25 January (MTI) -- In the wake of  Hungarian-Slovak disputes in recent weeks, Hungarian Foreign  Minister Geza Jeszenszky wrote to his Slovak counterpart Jozef  Moravcik today, foreign affairs spokesman Janos Herman told a  press conference.    In a letter, Jeszenszky expresses surprise at the Slovak  Foreign Ministry and Moravcik personally criticizing an  interview he gave Polish weekly POLYTIKA. In the interview,  Jeszenszky said some of Hungary's neighbours had failed to  totally observe recommendations in the Copenhagen declaration  and in Council of Europe (CE) papers.    These documents guarantee national minorities' individual  and  collective rights to set up their own educational, cultural, and  church institutions, and to play an active role in public  affairs, including forming local or autonomous administrative  districts.    Under Council of Europe recommendations, all members of an  ethnic community have the right to use their family and given  names in their mother tongue, and that right has to be  recognized by the authorities. In districts with large  minorities, these communities have the right to use their mother  tongue in public administration and courts, and put up signs and  other information in their mother tongue.    Hungary's foreign minister found it difficult to say that  official Slovak practice follows European Union [EU] ethnic  minority guidelines. South Slovak representatives in a recent  Komarno conference urged new types of councils following  "regional traditions," and with more local involvement.    Jeszenszky feels Slovakia would help its own interests by  fulfilling legitimate wishes of Hungarians in Slovakia: Helping  stability and improving Hungarian-Slovak links, enabling both  countries to take a common Central European position abroad.    The foreign minister saw common interest in reuniting  citizens by reopening border posts closed since the Second World  War.    "Hungary, as Jozef Moravcik well knows, is ready to confirm  the well-known fact that it recognizes the two countries' joint  border," Jeszenszky wrote, saying numerous other unsolved  problems were holding up the basic agreement, not any border  question.    Herman added that Hungary has Maastricht-like borders in  mind, saying there was no border dispute. The Hungarian foreign  minister's visit to Slovakia is still on the agenda, he said.</p>

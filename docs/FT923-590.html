			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Assurance for investors and creditors - Auditors' involvement in half-yearly statements Casual readers of at least two sets of half-year results released this month might easily have thought they had been given a sneak preview of the full-year figures six months too early. The error would not have been caused by the size of the figures themselves, but by the fact that there was so much financial information available. A growing number of companies are providing more detailed half-yearly information, with divisional or geographical breakdowns of profit, or information on their balance sheet. But Guardian Royal Exchange, the insurance company, and Guinness, the drinks group, have gone several steps further. Their interim reports resemble more closely the financial statements in an annual report, even to the extent of including a statement from Price Waterhouse, auditor to both companies. Their results for the first half of 1992 are presented with a profit and loss account, geographical break-down, and also a full balance sheet. In addition, both have a full cash flow statement in accordance with the new Financial Reporting Standard. The figures presented in either case are unaudited. But they are accompanied by a letter from Price Waterhouse to the directors of the company, which says the firm has 'reviewed' the figures The PW report says the review was not conducted in accordance with auditing standards, and did not involve visiting operating locations or verifying assets and liabilities. It principally meant understanding the process involved in preparing the financial information, applying analytical procedures to the data, and quizzing the management. It concludes: 'In our opinion, the half-yearly financial information has been prepared with due care and using accounting policies consistent with those adopted  .. in the statutory financial statements for the year ended December 31 1991.' GRE states that it provided greater interim financial information in line with the recommendations of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance. 'We had done the work internally, and we were quite happy to take up the Cadbury suggestion,' says Mr James Morley, finance director. The statements were easy to assemble because GRE has long asked its auditor to conduct an interim review, discussing factors such as the financial information collected, technical issues and accounting policies adopted. 'We believe that having a half-year numbers review makes a lot of sense,' says Mr Morley. 'You can get into very esoteric arguments about whether having a review saves costs at the year-end audit. But the costs are certainly justified by the benefits.' The same message comes from Mr Andrew Allner, financial controller at Guinness. 'We have taken a close interest in corporate governance and it came up in discussions with our auditors,' he says. It is no coincidence that both companies were audited by PW. Mr Graham Ward, a partner in the firm has been among those in the profession actively supporting auditor scrutiny of both interim and preliminary announcements. Mr Morley supports the idea of the PW comment. 'It gives shareholders some anchors to what's been done. It is quite an important statement.' Mr Allner adds: 'It gives the shareholders the feeling that the numbers have been reviewed by someone independent and objective. We think it's a good thing and would like to think other companies would do the same.' Mr Quentin Humberstone, the lead engagement partner at PW for GRE, says: 'It seemed a logical extension that because we're doing the review, we should say something about it. We put our pen where our work was.' He says the firm took considerable time deciding on the wording since there was no precedent and no guidelines That same wording was mirrored in for Guinness. He stresses that the PW comment is addressed to the directors, and offers none of the safeguards of the audit report in the annual accounts. However, Mr Ward adds: 'There may not be a legal obligation, but once our name is associated with the accounts, there is an implication that a degree of care has been taken. There is an assurance value.' At a time when both gearing and short-term cashflow are among the chief concerns of investors and creditors, it comes as no surprise that the extra balance sheet and cash flow information has been widely welcomed. However, Mr Morley says that 'interestingly' he has heard no comment on the auditor's statement. Perhaps that reflects uncertainty over what significance it really has. After all, without any mandatory requirement, it is unlikely that companies disagreeing with their auditors will publish it It also remains to be seen whether, if other companies follow the lead of GRE and Guiness, a comment without the legal obligations of a full audit will provide any reasonable guarantee that the interim accounts really represent a 'true and fair' view of the financial position.</p>

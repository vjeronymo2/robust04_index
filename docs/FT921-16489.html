			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Letter: Chancellor is right to reject the quick fix Sir, The voices from the backbenches and elsewhere calling for an economic quick fix, exemplify the reasons why, for too much of the post-second world war period, the pound has been a weak and suspect currency. How right the chancellor is to reject all the special pleading, however it is dressed up. He is right, too, that an attempt at unilateral realignment now, even if it were possible, would probably lead to higher interest rates, more misery and still slower recovery, as well as to immense and lasting longer-term damage. But how much better still it would now be if monetary and exchange rate policies were handled by an independent central monetary authority (although obviously with an ultimate political override). It would then be understood by markets beyond doubt that these matters were, to a degree, insulated from short-term political panics and pressures. An extra blessing would be to obviate the need for newspapers to trawl around for the opinions of lesser political fry over holiday periods, or to endow these opinions with any significance beyond their own minute worth. David Howell, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

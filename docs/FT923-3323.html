			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Books: Retreat from the flames of war - J D F Jones finds power and beauty in an extraordinary book / Autumn Fiction THE ENGLISH PATIENT by Michael Ondaatje Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 303 pages MICHAEL Ondaatje is a Sri Lankan poet, domiciled in Canada, who has now written the extraordinary novel we have been awaiting from him: The English Patient is, I suggest, a masterpiece. This week, it was named on the Booker prize shortlist. Over the past 10 years, without fanfare, Ondaatje has become something of a cult figure. There was a 1979 jazz novel called Coming Through Slaughter, and a 1983 memoir of his family, in particular of his drunken father, called Running in the Family (re-issued recently in Bloomsbury's elegant mini-hardback format, Pounds 9.99). Then - leaving aside the poetry - there was a remarkable novel in 1987 called In the Skin of a Lion (available in Picador, Pounds 5.99). That book called on John Berger for a prefatory quotation: 'Never again will a single story be told as though it were the only one.' There is a clue to The English Patient. It is interesting, but not essential, to know that this new work picks up several of the characters from In the Skin of a Lion. After the 1930s' Canada of the earlier book, we are now in Tuscany in the closing months of the second world war. The 'English patient' is a charred, unidentifiable, dying man who, we gradually discover, had parachuted in flames into the North African desert where he was rescued by the Bedouin. He is now tended by Hana, the shell-shocked Canadian nurse who is making her farewell to arms; and attended by the burglar-spy Caravaggio (for both, see the earlier novel) and a Sikh sapper, Kip, who spends his time on the very brink of death defusing the booby traps left in and around the villa by the departing Germans. The four of them are, in their different ways, in retreat; they continue their trades - nursing, bomb defusing - but they have stepped back into a private world in which social constructs have lost meaning. Ondaatje gives us their various and interlocking stories, and tells them with an imaginative power that makes them haunting and unforgettable. There is a central mystery about the 'patient' and, cumulatively and tentatively, we piece together a history of his pre-war Cairo life in the years when the Libyan desert was being explored for the first time and recorded in the dry prose of the Royal Geographic Society. The patient is not what he seems, and there is irony in it; he is not even English, but that is shown not to matter. We are taken beneath the charred surface to see that he is in no way an enemy - we are beneath that level - but a human being who enjoys pain, love, affection, memory, morphine, while his burnt body is symbolic of the old universe which has ended in flames. Caravaggio, too, has a dramatic biography of horror and has retreated to watch over Hana, just as she has dedicated herself to the patient. And Kip, engrossed in his terrifying trade, hovering on the outside, clearing the ground around the villa, is drawn slowly into the inner circle - until he hears of Hiroshima: 'They would never have dropped such a bomb on a white nation.' The young man who has risked his life to defuse a thousand European bombs is undone. He, now, must quit the war. Not for the first time, Ondaatje's imagination is seized by the plunge into the void (see the nun blown over the bridge in In the Skin of a Lion). Here, the image of the aviator descending in flames is repeated in Kip's final motorcycle crash into the river. The patient 'slips into the harness of the oil-wet parachute and pivots upside down, breaking free of glass, wind flinging his body back. Then his legs are free of everything, and he is in the air, bright, not knowing why he is bright until he realises he is on fire . . .' None of this can convey the power of Ondaatje's writing, the beauty and excitement of his images, the elegance of his prose. These are early days, and Booker-guessing is a silly game, but I find it hard to see how they will be able to deny him this year's prize. MORE BOOK REVIEWS ARE ON PAGE XVIII</p>

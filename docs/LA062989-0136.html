			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR SAYS ADMINISTRATOR QUIT BECAUSE OF THREATS  </P> <P> After five weeks on the job, interim City Administrator Andrew Lazzaretto  resigned suddenly last week, leaving in his wake a contentious City Council  disputing the reasons for his departure.  </P> <P> Lazzaretto did not return numerous phone calls this week.  </P> <P> Mayor Donna Smith said Lazzaretto came to her office Friday at 4:30 p.m., shut  the door and told her he was resigning, effective in 30 minutes.  </P> <P> "He could no longer work under such stressful conditions," Smith announced at  Monday night's council meeting. "He said that on two separate occasions he saw  a fist coming at him and he didn't know if his face was going to be smashed. .  . . He said he didn't need the money that much."  </P> <P> Smith said the blows were threatened by a councilman, but would not identify  the person.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Nell Soto said Lazzaretto also met with her Friday afternoon about  his resignation, but said nothing about stress or physical intimidation. Soto  said Lazzaretto told her his part-time job with Pomona was conflicting with his  other consulting work and family obligations.  </P> <P> "My understanding was that he had a hard time keeping up with everything," Soto  said. "Simply, he wasn't aware (when he took the job) of everything he would  have to do. . . . I don't know what he told the mayor."  </P> <P> The council voted in executive session early Tuesday morning to name Fire Chief  Tom Fee as interim city administrator. Fee's appointment was supported by  council members Soto, C. L. (Clay) Bryant and Tomas Ursua. Smith and Councilman  Mark Nymeyer voted against the choice.  </P> <P> Soto, Bryant and Ursua voted to hire Lazzaretto May 16 after a brief interview,  two weeks after the three forced the ouster of City Administrator A. J. Wilson.  Smith voted against hiring Lazzaretto. Nymeyer was absent, but later joined the  mayor in expressing concern over the council's quick choice of an interim  successor to Wilson.  </P> <P> In an interview earlier this month, Lazzaretto spoke philosophically about the  rancorous City Council he had encountered in Pomona.  </P> <P> "You have a new council group here," he said. "There is a new mix of  personalities. It takes time for people to get in a familiar groove. I think  after awhile, it'll kind of shake itself out."  </P> <P> But according to Smith and Nymeyer, Lazzaretto had already written his  resignation letter at the time he made those statements. Smith said the  administrator had told her he was having trouble withstanding threats and  harassment from Bryant.  </P> <P> Bryant, Smith said, had shouted at Lazzaretto two days before his resignation,  insisting that he fire executive assistant Hector Godinez. Bryant has sought to  have Godinez dismissed, claiming Wilson violated the City Code when he hired  him in January without approval of the city Merit System Commission. The  council majority later voted to eliminate the positions of Godinez and two  other top administrators.  </P> <P> However, Bryant denied trying to intimidate Lazzaretto and said he knows of no  physical threats to the administrator. "Donna Smith is a consummate, rotten  liar," he said in an interview. He acknowledged that he and Lazzaretto had  differences over Godinez's continued employment with the city.  </P> <P> "I insisted that (Lazzaretto) discharge the three positions that had been  eliminated from the budget," Bryant said. "But other than that, I respected the  man. I think he spread himself too thin. He could not do a good job and do his  other responsibilities, too. And I think that's why he resigned."  </P> <P> Smith said Lazzaretto resigned because "he couldn't compromise any further with  what Mr. Bryant was asking." He decided that he wanted to leave with his  professional integrity intact."  </P> <P> Nymeyer said he was not surprised by Lazzaretto's sudden exit. "Mr.  Lazzaretto's very experienced when it comes to dealing with a council that's at  odds," he said. "I think he looked at our City Council, the dynamics of the  personalities, and quickly concluded that this was no ordinary council."  </P> <P> RELATED STORY: Page 3  </P></p>

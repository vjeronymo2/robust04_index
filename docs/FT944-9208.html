			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: American prospectors look southwards US mining companies are acting on their threats to move most of their exploration efforts to Latin America because of the constraints they claim are put on their activities in their own country. So for the first time Latin America is emerging as the most favoured area for mining exploration, jumping from third place in 1993 to top this year. At the same time spending in the US is falling, according to the latest annual survey of mining exploration expenditure by Metals Economics Group, the Canadian consultancy. Total expenditure budgeted for this year by the 151 companies surveyed by MEG is up by a net USDollars 206.4m from the 1993 level to Dollars 9.13bn - the second successive annual increase and conclusively reversing the trend for budget cuts seen at the end of the 1980s and in the early 1990s. MEG says its survey covers about 80 per cent of world-wide expenditures. The consultants attempt to exclude from the totals any portion of diversified company budgets devoted to energy minerals, iron ore or aluminium-related exploration. Companies with budgets totalling Dollars 2.05bn give a geographic split of their spending. MEG says this shows 26.5 per cent (Dollars 543.7m against Dollars 331m in 1993) will be spent in Latin America, with Chile the most-favoured country followed by Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and Peru. Meanwhile, spending in the US, which has ranged between Dollars 340m and Dollars 350m, is dropping below Dollars 325m this year, marking 'the first time that the perceived constriction caused by the more stringent US regulatory environment has actually manifested in company budget allocations'. Of the Dollars 9.13bn of total spending covered by the survey, 56.4 per cent (Dollars 1.2bn) is going towards gold exploration, up from 49 per cent (Dollars 925m) in 1993. Base metals exploration is down to 31 per cent (Dollars 660.3m), from 35 per cent (Dollars 669m). Some 57 per cent of base metals expenditure is being directed this year at copper. Grassroots spending - as distinct from exploration at or near existing mine sites - is accounting for 53.5 per cent (Dollars 1.1bn) of the total. MEG says junior companies are back in force this year and it was obliged to change its cut-off for budgets included in the survey to Dollars 2m instead of the Dollars 1m used in previous years. It estimates that about 85 junior companies not included in its survey may be spending between Dollars 1m and Dollars 2m each on exploration for non-ferrous metals and minerals this year.

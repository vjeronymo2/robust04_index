			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 19 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il received a congratulatory message Saturday from the  Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front  [SKNDF] on the lapse of 30 years since he began working at the  Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea.    The message says that the historic start of the party work  by  the sagacious leader Comrade Kim Chong-il on June 19, 1964, was  a solemn declaration announcing the inheritance of the chuche  cause and full efflorescence and development of the Workers'  Party era and a political event worthy of being specially  recorded in the history of the chuche revolution.    Reviewing the feats performed by Comrade Kim Chong-il over  the last 30 years, the message notes that he has developed and  enriched the chuche idea with new principles and contents  through his unique ideological and theoretical activities and  strengthened and developed the Workers' Party of Korea to be a  chuche-type revolutionary party with his experienced and fresh  art of leadership.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great brilliant  commander, has built the Korean People' Army to be a matchless  and invincible army of the party equipped with modern defensive  and offensive means, made the Army and people a crystal of the  unity of loyal subjects and filial people, which cannot be  broken even by an atomic bomb and firmly built the whole country  into an impregnable fortress which any formidable imperialist  enemy cannot provoke and led to one victory after another the  most acute ever political and military confrontation with the  U.S. imperialists hell bent on stifling the northern half of  Korea, the message says.    It declares that Hanminjon will build up the independent  driving force of the change by stepping up the awakening of the  people to the consciousness of independence and their  organisation under the banner of the chuche idea and accelerate  the glorious victory of independence, democracy and  reunification by intensifying the anti-U.S., anti-war, anti-nuke  and anti-fascist struggle.    The message wishes Comrade Kim Chong-il good health and a  long life.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Offshore futures fund open to UK retail investors JOHNSON Fry, the UK financial services group, is marketing a guaranteed offshore futures fund, called the US Masters Guaranteed Futures Fund, to UK retail investors. Most offshore futures funds sold in the UK are aimed at high net-worth individuals. The US Masters Fund, however, requires an unusually small minimum investment of Pounds 2,000. The initial investment is fully guaranteed by Barclays Bank. The fund is structured as a closed-end investment company, incorporated in the Isle of Man, which runs for a set period of seven years. Profits are rolled up and paid out only at the end of that period, so that capital gains tax, rather than income tax, is paid. The US Masters Fund will use three US trading advisers, each of which has at least Dollars 50m of clients funds under management. They all have a track record of at least seven years, with an annual average rate return of at least 20 per cent. The Securities and Futures Authority is examining an advertisement for the Johnson Fry fund, which appeared in this week's Economist magazine, to decide whether it follows SFA rules. Under legislation passed last year, unit trusts using futures can now be sold to UK retail investors. The two structures permitted  - futures and options funds and geared futures and options funds  - are restricted in their use of futures and cannot be guaranteed. So far, only two companies have launched unit trusts using futures and options. Legal and General, which targetted at retail investors, has so far raised Pounds 10m (Dollars 17m). In the US, the managed futures business has expanded swiftly since the early 1980s. It currently has more than Dollars 20bn under management. Typically, futures funds are externally managed on a discretionary basis by specialist trading advisers. An offshore market for futures funds targetted at European and Japanese investors has also grown up in recent years. Most of the funds under management are run by US-based trading advisers.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / EC moves to defuse policy row with US EUROPEAN governments yesterday attempted to defuse a rift with the US over what action to take in Bosnia by pointing out that differences between allies on such complex issues were a normal hazard of transatlantic policy co-ordination. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said in parliament that he saw no purpose in 'exchanging accusations across the Atlantic' and cited several areas of agreement between the US and European nations over Bosnia. In particular, discussions were continuing on possible military measures to be taken against the Bosnian Serbs if they persisted in their refusal to endorse a United Nations and European Community-backed peace plan, he said. Though not mentioning him by name, Mr Hurd was clearly referring to highly critical remarks made by Senator Joseph Biden, a member of the US Senate foreign relations committee, when he told a questioner in the House of Commons: 'I don't think some of those remarks would have been made if those concerned had actually seen the exchanges which have taken place between the allies in recent days, or if they had understood the nature of the effort and the risk which some of us, including this country (the UK), are actually making in Bosnia.' Mr Biden had accused European governments on Tuesday of 'bigotry and hypocrisy' for resisting US efforts to save Bosnian Moslems from what he called 'fascist thuggery' on the part of the Bosnian Serbs. In reply, British and French officials have pointed out that the lives of their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia would be endangered if their neutral status was undermined by air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions or a lifting of the UN arms embargo in favour of the Bosnian Moslems. Since the US did not have any ground forces in Bosnia, Washington would not be running a similar risk. A senior British government official had earlier defended the right of European countries to express reservations and doubts about the US policy options discussed by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, during his recent tour of European capitals. 'It is our job to point out some of the difficulties of some of the options,' he said. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, also expressed surprise at the reports of a split between the US and its European allies. 'That is not the way I see things,' he said. He also stressed that EC governments had not ruled out further steps against Serbia, if sanctions failed to end the Bosnian conflict.</p>

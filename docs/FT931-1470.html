			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Caird parts company with chief executive CAIRD Group, the waste management company, has parted company with Mr Peter Linacre, its controversial chief executive. Mr Linacre, who built up Caird from a sleepy Dundee-based property company, became unpopular with institutions in 1990 when the company was overshadowed by a profits shortfall, a lapsed bid from Severn Trent, the regional water company, and another profits warning last November. Mr John Ashton, chairman, said: 'This has been on the cards for some time, but we've been looking around for a replacement.' Caird's final results are due out this morning. NatWest Securities, the company's broker, has forecast a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.87m to Pounds 4.25m and no final dividend. Mr Ashton stressed that the profits shortfall was not related to Mr Linacre's departure. Mr Linacre is replaced by Mr David Weir, formerly managing director of Cleanaway Waste Services, part of the GKN/Brambles joint venture. Mr John Phillips has resigned as Caird's senior operations director. The moves are effective from April 1.</p>

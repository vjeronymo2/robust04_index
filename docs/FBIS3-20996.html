			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] STET has just celebrated its 60th anniversary and  has begun to make its "comeback" by establishing the basis for  the development that will take place in the coming years, and  that will see it playing a leading role in the most important  change in the history of Italian telecommunications. It is an  organizational and financial effort that has no precedents and  is already being formed as a result of the law providing for the  reorganization of telephonic services, the first tangible  effects of which will be seen between 1 January and the end of  1996.    The document has still not been made public but some  guidelines have been revealed by Managing Director Michele  Tedeschi.    In brief, there are plans for an investment program that  will  have a total value of 32 trillion lire, and a growth in revenues  of between 30 and 36 trillion lire per year, with the goal of  reaching a telephone density of 48.4 percent in a context that  is becoming more and more internationalized. These are the most  important statistics of the "group program" for 1994-1996, that  was approved in mid-November by the STET board of directors,  presided over by Biagio Agnes. This period will be particularly  demanding for the IRI [Institute for the Reconstruction of  Industry] finance company, because of the reorganization of  telephonic services to form a single operator, Telecom Italia,  and the effects of this reorganization that will start to be  seen within a market situation that is continually evolving both  at home and abroad.    The sole operator, which will surmount the fragmentation of  the five former concessionaires, will face the opening up of  overseas markets following the abolition of the monopolies, the  appearance of large foreign corporations, and the formation of  new alliances that go beyond national and continental barriers.    The formulation of the plan is therefore coherent with the  current trends of demand that accentuate the supremacy of market  factors in a context that is increasingly characterized by  strong competition. With the new organization, the Italian  system, like those of the other major European countries, will  be able to present itself on the services market with a  structure that is capable of enforcing a strategy of a single  offer and competitivity, with the prospect of reaping all the  possibilities of growth in the telecommunications sector.    In particular, the constitution of the sole operator, the  formation of which, it has been confirmed, will take place  before September 1994, will permit its intrinsic synergies to be  exploited. Consequently this will strengthen its position both  on the national and international markets, and ensure the group  a more favorable contractual position within the context of a  global alliance.    Specific emphasis will be given in the new plan to client  segmentation to be able to prepare the most appropriate response  in terms of services/prices, particularly for business clients.  The rapid strengthening of the network structure and the  relative administration systems, the strong nationwide  organization of customer services, and the evolution of the  pricing structure, will contribute to this. In 1994, the latter  in particular will already have the goal of gradually reducing  existing mutual assistance to give greater competitiveness to  the global supply system through the reduction of long-distance  prices, and thereby start to catch up with the most advanced  organizations at international level.    Therefore, in view of the fact that the program contract  will  be applied when the single operator is formed, the plan has been  worked out on the basis of a price restructuring process that  does not presuppose greater net capital contributions to the  sector. The resulting benefits will be an improved utilization  of the network and a more favorable market position.    These actions are part of a management plan that also  foresees achieving a notable improvement in economic-financial  strength.    Under this profile the program is characterized by a growth  in the volume of revenues from the current 30 trillion lire to  38 trillion lire by 1996, and by overall investments of over 32  trillion, and a revenue situation that will be decisively better  than that of 1993, the results of which were already favorable.  It is also forecast that debts will be notably reduced thanks  to the good progress of internal financing which, in the next  three years, will be clearly in excess of requirements for  investments.    As far as quantitative aspects are concerned the program  provides for:    -- An increase of about 1.5 million subscribers to the fixed  network, 600,000 of which business subscribers; an increase of  over 800,000 subscribers to mobile services; a density  (subscribers to fixed and mobile services) that will reach a  value of 48.4 percent by the end of 1996; and a final total of  over 300,000 ISDN [integrated services digital network]  equivalent connections;    -- A development of national traffic for which a growth rate  of 6.7 percent per year is foreseen, and of international and  intercontinental traffic for which notably higher increases are  foreseen (respectively about 12 percent and over 13 percent);    -- Further technological updating of the network, continuing  with the digitization of the exchanges (77 percent by the end of  1996) and the extension of optical fibers to the distribution  network too. As far as the industrial sector is concerned  programs are aimed at improving productivity and increasing  foreign market penetration. Special emphasis has been placed on  the complete integration of the Finsiel group to exploit the  potential synergies of information science and  telecommunications services.    Finally, the process of internationalization, which provides  for investments of about 1.5 trillion lire, hinges on the  acquisition of licenses to carry out services in areas of  preeminently strategic interest as well as on the reinforcement  of the supply system in an international environment through  strategic alliances that also involve the industrial activities  of the group.</p>

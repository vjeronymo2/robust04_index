			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Restaurants: Financial Times / Transmedia Restaurant promotion terms and conditions The FT/Transmedia Restaurant Promotion entitles readers to apply for an FT/Transmedia Restaurant Card free for the first six months. Annual membership fees are Pounds 35 and will be billed to your credit card account at the end of the fee-waived period. Card holders may cancel membership at any time for a full refund on return of the FT/Transmedia Restaurant Card. To participate in the promotion, readers must have a Visa, Mastercard, or Delta credit card. The FT/Transmedia Restaurant Card entitles holders to a 25 per cent saving on the cost of the food and beverage portion of restaurant bills (not including VAT, service and tip) at participating restaurants. Reservations for parties of seven or more must be booked through the Transmedia office. Reservations are subject to space available. The telephone number for reservations is 071-930-0700. To use your FT/Transmedia Restaurant Card select a participating restaurant from the list published in the FT. Present your card at the end of the meal as you would any other major credit card, sign the Transmedia slip for the full amount and keep your copy. Transmedia, not the restaurant, gives the 25 per cent saving and therefore that will not be deducted at the restaurant but will appear on your Visa, Mastercard or Delta statement. Transmedia will charge your Visa, Mastercard or Delta account for the full amount of the Transmedia charge slip and will process a corresponding transaction crediting your account for the 25 per cent discount on the food and beverage portion of the slip. Continue to check the published list of restaurants as some restaurants may be added or deleted. Restaurant directories will be sent to cardholders updating participating restaurants after the initial promotion has ended. Only the application form printed in the FT is valid. Photocopies or any other reproductions will not be accepted. Closing date for receipt of applications for the launch promotion is Friday, January 21 1994. Applications should be sent to FT/Transmedia Restaurant offer, PO Box 85, Watford, WD2 4WQ. Cards are expected to be sent within 7 days of application receipt. Transmedia will continue to accept card applications after the initial closing date, but cannot guarantee delivery in time for the launch promotion. Following the end of the FT/Transmedia Restaurant Promotion, a computer-generated random selection will be made of 1000 Transmedia restaurant charge slips generated over the promotion period of Monday January 24 to Friday February 11 1994. Charge slips selected entitle each winner to receive a Pounds 50 Transmedia credit toward their next visit to any Transmedia restaurant while continuing to enjoy a 25 per cent discount with their Transmedia card. The selection will take place on Tuesday, March 1 1994. Winners will be notified as soon as possible after Monday March 7. The Financial Times and Transmedia cannot be responsible for lost or stolen cards, although Transmedia will make every effort to recover these cards. Transmedia will provide restaurants with an updated list of invalid cards. The card holder should inform Transmedia as soon as possible to expedite this procedure.</p>

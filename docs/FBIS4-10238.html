			<p>BFN     [Text] The Dominican Republic is opposed to the presence of  foreign observers on the border between Haiti and the Dominican  Republic. On 7 April, Dominican Vice Chancellor Fabio Herrera  Cabral criticized the idea of sending UN observers to the  Dominican Republic border. Vice Chancellor Fabio Herrera Cabral  said that to post foreign observers on both sides of the border  would be an insult to national sovereignty.    He added, however, that the Dominican Government would be  agreeable to accepting observers if they were recruited from  among the Dominican population. Mr. Fabio Herrera Cabral was  reacting to statements by a UN spokesman raising the possibility  of observing the behavior of Dominican authorities from the  border with Haiti.    It should be pointed out that over the past few days the  Dominican Government was subjected to severe criticism because  of its ambiguous attitude toward the embargo, especially its  providing gasoline and gas oil to the Republic of Haiti.</p>

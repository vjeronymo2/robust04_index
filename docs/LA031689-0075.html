			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: ALOFT WITH THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY  </P> <P> "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is your Eastern Airlines pilot, Capt.  Frank Lorenzo, welcoming you aboard our flight from Miami to Anchorage, Alaska,  for $3.  </P> <P> "We will be cruising at an altitude of 35,000 feet, but because of expected  turbulence from striking Eastern employees, we may have to land in Ft.  Lauderdale.  </P> <P> "Please fasten your seat belts while we taxi on to the runway. Since our  disloyal pilots are refusing to cross the greedy mechanics' picket line, our  co-pilot on this flight is Sam Harris, who handles lost luggage complaints for  Continental Airlines. Will the flight attendants take their seats?  </P> <P> "We are now at 15,000 feet and I am going to turn off the no-smoking sign. If  you look out of the window on the left side of the aircraft, you will see  hundreds of pickets waving signs at decent Americans who have no use for  unions. If you look out of the right side, you will see thousands of people  waving papers. Those are my lawyers making sure nobody stops anyone from  flying.  </P> <P> "People don't appreciate what is needed to run an airline. It takes money,  which you have to borrow at very high rates. It also requires knowledge of the  merger business and how to sell off the assets of one airline to pay for  another. Union members can't understand that. Their only concern is feeding  their families. The employees don't give a hoot about what happens to  entrepreneurs like us. This country will never get back on its feet until it  has respect for those of us who watch the bottom line.  </P> <P> "I am about to turn on the 'No Strike' sign to warn the stewards and  stewardesses it is against FAA regulations to carry placards up and down the  aisles while we are in flight. Ladies and gentlemen, the cabin crew will now  begin selling beverages. We would appreciate it if everybody bought $30 worth  of liquor to help keep Eastern flying for the rest of the year.  </P> <P> "Now hear this. This is Capt. Lorenzo speaking again. We hope that you are  enjoying the flight. As you probably heard before leaving Miami, Eastern will  no longer supply meals to passengers. You can blame this on our 35,000 striking  employees who could care less if our passengers starve to death. If you don't  like this any more than I do, write to the Bush Administration. Almost everyone  there is a good friend of mine.  </P> <P> "We are flying over Niagara Falls and we have a treat for you. We are going to  show 'Labor Unions and How They Destroyed America.' This is a tough,  hard-hitting film that depicts the decline of the labor movement, and how one  man decided to break the stranglehold that the working class had on his  airline. There will be a $6 charge for head phones. . . .  </P> <P> "This is Capt. Lorenzo. We hope that you enjoyed the movie. If you would like a  videotape to take home with you, the cost will be $99.  </P> <P> "Many of you have asked what are the issues in this strike now affecting all of  us. They are as much about power as they are about money. I want power and my  employees want money. When I started running airlines I discovered that it is  impossible to have power if you give money to the workers. I know how to  operate a damn good airline but I can't do it if the employees have their hands  out all the time saying, 'gimme, gimme, gimme.' There has to be some way of  carrying on a business without paying people.  </P> <P> "Ladies and gentlemen, apparently my strike-breaking tactics are not working,  so I am going to demand the resignation of three of the cabin stewardesses and  request that they turn in their uniforms immediately. Eastern will never forget  their loyalty.  </P> <P> "This is Capt. Lorenzo speaking to you once more. At this moment we are flying  over Montana and seem to be out of fuel. I am asking all the passengers to  fasten their seat belts so that I can declare bankruptcy and let the courts  worry about whether we are going to make it to Alaska or not."  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Metall Mining improves offer for Minnova shares METALL MINING, the Canadian mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, has sweetened its bid for the publicly-held minority shares of Minnova, a Canadian explor-ation and development company. Metall bought 50.4 per cent of Minnova from Noranda for CDollars 131m (USDollars 105m) last year. Late in February, Metall bid one of its own common shares plus CDollars 4 cash for each of the Minnova publicly-held shares. Now it is adding half a warrant. A full warrant allows the holder to buy one Metall share at CDollars 14 for five years. Alternatively, Minnova holders can take 1.43 Metall shares for each Minnova share held. Metall said it improved its offer to meet institutional objections to the original bid. It plans to amalgamate Minnova with a unit of Metall. Laurentian Bank, Canada's fastest-growing chartered bank, is buying a CDollars 325m portfolio of residential mortgages and matching deposits from a Quebec City mutual insurance group for an undisclosed sum. This is the fifth expansion, mainly in the trust services sector, that Laurentian Bank - part of the Laurentian financial services group - has made in two years.</p>

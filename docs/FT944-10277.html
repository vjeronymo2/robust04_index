			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television Television on Friday nights is pretty uninviting these days, unless there happens to be a good movie somewhere. At present they are tending to turn up in BBC2's late slot which is linked to the Favourite Films series (9.30). Choosing his desert island collection today, in the last of the series, is Clint Eastwood. Among his choices (rightly enough since it inspired Serge Leone's 'Fistful Of Dollars' and thus virtually created Eastwood's fame) is Yojimbo. Directed in 1961 by Toshiro Mifune, this is something of a novelty: a funny samurai film. The fighting man sells his services to both sides in a village war and casually observes the results (12.15). The other movies are scarcely worth the time involved, and that goes even for the Marx Brothers' Big Store, in which Groucho plays a store detective (1.35 C4). As for the 1959 British re-make of The Mummy, it proves what a lot of overblown nonsense is talked about the 'great days' of Hammer. There is here none of that sense of style and poignancy which so powerfully characterised the early Hollywood horror movies (11.40 BBC1).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification </F> of the Fatherland issued in Pyongyang on 6 June -- read by  announcer]    [Text] The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the  Fatherland [CPRF] issued the following statement in connection  with the fact that the situation on the Korean peninsula faces  the worst situation because the South Korean puppet clique is  committing vicious maneuvers of sanctions against us, by  conspiring with the United States.    Statement by the CPRF:    Today, the situation on the Korean peninsula is on the verge  of entering into the worst situation. The nuclear commotion  being carried out by the United States and its following forces  is trying to openly move it toward sanctions against us, and the  endless threat and suppression continued by them is making the  situation enter into the doors of war.    What cannot be overlooked is that the South Korean ruling  bunch, who are indiscriminately conspiring with the outside  forces at a time when the nation is at the crossroad of life and  death, are carrying out rash and thoughtless acts and are making  the situation on the Korean peninsula a very acute one.    We warned the South Korean authorities not only once or  twice  of what sanctions mean, which the imperialists are trying to  force us into by finding fault with the nonexistent nuclear  issue, and what danger it represents if we are involved in the  sanctions. Nevertheless, the South Korean ruling bunch are  standing at the forefront, more so than the outside forces, and  are running amok by blowing the trumpet of sanctions against the  fellow countrymen.    The South Korean puppet clique that ignored the North-South  dialogue and that clung to the so-called international  cooperative system, recently all the more persistently begged  for sanctions against the North before the masters in the United  Nations, Washington, and Tokyo, and is crazily babbling the  inevitability of sanctions in the empty sky whenever it opens  its mouth.    The South Korean ruling bunch is conspiring with the master  for UN sanctions and multinational sanctions, and is even  hurriedly putting forth its groundless antinational method of  sanctions against the North. At the same time, it ordered the  whole area of South Korea to be on alert and is unhesitatingly  making provocative absurd remarks against us.    Looking at all the facts, it is clear that the South Korean  ruling bunch is throwing itself into becoming the shock brigade  of the anti-Republic maneuver and a servant of war for the  master with enthusiasm.    Begging for sanctions toward the fellow countrymen to the  outside forces means that it attaches greater importance to the  allies than the nation. Bringing about a very dangerous  situation of war which was not even carried out during the  military fascist dictatorial regime before, can by no means be  regarded as a civilian-ruled regime.    It was all the more clearly revealed that the South Korean  ruling bunch is a group of nation sellers entrusting the  nation's fate to the outside forces through its acts, and a  civilian-ruled fascist group pursuing war by wearing the mask of  a civilian-ruled regime.    We cannot but worry about the national misfortune and  calamity which can be committed anytime by the crazy rascals  running amok in accordance with the interest of the outside  forces. This is not an issue limited to the North or the South,  and also it is not an issue regarding the one side's ideology  and system. This is an issue of the life and death of 70  million people transcending differences in region, ideology, and  system of the North and South.    If the nation's interest is put in the forefront and regards  the nation's existence as the source, no one can gamble with  this important issue, and must not make a foolish thought of  trying to gain interest through this gamble.    Sanctions mean war, and there is no mercy in war. There is  no greater miscalculation to think that they will be safe if  they carry out sanctions toward the fellow countrymen by  conspiring with outside forces.    With the least expectation, if Kim Yong-sam dares to move  toward the road of adventure, this will mean his end. The Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique must correctly know that the United  States, its master, and the Patriot missiles, which it dragged  in, cannot protect him, and act with discretion.    [Dated] 6 June 1994, Pyongyang</p>

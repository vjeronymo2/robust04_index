			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS special correspondents Lyudmila </F> Aleksandrova, Grigoriy Arslanov, Pavel Spirin, and Vyacheslav  Tomilin]    [Text] Beijing, 27 May -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has  accepted with great enthusiasm the invitation from Russian  President Boris Yeltsin to pay an official visit to Russia.  This was stated at a news conference in Beijing today by Viktor  Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian Government, on the second day  of his visit to the PRC.    The prime minister said that the visit by the Chinese leader  should take place in September. It was proposed that on his way  to Moscow, Jiang Zemin should visit one of Russia's regions,  most probably one in the Far East.    We regard the forthcoming meeting of the leaders of the two  states as very important, Chernomyrdin stated. He added that  the conversation that he had had today with Jiang Zemin had been  rich in content and very interesting.    What we have done represents great progress in the  development of our relations, he stressed, summing up the  results of the two days of his visit to the PRC. The head of  the Russian Government noted the "smooth development" of links  between the two countries and stressed that the main stratum of  Russian-Chinese relations has not yet been reached and the sides  are only now approaching it.    Chernomyrdin pointed out that the reduction in the volume of  bilateral trade in the first quarter of this year was a  temporary phenomenon caused by objective as well as subjective  factors. However, there are no grounds for saying that anything  serious has occurred and the situation will be put right before  the end of the year.    Comparing the progress of economic reform in China and  Russia, the chairman of the Russian Government noted that it was  similar in many respects. Any differences were explained by  different potential and different conditions. The PRC is  pursuing socialist economic reforms, while we are carrying out  economic reforms that have a social thrust, he said.    The reforms in China began earlier and there was no shock  therapy. In Russia, however, the situation is different. We  began with shock therapy. It could not be done any other way.  That much is clear, the prime minister stressed. He believes  that in future there will be more similarities than differences  in the implementation of reform in Russia and China.    Referring to China's place in Russian foreign policy,  Chernomyrdin noted that relations between Russia and the PRC  influence the entire situation in the Asian-Pacific region. I  do not think that any issues in the Asian-Pacific region could  be discussed or resolved without the participation of these two  states, he added. He said that China's growing weight in Asia  and its' ties with the states of Central Asia did not worry  Russia at all.</p>

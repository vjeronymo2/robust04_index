			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Critical habitat identifies specific areas essential to the conservation of a species. Areas not currently containing all of the essential features, but with the capability to do so in the future, may also be essential for the long-term recovery of the species, particularly in certain portions of its range, and may be designated as critical habitat. However, not all areas containing the features of a listed species' habitat are necessarily essential to the species' recovery. Areas not included in critical habitat that contain one or more of the essential elements are still important to a species' conservation and may be addressed under other facets of the Act and other conservation laws and regulations. All designated areas may also be of considerable value in maintaining ecosystem integrity and supporting other species, although that is not a consideration in designating critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The process of designating critical habitat for the desert tortoise consisted of three steps that are explained in this document. The first step was to determine the elements and areas essential to the tortoise's conservation. This step was completed in the proposal process and is summarized in the sections of this rule entitled ``Primary Constituent Elements'' and ``Criteria for Identifying Critical Habitat.'' The second step was to determine the potential costs of the proposed designation, which was completed in the proposal process and is summarized in this rule in the section entitled ``Economic Summary of the August 30 Proposal.'' The final step was to consider whether any areas should be excluded based upon economic and other relevant impacts and to determine the costs associated with the final designation. This step is discussed in the sections entitled ``Summary of the Exclusion Process,'' ``Effects of the Designation,'' ``Economic Impacts of the Final Designation,'' and ``Available Conservation Measures.'' A section on biodiversity is included to highlight the importance of that issue and its relationship to the desert tortoise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designation of critical habitat may be reevaluated and revised, at any time, when new information indicates that changes are warranted. The Service may revise critical habitat if land management plans, recovery plans, or other conservation strategies are developed and fully implemented, reducing the need for the additional protection provided by critical habitat designation. For example, after the Desert Tortoise Recovery Plan is finalized, land management agencies may implement increased protection for the desert tortoise. If protection measures are implemented, the Service may revise its critical habitat designation in the future. With increased protection, some components of environmental variability threatening tortoise populations (or contributing to the variance of growth rates) may be reduced, thus lessening the need for large populations. In such an event, a population viability analysis_considering population trends based on the variance of population growth rates_might suggest that smaller, viable, populations would require less habitat (i.e., smaller DWMAs and less need for critical habitat designation). Therefore, critical habitat units (CHUs) could be decreased in size, increased in size, or eliminated based on changes in certain environmental variables, in land status, or tortoise populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Primary Constituent Elements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining the areas to designate as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological attributes that are essential to a species' conservation. In addition, the Act stipulates that the areas containing these elements may require special management considerations or protection. Such physical and biological features, as stated in 50 CFR 424.12, include, but are not limited to, the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Food, water, or other nutritional or physiological requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Cover or shelter;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Generally, habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological distributions of a species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

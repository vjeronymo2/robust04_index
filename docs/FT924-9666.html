			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar's strength helps to lift continent BOURSES rose on a stronger dollar and the early closing markets, particularly, were lifted by Wall Street's overnight gains, writes Our Markets Staff. But for some, the stimuli were stronger, and more specific. PARIS closed just below the day's high, encouraged by Monday's interest rate cut and on hopes that there was scope for further easing. A strong Matif and a firm dollar also lifted the market. The CAC-40 index ended 44.53 or 2.6 per cent higher at 1,786.93, in good turnover of FFr2.9bn, although dealers said a substantial part was options-related. Rises were across the board, with Elf up FFr5.50 to FFr355.50, Alcatel FFr19 higher at FFr659 and Lafarge FFr15.10 up at FFr309. But Rhone-Poulenc CIs dropped FFr9 to FFr502 after its unit Institut Merieux International confirmed that until November 1985 it exported a blood product for haemophiliacs which had not been tested for the AIDS virus or heated to kill the virus. Shares in Merieux were temporarily suspended and later lost FFr740 or 9.6 per cent to FFr7,000. Peugeot also bucked the firmer trend, losing FFr4 or FFr511 on news that registrations of cars made by the Peugeot-Citroen group tumbled by 11.1 per cent in October. FRANKFURT had another quiet day, with German stock market turnover estimated at little more than Monday's DM3.1bn as the DAX index rose 12.43 to 1,485.00. Mr Thomas Nolten, a dealer with B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that the direct effect of the dollar and Wall Street's overnight gains was that traders, including DTB DAX futures traders, felt obliged to close their short positions. Big DAX stocks moved accordingly although in chemicals, where the bad news came from Bayer on Monday, the big gains were reserved for BASF and Hoechst, up DM4.50 to DM411 and DM5 to DM236 respectively, while Bayer put on only DM1.90 to DM256.40. Constructions performed well, led by Holzmann which closed DM30 higher at DM30. The sector still has good orders for the short- and medium-term, noted Mr Nolten. STOCKHOLM jumped 2.3 per cent in heavy trading on the stronger dollar. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 16.6 to 729.8 in strong turnover of SKr766m after SKr454m. Dollar-sensitive issues rose, while demand remained strong for Astra ahead of its nine-month report, due on November 11. The A shares were up SKr13 to SKr589, while the B shares rose SKr12 to SKr570. COPENHAGEN's banks and shipping shares led the Danish advance as the KFX index gained 1.01 to 72.62 in turnover of DKr179m. Danske Bank and Unibank recovered some of their recent sharp declines to close DKr5 and DKr3 higher at DKr109 and DKr204 respectively, while D/S Svendborg, part of the export-dependent shipping and oil group, AP Moeller, rose DKr3,500 to DKr108,500. HELSINKI jumped 5.3 per cent, the Hex index closing 40.4 higher at 798.6 in turnover of FM83.2m, extending its recovery to some 30 per cent in just over two weeks. The banks and finance house index gained 14.1 per cent, reflecting the sharp fall in Finnish interest rates over the last few weeks. AMSTERDAM closed firmer, boosted by a strong rise in Akzo shares in the wake of its pleasing third-quarter results. The CBS Tendency index rose 1.1 to 103.2. Akzo rose Fl 6.20 or 4.9 per cent to Fl 134.00 after its 0.4 per cent increase in third-quarter net profit pleased the market, since it had expected a decline. The firmer dollar helped to lift Ahold, Aegon, Royal Dutch and Unilever. MILAN ended up but well off early highs as demand fell back after the official fixing. The Comit index rose 4.36 to 450.61 in turnover estimated around Tuesday's L226.3bn. Among leading stocks, Fiat rose L111 to L4,600 and Montedison added L7 to L1,242. Stet rose L50 to L1,530 but Mediobanca fell L240 to L12,000. ZURICH lost some of its early gains as the dollar declined in the afternoon, and New York opened flat. The SMI index put on 11.5 to 1,933.1, after a morning high of 1,940.4. BRUSSELS rose in brisk trading following a three-day weekend. The Bel-20 index added 16.26 or 1.4 per cent to 1,156.22. Petrofina continued its recent recovery with a rise of BFr230 to BFr8,310.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- November 3                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Open    10.30    11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1040.76  1041.87  1041.54  1039.12 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1107.37  1107.88  1109.92  1106.87                            13.00    14.00    15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1038.56  1039.61  1038.21  1038.76 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1105.49  1105.93  1104.23  1105.49  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Nov  2   Oct 30    Oct 29    Oct 28    Oct 27 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1032.82   1028.47   1025.26   1028.09   1038.79 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1095.06   1090.07   1086.76   1091.64   1100.79  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1042.15 ; 200 - 1110.12 Low/day: 100 - 1037.49  200 - 1102.05  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

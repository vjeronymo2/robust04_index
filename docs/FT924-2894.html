			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho debt has risen to Pounds 947m - Reduction in borrowings significant factor behind German deal LONRHO's determination to reduce borrowings was one of the main factors behind yesterday's deal with Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier. Shareholders in the international trading group may be perplexed to learn that net debt has risen to Pounds 947m. In March they were told at the annual meeting that net debt, which would be significantly reduced, stood at about Pounds 850m. Since then the acquisition of a majority stake in Gewog, a German company which owns 4,300 flats, has inflated the overall debt figure by Pounds 135m. Lonrho yesterday said debt also increased by Pounds 54m because of exchange adjustments to foreign currency borrowings and a further Pounds 24m in respect of UK motor trading operations. So in spite of more than Pounds 500m of asset sales earlier this year, at the half year to March 31 net debt had only fallen from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 903m. It has increased again in spite of two further disposals: Firsteel Group, a narrow steel strip processor and distributor, was sold to its management for a price close to its Pounds 21m net asset value. George Outram, publisher of the Glasgow-based Herald and Evening Times, went for Pounds 74m to the management, backed by institutions. However, some analysts believe the net debt is higher than Pounds 947m, because the Pounds 500m from asset disposals earlier in the year included Pounds 178m from the sale of a one third stake in the Metropole Hotel chain to the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company. The group said at the time of the deal in March that the proceeds would be used to cut the Metropole's borrowings and 'to generate further profits through developments.' Earlier in the year Lonrho disposed of its 50 per cent interest in Kuhne and Nagel, the German freight forwarder, for DM340m (Pounds 140m). It also sold Scottish and Universal Newspapers for Pounds 45m to Trinity International Holdings. Mr Mike Smith, conglomerates analyst at Robert Fleming Securities, said Lonrho needed a rights issue 'because it has already sold the best businesses and was clearly not going to make significant inroads into net debt by relying only on further disposals.'</p>

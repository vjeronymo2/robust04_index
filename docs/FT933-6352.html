			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Courtaulds Dollars 75m lawsuit Correction (published 28th August 1993) appended to this article. COURTAULDS, the textiles group, said that the Dollars 75m (Pounds 50.6m) lawsuit filed by Flamemaster Corporation, of the US, is 'without foundation' and that it was 'not aware of any circumstances which could rise to the claims allegedly being advanced by Flamemaster'. Courtaulds Aerospace, a subsidiary and the subject of the lawsuit had ' fully performed all its duties pursuant to its agreements with Flamemaster'. Flamemaster said it had filed the lawsuit for alleged breach of contract, unfair trade practices and fraud. It alleges that Courtaulds attempted to and actually monopolised interstate and export trade and commerce in the production, distribution and sale of high adhesion compounds. CORRECTION Courtaulds, the chemicals group, is being sued by Flamemaster Corp. of the US for Dollars 75m. Courtaulds has said the suit was 'without foundation'.

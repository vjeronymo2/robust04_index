The National Council has implicitly  agreed with the Upper House on resolving the final  disagreements. The option of "slowing down expenses," an  instrument which aims at imposing some financial discipline on  parliament, remains open at this time.    Both houses [of the Federal Assembly] have agreed to  postpone  to a later date the elimination of the optional AVS [special  insurance plan] for Swiss citizens living abroad. They have  also given up the idea of cutting subisidies to the disability  pension fund. Parliament thus has reduced the savings projected  by the Federal Council by SFr110 million.    Slowing down expenses will be dealt with as a separate  issue.  The support of an absolute majority of members of parliament --  not only the majority of the deputies present -- will have to be  obtained to approve new substantial expenses. The Council of  States had considered this system too difficult to implement and  sent it back to its commission for further examination.    Moreover, the 1993 stabilization program includes measures  which are under the sole responsibility of the Federal Council;  they should allow yearly savings of SFr900 million. A third  program is already being prepared. Its objective is to deal  with the structural deficit -- independent from the economic  situation -- and save SFr4 billion through a reduction in  expenses and an increase in incomes. The Confederation recorded  a SFr7.8 billion deficit in 1993.</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DIGGING IN FOR HUNGRY;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE: AN IRVINE FARMER IS SPEARHEADING AN EFFORT TO GLEAN FIELDS,  SALVAGING CROPS FOR THE COUNTY'S DESTITUTE. HE INSISTS THAT THERE IS PLENTY TO  GO AROUND.  </P> <P> Stand in A.G. Kawamura's fog-shrouded bean fields and take in the pungency of  fresh greenery and warm earth and it is easy to believe you are on a farm patch  in the Central Valley rather than in suburban Irvine.  </P> <P> The young farmer will accept this description as an anomaly or a last vestige  of a more rural past, but he also believes that his 600 acres of agricultural  fields, much of them bordered by encroaching business and housing developments,  may hold the key to solving a social ill of the county's increasing  urbanization.  </P> <P> "I think the farm community has just recently begun to be very supportive in  realizing that (we) have to take a part in alleviating hunger," said Kawamura.  He said he gained a sense of social responsibility as well as business acumen  as a student at UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> Hunger and malnutrition hound the homeless and working poor in Orange County  and fall especially hard on children, according to recent studies.  </P> <P> While local social planners grapple with finding solutions to the broader  societal problem, others, such as Kawamura, see a more practical approach:  Salvage crops from the county's agricultural producers to directly feed the  poor.  </P> <P> Gleaning, as such salvage is known, has been around locally for years. But a  new task force of activists and producers is attempting to develop the most  ambitious program to date, working on the theory that Orange County's once  abundant fields have much to yield.  </P> <P> "By and large, people are not aware of the agricultural resources in the  county," said Kawamura, who estimates that scarcely 1% of available produce is  salvaged.  </P> <P> To reap more benefits from the county's resources, Kawamura is working with the  Irvine Gleaning Project to enlist more agricultural producers.  </P> <P> The gleaning project is an outgrowth of earlier efforts to increase the amount  of fresh produce donated to local food banks, coordinator Charlene Turco said.  The group is forming a nonprofit foundation and has been awarded a $5,600 grant  from the city of Irvine. Turco hopes that with funds from other Orange County  cities and federal and state grants, he can expand the project's volunteer  base.  </P> <P> "We are trying for the first time to coordinate efforts and to include everyone  from growers to service providers," she said.  </P> <P> Turco talks of having a food hot line, which residents or businesses with  donations of food could call for pickup. She also hopes to develop an offshoot  of the gleaning project that will travel to private homes to salvage surplus  zucchini and tomatoes straight from the garden.  </P> <P> While no one disputes the critical need for fresh produce to supplement the  diets of those at risk of missing meals, what no one can say for sure is how  effective an expanded gleaning program would be in alleviating the hunger  problem in Orange County.  </P> <P> "It depends to what extent you are increasing the capacity of food providers,"  said Michele Van Eyken, nutrition services supervisor for the county. "If we  can get over the problems of distribution and the way people utilize food, then  (gleaning) could make a big difference."  </P> <P> Ann Cotter, a home economist with the local branch of UC Cooperative Extension,  noted that many needy residents, particularly Latinos, may be unaccustomed to  eating some fruits and vegetables common in the United States and might let the  produce waste.  </P> <P> "Even with low-income families that have been here for generations, making food  changes does not come overnight," she said.  </P> <P> The expense of fresh produce poses the greatest barrier. A recent survey  conducted by UC researchers noted that although the need for emergency food  assistance has increased, resources have decreased.  </P> <P> Cutbacks in government surplus commodities have resulted in a halving of the  number of Orange County households able to participate in the program. Foods  such as cheese, powdered milk and rice are no longer available.  </P> <P> In addition, donations to the county's two food banks are down 25% in recent  years. Mark Lowry, manager of the Community Development Council's food bank,  said his program is continually in need of fresh produce.  </P> <P> "It is very hard to provide a well-balanced diet for people because we are at  the whims and wills of what is donated to us," he said.  </P> <P> The food bank has recently sought help outside the county, working with a  Fresno group that has shipped down more than 40,000 pounds of cantaloupes,  peaches, nectarines and plums. The first 20,000-pound shipment was gone in  three days, he said.  </P> <P> Kawamura and others believe that if only 10% of available produce items were  salvaged, Orange County farmers could provide for local needs and export  produce to the needy in other counties.  </P> <P> Kelly Sullivan, resource director for the county's second major food bank, the  Food Distribution Center, said local gleaning projects have provided more than  118,000 pounds of fresh vegetables since last October.  </P> <P> "If you calculate that one-half pound of food is equal to a meal, in human  terms it means more than 236,000 meals for the county's needy," Sullivan said.  </P> <P> The Irvine gleaning project has enlisted support from four Irvine farms:  Kawamura's Western Marketing Co., Murai Farms, Treasure Farms and John Magarro  Farms. Another gleaning project, Sunshine Outreach, founded in 1983, also picks  over several south Orange County farms.  </P> <P> Kawamura says the salvage potential is vast and largely untapped. In spite of  seemingly endless development, the county has about 57,000 acres of  agricultural land, according to the Orange County Farm Bureau, nearly 8,000 of  them in orchards.  </P> <P> Although nursery stock accounted for more than half of the county's $250  million in agricultural earnings last year, crops such as strawberries, beans  and peppers are also big income producers. The county has more than 300  individual farms, according to Farm Bureau executive director Nanci Jimenez.  </P> <P> She said farmers are increasingly aware that their role is vital in feeding the  hungry.  </P> <P> "It's going to be agriculture that's going to solve the problem," Jimenez said.  Kawamura, a member of the Farm Bureau, recently made a presentation to the  group, and the board of directors probably will back expanded gleaning efforts  in the county, Jimenez said.  </P> <P> Kawamura said easing of liability laws has led many farmers to be more  receptive to having mostly novice volunteers tramp through their fields.  </P> <P> The most serious obstacle is timing, he said. Sometimes there is not even a  day's break between harvest of one crop and preparations for planting another  -- and farm operations will always come first, he concedes.  </P> <P> Of his 600 leased acres of corn, cabbage, celery, bean and squash, about 400  acres lend themselves to salvage, Kawamura said.  </P> <P> Kawamura's love for the land runs deep. He said his family is the oldest active  tenant on Irvine Ranch property, its farms dating to 1958. He is equally  committed to easing the plight of the county's growing ranks of hungry and  homeless.  </P> <P> "To grow up in Orange County with the wealth that we have, it's really no  excuse . . . to have the kinds of problems we have," he said.  </P></p>

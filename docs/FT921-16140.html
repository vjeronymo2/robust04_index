			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Appointments: Cowan moves to Jardine Matheson The Price Waterhouse partner who led the firm's audit of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, Christopher Cowan, is to leave the firm for JARDINE MATHESON, the Hong Kong-based trading group. The timing of the move could be difficult for Price Waterhouse, which is in the midst of one of the toughest battles in its history to defend its audit of the failed bank. He leaves to become finance director of Jardine in May - barely giving him time to defend Price Waterhouse before the UK official enquiry into BCCI, which is not expected to be completed before the middle of the year. The firm insisted yesterday that Cowan had not been asked to leave, and that he would be sorely missed. A 45-year-old audit partner in the firm's London financial institutions group, Cowan had been working virtually full- time on BCCI in the two years before it was closed in July. The move to Jardine to take over from Peter Collins, who retires after 18 years with the group, is said to have been under discussion for some time before BCCI's problems exploded into public view last July. Cowan had first acted for Jardine while a PW partner on secondment in Hong Kong between 1982 and 1985.</p>

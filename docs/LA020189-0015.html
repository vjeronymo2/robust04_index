			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOLARSHIP STARTED IN HONOR OF EDUCATOR  </P> <P> A scholarship fund to help students from the Juvenile Court School system  interested in attending college has been established in honor of Don Rucker,  the deputy superintendent of the San Diego County Office of Education. Rucker  died Jan. 9.  </P> <P> The Don Rucker Memorial Scholarship Fund will provide assistance to such  students, who attend schools within the Juvenile Court system after referrals  from probation or social service departments. Most students in the system have  limited funds and are unable to attend college even when they are to continue  their study.  </P> <P> Rucker helped begin the Dollars for Scholars program and a San Diego County  Court School Scholarship Foundation in 1986, and was a longtime proponent of  encouraging such students to think of higher education. More than 30 Court  School students have received a total of $6,000 since the foundation was set  up.  </P></p>

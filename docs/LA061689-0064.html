			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Over objections of the Bush Administration, the House Ways and Means human  resources subcommittee voted to raise the tax that finances federal  unemployment insurance. The proposed tax increase, which would be paid by  employers, is the first voted this year by any House or Senate subcommittee.  When fully effective in 1992, the proposed increase would cost employers $4 for  each employee per year, a total of $10.6 billion over the next five years. The  tax increase is part of a broad package of changes in federal unemployment and  welfare programs, including a $1.77-billion child-care initiative over the next  five years.  </P></p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Peel recovers to produce better half-time profits PEEL Holdings, the property company that owns 68 per cent of the Manchester Ship Canal Company, reported improved interim profits after heavy losses in the latter half of the previous year. It saw pre-tax profits rise from Pounds 269,000 to Pounds 1.64m in the six months to September 30 1991, although turnover fell from Pounds 43.04m to Pounds 29.8m, reflecting the ending of the group's housebuilding activities and reduction in the value of trading companies sold. After tax and the payment of preference dividends, there was a loss per share of 0.39p (0.5p). The interim dividend is again 1p. Despite the worst conditions in the property market for more than 50 years, the group sold investment properties worth Pounds 51.45m at just above book value. But rental income held steady at Pounds 23.65m, partly reflecting the contribution from Manchester Ship, so the group had achieved its longstanding target of rental income exceeding debt charge. Net borrowings, excluding Manchester Ship, continued to reduce and stood at Pounds 359.69m at the half-year. They had since come down to Pounds 342.07m, leaving the group Pounds 124m of undrawn banking facilities. All banking covenants were being met by comfortable margins and cashflow was therefore satisfactory, quite independent of Manchester Ship, the directors said. The short-term aim was to reduce debt below Pounds 300m and then to concentrate for future sales on lower yielding assets in order to improve profitability.</p>

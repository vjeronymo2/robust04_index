			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Forecast brightens engineering sector Strong growth in exports - especially to recovering markets in western Europe - and revived investment spending by UK industry will boost engineering output by 4 per cent next year, the Engineering Employers Federation said yesterday. The federation says in its half-yearly trends survey that employment in the sector, which has fallen by 400,000 since 1990, will stabilise - dropping only another 18,000 to 1.66m by the end of next year. The upbeat forecast underlines the better prospects for the engineering sector after the recession, but Mr Ian Thompson, the federation's economics adviser, cautioned against euphoria. Overall, the engineering sector's sales will exceed Pounds 140bn this year, but even by the end of next year its output will be no higher in real terms than it was in 1990. By the end of next year only two sectors of the industry - electrical and instrument engineering and automotive - will be producing at a higher rate than in 1990. Mechanical engineering, metal goods and aerospace output will still be substantially below 1990 levels. The federation says cyclical revival of investment spending is boosting UK demand for engineering products, but from a low level. It still wants changes in capital allowances to ensure that the next 'investment recession' is not as deep as the last downturn. Meanwhile, the recovery of European markets from recession is an important development for the sector and for the UK economy as a whole. Western Europe already accounts for 60 per cent of UK engineering exports, and the proportion could rise next year. Mr Thompson believes the upturn will prevent the Pounds 6bn trade deficit in engineering goods from worsening - although the federation continues to believe the deficit is not a good thing in the long term. He said the fall in employment had almost bottomed out. Small and medium-sized companies were increasing employment of engineers and skilled shop-floor workers, but big firms continued to cut back. The federation says overall output has increased 'exceptionally rapidly' this year, paced by a sharp expansion in the electronics and computers sector. There has also been growth in other electrical and instrument engineering sectors, in mechanical engineering and in the automotive sector. The federation predicts slightly slower growth overall, next year, but with more even balance between the main sectors. Its growth forecasts for the 12 months to the fourth quarter of next year are: Electronics and computers, up 7 per cent. Other electrical and instrument engineering, up 4 per cent. Mechanical engineering, up 4 per cent. Motor vehicles and parts, up 6 per cent. Metal goods, up 2 per cent. Aerospace equipment, nil. The strong growth in electrical and instrument engineering underlines the long-term structural shift in the composition of UK engineering in the past 15 years. Next year, for the first time, the electrical sector will account for a bigger share of engineering output than mechanical engineering and metal goods combined.</p>

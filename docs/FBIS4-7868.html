			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Branislav Radivojsa report on interview with Slobodan </F> Jarcevic, foreign minister of the Serbian Krajina; place and  date not given: "Krajina Will Demand a Free Port on the Coast"]    [Text] The signing of the cease-fire agreement between the  republic of Serbian Krajina and the Republic of Croatia  envisages the two armies each withdrawing 1 km to their  respective sides. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] will be  deployed between them. The two armies will withdraw their heavy  weapons 10 km (mortars) and 20 km (heavy artillery).    According to the Zagreb agreement, UNPROFOR will carry out  checks to see whether the two side are observing the agreement.  The blue helmets will, for the first time, carry out checks not  only on the Krajina territory, but also on the Croatian  territory, up to 20 km from the line of separation.    In his interview for POLITIKA, Slobodan Jarcevic, foreign  minister of the republic of Serbian Krajina and a member of the  Krajina negotiating team in Zagreb, also stressed this new fact.    We asked Minister Jarcevic what status Krajina's delegation  had at the negotiations.  <H5>  Two Equal Sides </H5>   [Jarcevic] We and the Croats acted as two equal sides. We  agreed not to mention the terms Republic of Croatia and the  republic of Serbian Krajina in the negotiations and documents.  The documents refer to the two delegations only as "two sides,"  without using any other designates. For instance, the documents  state that "the two sides agreed" that the "Serbian army  withdraw," that the "Croatian army withdraw...."    During the preliminary talks with Mr. Churkin we agreed that  we would not touch political issues. Our aim was to arrive at a  cease-fire agreement and to end hostilities, and not to make an  agreement on borders and demarcation lines that would deal with  the status of the territories occupied by the Croatian side.    Both we and the Croats also supported the proposal that,  immediately after the implementation of this agreement, we will  begin negotiations about roads, the economy, oil pipelines,  power lines, trade, and so forth. The condition for these talks  will again be that we do not deal with political problems. Only  once life, the economy, and everything else begins to function,  could we discuss political issues.    [Radivojsa] What will the Serbian side demand in the  negotiations regarding roads and economic cooperation?    [Jarcevic] Our aim is the scrapping of Security Council  Resolution 820. Point 12 of this resolution forbids  import-export activities by the republic of Serbian Krajina.  Moreover, we are interested in the opening of the roads only if  we are allowed to trade with the world. Otherwise, if we open  roads, which is what Croatia wants, our trucks could be  confiscated in Hungary. Therefore, we would not benefit from  this kind of agreement.  <H5>  400,000 Serbs Fled </H5>   [Jarcevic continues] The Security Council would therefore  have to guarantee us freedom on the market. Only then will we  sign the agreement.    [Radivojsa] Does this also refer to the opening of the  Zagreb- Knin-Split rail line, and the opening of the Krajina  section of the Belgrade-Zagreb highway?    [Jarcevic] Of course, but we are opposed to the  consolidation of the roads, economy, and even tourism in Croatia  while we are closed off and subjected to the sanctions. We  demand freedom to export to Belgrade, to Slovenia, and to  Hungary via the shortest route, through Western Slavonia.    We will also seek a tax-free port on the coast, because a  large part of our trade gravitates around the ports on the  Adriatic coast. We primarily have one of the Zadar ports in  mind. This port would handle our exports and imports without  inspection by the Croatian customs authorities.    [Radivojsa] What could Slobodan Jarcevic say at present  about the third stage of negotiations, about possible political  issues? He says that the talks in that stage will be the most  difficult, because they will deal with the issue of refugees,  the territories that Croatia occupied in its aggressions of 1992  and 1993. The Serb ethnic territories in Western Slavonia,  where Serbs constituted a majority until 1991, will also be on  the agenda. Then, we will also discuss war crimes and ethnic  cleansing, which, as Jarcevic says, assumed much larger  proportions in the Republic of Croatia. The Republic of Croatia  has expelled some 400,000 Serbs from its territory.    What could we then expect from the negotiators in the third  stage?    [Jarcevic] Regarding Krajina's future, I can say that the  sanctions introduced against the Serbian people are a paradise  in comparison with what they could experience in a Croatian or a  Muslim state. The world should therefore not be surprised that  we are putting up with the sanctions. This is why we should not  be asked whether we will accept a federal or a confederal model,  or an autonomous status in the Republic of Croatia. We do not  want any of that.    [Radivojsa] This was a categorical answer by Slobodan  Jarcevic.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Technology: Share prices wherever you go For the busy and mobile investor or fund manager who feels anxious and deprived without instant access to financial news and prices, a new portable device the size of a video cassette is being brought on to the market. Called Financial Alert, it uses a radio tuner to provide UK and foreign share prices and news updates. It can track highs and lows and pre-set investment limits with an in-built alarm system. As yet, the device - consisting of a keyboard and small screen operated by a rechargeable battery, all in a black leather folder - is only available in the Netherlands where it was introduced about a year ago. The UK launch is on February 10, with plans to introduce it later in Sweden, Switzerland and the US. Rob Schram, managing director of Alert Network, the UK distributor of Financial Alert, hopes to have up to 1,000 in use in the UK in a year's time. He calls it 'a very powerful way of staying up with the market'. It monitors prices of the FT-SE 100 shares plus 900 other UK stocks and those of 100 continental European companies. It also carries foreign exchange rates, international indices and data on futures contracts and gilts. The screen has room for eight prices at a time, with a bleeper which can be set to sound when any desired type of information comes up. Investors can select their own information to put on special pages. All stored data can be downloaded to a hard disc or printed out. Schram hopes that Financial Alert, which has components (such as a microprocessor, highly sensitive radio tuning device and liquid crystal display) from the Far East and Dutch-developed software, will appeal to institutions, private investors and corporate investment staff - in fact, anyone likely to need information while away from their base and who will feel distinctly uncomfortable without it. The cost is Pounds 160 a month with a connection fee of Pounds 50; there is a refundable deposit of Pounds 330.</p>

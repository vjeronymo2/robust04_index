			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / West warns Iraq over military provocation WESTERN diplomats have issued a formal warning to Iraq not to provoke the coalition forces operating in the north of the country. Diplomats from the US, France and the UK met Mr Abdul Amir al Anbari, the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations, yesterday to warn him of the consequences if his country did not halt all threatening military activity. The coalition members demanded the withdrawal of the anti-aircraft missiles Iraq has deployed north of the 36th parallel in an area close to the protected zone they have established to safeguard Kurdish refugees. They also warned Iraq not to fly fighter aircraft north of the 36th parallel, and not to attack either the Kurds in the north or the Shia minority in the south of the country. Diplomats said that although the demarche was made only by the US, France and the UK, it had been discussed beforehand with other coalition members, including Turkey. Turkey is understood to have shown some reluctance to go along with the warning, in part because of its conflict with its own Kurdish minority. Iraq's deployment of Soviet-made Sam-2 and Sam-3 missile batteries and its attempts to track coalition aircraft with the batteries' radar have aroused considerable concern among the allies. Mr Brent Scowcroft, President George Bush's national security adviser, described the move as 'very ominous' and said that he would not rule out military action if Iraq persisted. Admiral David Jeremiah, vice-chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, added the coalition partners viewed the presence of the missiles with 'considerable concern'. 'Surface-to-air missiles have no purpose other than to be used against aircraft, and the only aircraft flying in that area are allied,' he said.</p>

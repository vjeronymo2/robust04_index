			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Small is beautiful in South Korea - The influence of foreign investors has been in second-tier stocks Expectations that opening the stock market to foreign investment last January would revive South Korean equities after a long period of underperformance have been dented by a run of bad news in recent months. 'Things can't get any worse. The only direction the market can go is up,' says one foreign securities analyst in assessing the performance of the Seoul stock market this year. It remains to be seen, however, when the long predicted recovery will occur and whether it last. The composite index closed at 620.33 yesterday, 1.54 per cent higher than at the start of the year, compared with a 8.9 per cent rise in the Pacific Rim excluding Japan as shown in the FT-A World Indices. Negative factors afflicting the market have included the government's setback in National Assembly elections in March, which increased political uncertainty. It also created doubts about the government's ability to solve the country's economic problems, which include high inflation, steep interest rates and a sizeable trade deficit. The row between the government and Hyundai, Korea's second biggest business group, has provoked worries about the effect of the dispute on the economy and whether the feud signals a new state crackdown on the chaebol, the conglomerates that dominate industry. But the influence of foreign investment in the Seoul market has been greater than that indicated by the market's index, which is heavily weighted towards large-capitalised shares. Foreign investors, primarily from the UK, concentrated on buying shares of small and medium companies with low price/earnings (p/e) ratios and good fundamentals, spurring interest among domestic investors. The sub-index for medium-capitalised companies has risen by 35 per cent this year, and that for small-capitalised businesses by 50 per cent. In a move to give more prominence to smaller companies, the Korean Stock Exchange announced last week that it would introduce a second index on May 1 that would average all share prices without giving weight to capitalisation. Based on this index, the market has risen by 30 per cent since the start of 1992. Foreign net investment in the Seoul bourse, which amounts to Dollars 665m so far this year, has subsided after an initial rush of activity in January. One reason is that the foreign preference for investing in smaller companies meant that the 10 per cent ceiling imposed on foreign shareholdings was quickly reached. Foreign investors, meanwhile, have avoided buying blue-chip Korean companies because of their high p/e ratios and heavy debts. There is speculation among foreign brokers that the government may raise the foreign ownership ceiling to 25 per cent this summer. 'If that happens, foreign interest will be revived. The amount of overseas investment in the Korean market could reach Dollars 2.5bn this year,' says Mr Duncan Ross, branch manager of Baring Securities. The government is also simplifying investment procedures in response to foreign criticism. 'Foreign investors viewed the initial process as too complicated, but things are now improving,' says Mr Peter Thorn, the chief representative for WI Carr. Rules that prevented foreign nominee companies or unit trust funds from participating in the market have been modified in recent weeks. But the imposition of a capital gains tax on investors from countries that have no double tax treaty with South Korea is still dampening interest from Germany, Japan and Hong Kong. An improvement in the economy could set the stage for a market rally. Inflation appears to be slowing, while the trade deficit has narrowed in the first quarter of 1992. A slowdown in economic growth to 7 per cent this year from last year's 8.4 per cent should reduce borrowing demand, leading to lower interest rates. But Mr Philip Smiley, Seoul branch manager of Jardine Fleming Securities warns that a market surge could be short-lived. 'There is a big overhang of shares held by local institutions and their sale could depress any rally.' Previous upturns have run out of steam for this reason. If enough foreign investment is attracted to Seoul in the coming months, that may represent the crucial difference in sustaining a recovery.</p>

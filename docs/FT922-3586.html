			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Regalian sells Frogmore stake Regalian Properties has sold its stake of 3.99m shares in Frogmore, another property company, for Pounds 10.6m. Regalian described the holding as a 'strategic stake' when it bought it last October for Pounds 14m. It said it would give it an interest in income-producing property at a discount to net assets and was in line with its strategy of developing an investment portfolio. City analysts assumed that Regalian was preparing to make a full bid and that its plans were thwarted by its inability to sell a Pounds 80m block of flats in Kensington. Regalian acquired the holding from Southend Properties, which bought the stake when it launched its unsuccessful Pounds 139m bid for Frogmore. Regalian is due to announce its annual results today.</p>

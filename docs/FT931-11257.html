			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News In Brief: Japanese shipbuilder cuts forecast MITSUBISHI Heavy Industries, the Japanese shipbuilder and machinery maker, has cut its pre-tax profit forecast for the year to March by 6.7 per cent to Y140bn (Dollars 1.1bn) as a decline in capital spending by Japanese industry has slowed machinery orders, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. Sales for the current year are now forecast at Y2,480bn, about the same as last year and 1 per cent lower than originally forecast. Net profits are forecast at Y88bn. ***** USF&amp;G, the troubled Baltimore-based insurer, yesterday reported an after-tax profit of Dollars 13m in the fourth quarter of 1992, compared with a loss of Dollars 40m in the same period of 1991, writes Nikki Tait. The figures  - which include no realised investment gains, compared with a Dollars 16m surplus a year earlier  - leaves USF&amp;G with an after-tax profit of Dollars 28m for the year, against a Dollars 176m loss in 1991. ***** TELUS, the Alberta telecoms utility privatised in 1991, will partner Toronto's CUC Broadcasting in developing cable TV operations in the UK. Telus will invest CDollars 126m in equity over five years and provide telephone services, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. CUC holds eight franchise areas in the Midlands and south-east, but has only recently begun to line-up subscribers.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Hong Kong progresses The Hong Kong stock market has made phenomenal progress recently. But much of that is because it started from such a low position. As the graph shows, the market was depressed following the Black Monday crash of 1987, and received further damage after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Now political and economic factors are conspiring to force the market back up. Real interest rates are negative, and real GDP growth in the colony is expected to top 5 per cent this year. Predictions for corporate earnings growth might mean that the market is still undervalued. The market was up more than 3 per cent for the week, in spite of a fall on Friday after nine positive sessions in a row.</p>

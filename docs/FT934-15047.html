			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (22): More than just a pretty picture - Neil Buckley discovers that the packaging of products is vital for those who want to succeed in culturally different markets / Labelling WHEN KP launches its Branigans thick-cut potato crisps in Spain, the packs will be without the drawing of Mr Branigan holding a tray of his wares familiar to devotees of the snack in the UK. Instead, Spanish snack-munchers will be confronted by a picture of a woman. The company was worried that cultural differences might mean a picture of a man engaging in the unmanly pursuit of baking would not go down well in Spain. For companies exporting consumer goods into foreign markets, the labelling and packaging to be used is a crucial consideration. A simple oversight - such as failing to take account of cultural differences - could prove costly and difficult to rectify later. Getting the packaging right, on the other hand, can bring rich rewards. Galbani, the Italian cheese producer, replaced 10 different packaging designs across Europe in 1991 with a standard one depicting the Tuscan landscape, a Gingham table cloth and appetising dishes for each cheese. Without any advertising, sales increased 22 per cent in the UK, 33 per cent in Germany and 50 per cent in France within six months. Broadly, exporters face two types of problems when labelling products for foreign customers. Firstly, they must ensure labels comply with legislation in the target market. Secondly, they must make choices about how to present a product, bearing in mind cultural, historical and linguistic differences. Labelling legislation can be complex. EC directive 79/112 covering the labelling of foodstuffs runs to 10 pages. While EC harmonisation at least means that a company which meets all the requirements on naming, ingredients, quantity, use-by dates and so on in one Community country should do so in another, there are still pitfalls. The directive says, for example, that food producers must display information about their products in a language easily understood by customers in the local market. That means manufacturers must either supply goods with labels printed in the appropriate language, apply stickers in the appropriate language to the original packaging, or distribute explanatory leaflets along with the foodstuffs. Exporters to new markets must check carefully the labelling requirements with the authorities in that country. Once the legal requirements have been met, companies must decide whether to use the same labelling as they do in their home market, or to adapt it for overseas markets. 'When you're going into a market where you have not been before, the major priority is getting to know your audience, and finding out about the cultural differences,' says Jan Marshall of Coley Porter Bell, the London design consultancy. There are obvious advantages in harmonising labelling across foreign markets. It allows centralised marketing, saving money on advertising and design, and keeps open the possibility of advertising via cross-border media such as satellite television. It also allows for a more cohesive and effective brand strategy. Devising a strong image for a brand can actually help it to cross borders and transcend language barriers. There can, however, be problems with such an approach. It may be difficult to use the same product name as some names may lose their impact in different markets. Moreover, names may translate badly. Marketing the anti-perspirant Body Mist might be difficult in Germany, where 'mist' means manure or dung. Where different names for the same product exist in different markets, harmonising them can be difficult. But it can be done. Mars, the US-owned food manufacturer, did it successfully with its Snickers bar, previously known in the UK as Marathon. The change was heralded well in advance of its introduction, with a 'flash' on the pack warning the product was 'soon to be called Snickers'. After the name change, the flash changed to 'formerly known as Marathon'. Mars was helped by a strong packaging design that was the same everywhere despite the different name. Sometimes, manufacturers decide not to change different brand names that are well-established in different countries, but continue to capitalise on the customer loyalty within each country. A good example is Unilever, which decided to retain the existing names of its main laundry detergent, known variously as All, Omo, Persil, Presto, Skip and Via. But it did adopt a more harmonised approach to packaging, using similar visual devices, typography and colours, to ensure that Persil buyers from the UK would recognise a packet of Omo as the same product if they were confronted with it overseas. Harmonising packaging design, however, can be difficult. Colours, for example, are used differently in different countries. In Germany, it is quite normal to market products for babies in bold, bright colours. In the UK, pastel shades are more acceptable. Pictures and images can also create problems. Nudity or semi-nudity, while acceptable in countries such as France, is clearly out in Muslim countries. Even if the basic design and lettering of a label is the same, companies may decided to carry a different message or slogan on the label in different countries. Although Unilever launched its new Sun Progress dishwasher powder in a standard packaging design, research in France, Germany, Italy and the UK revealed widely differing consumer priorities. The result was that when Sun Progress was introduced into Germany in 1990, the packaging message stressed the product's environmental credentials. When it was launched later in the UK, the message emphasised its value for money and the fact that it would not cause damage to fine china. For exporters to be successful in foreign markets, having the right product is not enough. Just as important is presenting it the right way.</p>

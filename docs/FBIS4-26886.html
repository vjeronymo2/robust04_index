			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "ID Card Aids Foreign Experts"] </F>   [Text] The State Bureau of Foreign Experts (SBFE) is  drafting a regulation to ensure sound management of foreign  experts employed by the country.    According to the bureau, the State is now issuing a special  ID-like certificate to the growing number of foreign experts  that will enable them to make more convenient purchases and  money exchanges.    The regulation's main content is the ID certificate which is  designed to make life more convenient for foreign experts.    With it, experts can bring into China such working tools as  personal computers without paying custom duties.    They can also exchange foreign currencies at the Bank of  China.    Foreign experts are hired by the state for such things as  teaching at universities or editing for newspapers or publishing  houses. In most cases their contracts stipulate that they are  paid a percentage of their salary in renminbi.    According to Ma Junru, director-general of SBFE, more than  50,000 foreigners worked for China last year, including 11,000  experts in universities, newspapers, and publishing houses.  There were also 4,500 special economic and technical experts,  more than 20,000 foreign engineers for big construction  contracts, and 10,000 overseas staff in foreign-funded  enterprises, Ma said.    They will all receive the new identification certificate.    Foreign professionals have been invited to China since the  founding of the People's Republic. But they shied away from  China until the 1980's.    The experts in university and journalistic units earn 2,000  yuan ($230) to 4,800 yuan ($552) a month plus free housing, a  vacation bonus, and round-trip plane tickets.    But the 4,500 economic and technical experts actually  receive  no salary apart from stipends. Usually retirees, they  voluntarily help with their knowledge and experience.    Foreign engineers earn $300 to $1,200 a day working on  construction sites of power plants, expressways, and chemical  complexes in line with their contracts.    According to Ma, foreigners now work in every province,  municipality, and autonomous region including landlocked regions  like Tibet and Xinjiang.    "Foreign intellectual resources have instilled great  momentum  into China's modernization drive," he said.    Foreign experts have helped in "establishing a market system  in China, solving technical difficulties in important  construction projects, industrial and agricultural production,  and spreading advanced technology," he added.    Meanwhile, Ma told China Daily that SBFE will help import  more fruit and vegetables from Europe and South America to  enrich the national dinner table variety.</p>

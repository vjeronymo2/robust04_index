			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Travel (Scotland): Forgotten romance of Scotland - Nicholas Woodsworth makes a rewarding discovery on the road back to England I drove into the Borders town of Kelso late one rainy night, feeling rather low. I was London-bound and, after a week of wild hills and salt air in the far north-west corner of Scotland, had little taste for a return to the stuffy confines of English life. If I stopped six miles short of the English border, it was not for nostalgic reasons - it was simply because Kelso was a place to eat and sleep, a pit stop as convenient as any on the way to the M1 motorway. The place had nothing to do with the real Scotland which, as far as I was concerned, began somewhere north of Inverness. I woke early, though, and a look outside made me wonder immediately if I might not take an extra day on the way down. The weather had cleared and, just outside my hotel window, in warm morning sunlight, flowed a marvellous river. Twenty feet from the pasture on the far shore, a fisherman stood thigh-deep in slow-moving water, spinning gossamer from a fly rod. Caught against the light, the fishing line took on a twisting, restless life - the longer it grew with each delicate flick of the rod, the more artful became its arcs, the more complex its ellipses and convolutions. The fisherman's final object might have been to catch fish but, in the process, he also caught me. My eyes moved up-river, taking in new sights with new pleasure: a tall, blue heron standing statue-like in shadows by the bank; a black and white border collie, on some unknown but crucial mission, hurtling past a herd of fat Guernseys drinking at the river; a large, water-borne swan stretching its powerful neck skywards, wings flapping and chest heaving, before settling back down to its customary repose. My eyes finally came to rest on a far reach of river half a mile from the town. Across a vast park dotted with shade trees, I spotted the crenellated towers and pepper-pot chimneys of a sprawling castle. Somehow, although I had never been in Kelso before, both river and castle seemed familiar. The water that flows past Kelso is, in fact, the middle reach of the Tweed, one of Scotland's most celebrated rivers; any angler who has ever picked up a coffee-table book on salmon and trout fishing has seen pictures of it. The memory of the castle was harder to locate. Floors, Scotland's largest castle, was once featured graphically in Greystoke, a film in which Tarzan of the apes returns from his jungle home to claim his rightful inheritance as Scotland's distinguished Lord Greystoke. That little conceit might seem somewhat improbable but, as I began to discover immediately, it is no more improbable than our insistence that highland Scotland is the only Scotland. If romance is the criterion for Scottish travel - and, for most of us, it is  -then we may be over-shooting the mark in our haste to make for lonely northern islands and highland moors. In the superb and virtually ignored countryside of the Borders, 500 years of violent struggle between Englishman and Scot ensured there is more romance to the square yard than anywhere in Britain. Author Sir Walter Scott called Kelso 'the most beautiful, if not the most romantic, town in Scotland'. He might have been prejudiced (he went to school there) but, to get some idea of what he was talking about, I only had to walk past Kelso's flower-strewn main square to the oldest part of town, snugged into a sharp bend in the Tweed. Once I had torn myself from the display cases of hand-tied flies in the Tweedside Tackle shop - every bit as good as a visit to a fine arts museum - I found myself in Abbey Row. In the grassy, tree-shaded square stood hundreds of headstones, green with the moss of ages and leaning at all sorts of precarious angles. Anywhere else, a gloomy cemetery in the middle of town might seem morbid. Here in the shadow of Kelso Abbey, it only substantiated the link between present and past, enlivening the great medieval romance that bloody Borders' history has now become. In the middle ages, far from being the stage for wild and warring clans that the highlands were, the Border area was a centre of monastic culture and learning. In the first half of the 12th century, Scotland's King David I embarked on a campaign of abbey-building so ambitious it left a string of his successors bankrupt. But the fate of those who followed the first monks at the four great royal abbeys - Kelso, Dryburgh, Jedburgh and Melrose - was worse than any indebtedness. Over the next five centuries, endless invasion and border raids by the English, interspersed with counter-attacks and scorched earth campaigns by the Scottish, engulfed the whole area. Towns, castles, livestock and rich farming lands were not the only targets. In 1544, after the town of Kelso had been burnt twice and gutted by the English, the Earl of Hertford put these four abbeys to the torch. By this time, 'the Kelso monks were mainly fighters', as one historian recounts. 'Twelve monks and 90 laymen held the abbey against the English and, when the guns battered down the splendid walls, the gallant soldier-monks retreated to the tower, where they held out all night. At dawn, the steeple was won and the last Scot died fighting.' It is little wonder that, today, there are still significant differences of outlook and behaviour, a sense of 'us and them', along the Scottish-English border. I walked around the broken arches and collapsed towers and tried to imagine the silent, smoking horror of Kelso Abbey following that last, early-morning slaughter. For a while, alone, it was easy. Then, in much less time than it took to bring the abbey down, an entire church fete and bake-sale built itself up around the ruins. I bought myself some treacly currant tart and wandered off to Floors. I enjoyed a tour with John Wilson, the castle's former butler turned guide who now shows visitors about. It is a wonderful place, full of fairy-tale castle ornamentation. 'Altogether a kingdom for Oberon and Titania to dwell in,' Scott enthused. Wilson did not wax quite as lyrical. 'Never used to like the stuff,' he told me in the dining room, pointing out a magnificent set of engraved silver gilt cutlery. 'Used to have to clean it.' Wilson is, in fact, tremendously proud of Floors and tremendously knowledgeable about the Meissen porcelain, Louis Quinze furniture, Aubusson carpets, Gobelin tapestries, Ming vases and the hundreds of other objects that fill its rooms. I enjoyed even more a chat with the duke of Roxburghe himself, an unassuming man of great charm who, when not managing his 50,000 acres, likes nothing more than fishing. We discussed farming life in the green, rounded hills of the Borders and the proud, independent and tough attitude that is born from it - Borders rugby men, he assured me, are second to none in Scotland. We discussed Borders horsemanship - again, mostly because of the area's warring tradition, unrivalled in the country. We discussed fox hunting, pheasant shooting, hounds, cattle, cattle thieving, old Border traditions and, inevitably, Sir Walter Scott. His former home in nearby Abbotsford, a neo-Gothic mansion filled with all manner of things traditional, romantic and heroic, attracts as many visitors as Floors. Most of all, though, we discussed Tweed salmon and the monstrous specimen, weighing more than 50lb and now mounted proudly on the wall, that the duke pulled from the Tweed not so long ago. All in all, he concluded, there was much more here to keep him occupied happily than there was in London. I might have said the same. The pleasures to be found in the Borders are as varied as you like to make them. Shortly afterwards, I found myself on a rough tramp through the wild Cheviot hills with the merry members of the Coldstream Ramblers Association. On the other hand, dinner that evening at Sunlaws House, a grand baronial hotel outside Kelso, was as elegant as could be: Perthshire venison with figs, Tweed salmon with fennel, and Tayside raspberries with a great sigh of satisfaction. I had lost a day on the way down to London. The capital, I decided before turning in, might just have to wait a day or two longer.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russia Hides no Data on Chemical </F> Arms"]    [Text] Allegations that Russia is hiding some sort of data  about chemical weapons are "absolutely groundless," stated  Grigoriy Karasin, Russian Federation Foreign Ministry  information and press department director, in connection with  the accusations heard in the course of hearings in the U.S.  Congress. He advised that the Russian Federation and the United  Stated exchanged data on their military-chemical potentials on  the basis of an intergovernment memorandum on chemical weapons.  "These data are being studied and analyzed by both sides,  following which Russia and the United States will each carry out  five inspections at each other's installations. This is provided  for so that the sides can make sure the received information is  trustworthy," the Foreign Ministry official stated.</p>

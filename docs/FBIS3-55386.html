			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yuriy Soltan] </F>   [Text] On the invitation of the Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, the head of the Washington administration, Bill  Clinton, will arrive in Moscow on 12 January on a state visit.  Yuriy Solton examines the significance of this visit:    [Solton] It is symbolic that the new external political year  for Russia is beginning with a meeting between Boris Yeltsin and  Bill Clinton. This has once more refuted the speculations that  have appeared in some media as though the Russian Government,  embroiled in internal and other problems, considers its  relationship with the United States less significant.    In Moscow, the Vancouver Declaration, under which the two  presidents attempt to conduct their business with the aim of  strengthening bilateral cooperation and friendship, is seen as  an important principle. By all accounts, Washington also feels  the same about the Vancouver Declaration. As to what meaning  the United States of America attaches to the Russian factor can  be gleaned from the appointment of Strobe Talbott [as]  coordinator of American policies on Russia and other  Commonwealth countries.    President Bill Clinton himself believes that the main task  of  his visit to Moscow is to demonstrate America's support for the  democratic and market reforms, which are the preoccupations of  Yeltsin and his team. He is not carrying with him any new aid  package to Russia. The sum of $4.5 million has already been  announced, and during the visit of the American Vice President  Albert Gore to Moscow in December some concrete agreements were  reached.    Of course, during the Moscow talks prospects for further  development in trade and economic cooperation between the two  countries -- which for Russia, that has entered a period of  radical changes, is important -- will be discussed. The  negotiations in Moscow promise to be all-embracing and concrete,  including the issue of security, cooperation in the control of  weapons, the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and joint  action in resolving regional conflicts.    It is possible that different approaches to the solution of  all or any problem may arise, but there can be no doubt that the  meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, designed to  define the program of cooperation and joint actions by these two  great countries at the end of the century and the beginning of  the next, will become an important event in world history.</p>

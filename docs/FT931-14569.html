			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Women still miss out on top jobs A YEAR after the launch of Opportunity 2000, the equal opportunities programme, the proportion of female main board directors remains negligible, according to figures in the 1993 edition of Crawford's Directory of City Connections, Roland Rudd and David Goodhart write. The number of women reaching key executive positions in Britain's top publicly-quoted 1,278 companies rose only from 124 to 150 out of a total of 5,641 senior jobs. The number of women who hold chairmanships has fallen from five to two - Ms Jean Tyrell at Sirdar, the textile manufacturer, and Ms Aleksandra Clayton at Alexanders Holdings the car dealer. Ms Ruth Henderson remains the only woman chief executive, at Alexon Group, the retailer. There are a few women managing directors: Ms Anita Roddick at Body Shop; Ms Barbara-Anne Maxwell at Tamaris, the nursing home operator; Ms Bridget Towle at Towles, the knitwear manufacturer; and Ms Michelle Kavanagh at Irish property developer Power Corporation. The growth areas for women are company secretary, with 7 per cent women  - and investor relations officer, with 17 per cent. Crawford's Directory of City Connections.

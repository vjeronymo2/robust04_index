			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs behind 49% decline at Union Intl Union International, the trading arm of the Vestey group, yesterday announced a 49 per cent fall to Pounds 6.5m in pre-tax profits for 1993. However, that reflected the group's substantial restructuring - its core business showed growth. Mr Terry Robinson, chief executive, has almost completed the group's refocusing on food processing and distribution, while reducing its enormous debt through the sale of non-core businesses. 'The company has moved from intensive care to recuperation', he said. Mr Robinson's contract runs out at the end of the year, and is unlikely to be renewed. During 1993, total bank debt fell by Pounds 77.4m to Pounds 124.6m, helped by the sale of Pounds 96m of assets - including UK properties, its Australian fisheries business and Brazilian trading operations. Turnover fell 25 per cent to Pounds 891.5m as a result of disposals, but continuing operations showed an 8.3 per cent increase in sales and contributed Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 21m) in profit Interest charges fell from Pounds 32.6m to Pounds 21.6m due to the debt reduction, but profits were held back by an Pounds 8m exceptional loss, resulting from asset disposals. In the UK, the food distribution businesses performed strongly. Weddel Swift Depots, the largest national meat wholesaler, achieved a 70 per cent increase in operating profit to Pounds 1.1m. However, Union's retail chains of butchers in the UK - which include Dewhurst, Alex Munro and Baxters - showed a decline in profits during the year. The group's Australian businesses, including meat packing, retail and wholesaling, and also a profitable property business, showed strong growth. There is speculation that these will be floated off but Mr Robinson refused to comment.</p>

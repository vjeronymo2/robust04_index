			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / OECD Employment Outlook: Unemployment set to reach 35m this year Unemployment in the 25 countries of the Organisation of Economic Development and Co-operation will reach a record 35m this year, up 10m since 1990, but will fall from 8.5 per cent of the working population in 1994 to 8.3 per cent in 1995, according to the OECD annual Employment Outlook released yesterday. In Europe, however, the jobless figure will rise from 11.7 per cent this year to 11.8 per cent next. The report says employment growth in the current recovery has been concentrated in part-time jobs and has been weaker than in past recoveries, a result of slower growth in service sector employment. But the OECD says that fears of 'jobless recovery' have been exaggerated and predicts that as growth picks up employment will follow. Wage rises remained moderate in 1993, falling to 3.4 per cent from 5.2 per cent in 1992. A peak was reached in public spending on labour market measures in 1992 and 1993 at an average 1.7 per cent of GDP. The report strikes a rather less free-market tone than parts of last month's OECD Jobs Study. 'High labour turnover can deter both businesses and workers from investing optimally in skill training. This can result in even more labour turnover as workers look for better job opportunities in other firms', says the commentary. Countries should facilitate long-term commitments between employees and employers and says 'institution building, involving governments and the social partners, is an essential component of a strategy to foster a high productivity growth path.' This emphasis reflects the influence of Mr Robert Reich, the US labour secretary, and will be less to the liking of the UK government. Similarly, strongly deregulatory governments will have reservations about the praise for collective bargaining and consultation with workers over plant closures. However, the UK government will be pleased that on labour standards the report hints that harmonisation of labour regulation of the European Union is superfluous, although it adds that further research will be needed to substantiate this. The UK will also be pleased that the OECD predicts it will have one of the highest levels of employment growth this year and next, at 1.2 per cent in 1994 and 1.4 per cent in 1995. And in an analysis of average earnings after tax, adjusted for purchasing power parities, the UK comes fourth out of 18 OECD countries behind Switzerland, the US, and Canada, and just ahead of Germany. Compared with the 1980s it says labour force growth in Europe will slacken but the opposite is predicted for North America and Oceania. The number of young people in the labour force is set to fall in Europe and grow in North America. Women and older workers will see their share of the labour force grow. Occupational growth will be strongest for professional, technical and managerial workers.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- EMPLOYMENT AND LABOUR FORCE GROWTH IN THE OECD AREA  -------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Total                                   (000s)    Annual percentage change                                     1992   1992   1993   1994   1995  ------------------------------------------------------------------- North America: Employment        129 835    0.5    1.4    3.0    1.9  Labour force                    140 781    1.2    0.9    2.5    1.3 Japan: Employment                 64 357    1.1    0.2    0.3    0.9  Labour force                     65 779    1.2    0.6    0.7    0.8 Central &amp; Western Europe:  Employment                      102 310   -1.3   -1.4   -0.5    0.6  Labour force                    112 048   -0.2   -0.2    0.1    0.4 Southern Europe:  Employment                       60 231   -0.7   -2.5   -1.7    0.3  Labour force                     67 952    0.2   -1.4    0.8    1.0 Nordic countries:  Employment                       11 070   -3.2   -3.4      0    1.1  Labour force                     12 066   -0.8   -0.9   -0.3    0.6 Oceania:  Employment                        9 201   -0.3      0    2.2    2.5  Labour force                     10 301    0.8      0    1.3    1.6  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

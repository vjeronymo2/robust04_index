			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S., SOVIETS TO RESUME NUCLEAR TALKS;  </P> <P> BAKER, SHEVARDNADZE REACH AGREEMENT AT MOSCOW MEETING  </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union will resume negotiations on strategic  nuclear arms reductions in mid-June, a Soviet spokesman announced today.  </P> <P> Gennady I. Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, said the  agreement was reached during the first day of talks between visiting U.S.  Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze.  </P> <P> Gerasimov said the next round of talks on nuclear and space weapons will  probably resume in Geneva either June 12 or June 19 and last for six weeks. He  said that the Soviets had wanted the negotiations to begin again in May but  that the Americans demurred.  </P> <P> He said the U.S. side explained that Richard Burt, who has been nominated by  President George Bush to head the U.S. bargaining team, probably would not be  confirmed by the U.S. Senate in time to resume talks this month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Regional Issues  </P> <P> The two leaders met for almost three hours today after Baker's arrival from  Helsinki for his visit to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The discussions began with regional issues, such as the Middle East and  Afghanistan, and included arms control, human rights, regional problems and  direct U.S.-Soviet relations.  </P> <P> Gerasimov said the subject of short-range missiles in Europe, which has caused  a rift in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, did not come up today.  </P> <P> He had told reporters earlier that at the request of the U.S. side, Baker and  Shevardnadze concentrated on regional conflicts, rather than nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Last of the Cold War'  </P> <P> "Dealing with regional problems will enable us to get the last of the Cold War  behind us and move into a new stage of our relationship," Gerasimov said.  </P> <P> "We are very pleased with the way things started," said Baker, who is making  his first trip to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The two sides found common ground on Central America, Gerasimov said. "Both  sides stated there was good potential for a furthering of dialogue on a Central  American settlement," he said.  </P> <P> Baker wants the Soviets to curb their aid to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua,  which amounted to $500 million last year. The Soviets also raised the subject  of Afghanistan, which Baker had no intention of bringing up because the Kremlin  is demanding that the United States halt its military aid to Afghan rebels.  </P> <P> According to Gerasimov, Baker and Shevardnadze also discussed U.S. Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney's prediction that perestroika, the restructuring program  of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, will fail.  </P> <P> Baker explained that Cheney's remarks did not reflect Washington's official  position and Shevardnadze did not take offense, Gerasimov said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michael Binyon and Nicholas George: "Rush To </F> Expand EU Is Blamed on Swedish Law"]    [Text] Stockholm -- The Swedish constitution is the main  consideration behind the urgency of the timetable for the four  applications to join the European Union [EU], a senior British  official said yesterday.    Under Swedish law a bill which involves changes to the  country's constitution must be approved by two separate  parliaments. The Swedish parliament is dissolved in June, with  a general election in September, and unless the constitutional  bill paving the way for the treaty can be presented to the  current parliament, the final decision might have to wait a  further four years until after the next general election.    Swedish officials were yesterday urgently studying ways  around the obstacle. One would be to allow a vote on the  constitutional bill before the outcome of the negotiations with  the EU were known.    An alternative would be to present the constitutional change  to the new parliament, and then call a general election shortly  afterwards so that a fresh parliament could also add its  approval.    This would be a highly unorthodox move, breaking the  practice  of fixed-term parliaments but it is not impossible for the Prime  Minister to call a snap election.    Sources in Sweden said yesterday that the worries about the  timetable have subsided as constitutional experts have insisted  that Swedish membership would not be jeopardised by such  technicalities.    A failure to settle quickly the dispute over EU minority  voting rights could jeopardise the whole enlargement process,  Ulf Dinkelspiel, Sweden's Minister of European Affairs, warned  yesterday. Sweden, Finland and Norway have been relaxed about  the dispute which has pitted Britain and Spain against the ten  other EU members. However, concern is now growing that the  inability of the Twelve to settle the matter will force a  postponement of the Nordic countries' entry into the EU,  scheduled for January 1, 1995. Any such delay would have a  negative effect on the outcome of forthcoming referendums to be  held on the issue in the three countries, Mr Dinkelspiel said.  A majority of voters in Norway and Sweden oppose membership and  the governments face an uphill task in convincing them  otherwise. In Finland a majority supports joining.    "I think we are approaching a critical point. If there is a  further delay it will not be possible for the European  Parliament to deal with the enlargement negotiations this spring  and that will effectively delay entry," Mr Dinkelspiel said.    On a visit to Stockholm earlier this week Kenneth Clarke,  the  Chancellor of the Exchequer, defended Britain's stance.    "I think if you in Scandinavia had a government that had  found itself being out-voted all the time because its political  colours don't match the political colours of most of the other  governments, you will find there is a growing resistance to  that," he said.</p>

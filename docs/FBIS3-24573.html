Sarnadskiy; UDC 621.378:682.33]    [Abstract] Interference-optical methods for information  processing dealing with space-time parameters of several  physical phenomena are examined. The information is in the form  of a universal optical signal - interference pattern. In  addition to examining the traditional methods of processing the  interference pattern, methods, based on supplementary modulation  in time and space, are also examined along with methods of  spatial frequency measurements. Some new phase measuring methods  are proposed and areas of their practical application are  pointed out. An example of a digital analysis of interference  pattern, which has a practical significance, is provided.  Figures 5, references 64: 21 Russian, 43 Western.</p>

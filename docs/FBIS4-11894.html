			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 1 April (SUNA) -- Sudan Government  Thursday [31 March] issued a statement on the occasion of the  visit to Sudan by Mrs. Madeleine Albright, permanent  representative of the USA at the United Nations. Here is the  statement full text:  <H5>  Sudan's Stance Towards Various Issues </H5>   The government of the Revolution of National Salvation is  fully aware of the fact that most of the problems that face the  Sudan at the internal level and at the level of its relations  with the other countries, including the United States, are  tightly connected with the problem of the war in southern Sudan,  therefore, the government has always been looking for the  attainment of a peaceful solution to the problem in itself as  well as for the treatment of the complications that the war has  caused.    This has been clearly reflected in the efforts exerted by  the  government in order to restore peace and to provide relief for  those affected by the war. On the other hand, the problem of  the war in the south is connected to varying degree with other  problems encountered by the Sudan such as human rights, the  quest for an equitable division of wealth and power and the  creation of social and economic development.    Since its advent the Revolution of National Salvation has  put  the quest for a peaceful solution to the conflict in southern  Sudan at the top of its priorities. It took the initiative by  sending a message to Colonel John Garang calling him for the  table of negotiations, but he refused to receive that message,  which was received instead by the former Ethiopian President  Mengistu.    The government also took the initiative by declaring a  unilateral cease-fire which induced the rebels to capture Kurmuk  Town, but the government had nevertheless committed itself to  the transportation of relief products to the needy in the  operation areas, including those controlled by the rebels.    Two months after the advent of the revolution, in August  1989, a government delegation met with rebels delegation in  Addis Ababa and the two sides agreed upon the necessity of the  continuation of the negotiations in order to attain peace.    During September and October 1989 a national conference on  peace issues convened in Khartoum and tackled problems such as;    (1) Power sharing    (2) Distribution of wealth    (3) Religion and politics    (4) Unity in diversity    During the period from 28th November to 5th December, the  second round of negotiations between the government and the  rebels was held in Nairobi, sponsored by former U.S. President  Mr. Jimmy Carter. In effect, the government's agenda during this  round and during all the subsequent talks were the resolutions  of the national conference on peace issues.    In 1991 the rebel movement was split into two factions.  However, the government had not given up hope in contacting  both of them. During May, June, 1992, and in response to the  mediation of the Nigerian Government, another first round of  negotiation was held in Abuja between the government and the two  factions, and the agenda had been agreed upon for the future  talks, but John Garang declared in Kampala during a press  conference that he would not recognize the Abuja resolutions  because the head of his delegation surpassed the powers  delegated to him.    The second round convened in Abuja in May 1993, and this  time  the concerned sides had agreed upon most of the raised points  but the coming of John Garang at the end of the talks impeded  the success of the round by causing a disagreement over the  issue of residual powers. However, another round of talks  between the government and the United Faction was held in  Nairobi and resumed in Fashoda (Sudan) in August 1993.    During the summit meeting of IGADD (6th to 8th September  1993), the presidents of Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda,  expressed their desire to mediate in order to put an end to the  war in southern Sudan. A meeting between the two sides of the  conflict was thus held in Nairobi, 17th March 1994, but the  talks have been postponed, to be resumed in the same venue on  16th May 1994.    This long war which is imposed upon us in the southern part  of the country has created a humanitarian problem. This problem  is manifest in the great numbers of displaced persons who sought  refuge in safer areas inside or outside of the Sudan. The  government has therefore committed itself to displaced people  until peace is restored and they go back to their areas.    In fact, the government has done its utmost in order to  provide relief for its needy citizens and at the same time it  welcomed the support of the international community in this  respect. The government has signed a number of agreements, some  of which represent a breakthrough in the field of providing  relief to those affected by war, even for those who live in the  areas held by the rebels. The agreements include:    (1) The general agreement with the International Commission  of the Red Cross signed in 1984.    (2) Operation Lifeline Sudan signed with the U.N. in 1989.    (3) Operation Lifeline signed with U.N. in 1991.    (4) The detailed agreement with the ICRC in 1992.    (5) Operation Lifeline signed with the U.N. in 1993.    (6) The Nairobi Agreement with the rebel factions on the  facilitation of the flow of relief March 1994.    In spite of the fact that the rebel movement has exploited  these agreements to serve other ends, and in spite of the fact  that certain organizations have acted in such manners that  ignore the Sudanese sovereignty, the government showed a lot of  patience and cooperation in consideration to the miserable  situation of its citizens.    However, the major handicap that faces us at the present is  the lack of the means of transportation that secure the arrival  of the relief materials to the needy in due time.    And hence, the government is ready for full cooperation with  the international community represented by the U.N. and donor  countries for the import of the necessary equipment for the  transportation of relief products as well as for the cooperation  in the field of the supervision of relief operations.  <H5>  Democracy and Political System </H5>   The concept of democracy in Sudan entails the exercise of  people of their legitimate rights in governing themselves and  choosing the political system that conforms with their social  background, cultural heritage and economic prosperity.    (?As to) the question of democracy (?on) the agenda of  (?Sudan)- American relations, it is imperative to agree on the  content rather than the form which is governed by the changing  factors of specific community.    Sudan has adopted a political system that conforms with its  orientation, having in mind repeated failures of applying  Western democracy since independence, in 1956. Although the  political system is still in its preliminary stages, the active  participation of people in popular committees' elections gave it  the needed drive. Necessary steps are being taken to complete  the system by introducing free and direct elections at all  levels, from popular committee to the National Assembly. The  political system tends also to elect the president and vice  president directly. The federal system will help also to widen  the base for political participation.  <H5>  Economic Reform </H5>   Sudan's Government has exerted great efforts regarding  privatization of the Sudanese economy to an extent that exceeded  what is usually recommended by the IMF. It applied a tough  policy of self-reliance and market economy which resulted in  economic hardship.    Unfortunately, the IMF has ignored its adviser's technical  view, which praised Sudan for achieving an annual economic  growth of 11.5 percent. The IMF response to American  (?pressure) has denied Sudan any financial assistance. The IMF  has lost its technical credibility and began to treat economic  issues which are influenced by double standards.  <H5>  Terrorism </H5>   Sudan has renewed its condemnation of international  terrorism. It also requested those accusing Sudan of terrorism  to furnish evidence to that effect.    It is needless to say that Sudan does not harbour terrorists  or training camps and the government has repeatedly declared  that Sudan is an open country for those who want to see for  themselves.    Sudan also is not threatening the stability of other  countries. To the contrary, Sudan is threatened by some  neighbouring countries that provide rebels and opposition groups  with logistics, camps and access to media. Efforts were made to  refute these allegations about terrorism. Dialogue was started  with the American ambassador in Khartoum and a letter was sent  by the foreign minister to his American counterpart, suggesting  exchange of information about the subject. Instead of a  positive response, the United States include Sudan in its list  of countries sponsoring international terrorism.    A statement by ex-President Jimmy Carter and a testimony by  an official of the State Department, at hearing in the congress  on last March 1994, prove beyond doubt that the American  decision was baseless.  <H5>  Human Rights </H5>   Respect of human rights in Sudan is a matter of principle  and  the government is very eager to preserve these rights in  accordance with its principles. Sudan welcomed the special  rapporteur, Mr. Gaspar Biro, and accorded him all assistance  possible to carry out his job. However, the report of the  special rapporteur was full of misinformation and disrespect to  the beliefs of the Sudanese people. Nevertheless, the U.S.  Government delegation to the 50th session of the human rights  committee decided to support the biased report and spearhead the  attack on Sudan.    We believe that the noble cause of human rights is being  exploited politically and double standards were applied to  ridicule the beliefs of Muslims, as did the report by the  special rapporteur. This is a serious matter.    Such irresponsible behavior defeats the real objectives  behind the international instruments on human rights that call  for the respect of different cultures and religious beliefs.  <H5>  Grievances of the Sudanese Government Against the USA Policy </H5>   The Sudanese Government has its own grievances against the  policy of the U.S.A. vis-a-vis the Sudan. It is a policy  characterized by permanent hostility, escalation of contention  and arbitrary.    (1) The American administration based itself in its hostile  position against the government of the Sudan on Congress  Resolution No. 513, despite the selectivity and double standards  practised by the American administration in applying this  resolution. The administration did not take into account the  legacy inherited by the NSR government such as an imposed war,  refugees, displaced persons, drought and instability that  hindered development, endangered unity and security of the  country and posed a threat to neighbours.    (2) The United States adopted a number of resolutions  against  the Sudan without any objective reasons, an act that deepened  misunderstanding between the two governments, e.g.;    (3) Congress Resolution No. H.R. 2295 (June 1993), H.R.  2332,  (June 1993-1994), (March 1993) and 131 (November, 1993).  [paragraph as received]    (4) Hostile positions of the American Administration by  preparing draft resolutions against the Sudan and lobbying for  their adoption. Such positions were flagrant at U.N. General  Assembly during 47th, 48th sessions, especially on human rights  issue.    (5) Hostile American positions against the Sudan within the  Human Rights Commission sessions 48,49,50. The question of  appointing the independent expert, the appointment of the  special rapporteur, transition of Sudan from the confidential  hearing to the public hearing phase and, finally, the adoption  of the report of the rapporteur which contained insults against  Islam, the creed of the nation.    (6) Adaption by the American administration of the rebels'  version at different international forums and different  occasions, as proved.    - The Washington Colloquium, organized under the auspices of  Mr. Johnson, chairman of the Special Committee on Africa.    - Hostility to the Islamic orientation of the Sudan and its  cultural option.    - The hostile position of the American Administration  against  Sudan at the IMF, an act that led to forcing the Sudan to quit  the IMF.    - The American Administration consistently stood against the  Sudan in other international financial institutions.    - Inscription of the Sudan on the list of countries that  sponsor international terrorism, without the least proof by the  American administration.    - Anti-Sudanese declarations by USA officials in every  international forum, subjectively and without any proof whatever.    - Despite the American humanitarian assistance, a gesture  appreciated in itself, yet this assistance is limited and does  not cover liberated zones and falls short of involving  infrastructure for relief operat ons.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   Despite the grievances mentioned above and the damage  suffered by the Sudan due to the American hostile policy, we do  believe that there is no objective reason for this hostility.  We are confident that the wrong information leaked to the  American Administration, which caused the misunderstanding that  prevail over the relations between the two countries, can be  corrected through serious, frank, and active dialogue. The  Government of Sudan stands ready for such dialogue and that it  shall contribute, it is the conviction that dialogue is the  confidence between the two countries and strengthen the ties of  friendship between the two governments.</p>

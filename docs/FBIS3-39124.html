			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Paul Cambon report: "Juppe and Leotard in Sarajevo Today"] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Defense Minister  Francois Leotard will be in Sarajevo today, according to a  communique issued by the Foreign Ministry. Mr. Juppe left last  night, initially flying to Zagreb. There he will notably meet  with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. Juppe and Leotard will  today visit Sarajevo where a meeting is planned with Bosnian  President Alija Izetbegovic.    This visit comes after Wednesday's [9 February] decision by  NATO to give the Serbian forces 10 days to lift the siege of  Sarajevo or be subjected to air strikes. The Foreign Ministry's  communique added that Mr. Juppe will express the "firmness and  determination" of Paris to "enforce the ultimatum issued by the  Atlantic Alliance and which France had demanded. At the same  time, France, in agreement with its allies, still subscribes to  the need to do everything possible to restart the diplomatic  process which must make it possible to find a political solution  to the conflict."    The Foreign Ministry said that Mr. Juppe had discussed the  visit with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and  British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd. All France's other  European partners have also been kept informed.    Today's visit to Sarajevo by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe  and  Defense Minister Francois Leotard is a symbol of France's desire  to persist in the determination expressed by NATO on Wednesday  and to stress the unaltered priority: Beyond the warnings, the  ultimatum, and possible sanctions by air strikes, the aim is  still to push for negotiations between the three warring  factions and therefore to create the conditions required to  restore peace through diplomatic channels.    On this fundamental point, Paris and Washington have happily  taken the same line. While pressure must continue to be put on  the Serbs (and on the Croats) at the cost of real risks for the  UN troops on the ground, France and America have finally reached  an agreement on the issue of intensifying efforts of persuasion  for the Bosnian Muslims.    In Sarajevo Alain Juppe will certainly work along these  lines  in his meeting with President Izetbegovic. Nonetheless, until  the NATO ultimatum expires on 21 February, we can expect to see  an escalation in the delaying tactics originating equally from  Belgrade, Pale, and Moscow. There were already initial signs of  this yesterday. Moreover, everyone still remembers the flurry of  more or less successful diplomatic initiatives between December  1990 and January 1991 that tried to avert war breaking out with  Saddam Husayn.    This time, Paris at least considers that the it stands  strong  in the Bosnia dossier and that the determination of the West  should not be caught out. While Alain Juppe firmly stresses  that it is "Sarajevo first," he has still not forgotten the rest  of Bosnia: central Bosnia, Tuzla airport, and the Srebenica  enclave.    However, while Sarajevo takes priority, the Bosnian capital  seriously risks being the exclusive focus of attention for  observers. This means that, on the scattered front lines many  threats and temptations will still remain open to all sides.  The Muslims, for example, may well be tempted to profit from  the new situation and provoke their enemies as they have done in  the past. The Serbs could let themselves be caught up in an  accelerating logic of reprisals. The same goes for the Croats.    Finally, there is the difficulty of checking the  implementation of the NATO requirements on the ground, always  assuming that no serious incidents occur between now and 21  February to trigger NATO's intervention mechanism. Unless there  is a dramatic turn of events, the West has therefore entered  into a rigorous logic of dissuasion and determination. In any  event, the chosen path is paved with many stumbling blocks and  serious uncertainties.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A few minutes ago President Arpad Goncz gave a  statement to Hungarian Television. Here is our recording of it.    [Begin Goncz recording] [passage omitted] I am very glad  that  the election has taken place so smoothly, I almost dare to say,  in a cheerful manner. [passage omitted] I am very glad that the  voters' participation in terms of the national average has been  so high. This matches the best European standards. So the  anxiety that Hungary has become apathetic and that Hungary has  lost interest in its own fate has proved groundless. [passage  omitted]    I will probably await the outcome of the next round of the  elections with greater excitement. [passage omitted] If there  is anything I can ask from the country and the parties, it is  that after all this they should not turn sour the beauty and  smoothness of this with a negative campaign or by mud-slinging  or with anything else. I do not believe that the essence could  be changed, it would only leave a bitter taste in our mouth, in  the mouth of the Hungarian electorate -- and there is no need  for that whatsoever.

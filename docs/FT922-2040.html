			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Enso-Gutzeit FM76m in the red in spite of sales gain ENSO-Gutzeit, the Finnish pulp and paper group, has returned a FM76m loss (after financial items) for the first four months of the year, compared with a FM182m (Dollars 42.4m) loss for the same period of 1991, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. Net sales went up by 9.3 per cent to FM3.36bn. The company said internal rationalisation measures would ensure a continuing revival towards profitability, but operations would still be showing a loss by the end of the year. Mr Jukka Harmala said competition had kept prices down, particularly for fine papers and publication papers, while the paperboard market was stable and demand for Scandinavian sawn timber increased.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Paris bourse suspends MMB shares MMB, the holding company which has been clouded by controversy over its attempts to merge its Matra defence electronics and Hachette publishing interests, yesterday saw its shares suspended on the Paris stock market. The Societes des Bourses Francaises (SBF), which runs the Paris markets, said that MMB's shares would be suspended until tomorrow because of 'disorderly movements' in the price over the past few days. Shares were suspended at Tuesday's closing price of FFr92 (Dollars 18.43). The suspension comes at a time when MMB is in the final stages of completing the merger between Matra and Hachette. It comes shortly after news that Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications group, is investing FFr1.36bn in Matra's telecommunications division, and was negotiating to take a stake in the new merged group. Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the chairman of Matra and Hachette whose family controls MMB, has come under fierce criticism for his plan to merge the two companies because of the apparent incompatibility of their interests. The merger will include combining some central administrative areas to cut corporate costs. Mr Lagardere's plan has been seen as particularly sensitive given Hachette's recent financial problems following the collapse of La Cinq, the French TV company. Hachette recently secured shareholder approval for a FFr2.8bn recapitalisation package to reduce its debt and restructure its finances before the merger with Matra. However, the suspension comes while Mr Lagardere is negotiating with prospective shareholders over the scale and cost of their potential investment in the merged group.</p>

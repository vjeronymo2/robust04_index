			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, MSRB believes that the proposed rule change will facilitate clearance and settlement of municipal securities and, therefore, is consistent with the provisions of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSRB does not believe that the rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because it will apply equally to all brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

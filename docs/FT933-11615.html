			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices rise as Iraq fears fade SOME STRENGTH returned to the oil market yesterday with North Sea Brent crude for September delivery rising 27 cents to Dollars 17.08 a barrel. Traders said that prices had begun to recover from recent weakness on suggestions that the Iraqi government's oil export talks with the United Nations could be put off until September. Iraq had been talking about a limited return to the export market with a sale of Dollars 1.6bn-worth of oil spread over 6 months. But it now appears that Saddam Hussein is pressing for a full lifting of UN oil sanctions, which could take months to negotiate. 'OK, the fundamentals are not that great, but we've still come off Dollars 2.50 a barrel on the back of the Iraqi oil threat and it's now creeping back up,' said one trader yesterday. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries remains in disarray over the low oil price and over-production by some members. An emergency meeting has been put off indefinitely , but with the imminent threat of Iraq's return removed, the organisation has less need to meet. Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at UBS, says the supply-demand balance is not that bad: 'Certainly not as bad as represented by the weak oil prices of the last couple of weeks'. Industry stocks are not especially high for the time of year, Mr Pyne asserts, but some refiners have been building stocks more quickly than usual in the past month.</p>

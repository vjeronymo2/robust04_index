Denny] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg March 13 SAPA -- The African National  Congress [ANC] has welcomed the appointment of former  Bophuthatswana Ambassador Professor Tjaart van der Walt as  administrator of the strife-torn homeland.    Congratulating the Batswana for their "courageous struggle  against the brutal Mangope regime," the ANC said in a statement  on Sunday [13 March] the homeland's residents could now engage  in free political activity and next month's election. "We urge  all to exercise this hard won right in a peaceful and orderly  manner," the statement said.    It condemned the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner  Resistance Movement] and other white rightwingers who had tried  to keep President Lucas Mangope's government in power. "Their  efforts were doomed from the start and turned out to be a  pathetic and dismal failure. Many died because of their brutal  and blundering thuggery -- including some in their own ranks --  and many more sustained serious injuries. We hope that  rightwingers, who have in the past so easily threatened  violence, will now finally realise that war is no solution," the  statement said.    Now was the time for all democrats to take hands and ensure  that every South African voted next month without fear of  violence or intimidation.</p>

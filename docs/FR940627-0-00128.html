			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The baseline gasoline group is restricted to formulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are derived from conventional petroleum sources. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasolines derived from synthetic crude oils are excluded from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline category. Synthetic crude oils can be prepared from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coal, shale and tar sands, heavy oil deposits, and other non-conventional petroleum sources. Compared to petroleum, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> synthetic crude oils must be extensively upgraded before they can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be refined into useful products. Because of the nature of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources, these synthetic products are likely to contain a variety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of unknown contaminants with unknown health effects. With little  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific data currently available on their composition, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that separate non-baseline classifications are most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for grouping these products. Gasoline formulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived from a particular synthetic crude oil source (e.g., coal)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be permitted to group together. The representative of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such group will be the first such product to seek registration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diesel.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Diesel formulations are defined as those containing more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 50 percent diesel by volume. The sulfur content for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel formulations in the diesel fuel family is limited to 0.05  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent by weight, based on current EPA limits (55 FR 34120).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The diesel fuel family includes both diesel  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1 and diesel  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2 formulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As originally proposed, the diesel baseline category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes diesel formulations containing no elements in addition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur. Baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel formulations must also possess, at the time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture, all the physical and chemical properties of a diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel as specified in the latest version of ASTM standard D 975.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oxygen content of baseline diesel formulations must be less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.0 percent by weight. The baseline diesel category includes all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel fuels that meet the above criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The diesel baseline definition is consistent with existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information in EPA's F/FA registration data base, which indicates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that most commercial diesel fuels, including their bulk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives, consist of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfur. While some currently registered diesel fuels contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives with additional elements, the objectives of the testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program are inconsistent with broadening the diesel baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition to include other elements with potentially different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health effects from those of basic diesel formulations. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broader baseline definition would mean that the atypical diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FAs would not be separately examined. Limiting baseline diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FAs to those containing no elements in addition to carbon,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur ensures the conduct of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate health effects evaluations for the emissions of diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulations containing atypical elements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similar to baseline gasoline, the baseline diesel category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excludes fuels derived from synthetic crude oil sources. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such formulations are included in the non-baseline category of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the diesel family. The non-baseline diesel category also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes diesel formulations with 1.0 percent or more oxygen by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight. Examples of non-baseline diesel formulations are alcohol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blends and biodiesel formulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Methanol.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F/FAs in the methanol fuel family are defined as those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing at least 50 percent methanol by volume. The baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methanol category is comprised of methanol and methanol-gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FAs that: (1) Contain at least 50 percent methanol by volume,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) contain no more than 4 percent by volume of substances other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than methanol and gasoline, and (3) contain no elements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chlorine. The sulfur content of baseline methanol formulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is limited to 0.004 percent by weight. Chlorine (as chloride) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to no more than 0.0001 percent by weight. Chlorine is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed in methanol baseline formulations because it is a common  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminant remaining from methanol production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The baseline methanol category includes all methanol fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the above criteria and is divided into two groups: M100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group and M85 group. The M100 group includes methanol-gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulations containing at least 96 percent methanol by volume,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while the M85 group consists of methanol formulations containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50&hyph;95 percent methanol by volume.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FAs within the baseline M100 group are required to contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> odorants and bitterants. These formulations should have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinctive and noxious taste, for purposes of preventing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposeful or inadvertent human consumption. The elemental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composition of the odorant and bitterant is limited to carbon,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine. Baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methanol formulations in the M85 group must comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elemental composition specified above for all baseline methanol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FAs, but need not have added odorants and bitterants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The non-baseline methanol category is comprised of methanol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulations (i.e., containing at least 50 percent methanol by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume) that meet the baseline limits on elemental composition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but contain more than 4 percent by volume of substances other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than methanol and gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Atypical methanol F/FAs contain elements in addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those allowed in the baseline methanol category or exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified limits for sulfur or chlorine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SPECULATION GROWING THAT FED MAY LOWER INTEREST RATES  </P> <P> The runaway dollar paused for breath Tuesday as the Bush Administration  reaffirmed its pledge to keep exchange rates steady and speculation emerged  that the Federal Reserve might soon start to lower interest rates.  </P> <P> A day after the White House expressed concern that the surging dollar could  damage U.S. trade prospects, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said  Washington was committed to working closely with its allies on economic policy  and exchange rates.  </P> <P> "I think it's important that the major industrial democracies of the world  continue to work to coordinate their economic policies," Baker said. "It's  really the coordination of those underlying economic policies that's going to  make a difference in terms of exchange rate stability."  </P> <P> Bush's chief economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, also sought to end  speculation that the Administration was willing to tolerate a stronger dollar,  which reached a 29-month high against the West German mark this week.  </P> <P> "The Administration has not changed its policy," Boskin told reporters.  </P> <P> Although a firmer dollar dampens inflationary pressure by making imports  cheaper, Fed and Treasury officials are worried that progress made in the past  two years toward closing the U.S. trade gap will grind to a halt if the dollar  continues to "misbehave," as one senior central banker put it.  </P> <P> Top Administration officials, including the President and Treasury Secretary  Nicholas F. Brady, have been cajoling Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to lower  interest rates virtually since the day the President took office Jan. 20.  </P> <P> But Greenspan resisted and continued to push rates higher until February to  curb inflation. An Administration official said the seven-member Fed board of  governors is now more willing to think about easing its tight grip on credit.  </P> <P> However, the Fed's action in draining cash from the banking system this week  and recent comments by Fed officials suggest that any relaxation in the period  ahead will be cautious.  </P> <P> "Inflation isn't dead," Fed governor H. Robert Heller said Tuesday. "Inflation  is still a key factor to be considered in monetary policy-making. You don't  want to declare victory all too soon," he told the National Economists Club.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Doubt About Interest Rates  </P> <P> "You've got to proceed in a prudent fashion," Heller said when asked whether it  was time to ease monetary policy.  </P> <P> Fellow governor Wayne Angell, in an interview with the Washington Post  published Friday, appeared to rule out any easing of interest rates to rein in  the dollar.  </P> <P> Asked whether the United States and other leading industrial countries should  launch an aggressive policy to bring down the dollar, Angell said, "I can't  imagine anything that would be more fraught with potential disaster for the  world's financial system."  </P> <P> David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said he  doubted that the Fed would loosen its grip on credit, especially after  Tuesday's surprisingly large 2.9% rise in durable goods orders for April.  </P> <P> He thinks that growth has slowed only modestly from last year's 3.9% pace,  perhaps to the 2.5% to 3.0% range.  </P> <P> "I can't believe in light of the durable goods orders that they'll want to ease  unless the dollar skyrockets," Hale said.  </P> <P> By contrast, Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York believes that  the Fed has already begun to let interest rates drift lower to prevent the  increasingly evident slowdown in consumer buying from killing the 6 1/2-year  expansion.  </P> <P> "There has to be a real fear on their part of overdoing it and dumping us into  a recession," Slifer said.  </P> <P> He said the federal funds rate, the overnight lending rate among banks that  influences the cost of money throughout the economy, is likely to edge down by  about five basis points, or hundredths of a percent, a week for the next month.  </P> <P> "It'll be a very slow, gradual move," Slifer said.  </P> <P> Fed funds averaged 9.75% last week, down from 9.86% the week before and the  first time in several months that it had dropped below 9.80%.  </P></p>

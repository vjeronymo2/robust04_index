			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: DON'T BET ON JUST ONE HORSE IN THIS RACE  </P> <P> With Houston's oil-driven economy collapsing all around him in 1984,  restaurateur Bob Borochoff was determined to survive. He bought and sold eight  restaurants while times were tough but realized that he needed a long-term  solution.  </P> <P> So, in addition to his Boston Sea Party Restaurant, he set up Epic Catering to  keep his chefs and kitchens busy during slow times and created Epic Special  Events to stage celebrations.  </P> <P> By taking the people and equipment he already had and deploying them in new  ways, Borochoff has built a thriving, three-part small business.  </P> <P> "I'm absolutely convinced every small business can diversify," he said.  "Everyone who survived the Texas oil bust did it by diversifying."  </P> <P> Small-business owners around the country should consider diversifying into new  product lines or services as America girds for an economic slowdown. The secret  is to make changes without having to spend a lot of money or add new employees.  </P> <P> "Now is the time to look at your strategic plan and see if it still makes  sense," said Anthony Radaich, partner in charge of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.'s  enterprise group in Woodland Hills. He suggests that business owners assess  their companies' strengths and weaknesses and figure out the best way to  capitalize on their strengths.  </P> <P> For example, Radaich said, a client with a metal plating business boosted sales  by setting up a second shift to do contract plating jobs for other firms.  </P> <P> About a year ago, Camarillo-based California Amplifier realized that its  dependence on military orders for its microwave amplifiers was hindering  growth.  </P> <P> "When it became obvious the government business wasn't going to help us grow,  we refocused our efforts into what was a small part of our business -- the  commercial sector," said Barry Hall, chairman and chief executive of the public  firm, which had sales last year of $11 million and employs about 130.  </P> <P> "Business people have to accept the fact that while they made money one way in  the past, it won't be the same in the future," Hall said.  </P> <P> Based on the success of the diversification, California Amplifier recently sold  its military products division to focus entirely on providing equipment to  satellite dish manufacturers and television stations. And, Hall said, the  company has turned around the quarterly loss it suffered a year ago, and this  quarter is showing a modest profit.  </P> <P> "A manufacturer has to make sure he has taken all the juice out of his  products," advises Pamela Roth, president of P. J. Roth &amp; Associates in Los  Angeles. "You should see if the products you make could be changed slightly to  appeal to a broader market."  </P> <P> Roth, a marketing consultant, has helped several small businesses turn around  through diversification. One firm, which produced cosmetics for Latinas,  broadened its advertising campaign and product literature to appeal to women of  different ethnic types.  </P> <P> "We made the change with little or no investment after identifying a larger  market for the products," Roth said.  </P> <P> "Small-business owners selling things over the counter should also look into  selling them in catalogues or through direct mail," said Roth. "You have to  think broadly today because target marketing can kill you."  </P> <P> Arthur Andersen's Radaich also recommends looking at your equipment and  vehicles to see how they can be better used. For example, if you are sending  your products out on trucks all day, maybe you can haul another company's  products back to your city at night.  </P> <P> If you have a machine shop, why not ask fellow business owners if you can do  any work for them? In the same vein, see if you can send a part of your work  out to others so you don't have to buy expensive new pieces of equipment.  </P> <P> And, if possible, seek out other business owners to perform tasks for you, so  you don't have to hire new people.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DIVERSIFYING YOUR BUSINESS  </P> <P> * Revise your business plan to prepare for an economic slowdown.  </P> <P> * Look at new or different uses for your equipment, vehicles, buildings, etc.  </P> <P> * Ask your customers what new services or products you could provide to them.  </P> <P> * Cut costs by farming out projects to other small businesses.  </P> <P> * Discuss new business possibilities with your vendors or suppliers.  </P> <P> * Consider what other consumers could use your products.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, April 9 (AFP)--Some 5,000 demonstrators  took to the streets here Saturday to call on the country's  president and prime minister to quit, and for fresh elections.    The demonstration was called by opposition parties, the  conservative Popular Party and the extreme right-wing Slovene  National Party, which accuse President Milan Kucan and Prime  Minister Janez Drnovsek of following communist policies.    Many Slovenians are also angry at the dismissal two weeks  ago  of the country's independence hero and Social Democratic leader  Janez Jansa from the post of defence minister by the coalition  government.    Jansa addressed the crowds saying he would soon return to  power, calling on all opposition groups to support him.    The only government representative to take the stand was  Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle, who was booed by the protestors  when he called for a "fight against corruption, but only through  democratic and legal means." The demonstrators later dispersed  peacefully.</p>

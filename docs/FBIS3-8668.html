			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Stefan Grubac] </F>   [Excerpts] Had those who started the war in the former  Yugoslavia cared about peace, it would have been accomplished  relatively quickly and, above all, naturally by offering a just  peace and by treating all the warring sides equally. However,  because the interests of the big and powerful come before the  interests of those whom the war directly affects, the big and  powerful pursue their policy not in the interest of those who  are affected by the war but to their own benefit.    We recently had a chance to see what kind of interests are  intertwined here from a seemly banal fact. Namely, Saudi Arabia  purchased from the United States $6 billion worth of new  aircraft for its aircraft carrier. High-level Saudi officials  signaled to the Europeans that they have not done enough for the  Muslims in Bosnia. France--which wanted to--failed in striking  a deal to sell its own aircraft. In place of such a reprimand,  the United States was rewarded with an enormous financial deal  in which President Clinton was personally engaged. By the way,  Saudi Arabia is an Islamic country that financially assists the  Bosnian Muslims the most.    Let us now reexamine the relations between the Unites States  and Western Europe and the United States and Russia. These  relations are also being mutually reexamined and reshaped  precisely on the issue of the war in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has transpired that Western Europe--that  is, the European Union--for a long time failed to contribute  toward a solution for the Balkan war zone. Therefore, the  United States has taken the initiative, more to demonstrate to  the European Union that it is not capable of resolving such a  problem than to actually solve the problem, and even less to  solve it justly. The political message is clear. Europe is not  capable of resolving such conflicts by itself and the presence  of the United States is inevitable. [passage omitted]    Speaking about the sanctions, let us recall that Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic in a meeting with Greek diplomacy  chief Karolos Papoulias actually sent a message to the European  Union saying that it has a great political obligation to abolish  the sanctions against FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia],  keeping in mind that the Serbian side had accepted its peace  plan, a component of which is also an abolition of the embargo.  Prolongation of the sanctions against our country encourages  precisely those forces that aspire to accomplish their goals by  war, the Serbian president emphasized.    As the time is advancing, there is less belief in the  Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia, as well as a confederation  of this federation and Croatia. Does this not mean that instead  of a practical step toward peace, an illusion has been created  among the international public that the United States is trying  to do something--that is, paving the way to force the Serbian  side, primarily politically but if possible also militarily,  into new territorial concessions. There are increasingly more  facts that suggest that this is the true aim of this agreement.  Izetbegovic says he would need 60 percent of the territory. The  international media assess that the Muslim side would be  satisfied with 50 percent or even less territory of the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. In any case, Izetbegovic has doubled his  tactics to accomplish this goal. He is faking political  cooperativeness in front of the world, as instructed by his  tutors, but simultaneously does not hide new military offensive  actions against the Serbian positions.    On the other hand, Croatian President Tudjman in his  apparent  cooperativeness wants to take advantage of the expiry of yet  another United Nations Protection Force mandate for new threats  and not only that to the republic of Serbian Krajina.    Regardless of everything, it is increasingly more difficult  for the international public to invent endless lies about what  is happening in the former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]</p>

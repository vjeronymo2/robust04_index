			<p>BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], has said he would speak to President of the  Republic Joaquim Chissano so that his organization may be  included in future talks between the Mozambican Government and  Malawian authorities on the issue of the Malawi Young Pioneers  who entered Mozambique. Dhlakama said only then will Renamo be  able to explain that the movement is not harboring any Malawian  Young Pioneers. The Renamo leader was speaking at a news  conference on his return from Malawi yesterday. Earlier the  Renamo leader was in South Africa, where he attended the  inauguration of President Nelson Mandela. Dhlakama held talks in  Lilongwe with Malawian Government officials on the issue of  Malawi Young Pioneers who entered Mozambique some six months ago.</p>

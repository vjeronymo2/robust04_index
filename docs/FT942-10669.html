			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Civil war threatens Yemen oil industry: Companies are disillusioned over prospects Yemen's civil war, which has prompted the emergency evacuation of most foreign oil company expatriates, threatens to deliver a serious blow to an industry long seen as central to the country's economic prospects, oil executives suggested yesterday. As BP, Shell, Lasmo, Clyde, British Gas and other western oil groups yesterday completed staff evacuation from Sanaa in the north and Aden in the south, executives at many company headquarters said that, whatever the outcome of the fighting, there was a growing disillusionment about oil prospects in the country. A large number of foreign countries entered into exploration contracts with Yemen after its unification in 1990. Optimism peaked two years ago, when more than 20 companies rushed to conclude exploration deals. These were mostly in the south, after Canadian Occidental discovered viable fields in the Masila area, the north-west corner of former South Yemen. CanOxy says it is now pumping 150,000 barrels a day from the area, production which the company says will continue despite evacuation of its staff. CanOxy's find followed the discoveries in the mid-1980s by Hunt Oil, the Dallas-based group, in North Yemen. Yemen Hunt Oil produces most of the rest of Yemen's present output, about 320,000 b/d. It has also said production is continuing. Despite heady predictions from the government and some analysts that Yemen might eventually be capable of producing 1m or even 2m b/d, Yemen's rugged south has failed to deliver its apparent promise. 'There's been a very significant spate of drilling,' says the head of one western oil group active there. 'But the results have been singularly disappointing.' Another oil company managing director said the war might prompt many disappointed companies to pull out: 'It's now likely, particularly with this setback, that Yemen will be left only with Hunt and CanOxy.' At least two companies, who declioned to be named, said yesterday they expected to close their operations before the end of this year, given their disappointing results and the country's heightened political instability. CanOxy, which is continuing to explore around Masila, has already scaled down any expectations of further big finds. Shell, which has completed drilling in its concession, would say only that it would 'need to look at where we go from here'. Clyde, the UK-based oil company, said yesterday it had received 'some encouragement' from early drilling in its Masila concession and had no intention of leaving. Nevertheless, diminished prospects for Yemeni oil are a serious blow to whatever political arrangement arises from the fighting in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest and most populous land. It perhaps most seriously undermines the economic hand of Mr Ali Salem al-Beidh, the embattled southern leader, who would have depended heavily on oil to support any form of greater economic independence for the south. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh yesterday sacked Prime Minister Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas and named a new defence minister in further measures against rival southern members in Yemen's cabinet, Reuter adds from Sanaa. Mr Saleh named Mohammad al-Attar, industry minister, as acting prime minister and Brig Abed Rabu Hadi as defence minister.</p>

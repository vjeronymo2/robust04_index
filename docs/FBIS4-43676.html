			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federation of German Chambers of  Industry and Commerce [DIHT] has called on the Federal  Government to urge the European Union [EU] to be less wasteful.  "The time for making excessive demands is over," the DIHT  stated on Monday [20 June] in Bonn. "What we now need are  consistent planning of tasks, an economic budget policy, and  efficient spending control. This must go hand in hand with the  strengthening of the market forces and of competition in  Europe." Centralism and overregulation must be counteracted.    From the German EU presidency -- from 1 July to 31 December  1994 -- the DIHT expects a stronger coordination of the economic  and financial policy of the EU member states and clearer  prospects for the Central and East European reformist states.  "After the accession of Austria and the Scandinavian countries,  the community needs some respite," the DIHT stated.    Nevertheless, the reformist states need a concrete long-term  perspective for the time up to their accession to the EU. They  must be granted room to adapt to competition and the level of  integration in the EU. Excessive hopes regarding the time of  accession have to be avoided. The most promising help is the  opening of the markets. "Free trade will make it easier for the  reformist states to make the necessary changes of their  production structures, promote privatization, thus supporting  the introduction of the market economy system," the DIHT argued.    It must be prevented, under all circumstances, that the  convergence criteria, which were agreed for the third stage of  European monetary union, are watered down. The stability of the  monetary value must not be put at risk. "Quality is more  important than sticking to the calendar," the DIHT said with  reference to the set date for monetary union, 1999.    Moreover, the DIHT called on the Federal Government to fight  for the speedy elimination of the transitional solution  regarding the value-added tax [VAT]. The transition from the  principle of country of destination to that of country of origin  would be a sign for a real European single market. For the  economy it is important to treat deliveries to other EU  countries in the same way as domestic transactions as far as  taxes are concerned. For the consumers there would be no  changes, because since the beginning of 1993 they have always  had to pay VAT rate of the EU country in which they bought and  can no longer claim any possible difference to the lower German  VAT at the border.</p>

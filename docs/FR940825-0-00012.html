			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule will allow fresh litchi to be imported into the United States from Taiwan under certain conditions. Taiwan produces approximately 217 million pounds of litchi annually. In 1993, Taiwan exported close to 15.5 million pounds of fresh litchi, mainly to Hong Kong, Canada, Japan, the Philippines, and Singapore. Exports increased substantially from 1992, when Taiwan exported only 6.6 million pounds of fresh litchi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  APHIS anticipates that Taiwan could export as much as 21,000 pounds of fresh litchi into the United States in 1995; this would constitute only about 19.6 percent of current total imports of fresh litchi, 3.1 percent of current domestic production, and 2.6 percent of current total litchi supply in the United States. If imports of fresh litchi from Taiwan remain at such small percentages of domestic production and total supply, the economic impact on domestic growers will not be significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  However, if imports increase to a level comparable to those of other importing countries (listed above), domestic growers will be impacted significantly; the amount of fresh litchi imported from Taiwan could exceed the amount produced domestically and prices could subsequently decline drastically as a result of the increased supply. Consumers, however, would benefit from the decreased price and the enhanced access to fresh litchi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The aggregate economic impact of this rule is expected to be positive. U.S. consumers will benefit from a greater availability of fruits and vegetables. U.S. importers will also benefit from a greater availability of fruits and vegetables to import. It is not likely that any U.S. fruit and vegetable producers or other small entities will be affected in a significant economic way by the easing of importation restrictions on these particular commodities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In the course of rulemaking, had we come across evidence indicating that importation of any of the concerned fruits or vegetables would pose a significant risk of plant pest introduction, we would have considered either developing alternative requirements regarding that importation or continuing to prohibit the importation of that fruit or vegetable. However, our initial pest risk assessments and our review of public comments on the proposal indicated that importation of any of the concerned fruit and vegetables would pose an insignificant risk of plant pest introduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule allows certain fruits and vegetables to be imported into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States from certain parts of the world. State and local laws and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations regarding the importation of fruits and vegetables under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule will be preempted while the fruits and vegetables are in foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce. Fresh fruits and vegetables are generally imported for immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution and sale to the consuming public, and will remain in foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce ceases in other cases must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. No  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retroactive effect will be given to this rule, and this rule will not require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared for this rule. The assessment provides a basis for the conclusion that the importation of fruits and vegetables under the conditions specified in this rule will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating plant pests and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on the finding of no significant impact, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmental impact statement need not be prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact were prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272&hyph;51274, August 31, 1979).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact are available for public inspection at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays.

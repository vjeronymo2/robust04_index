			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Hafnia withdraws Baltica share offer HAFNIA, the Danish insurance-based financial services group, has withdrawn a standing offer to buy any new shares issued by its domestic rival, Baltica, at DKr1,000 (Dollars 156.25) each. Hafnia gave no explanation for withdrawing the offer, which was first made in 1990 as part of an unsuccessful attempt by it to gain control of Baltica. Analysts, however, said Hafnia probably withdrew because its finances would come under excessive strain if Baltica made an issue and Hafnia had to make good its offer. Hafnia has bought a substantial bloc of shares in Sweden's Skandia as part of an attempt, with Norway's UNI Storebrand, to gain control of Skandia and establish a Nordic insurance giant. The two challengers have received a somewhat sceptical reception from Skandia, although they held further talks on Wednesday. Baltica Holding, meanwhile, reported a DKr271m (Dollars 42.3m) net profit compared with a DKr2.04bn loss in 1990. Last year's result was a return on capital of 3.0 per cent. An unchanged DKr8 per share dividend was proposed. Life assurance profits rose from DKr199m to DKr466m and accident group profits from DKr225m to DKr277m. Baltica Bank, however, made a DKr334m loss as a result of large provisions on property engagements. It required a capital injection from the parent company. Premium income in Danica, the life group formed following Baltica's acquisition of the state life assurance and pension company, Statsanstalten, increased from DKr1.17bn to DKr4.35bn. Accident group premiums increased from DKr4.09bn to DKr4.91bn. Baltica said it would not this year achieve its target of a market rate of return on its equity capital.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Strike disrupts American Airlines FLIGHTS operated by American Airlines, the second biggest US carrier, were severely disrupted yesterday as the airline's flight attendants started an 11-day strike over changes in working conditions. The company kept most services running with the help of non-striking attendants and employees seconded from other duties. But at least 40 per cent of flights from its Dallas/Fort Worth hub had to leave without passengers because of crew shortages. Other carriers took passengers to their destinations. The flight attendants' union, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, has called out its 21,000 members at American Airlines following the breakdown of talks on new labour contracts. The company is seeking to cut costs by reducing staffing levels on some flights and changing holiday and pension arrangements. In return, it is increasing the attendants' pay by amounts averaging 7.8 per cent a year for the next four years. The flight attendants' union says the changes in conditions are unacceptable. American Airlines believes it can ride out the dispute and has told strikers that they will lose their jobs. Yesterday it announced it had started recruiting new flight attendants at Forth Worth and would shortly start doing so in 30 other cities. The dispute is casting a cloud over attempts by the beleaguered US airline industry to restore profitability by securing employees' agreement to cuts in labour costs. All the large carriers are under pressure to change working practices because of the entry into the domestic market of rapidly-expanding carriers like Southwest Airlines which operate at far higher levels of productivity.</p>

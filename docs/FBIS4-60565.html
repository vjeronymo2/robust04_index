			<p>BFN     [Text] Brothers 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, deputy  chairman of the Presidential Council, and Anis Hasan Yahya,  chairman of the Provisional Assembly for National Salvation,  have issued a press statement to the YEMENI NEWS AGENCY, in  which they said: Over recent days a number of Western and  foreign media have reported on efforts to bring about a  cease-fire in Yemen. Inasmuch as the institutions of state in  the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] are responsible for such  matters, we, on the basis of the firm positions we have adopted  in rejecting the war, and our decision to enter a defensive  battle to foil this treacherous attack, declare to our great  Yemeni people and to all local, Arab, and international  quarters, that the solution to the existing crisis -- which was  transformed by the rulers of Sanaa into a destructive war -- can  only be achieved through the following:    1. A final ending of the war and the withdrawal of all  attacking forces to the positions they occupied prior to 22 May  1990.    2. The immediate beginning of negotiations -- without  pre-conditions and under the auspices of the Arab League -- this  arising out of a desire to arrive at a peaceful solution within  the Arab framework, so that further bloodshed and general  destruction can be halted, and to prevent a resumption of  fighting, thus guaranteeing peace and stability in Yemen, the  Arabian Peninsula, and the Arab world.    Our position constitutes proof of our continued responsible,  patriotic concern. We have mobilized for the sake of the  homeland, and we have made sacrifices along this path. At this  moment we continue to pay the price for rejecting the war. We  are eager to stop the shedding of Yemeni blood, which is being  shed with impunity and unjustly, only to serve the insane  purposes of those who began this war.</p>

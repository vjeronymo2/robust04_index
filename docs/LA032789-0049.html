			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> In its first official act, Sudan's new coalition Cabinet endorsed a tentative  peace agreement with southern rebels that calls for an immediate cease-fire in  the country's six-year civil war. The peace plan also calls for an end to the  state of emergency in force since 1985 and the suspension of plans to introduce  Islamic law until a national constitutional conference can be held. The rebels  negotiated the agreement in November with the centrist Democratic Unionist  Party, then the senior partner in Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's Cabinet.  Parliament, however, rejected the plan. Mahdi subsequently agreed to form a  more broadly based government and to pursue peace talks with the rebels.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPRINT IS LATEST FIRM TO DO DEAL WITH EAST BLOC;  </P> <P> PHONES: ANTIQUATED COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS REPRESENT A GROWING MARKET FOR U.S.  COMPANIES.  </P> <P> A growing number of American telecommunications companies, seeking lucrative  opportunities to modernize the East Bloc's antiquated phone networks, have  managed to thrust their feet behind the newly parted Iron Curtain.  </P> <P> US Sprint has become the latest to do so. On Wednesday, the nation's  third-largest long-distance carrier said it signed a preliminary agreement to  form a pioneering joint venture with two Soviet agencies. The new company,  Telenet U.S.S.R., will provide high-speed data and other telecommunications  services within the Soviet Union, perhaps by year end.  </P> <P> "As the perestroika process unfolds and economic bridges between East and West  are built, modern telecommunications will become even more important," Paolo  Guidi, president of Sprint International, said in announcing the agreement in  Washington. Sprint International, formed in January from US Sprint's  international and data network operations, now provides international voice,  data and video-conferencing services and products for US Sprint, based in  Kansas City.  </P> <P> US Sprint also announced Wednesday that it will take part in a new fiber-optic  cable project linking Japan, China, Hong Kong and Singapore.  </P> <P> US Sprint will not be alone among American firms in the Soviet Union. US West,  one of the seven Baby Bell regional phone firms, already has signed on to play  a leading role in an international consortium that will build a $500-million  fiber-optic cable across the Soviet Union. That venture, the Trans-Soviet Line  Development Corp., will provide a new high-speed link between Europe and Asia  via Moscow and Vladivostok.  </P> <P> Moreover, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph has proposed tripling existing  calling capacity between the United States and the Soviet Union by using  channels on the Soviet Intersputnik satellite system. AT&amp;T also recently  acquired Istel, a British information company, as part of an announced goal to  generate 20% of its revenue overseas within five years. Among its targets for  equipment sales are the East Bloc and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Meanwhile US West and several other Baby Bells have been "very aggressive" in  penetrating East Bloc nations, said Mark Lowenstein, telecommunications analyst  for Yankee Group in Boston. US West expects to start work this spring on a  cellular phone system for Hungary. Chicago-based Ameritech, another Baby Bell,  is discussing a similar cellular project with Polish authorities, Lowenstein  said.  </P> <P> Pacific Telesis of San Francisco and a consortium of British, French and German  organizations in December won the right to provide mobile telephone service in  West Germany, which is about to begin unification talks with East Germany,  where only 16% of households have telephones and more than 1 million  applications for service are awaiting resolution.  </P> <P> "The potential (market) is practically limitless," Lowenstein said.  </P> <P> Among the obstacles these ventures must overcome, however, are restrictions on  sales of electronic and telecommunications equipment to the Soviet Union and  East Bloc countries. But the Bush Administration and NATO countries already are  considering easing these restrictions, prodded by requests from the new  governments of Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> In announcing its new venture on Wednesday, US Sprint said its partners are  Central Telegraph, an agency of the Soviet Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications that provides international and intercity public telex,  telegram and low-speed data communications services within the Soviet Union,  and the Institute of Electronics and Computer Science of the Latvian Academy of  Sciences. The institute specializes in computer networking technology.  </P> <P> Sprint International's Guidi also announced that the company will participate  in planning construction of a 4,500-mile undersea cable linking Japan, China,  Hong Kong and Singapore. The fiber-optic link will tie in with a new  transpacific cable that Sprint owns with Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless.  </P> <P> Another cable covering the same area is expected to begin service this year,  but current estimates indicate that it will reach capacity by 1993, when the  second cable is expected to be ready, Sprint said.  </P></p>

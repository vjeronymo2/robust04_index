			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2-YEAR-OLD CONSERVANCY BECOMES WHITTIER'S MOST VOCAL ADVERSARY  </P> <P> The bumper sticker on Helen Rahder's car puts it quite plainly: "Think  Globally, Act Locally."  </P> <P> And for two years Rahder and other vocal members of the Whittier Conservancy  have followed that motto with fervor and determination.  </P> <P> The preservationist organization virtually arose from the rubble of the Oct. 1,  1987, earthquake, holding its first meeting within a week to plan a march and  other efforts to pressure the city to preserve historic buildings that were  badly damaged. As more and more buildings were demolished, more residents  joined the conservancy.  </P> <P> Today, the group, which claims to have a core of 30 members and a mailing list  of 700, is the most vocal residents' organization in Whittier.  </P> <P> The conservancy's form of activism is often controversial and eyebrow-raising.  Rahder, who displays a biting wit, has no qualms about lashing out at city  officials. "They would bulldoze all the historic buildings and put up ugly  pink-stucco apartments, and then we would look like Orange County," Rahder, the  group's issues coordinator and a founder, said in a recent interview.  </P> <P> When an important issue concerning historic preservation is before the City  Council, members inundate city officials with letters voicing their opinions.  The group has no problem packing a City Council meeting.  </P> <P> In addition, the group's core members, which include several lawyers,  archeologists and historians, are well-versed on the state laws and local  zoning codes, forcing city officials to take notice of what they are saying.  The conservancy has sued the city twice, and won both times, in efforts to save  two historic buildings damaged in the quake.  </P> <P> Some city officials cringe at the mention of the conservancy. Privately, they  sometimes describe members of the citizens' group as wild-eyed  preservationists. The irritation of council members at the conservancy members'  forceful, sometimes insulting demeanor is obvious at meetings. Officials roll  their eyes, tap their pens, look at the clock.  </P> <P> "Their methods are just not correct," Mayor Victor Lopez said. "They try to  mislead people; They say we don't care about the community."  </P> <P> Others offer more diplomatic assessments. They say public comments are  important to city government. Some city officials say they realize that the  group will continue to be a vocal -- and important -- force in the community,  which for years was without such activism.  </P> <P> "They are very eloquent," Councilman Myron Claxton said. "They have a real good  understanding of what's going on. The more interest in the community, the  better, even though we disagree on things."  </P> <P> The disagreements between members of the conservancy and city officials often  have centered on one thing: money.  </P> <P> Conservancy members believe the city has a responsibility to spend public money  to save the community's historic buildings.  </P> <P> "We are fighting to save the gradual denigration of Whittier," said John Smith,  the vice president of the conservancy. "The older people say they are feeling  robbed of their heritage. The young say they (city officials) are destroying  the thing that makes Whittier unique."  </P> <P> Rahder added: "California is a sea of stucco tract homes and mini-malls. But  Whittier is different. That's what we are trying to save. That's why we are  here."  </P> <P> City officials say they would like to accommodate the conservancy's desire to  save historic buildings, but the effort would cost too much.  </P> <P> "I recognize the importance of conservation," Claxton said. "But we've got to  be realistic about things. The city is just not made of money."  </P> <P> Recently the group lost two major battles, largely because of finances.  </P> <P> In September, the City Council voted against a proposal to reface the Harvey  Apartments, destroyed in the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake, with the original,  100-year-old bricks. To do so would have cost about $50,000, the project  architect told the council.  </P> <P> The city offered to come up with half the money if local preservationists came  up with the rest. When the conservationists failed to raise the money, the City  Council gave the architect permission to stucco the building, a less costly  method than using the bricks. The city then decided to use the bricks to build  other structures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vote Was Unanimous  </P> <P> On Tuesday night, the conservancy suffered a major setback when the City  Council voted unanimously to demolish the historic Whittier Theater, at  Whittier Boulevard and Hadley Street. Council members voted without comment,  but previously expressed concern over the cost of saving the theater.  </P> <P> The conservancy had obtained a court order two years ago stopping the city from  demolishing the historic film palace until an environmental impact report was  conducted. Conservancy officials said they will return to court in an effort to  stop the demolition.  </P> <P> Despite the two recent losses, the conservancy has accomplished much in the  past two years, city officials acknowledge.  </P> <P> The activists have been instrumental in persuading the city to allow only  single-family houses to be built in much of the Uptown area, where developers  were trying to demolish old, earthquake damaged homes and build apartment  complexes in their place.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Park Historic District  </P> <P> The conservancy also was influential in persuading the city to declare the area  around Central Park as a historic district. The homes there cannot be altered  without approval from the city.  </P> <P> In addition, the group has stressed the importance of conducting environmental  impact reports before the buildings are razed or new development started.  </P> <P> "We are not out to save every old brick and piece of wood in the city," Rahder  said. "What we are trying to save is our quality of life before someone rips it  out from under us.  </P> <P> "If we care enough about the local environment, it will have a domino effect on  the larger picture -- the state, national or global level. It all starts at  home."  </P></p>

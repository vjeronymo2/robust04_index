			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Midland However it dresses it up, the Hongkong Bank has difficulty making its bid for Midland look as attractive as the putative offer from Lloyds. An HSBC victory would produce a better capitalised bank than Lloyds combined with Midland. Restructuring costs would also be less than half. But the change of tax residence would require a special Pounds 200m tax provision and the eventual profits benefit would be only Pounds 300m a year compared with Pounds 700m in cost savings alone under the Lloyds plan. HSBC is at pains to argue that these figures are not necessarily comparable. Its assumptions on cost savings, in areas like information technology, do not include any benefit from Midland's continuing restructuring. That suggests several hundred branch closures and heavy job losses in the UK even if HSBC wins. The combined banks would generate about Pounds 150m in extra revenues. But however conservative, such forecasts cannot carry any absolute guarantee. Though Lloyds may lose some revenues from branch rationalisation, it stands to make a lot more by selling insurance through the Midland network. It would be extraordinary if HSBC made as much commercial sense as Lloyds as a partner for Midland. But since the competition authorities may render the comparison theoretical, the real question is whether HSBC makes a sensible case on its own. Its shareholders seem sceptical. HSBC fell over 3 per cent in an otherwise little changed Hong Kong market yesterday. The risks inherent in such a widely-spread conglomerate are high, while the forecast benefits from 1996 amount to only 14 per cent of last year's combined profits before provisions.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Management: Shaking off the heavy brigade - Christopher Lorenz argues that diversity is dying The phrase 'charge of the light brigade' has been associated in Britain for almost 140 years with a self-inflicted, but glorious military defeat in the Crimean War, when Lord Cardigan's cavalry rode out to capture the enemy's guns but was annihilated by them. In the future it could take on a more modern meaning: the outcome of ICI's bold decision yesterday to go ahead with its plan to de-merge into two. For, among other influences, the plan reflects the final triumph of decades of pressure from ICI's self-christened 'light brigade' to get out from under the resource-hungry weight of the company's bulk chemicals side and make a dash for growth in pharmaceuticals and elsewhere. By de-merging, ICI will expose Zeneca (pharmaceuticals and agro-chemicals) and the new ICI (bulk chemicals and paints) to the almost certain fire of stock market predators. But it will also put them under an unprecedented degree of market and managerial discipline. Whether the move results in victory or defeat, it will be seen by future business historians as in keeping with the times and entirely logical. In many senses it marks merely a further stride in a stampede of strategic revisionism which has gripped western industry over the past decade. The new orthodoxy argues: Cross-business 'synergies' of any kind - technological, marketing or any other - are far more elusive than was thought in the 1960s and 1970s. Diverse corporate portfolios are hard for stock markets to understand and value, and for executives to manage, especially in an era when most individual businesses are growing more global. The most effective way to create value for both the customer and the shareholder is therefore to substitute diversity with focus. There has also been a growing realisation that focus is not just a matter of concentrating on businesses in related product markets, technologies and geographic areas. As Hanson, BTR and other specialist conglomerates have shown, it is even more a matter of the managerial characteristics of those businesses, such as the relative maturity of their industry, their technology and marketing intensity, and their investment-time horizons. A set of businesses without similar managerial characteristics is difficult for the same company to 'parent' effectively. In the terminology formulated by Britain's Ashridge Strategic Management Centre, which is influential in this field, these principles apply to 'vertical parenting' - the relations between the group corporate centre and an individual business - and to 'horizontal parenting' - the centre's ability to foster synergies between the different businesses. Growing awareness of the importance of these various types of relatedness and focus has spurred the flood of divestments and the growing number of de-mergers. Companies have not just 'spun off' diversifications they made through acquisition, but which have failed. They have also divested businesses which they developed organically, but for which they are no longer a suitable 'parent'. One of the clearest examples of the second type - leaving aside stock market-driven de-mergers such as Racal's 1991 split with Vodafone - was the separation three years ago of the British Courtaulds combine into a chemicals and a textiles group. Martin Taylor, chief executive of the latter, points out not only that the shares of both companies have outperformed the stock market ever since, but that the split has enabled each management to concentrate more single-mindedly on its own industries. Which brings us back to ICI's 'light brigade'. For the best part of the last 40 years, this band of managers - especially those running pharmaceuticals, but also those at agro-chemicals, paints and some specialties - felt frustrated at the priority given to the heavy side by the ICI board, which until very recently was dominated by heavy chemicals people. Andrew Pettigrew, a Warwick University professor of strategic change who researched an acclaimed study of the company more than a decade ago, says: 'There's always been an atmosphere of great distance between pharma and heavy chemicals at ICI.' As long ago as the 1960s, he says, the 'light brigade' felt neglected and starved of funds. This attitude fermented through the 1970s and early 1980s, he recalls, as the internal power of the 'heavy brigade' persisted long past the point at which its side of the business was the more important in terms of profitability and growth potential. In the minds of the 'light brigade', the thinking behind the de-merger goes back to the mid-1970s, says Pettigrew. But only since the mid-1980s has its weight on the board been sufficient to give its view real force. It should be clear from the foregoing that the managerial logic behind ICI's de-merger makes it by no means a peculiarly Anglo-Saxon move, as critics have alleged. In common with Union Carbide in the US, France's Rhone-Poulenc has already been moving in a similar direction through a string of divestments. By the same token, the new Zeneca and ICI portfolios will be far from sacrosanct. A management consultant who specialises in the chemical industry says that much so-called synergy in chemicals is merely 'historical'. He agrees different chemical businesses often share technology and production facilities, partly because they have grown out of each other. But, 'unlike the branches of a tree, little sap sometimes flows between them - or needs to'. So Zeneca and the new ICI are quite capable of being dismembered by outside intervention. In military terms, they will both now mount a charge for victory. But they could still suffer the sort of treatment meted out to Lord Cardigan and his men in 1854.</p>

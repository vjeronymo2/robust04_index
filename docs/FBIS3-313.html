			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, kwaZulu chief </F> minister and Inkatha Freedom Party leader, in the Cape Town  parliamentary studio by Max du Preez on the "Agenda" program --  live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Du Preez] Earlier I referred  to the state president's statements earlier tonight that there  is not enough time for foreign mediation. What is your reaction  to that?    [Buthelezi] Well I don't know. Mr. de Klerk has always been  saying there is no time for this, there is no time for that,  there's this deadline and that deadline, and really it's  something that depresses me immensely, Mr. du Preez, because I  think that the main thing is to find a solution. What is the  use of meeting deadlines, as happened in Angola, and still have  mayhem like that in the country. I think that it's important  for us to find solutions, rather than to gallop regardless of  whether we find a solution or not.    [Du Preez] Now I suspect then what Mr. Moosa said about the  election date being cast in stone, that you will also not be  very happy with that statement?    [Buthelezi] Well I'm not happy with it because it's based --  in fact from the very beginning, you know Mr. du Preez, without  rehashing, you know, arguments that have taken place at the  multiparty talks, you know, in Kempton Park -- from the very  beginning, the very idea of fixing a date before there was a  constitution was wrong. But we provisionally accepted the date  on the proviso that certain things should come first. But those  things which should have come first did not even come first, and  that is why our teams or delegations had to walk out of Kempton  Park.    [Du Preez] I put it to the other two gentlemen earlier -- I  think viewers and voters will imagine now that this is the next  deadlock: that the Freedom Alliance parties will come in and say  we have not had enough time -- the ANC [African National  Congress] and government saying it's virtually cast in stone.  Do you have sympathy with the position that there could be  violence -- it would be a massive disappointment to a large  majority of the people -- if we had to move the date from the  27th of April?    [Buthelezi] Well I think that is propaganda that is being  built by both the government, Mr. de Klerk, and also by the  leaders of the ANC that, you know, people are itching to have  the 27th, they are itching for that regardless of the result,  regardless of whether there is an all inclusive solution. I  mean that is their attitude all along, and it's propaganda, of  course, which has become a hype, sort of deliberately created,  you know, in their public relations work. [passage omitted]</p>

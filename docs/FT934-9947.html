			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / No more winner-takes-all: Europe If there is a fashionable new buzz idea these days, it is the globalisation of the world economy. Ultra-liberals inevitably think it is an unmitigated blessing; the rest of us may wonder at the political and social price we are already paying. Imperious reality is not in doubt, however. The internationalisation of world finance is overwhelming the old demarcations between national financial markets. The competition of low-cost, high-tech producers in Asia is challenging the survival of slower-moving traditional producers in Europe and the US. And global competitive pressures threaten to sweep away Europe's costly social welfare systems. The political implications are disturbing. Democracy is more or less established in the west, and precariously foisted on other parts of the world, apart from China. Yet the globalisation of economics undermines the ability of democratic governments even to influence the essential conditions affecting their voters. Key factors are, in the short run, the interest rate policy of the Bundesbank, in the long run, the harvesting of the rain forests of Brazil; in neither case can democratically elected national governments affect the outcome. The answer to this mis-match between the traditional nation state and the modern global economy, according to David Held*, professor of politics at the Open University, is to extend active democracy up the international hierarchy, from the nation state to the global system. The starting point for what Mr Held terms 'the cosmopolitan model of democracy' would be a far-reaching reform of the United Nations, including the creation of a second UN chamber, compulsory jurisdiction for the International Court, and the establishment of a small, accountable, international police force. Mr Held makes no attempt to deny the immense conceptual and practical difficulties of such an internationalisation of democracy. But to say that his ideas are utopian is not a serious objection: only a utopian would have imagined the creation of the UN, the World Bank or the European Community, only a utopian would have predicted the collapse of communism, and only a utopian would have imagined the information revolution which is at the root of the globalisation of the world economy. The trouble with Mr Held's ideas is not that they are over-optimistic, but that they are over-global. The nation state will remain for the foreseeable future the fundamental building block of democratic politics. The problem he identifies is a crisis of loss of national political effectiveness, and therefore loss of democratic legitimacy. But only part of the solution lies in the creation of new institutions at global or regional level: the more urgent practical tasks are, first, to make national democracies work better and, second, to improve co-operative democracy between local groups of states. In the EC, for example, there is a glaring problem of political legitimacy, which showed up in the national ratification debates on Maastricht. But contrary to the usual Euro-babble, it has virtually nothing to do with the shortfall in the powers of the European Parliament, and everything to do with the inadequate legitimacy of national political systems. Voters do not trust national politicians, and above all they do not trust them to safeguard the national interest in dealing with Europe. With the politicians we have, there may be no way of regaining that trust. But there is a sure way of forfeiting it: to persist in a voting system in the European Council of Ministers that gives several times as much weight to the interests of a Luxembourger as to those of an Italian or German. No national democracy would tolerate such inequality in constituencies or voting weights for national elections; and unless the Community starts to think in terms of real voters, rather than in terms of artificially weighted member states, the entire operation will be closed down by the German constitutional court, and quite right too. This is an indication of the Community's development. In 1958 it was essential to protect the little member states; today it is essential to protect the voters. The same principle applies to Northern Ireland; but the solution is quite the reverse. Britain and Ireland are both being held to ransom by two infinitesimally tiny minorities. The power of these barbarous extremists does not really come from bombs and guns, but from the belief, relentlessly fostered by every British politician, that this is a political system where the winner takes all. The IRA believes that one last murder will make Ulster wholly and permanently Irish; the UDA that one last murder will keep Ulster wholly and permanently British. There is only one logical strategy for defeating the murderers; and that is a treaty between Britain and Ireland, which would virtually amount to a condominium over the province's future, and which would rule out, for ever, the feasibility of winner-take-all. Some people would say that proportionality and democracy should be extended not just upwards to the UN and the EC, but downwards to the nation states; for example, to Britain's national electoral system. But, of course, that is just the absurd imagining of people who do not understand the deep beauty of British democracy. * Democracy and the New International Order, by David Held, Institute for Public Policy Research, 30 Southampton Street, London WC2, 30 pages, Pounds 2.95 Ian Davidson will be on sabbatical until the end of this year</p>

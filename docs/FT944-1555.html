			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Shareholders fight political funding Shareholder groups of three leading Japanese industrial companies yesterday took court action to stop them making corporate political donations, the first such case in Japanese legal history. This exemplifies growing public concern that curbs on political funding, due to take effect at the end of the year, may contain loopholes. It shows a small yet growing tendency among Japanese shareholders to make their voices heard. They are angry that many companies have over the past few weeks resumed political donations, a year after they claimed to have closed their coffers, ostensibly to promote cleaner politics. In the previous year, 1992, corporate donations from all sources amounted to Y332.2bn (Pounds 2.1bn). The companies in this case, all Osaka-based, are Obayashi, one of Japan's five largest construction groups, Osaka Gas and Kansai Electric Power, respectively Japan's second biggest gas and electricity suppliers. The suit, filed on shareholders' behalf by an Osaka civil rights group, seeks to stop the trio making donations for the Osaka governorship in next April's local elections. The shareholders allege the three companies contravened an election law against giving money to politicians responsible for public works. Local governors can select contractors for substantial civil engineering projects. The trio are alleged to have collected Y420m from 129 local companies for a candidate in the last gubernatorial election in 1991. Other business groups to have started making political donations again include the construction, oil and life insurance industry associations. The Keidanren, the leading business federation, continues to abstain from channelling its members' cash to political parties, but says member organisations have kept the freedom to donate independently. However, the party line-up has now been simplified by last week's merger of all leading opposition parties into a single group, the New Frontier party. This leaves Japan with a simple system of three main parties: the ruling Liberal Democratic party, NFP and Social Democratic party. The move has made it easier, for the first time in 18 months, for companies to spot who needs to be paid to safeguard their interests. The construction industry group says it is giving to both the main parties, the LDP and NFP, the first time it has had to make a two-way political bet. Corporate political funding is to be banned entirely in five years. Meanwhile, donations can still be made to one registered fund-raising group per politician.</p>

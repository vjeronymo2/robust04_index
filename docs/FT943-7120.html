			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Reynolds to meet US delegation Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is to meet an influential Irish-American delegation in Dublin today. The encounter will precede the group's meeting in Belfast tomorrow with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The delegation is headed by Mr Bruce Morrison, a former congressman who is considered a close friend of Mr Bill Clinton, the US president. Although not on official US business, Mr Morrison is expected to impress upon Mr Adams the desire of prominent Irish-Americans to see an IRA ceasefire in return for the lobbying that has been done on behalf of nationalists in the US, and which resulted in Mr Adams obtaining a temporary entry visa to the US earlier this year. Mr Adams has said he considers his meeting with Mr Morrison's group important. However, the Irish government yesterday played down the significance of Mr Reynolds' planned meeting with the delegation. The group is also to meet leaders of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the Alliance party in Northern Ireland, but last-minute requests to meet unionist leaders were turned down by both the Ulster Unionist party and the hardline Democratic Unionist party. In a sign of growing tensions within the SDLP over the peace process, Mr Joe Hendron, the party's MP for West Belfast, said he sympathised with the unionists for not meeting the US delegation because 'they have identified fairly strongly with the nationalist side'. With an IRA ceasefire widely expected to be announced within two weeks, new rifts are also appearing in the unionist camp. Mr David Irvine, a member of the Progressive Unionist party, which is thought to reflect the views of loyalist paramilitaries, yesterday accused the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the DUP, of attempting to destroy efforts to bring the UUP and DUP closer. He said there was 'widespread anger' among loyalists at recent attacks by Dr Paisley on the UUP. 'Unionists should be working together to face the future from a position of strength, but he is ensuring division,' he said.</p>

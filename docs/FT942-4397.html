			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Nato offers Russia a special relationship Nato yesterday held out an olive branch to Moscow by promising it a relationship that would reflect Russia's status as the most powerful nation in Europe. Diplomats said the message, contained in a communique by Nato foreign ministers and a series of verbal statements by senior Alliance figures, should be enough to persuade Russia to join Partnership For Peace, the military co-operation programme, in the near future. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, will deliver an initial response to the initiative when he and his counterparts from other east European nations arrive in Istanbul today. The Nato ministers hope Mr Kozyrev will join PFP, in which 20 other eastern central European countries have agreed to participate, in time for next month's summit of the Group of Seven. Ideally, the question of Nato's relations with Russia would be settled before the European Union summit in Corfu later this month, which is expected to set the seal on enhanced Russia-EU ties. Mr Sergio Balzino, Nato's acting secretary-general, told the meeting: 'Russia will remain the most powerful nation in Europe; its active participation in building a new security architecture in Europe is vital'. The ministers called for an 'extensive and far-reaching' role for Russia within PFP, a programme envisaging exchange of military knowhow, co-operation over peace-keeping, and the possibility of full Nato membership. In a significant concession to Russian aspirations, they also called for relations with Moscow to be developed 'in appropriate areas' outside PFP. Diplomats said this implied acceptance of Russia's wish for an upgraded dialogue on matters such as nuclear safety and non-proliferation. The ministers stopped short of using the words 'special relationship' to avoid offending Moscow's former satellite nations. They also avoided giving any satisfaction to Russian demands for broader institutional changes in Europe, which at their most extreme called for Nato's subordination to the Conference on Security and Co-Operation in Europe. Diplomats pointed to one behind-the-scenes development which, although in theory quite separate from yesterday's deliberations in Istanbul, should give Moscow considerable cause for satisfaction. Long-running talks within the CSCE on setting up a set of principles to govern peace-keeping was making good progress and could soon yield a formal agreement, they said. Russia wants to secure Western acknowledgment of its 'peace-keeping' role in the southern republics of the former Soviet Union. The Nato ministers welcomed the announcement of a one-month ceasefire in Bosnia and pledged to work quickly for broader agreement on the republic's future. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said the contact group on Bosnia, including the US, Russia, Britain and Germany, should within 10 days have prepared a map providing for a territorial division of Bosnia which the parties would be urged to accept. 'Severe pressure' would be put on any party blocking moves to a long-term settlement. If a settlement won general acceptance, he was confident the US would make good on its promise to provide peacekeeping forces.</p>

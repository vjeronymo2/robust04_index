			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Alberto Pepe Leira] </F>   [Text] Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (EFE) -- The  presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay today  ratified that Mercosur [Common Market of the South] will go into  operation on 1 January 1995. They also confirmed the new work  program to overcome the problem related to the common external  tariff which is preventing the creation of a customs union.    The presidents were not able to fulfill the objective of  announcing an agreement on the external tariff which is the  basis for the customs union before Mercosur goes into operation.  This was the intention of the fifth Mercosur summit after the  emergence of a number of problems related to percentages  accepted by each country for the protection of heavy industry,  electronics, informatics, and petrochemistry.    Brazil, which is the main Mercosur partner, wants tariffs of  up to 35 percent on those items while Argentina accepts up to 12  percent or a maximum of 14 percent on the exports of third  countries.    Paraguay and Uruguay, the two smaller partners, are in favor  of a minimum tariff to prevent being subject to Brazilian  technology and to the lack of efficiency of those industrial  sectors.    President Carlos Menem of Argentina, Itamar Franco of  Brazil,  Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay, and Luis Alberto Lacalle of  Uruguay agreed today, upon opening the fifth summit, on the  difficulties facing Mercosur in this decisive stage of its  operation.    At the same time Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de  Lozada, who attended the meeting as an observer, warned in his  speech that the lack of political will has been the main cause  of Latin American failure in the search for economic integration.    All the presidents who carried out intensive direct  diplomatic activity to overcome the obstacles asserted their  desire to continue despite the obstacles.    Paraguayan President Wasmosy was the one who clearly defined  the current situation by indirectly criticizing those like  Brazil which seek to maintain their traditional protectionism.    Wasmosy said that Mercosur will only represent "the opening  of a market comparable to other world regions if there is a  modern framework based on free trade and competition, and where  traditional protectionism must adjust to the new scenario."    He also said that Mercosur must be "a system for new  investments and technology, even the `advanced' ones, as well as  real full employment."    On the other side, Brazilian President Franco, who admitted  the future difficulties, expressed satisfaction with the  progress of Mercosur, and with the growth of the economies of  the four countries.    He supports the extension of the free trade agreements to  Chile and the signing of other subregional agreements. He added,  however, that the complete opening of the Brazilian markets will  have "benefits proportional to the size of the openings in each  of the other member countries."    In order to overcome the obstacles and interpretations, the  presidents decided to approve a new program to define the  external tariff. That program must conclude before the sixth  summit scheduled for next July, six months before the date  established by the Asuncion Treaty of 26 March 1991 to put  Mercosur into operation.    That work program establishes concrete dates to define each  item of the tariff and to move toward a common percentage for  imports from third countries.    The experts believe that the less complex negotiations will  conclude before May and that by July there will be a clear  picture on the four most controversial items which Brazil hopes  to protect from the imports from third countries: informatics,  petrochemistry, capital goods, and electronics.    A timetable for reducing tariffs has been established,  therefore, it is expected that by the year 2000 there can be a  tariff of 12 percent for capital goods.    Regarding informatics and electronics, for which Argentina  wants a tariff of 4 percent and Brazil 35 percent, the lowest  possible tariff will be established by the year 2006 as a way to  favor industrial reconversion.</p>

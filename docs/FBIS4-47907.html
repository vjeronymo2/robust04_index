			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Now for our interview: Philippe Gaillard,  representative of the ICRC in Kigali in Rwanda. A few moments  ago we heard him talking about the deterioration of the  situation on the ground today. Now Philippe Gaillard speaks  first of all about the successful evacuation of 350 Rwandan  orphans to Zaire yesterday. He spoke to Catherine Nina:    [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Nina] Mr. Gaillard, the  ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] is also working  in the rest of the country. What is the current situation?    [Gaillard] There is no region, no village, in Rwanda which  has escaped the violence. It was known that 220,000 to 250,000  people have fled the southwest of Rwanda to take refuge in  Tanzania. The day before yesterday, thanks to remarkable  cooperation from the Tanzanian and Rwandan Red Cross, we managed  to distribute four days' worth of food, so that they can  survive, at least for the next four days. We carried out this  distribution in one day, for 220,000 people.    That is one thing. Today we are starting to evaluate the  situation of the civilian populations in the southeast of  Rwanda, the regions of Kibungo, Rusomo, the Tanzanian frontier  -- but on the Rwandan side -- because there are all sorts of  rumors going round as to the fate of the civilian populations  that have stayed inside the country. I think we shall have a  reasonably clear picture tomorrow morning, or tomorrow evening  at the latest, I think.    [Nina] What is the situation in Gitarama?    [Gaillard] You know, the Rwandan Government is in Gitarama.  There is a huge number of displaced persons in Gitarama. They  are mainly people who fled Kigali and who are completely  destitute.    Yesterday morning I received a formal invitation from the  Rwandan Government to transform -- with the agreement of the  nuns -- the religious center of Kabgayi, which is the biggest  religious center in Rwanda, into an ICRC hospital.    I think we shall be able to start on an initial distribution  of food to the displaced persons in the regions of Gitarama and  Kabgayi at the beginning of next week at the latest.    I am not at all optimistic. It seems to me that there is no  longer any hope of dialogue, that in spite of international  pressure of various kinds it will be extremely difficult to stop  this infernal machine which has been set in motion in Rwanda. I  don't know if I should say it was 6 April [death of  Habyarimana], three and a half years ago, in 1959 [dates of  clashes in Rwanda] -- I don't know, it'll be analyzed later --  but it is very recent that the despair has been so great on both  sides that they are ready to push the exercise through to the  end, and I think we haven't seen the end of the horror.</p>

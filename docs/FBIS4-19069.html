			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] According to an agreement reached with UN  observers, the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front have agreed  to the evacuation of foreigners who are still in the country.  [passage omitted]    Foreign Minister Javier Solana informed the Senate about the  evacuation of Spanish citizens.    [Begin Solana recording] According to the latest information  I have at my disposal, right now I can say that about 25  Spaniards are on the verge of leaving, a certain number have  already left, and there are 25 ready to leave. I think that  they will be able to leave at 1400. That is the mainly good  news I can give, but as I say, overall it is a bad picture  because the situation in Rwanda is still very unpleasant, very  bad. [end recording]    The Spanish Government is in permanent contact with France  and Belgium, the countries which are coordinating the evacuation  of nationals. Spain has offered two Hercules transport planes  to help with the evacuation. So a unit of the Legion's special  operations group is on stand-by should it be needed.</p>

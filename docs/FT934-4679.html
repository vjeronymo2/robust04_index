			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management: US investors back in the driving seat - International fund managers have enjoyed buoyant conditions in most markets, with bonds largely leading equities upwards. A general downward trend in short term interest rates has created a benign framework for the capital markets It has been a year in which the US has once again come to dominate the global investment scene. Upstart rivals such as Japan and Europe have faced acute domestic problems and have retreated before the tidal wave of money - aggregating nearly Dollars 50bn during just the first half of 1993 - which has left the US and flooded into the global equity and bond markets. One corporate event may symbolise this new phase of American domination: the decision by the troubled German motor giant Daimler-Benz to list its shares in New York in October, and to agree to publish amended financial statements which comply with the US generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP). Not very long ago, it was countries such as Germany and Japan that were effectively writing the rules on the back of heavy capital outflows. However, Germany has stumbled under the burden of reunification and its capital surplus has faded away. Japan, meanwhile, is still fighting its long battle against debt deflation and the aftermath of the bubble economy of the 1980s. The Japanese economy is in deep recession. One consequence is a large balance of payments surplus that has helped to push the yen exchange rate to extreme heights. Instead of sending more capital abroad and risking currency losses, Japanese investors are keeping their heads down. As for the UK, for much of the 1980s a disproportionately important participant in the global securities markets following the 1979 abandonment of foreign exchange curbs on portfolio investment, the institutional allocation to overseas assets appears to have peaked out, with the typical pension fund having an exposure of almost 30 per cent. How big are these international securities markets? We are dealing in international telephone numbers here, but the IMF estimates that the value of publicly-traded debt and equity around the world is of the order of Dollars 24,000bn. Some Dollars 14,000bn of this is managed by investment institutions and a different agency, the United Nations, has calculated that Dollars 2,500bn is held on a cross-border basis. There are different theories about the right degree of international exposure. Some arguments are based on concepts of diversification, through which a better balance of risk and return can be obtained so long as the different national markets have only a low degree of correlation. Others are based on matching theories, so that the appropriate international exposure for a pension fund, for example, is linked to the proportion of imports in the basket of goods and services that the future pensioner can be expected to consume. Whatever the details of the logic, the broad brush conclusion is that overseas diversification is more important in a small, open economy than in a large, closed one where a broad range of investment opportunities is available in the domestic markets. Strategic judgments are subject to tactical modifications, however. The impetus of the current US portfolio outflows has been derived from perceived declining value for money in US securities markets. Long Treasury bond yields fell below 6 per cent at one stage this year, prompting an intensified search for higher returns elsewhere. Dividends and price-earnings ratios on US equities have been at historically unattractive levels, again leading to a renewed inspection of international opportunities. Some of the effects have been quite strange. US pension funds have found it hard to invest in domestic bonds which meet their actuarial return requirements, and so they have been buyers of substantial volumes of Latin American and other Third World debt. It is not clear whether they understand all the risks they are taking - although probably such securities should be seen as replacing domestic junk bonds rather than US Treasuries. US mutual fund investors, meanwhile, have been drawn overseas for straightforward reasons by the performance figures. Most of the top-performing mutual funds earlier in the year were international specialists, and investors have recently been putting nearly half of their new money into overseas stock and bond funds in the hope of capturing extra performance. Although American investors have stayed light in Japanese equities, which they have judged to be still very overvalued (correctly, on the basis of the very latest tumble by the Tokyo market), they have been active in driving up stock prices in Continental Europe and many less developed countries (or emerging markets, as they are somewhat tendentiously named). The greatly strengthened US interest in global securities markets has created substantial opportunities for US-based investment management firms to develop their international business. This is putting competitive pressure on some of the London managers who have until now been able to exploit a reputation for global skills almost unchallenged. US pension plan sponsors, for instance, find it less necessary to hire their global specialist expertise in London than they used to. London remains a leading centre for global equity management, however. According to Technimetrics, which runs an investment management database, equities worth Dollars 530bn were managed out of London at the end of last year, almost as much as the Dollars 580bn of equity portfolios being run in New York. Boston came some way back with Dollars 270bn. Given the much higher overseas weightings in the London portfolios - probably 30 per cent against 7 per cent in the US - the role of London is considerable, especially when backed up by the Dollars 110bn or so controlled in Scotland. The biggest centre of equity fund management by far is actually Tokyo, with funds of nearly Dollars 1,400bn, but this again is very much an inward-looking centre: its US and European equity assets of some Dollars 60bn at the end of 1992 were less than half the size of the corresponding portfolios run in London. With bonds the picture is rather different. There is a lot of expertise in bond fund management in Continental Europe, in centres such as Frankfurt and Zurich, although London has been rapidly developing its skills in this area too. In some respects the management of global bond funds is easier to organise than global equities. Economic and political data can be gathered into a single location and analysed according to a consistent framework. Equities are more difficult, because local information still counts for a lot, especially in emerging markets where information may be poorly distributed and where pricing may well be inefficient. Managers in London have too often attracted criticism for poor performance in the US and Japan. The obvious solution is to set up overseas subsidiary operations which have their ears close to the ground. But this is often not a satisfactory answer either, because global networks can be difficult to manage, and expensive. For a big institution, the better the quality of the people in local centres around the globe, the more difficult it is likely to be to maintain central control of the strategic asset allocation process. No magic formula has been found for international fund management. There are still plenty of opportunities for small specialists, while at the other end of the spectrum the biggest institutions struggle with multi-office telecommunications hook-ups across the time zones to allow their various investment gurus to talk to each other. Fast-talking marketing men from quantitative boutiques, armed with glamorous global tactical asset allocation models and impeccable backtesting results, are in direct competition with traditional international banks. With Dollars 14,000bn of assets there to be managed around the world, and more every day, perhaps everyone can find an opportunity.</p>

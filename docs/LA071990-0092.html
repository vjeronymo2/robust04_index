			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PETITION DRIVE TO RECALL 2 BURBANK COUNCIL MEMBERS FAILS  </P> <P> The campaign to recall two Burbank City Council members has died after  organizers failed to gather enough signatures to put the issue on the November  ballot.  </P> <P> "It's just dead," Assistant City Clerk Marge Lauerman said Wednesday of the  petition to recall Mayor Thomas Flavin and Councilman Michael Hastings.  </P> <P> She said organizers did not file the petition with her office by the deadline  Tuesday afternoon.  </P> <P> Ted McConkey, who started the recall movement along with two other Burbank  residents in February, said 7,239 signatures were collected since March. The  petition needed 8,720 signatures -- or 20% of Burbank's 43,600 registered  voters -- to be placed on the ballot.  </P> <P> McConkey said he and other organizers were dissatisfied with the performance of  Flavin and Hastings, particularly their support for development.  </P> <P> Flavin and Hastings could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Flavin said earlier that the campaign against him was "an irresponsible action  driven by political motives." Hastings accused those seeking the recall of  being "unprincipled dissidents."  </P> <P> McConkey cited well-financed opposition and lack of media coverage as reasons  for the petition's failure. "Half the people in this town didn't even know  there was a recall," he said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Although he will not organize another recall petition, McConkey said other  groups in Burbank have contacted him about campaigns of their own.  </P> <P> "Even though this recall did not succeed, this is far from the end of it," he  said.  </P> <P> The only successful recall of a member of the City Council was in 1954.  </P></p>

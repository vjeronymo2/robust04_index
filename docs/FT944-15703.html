			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Paris - Other Markets The market continues to be volatile, although most commentators have an overweight position, favouring France over Germany on a medium to long-term view, writes John Pitt. SG Warburg is overweight in the consumer sector, and it also likes the luxury end of the sector, such as LVMH. However, within the luxury segment, Remy Cointreau, due to release half-year results this week, is less favoured by brokers. James Capel has downgraded the stock to hold, given the drain on profits due to heavy investment in upgrading its distribution network.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, has said that  the Bodoland accord should be implemented in letter and spirit  without adversely affecting the interest of any other section.  Talking to newspersons last night at Guwahati, Mr. Chavan hoped  that the state government will be able to sort out the  differences relating to the demarcation of the boundary of the  Bodoland Autonomous Council. The home minister said there has  been distinct improvement in the law and order situation in  Assam. The three-member team of union ministers headed by Mr.  Chavan met a number of delegations representing various ethnic  groups of Assam and heard their problems.    Mr. Chavan earlier said that Pakistan's Inter Service  Intelligence, the ISI, had increased its activities in the  northeast by operating through various militant organizations.  He said much of it is controlled from ISI's Bangladesh bases.  He hoped that with the agreement being reached with Bangladesh  coordinated actions would be taken soon to end ISI activities.  As reported, Bangladesh had agreed to cooperate in halting ISI  activities in India.    The home minister has since arrived in Arunachal Pradesh's  capital Itanagar on a two day visit to the state. He is  accompanied by the minister of state for labor, Mr. P.A. Sangma,  and the minister of state for personnel, Mrs. Margaret Alwa.  The three-member team currently on a four-day visit to some of  the northeastern states will meet the state governor, Mr.  Prasad; the chief minister, Gegong Apong; and his cabinet  colleagues and discuss various issues concerning the state.</p>

This disease manifests itself as lung disease or draining, nonhealing abscesses, or both. It is generally transmitted by breathing in respiratory excretions from infected animals or drinking infected milk from infected animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Zealand has reported that TB is endemic in the brushtail possum ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Trichosurus vulpecula <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). These possums are a constant source of disease for the domestic livestock population of New Zealand. Based upon information received from the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and information available in scientific literature, we recently prepared a risk assessment regarding the importation of brushtail possums from New Zealand into the United States. This risk assessment indicates that 45.8 percent (range 7.2 percent to 67.4 percent) of consignments of imported brushtail possums (generally imported in 4 consignments of 12 animals each) would contain 1 or more possums infected with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mycobacterium bovis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Additionally, there is no recognized test for detecting TB in brushtail possums. These factors present a significant risk that TB-infected brushtail possums from New Zealand could be imported into the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because hedgehogs from New Zealand occupy the same habitat and geographical areas as the brushtail possums, there is some risk that hedgehogs could contract TB from TB-infected possums. Also, as with the brushtail possums, there is no recognized test for detecting TB in hedgehogs. These factors present an unacceptable risk that TB-infected hedgehogs from New Zealand could be imported into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There have been a number of importations of brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand into the United States. Both these animals could likely survive and thrive in the wild in much of the United States. If infected with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mycobacterium bovis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and allowed to roam freely, these animals could disseminate the TB organism over range and pasture land. Consuming grass contaminated with the TB organism by TB-infected brushtail possums is the major mode of TB infection in cattle in New Zealand. To prevent a similar situation in the United States, we are amending the regulations by adding a new subpart G to prohibit the importation of brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Immediate Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to prevent the introduction of TB into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule prohibits the importation of brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand into the United States. These animals are imported as pets, for animal exhibitions, and for petting zoos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulating the importation of certain animals that pose a disease risk to livestock in the United States is a continuing program. Discontinuing the importation of brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand will have no significant cost impacts, but it will produce a benefit by helping to protect domestic livestock from this disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The incidence of TB in domestic cattle remains relatively small; however, it has increased slightly in the past several years. Most of the incidences have occurred in States that share a border with Mexico. Mexican-origin cattle accounted for 83 percent of all TB lesions disclosed at slaughter in 1992. There are very few cases of TB in the rest of the country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inventory of all cattle and calves in the United States is estimated at 101.7 million head, with an estimated value of almost $67 billion. Nationwide, there are approximately 1.2 million operations with cattle and calves, according to USDA data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

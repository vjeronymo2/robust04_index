			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Fair Balance -- "Keys well-balanced Budget should allay a  lot  of economic jitters, at home and abroad, while offering a sound  basis of hope to the deprived. As in the old South Africa, the  acid test is whether government spending will be kept firgly in  check," states an editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English  on 23 June on page 18. The "good news" is that Reconstruction  and Development Program "is to be financed largely through cuts  in existing allocations," with no increase in VAT [value-added  tax] or fuel tax. As for the "widely expected soaking of the  rich," this takes the form of a "one-off 5 percent tax surcharge  on individuals and companies with taxable incme over R50,000  [rand] a year." As "redistribution" had to come, this "is not a  bad way to approach it." "The Budget's stress on increased  social spending sends the correct signals to a society in need  of radical reconstruction," and while much "remains for the  present in the realm of promise rather than performance, but at  least the guidelines are firmly set out."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   PWV, KwaZulu/Natal Capitals -- The decision to make  Johannesburg the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]  capital "was much easier than resolving a similiar issue in  KwaZulu/Natal" as "the political dilemna is not as tense," notes  an editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 23 June on  page 10. "If a suitable resolution -- the decision has now been  taken to the people for a referendum -- is arrived at, the  fundamental political problems of that region might also be  resolved. For stated simply, it is a political fight for control  between the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], which runs the region,  and the ANC which believes it should be running it."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   Television Tax -- "SABC [South African Broadcasting  Corporation] proposing that part of its income should come from  increased taxes can bring to an end its license problem."  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 17 June says in a page 10  editorial. "It creates an opportunity to ease the bigger  problems experienced by the SABC, even though taxpayers could  resist payment of licenses." "The plan is that a percentage of  the state's income tax should replace the license fees. This is  a much more efficient manner of collecting money than the  expensive and ineffective effort to get television viewers to  pay license fees every year." "However, the disadvantages of  this system is that people who do not watch television would  also be taxed, and that taxpayers could regard such a system as  being unfair. It could also further undermine the SABC's  Independence." "As a state-run corporation it enjoys much more  advantages than the private media. In certain respects it has  the monopoly, namely, television news programs during the peak  period, and choice advertising." "The taxation plan provides  the state with an opportunity to make the SABC less dependent on  advertisements. It would be practically easier collecting  increased tax than increasing license fees." "Although  television tax will ultimately have several advantages, the  matter should nevertheless be approached very cautiously."</p>

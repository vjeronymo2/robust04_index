			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK house prices The stock market was wise not to read too much yesterday into Thursday's announcement by the Halifax Building Society that house prices in June rose 0.7 per cent. Memories of last October apart - a month when the Halifax index momentarily blipped up before resuming its downward path - the mood of UK housebuilding companies at the moment is almost unremittingly glum. Price cuts of 5-10 per cent were not untypical in the first half of this year. More worryingly it looks as though current pricing strategies will be insufficient to achieve most companies' year-end target volumes. Tarmac for one admits that prices may have to drop further, or incentives be sweetened, if its goals are to be met. To be fair to the Halifax, its suggestion that prices should stabilise in the second half is tentative. This is not surprising, perhaps, given its rosy predictions at the start of 1991 and its forecast in January of a modest increase in prices this year.</p>

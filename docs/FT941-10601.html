			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Tokyo's financial community welcomes government package Tokyo's financial community welcomed the government package yesterday although much of the buying had been done last week, when the government had initially hoped to announce the measures. The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares, which fell 287.03 points on Monday, rebounded 236.83, or 1.2 per cent, to 20,251.23. The bond market, recently depressed by fears of extra supply of government bonds to finance the income tax cut and economic package, gained ground. The yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark fell 2.5 basis points to 3.5 per cent as investors regarded the over-supply factor as already discounted in the yield.</p>

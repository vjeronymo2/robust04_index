			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From 18 February RAHVA HAAL, p 1; "News Bulletin" No. 34/94] </F>   [Text] Friday, February 18 -- Estonian Ambassador to the  United Nations Ernst Jaakson announced that Estonia supports the  ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, threatening to use air raids  unless the heavy weapons be removed from the environs of  Sarajevo. Jaakson admitted that the situation in Bosnia had  deteriorated lately and pointed out the open support to the  Serbian aggressors by some Russian political forces.    Jaakson expressed the Estonian views on the issues. Estonia  does not support the ending of humanitarian aid and the  withdrawal of the UN forces nor the ending of the economic  sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro before the signing of a  peace treaty in Bosnia. Estonia also supports the countries  demanding an end to the ban on arms sale to the Bosnian Muslims,  who represent the lawful government of Bosnia, Jaakson declared.</p>

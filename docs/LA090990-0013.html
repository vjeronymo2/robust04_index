			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Lauren Lipton's "Anchored in L.A." piece on Aug. 5 was a good story.  </P> <P> All of the news anchors listed were A-OK. Some were better than others, but all  very acceptable. Among the women, Bree Walker of KCBS has warmth, knowledge and  looks. Among the men, we like Paul Moyer, Jim Lampley, John Beard and Keith  Morrison.  </P> <P> As for the morning shows, we don't like Bryant "Grumble" and can't stand  Deborah Norville of NBC's "Today." Poor chemistry.  </P> <P> Marjorie Seitz, Loma Linda  </P></p>

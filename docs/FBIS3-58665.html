[end recording]    Venizelos added that Greece is ready for talks with Skopje  within the UN framework, but on the basis determined by the  government. Commenting on remarks Alternate Foreign Minister  Theodhoros Pangalos made on Skopje yesterday, Venizelos stressed  that as Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said, he and Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias are handling the issue.

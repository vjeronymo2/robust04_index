			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Balladur in plea to air strikers THE French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday urged striking Air France employees to return to work, as riot police moved to block protesting workers from runways at the two main airports in Paris. Making his first comments on the strike which has crippled air travel to and from Paris for the past three days, he said that the industrial action threatened serious damage to the national airline. The strike also reflects a dilemma facing the French government, which wants loss-making public sector companies to be restructured but is anxious to avoid protests against large-scale job cuts and the country's rising unemployment rate. Reflecting this delicate balance, Mr Balladur emphasised that Air France's austerity plan, which envisages 4,000 job cuts by the end of next year, would be implemented with a minimum of forced redundancies. However, he described the plan as vital for the survival of the airline which lost FFr3.8bn (Pounds 440m) in the first half. Air France was again forced to cancel hundreds of flights to and from Paris yesterday.</p>

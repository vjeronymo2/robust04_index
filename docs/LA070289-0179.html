			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> The sewage spill June 22 at Aliso Beach, in which more than 900,000 gallons of  raw effluent was dumped into the surf after a sewage line burst, was the  largest in Orange County in more than a year, according to county health  officials.  </P> <P> Health officials say people who come into contact with water contaminated by  untreated sewage risk contracting hepatitis. If such water is swallowed,  stomach and intestinal problems may develop.  </P> <P> The largest sewage accident in Orange County in the last decade is thought to  be the 9-million gallon spill in January, 1980, from a Capistrano Beach  treatment plant. Salt Creek, Doheny State and Capistrano beaches were closed  for two months after the event.  </P></p>

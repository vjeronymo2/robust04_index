			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / World Trade News: US steel makers to file on anti-dumping UP TO 50 US steel makers are soon expected to file anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases against their foreign competitors. Mr Frank Luerssen, chairman of Inland Steel in Chicago, said that the steel makers would be filing a 'whole spectrum' of trade cases when Washington's Voluntary Restraint Agreements (VRA) lapse with 28 countries. These are scheduled to expire in March. The tactic, said Mr Luerssen, was to pressure for a multilateral steel arrangement because 'what we're seeing under the VRAs is widespread dumping'. He complained that US steel prices have been consequently weakened. VRA's are informal arrangements through which exporters voluntarily restrain certain exports, usually through quotas, to avoid economic dislocation in an importing country. He declined to specify what countries or products would be the targets of such cases. VRAs currently apply to some 75 per cent of US steel imports. Mr Luerssen said that the cases now being prepared would be those 'with a high probability of success'. The companies used the filing of trade cases to win the VRAs in 1984. Critics of US steel quotas say that it is not imports that are hurting large integrated US steel mills. Imports accounted for some 18.2 per cent of the US market 20 years ago and just under 18 per cent last year. They argue that efficient US mini-mills have been doing far more harm. Mini-mills' market share has risen to 28 per cent in 1991 from 5 per cent two decades ago.</p>

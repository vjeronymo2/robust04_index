President Clinton said that China is a very important and  great country. Both he and the U.S. Government attach great  importance to the development of friendly relations with China.    He also said: The United States and China should become  partners of cooperation in their efforts to safeguard world  peace and promote economic progress. The two countries should  establish a relationship based on sincerity and mutual respect.  He noted that "We are willing to take part in China's  development program."    Vice Premier Zou Jiahua said: China always takes a serious,  positive, and forward-looking approach to Sino-U.S. relations.  China sees and deals with this relationship from a long-term and  worldwide perspective. He pointed out: Sino-U.S. relations are  now at a crucial juncture. There are still differences between  the two sides on some issues, but their common interests far  outweigh the differences. It is China's hope that the two sides  should do more in seeking things in common and expanding their  common interests [fa zhan gong tong li yi 4099 1455 0364 0681  0448 4135], end their past disputes as soon as possible, resume  and increase the exchange and cooperation between them in  various areas, and open up the way to the future of bilateral  relations.

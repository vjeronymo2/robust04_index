			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / SmithKline and Glaxo fight over new cancer drug A LEGAL BATTLE has begun between Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham, the two largest UK pharmaceutical companies, over a new class of drug designed to prevent nausea in cancer patients. The world market for these medicines is expected to exceed Pounds 500m a year in the mid 1990s. SB has filed a complaint in the US District Court in Philadelphia, alleging patent infringement against Glaxo's drug Zofran, which was launched in Europe last year and in the US in February. The dispute has been simmering behind the scenes for four years, and yesterday Glaxo issued a statement saying it had been notified of SB's complaint. 'Glaxo believes its patent position regarding Zofran is strong and that it does not infringe any valid patent of SmithKline Beecham,' it said. 'Glaxo will vigorously defend its position, and expects to prevail.' SB said it hoped to settle the dispute by negotiation with Glaxo and without having to proceed with the lawsuit. SB has a patent covering the use of a new group of drugs, known as 5HT3 antagonists, used as anti-emetics (to prevent the nausea and vomiting which are a common side-effect of chemotherapy for cancer). It claims Zofran contravenes that patent, even though it has a different chemical structure from SB's anti-emetic drug, called Kytril. Glaxo has won the race to market. Zofran is almost two years ahead of Kytril, which SB expects to launch in the US in 1993. That would normally give it a big commercial advantage. Sandoz, a Swiss pharmaceutical company which has developed a third 5HT3 antagonist, recently recognised SB's patent claim and signed a worldwide licensing agreement with the UK company. Mr Steve Plag, pharmaceuticals analyst at County NatWest Securities, said he believed SB wanted to force Glaxo to pay it a royalty on sales of Zofran. If the lawsuit is successful, Glaxo may end by paying SB Dollars 100m (Pounds 59m) a year in the late 1990s. Mr Robin Gilbert of James Capel said the legal move was a sign of more aggressive management at SB, the company formed in 1989 when Beecham of the UK merged with SmithKline Beckman of the US.</p>

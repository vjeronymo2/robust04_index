			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1421.1 is amended to remove the reference to soybeans. Soybeans are already included because they are defined as an oilseed in &sect;1421.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1421.3 is amended to: (a) Add the reference to part 1425; (b) clarify that the definitions in this part apply if there are any conflicts with the referenced parts; and (c) add a definition of high moisture commodities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule amends &sect;1421.4(b) to add references to a receiver, guardian, or trustee which were inadvertently omitted. In addition, &sect;1421.4(f) is amended to remove an obsolete reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1421.5(b)(1) is amended to clarify the application of the provision of the paragraph to loans, purchases, and LDP's and &sect;1421.5(b)(4)(iv) to correct the unit of measure for peanuts to tons and hundredths of a ton.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 110 of the 1949 Act sets forth the statutory authority for the farmer owned reserve (FOR) program for wheat and feed grains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Producers with regular 9-month nonrecourse price support loans are eligible to enter the FOR upon maturity of the regular loan. Producers may repay regular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9-month loans and repledge the commodity pledged as collateral for such initial loan for a subsequent loan. Under current program regulations, the maturity date for the subsequent loan is the same as the maturity date for the initial 9-month loan. Section 110(b)(1) of the 1949 Act provides, in part, that ``an extended loan shall only be made to a producer after the expiration of a 9-month price support loan *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Accordingly, under current program regulations, grain pledged as collateral for a subsequent loan is not eligible to be pledged as collateral for a FOR loan because the grain is not placed into the FOR ``after the expiration of a 9-month price support loan''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule amends &sect;1421.5(d)(2) to provide that CCC may allow producers to extend price support loans which are less than 9 months in length because the collateral securing such loan had been previously pledged as collateral for a price support loan so that the maturity date for such subsequent loan is the last day of the ninth month following the month such subsequent loan was disbursed. This would permit producers having such a loan to enter into the FOR upon maturity if all other eligibility requirements are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule amends &sect;1421.7 by removing paragraph (b) and redesignating paragraphs (c) and (d) as paragraphs (b) and (c), respectively. The weed control provisions are removed because CCC has determined that weed control laws do not affect the value of a commodity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, this interim rule amends &sect;1421.7(c)(1) to include rice and to remove the reference to the weed control law discounts. Section 1421.7 is also amended to redesignate paragraph (c)(3) as (c)(4) and add a new paragraph (c)(3), which was inadvertently omitted, which includes the method to determine the loan rate for rice based on the milling yield.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule amends &sect;1421.8(b)(2) to remove an incorrect reference to the United States Warehouse Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule amends &sect;1421.9(f)(2)(iv) by removing paragraph (G) to correct an error. Rice has not been stored identity preserved for many years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule amends &sect;&sect;1421.9(f)(2)(xiv)(B)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> v <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and 1421.18(b)(15)(ii)(G) to correct the terminology that the sunflower seed must pass through a 14/64 <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; round hole screen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule amends &sect;1421.11(a) to correct a typographical error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions for taking administrative offsets are provided in part 3 of this title and part 1403 of this chapter. Accordingly, this interim rule removes and reserves &sect;1421.14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule amends &sect;1421.16 (a) and (c) to include applicable references to Forms CCC&hyph;666, CCC&hyph;666 LDP, CCC&hyph;678, and CCC&hyph;709 and to remove incorrect references to Forms CCC&hyph;700 and CCC&hyph;701.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Producers who violate the loan note and security agreement by moving farm-stored loan collateral from the structures designated for the storage of such loan collateral, without prior written consent of the county committee, are subject to liquidated damages. In some cases, the collateral is moved to other structures on the farm which makes it possible for CCC to perfect its security on such collateral. CCC has determined that when such security can be established, producers should not be subject to such liquidated damages. Accordingly, this interim rule amends &sect;1421.16(b)(2) to clarify that unauthorized removal only includes cases where CCC cannot obtain the first lien on the collateral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is difficult to prove the amount of damages to CCC for loan and LDP violations committed by producers; however, 20 and 50 percent of the loan and LDP rates, as applicable, were established for first and second violations, respectively, when the county committee determined that the producer acted in good faith. CCC has determined that the liquidated damages can be reduced without affecting the administration of the loan and LDP programs. Accordingly, this interim rule amends &sect;1421.16 to: (a) Decrease the liquidated damages amounts; and (b) add paragraph (q) to provide that any or all of the liquidated damages may be waived under certain conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, under certain conditions, producers who violate loan and LDP provisions may be denied loans and LDP's on commodities stored on the farm. CCC has determined that this penalty is severe and should only be assessed when the county committee determines that such action is necessary to protect the interests of CCC. Accordingly, in &sect;1421.16, paragraphs (d) and (e) have been amended to remove the requirement for denial of farm-stored loans or LDP's and paragraphs (k) and (l) have been amended to clarify that producers must pay the liquidated damages assessed and such amounts cannot be repaid with a commodity certificate under the provisions of part 1470 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1421.17 provides requirements for farm-stored commodities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1421.17 is amended as follows: (a) Paragraph (a) has been amended to clarify that the reduced quantity for loan shall be the mortgaged loan quantity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) paragraph (c)(1) has been amended to clarify that, when farm-stored loans are transferred from the farm to warehouse storage, the warehouse-stored quantity cannot exceed 110 percent of the loan quantity transferred from the farm-stored loan; (c) paragraph (c)(3) has been amended to correct a reference; and (d) paragraph (e) has been amended to include a reference to Form CCC&hyph;709 which was omitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with civil rights advocate Aleksey Zybin by </F> correspondent Lembit Annus; Tallinn; date not given: "Converse  With a Duster, in Estonian. Instructions to Russian Cleaners"]    [Text] Tallinn--Aleksey Zybin is a communications engineer  and hereditary citizen of the Republic of Estonia. He is well  known with us as a prominent figure of the Russian civil rights  movement. He was a member of the last Supreme Soviet of Estonia.  Residents of Tallinn recently elected him to the city assembly,  where he is head of the faction of deputies of the Russian Revel  slate. He is interviewed by Lembit Annus, our own correspondent  in the Republic of Estonia.    [Annus] Aleksey Alekseyevich, what brought about the need  for  the creation of the Russian community of Estonia?    [Zybin] The purpose of our organization was the preservation  and development of Russian spirituality, cultural  distinctiveness, and national-historical memory. It emerged as  the Russian people's response to the challenge of the times. Our  organization is the youngest in the republic, incidentally. Its  "chronology" dates from 17 April of this year. At that time 500  delegates of the Russian Assembly adopted in Tallinn a decision  on the formation of a Russian community, elected its duma and  approved a program and bylaws. But we are not a Russian  political party, merely a civil rights organization of Russian  people. Russians, the bulk of whom do not have Estonian  citizenship, do not, according to the Constitution, have the  right to form political parties. They availed themselves,  therefore, of the opportunity to create a social and cultural  organization. Unfortunately, the government has still not made  up its mind to register our community, and the president, to  invite its representatives to the roundtable discussing the  problems of Russians in Estonia.    Of course, it would be flagrant deception to declare that  the  community unites in a single organization all 600,000  non-Estonians. But no one can any longer deny the fact that it  is the mass of Russians that constitutes the social base of our  organization. And this means that the future in the republic is  on the side of the community.    There is in Estonia today no other organization like ours,  whose principal goal is the creation of an integral practicable  and effective system of moral, spiritual, and material mutual  assistance for all members of its community. It is perfectly  explicable, therefore, that it is gaining ever-increasing  support from Russians living in Estonia.    [Annus] You refer also, most likely, to the results of the  October elections to the local government assemblies?    [Zybin] Quite right. Surely it is a success when 10 deputies  were elected to the Tallinn City Assembly on the Russian Revel  slate. This was possible because the community was able to get  the better of those who had fervently urged a boycott of the  local elections. On account of the boycott, not a single Russian  deputy was elected to the city council in many constituencies at  that time. And the Russians themselves were the losers because  of this. For this reason the people supported us this time.  Approximately 20,000 Tallinn residents voted at the elections  this time for the Russian deputies of our slate. Mainly from the  most unprotected strata of the population. And we ourselves are  today the poorest faction of deputies in the Tallinn City  Assembly. For example, the Russian community spent on the entire  campaign only 3,300 Estonian krona. Six hundred krona went on a  one-time lease of the Russian Cultural Center in Tallinn alone.  Simple arithmetic shows that each of our deputy's mandates  "costs" 330 krona. No other faction of deputies in the Tallinn  City Assembly has such "cheap" seats, incidentally. I mention  this not from pride but from pain. Poor Russian deputies will  today have to defend their equally poor electorate. It is  counting on us and firmly believes that we will be able if only  in some respects to alleviate its life in our cruel times.    [Annus] Aleksey Alekseyevich, what is your attitude toward  the assertion of Lennart Meri, president of Estonia, who in his  recent interview with the journal DER SPIEGEL said that Estonia  is treating "the minority better than Germany is treating the  Turks"?    [Zybin] I do not know how Germany treats the Turks, but that  there is everywhere in Estonia bad treatment of Russians I, as a  Russian, have experienced for myself repeatedly. And the  language, citizenship, and foreigners laws show this better than  a thousand words. So various political statements in the press  are one thing; the policy being pursued currently by the ruling  national-radical forces is quite another. It is for this reason  that the Russian community is endeavoring to help our people in  today's Estonia.    [Annus] You have touched on the most painful problem of the  life of Russians in Estonia today--the question of the official  language. What do you think--do Russians need to know Estonian?    [Zybin] Everyone should unequivocally know Estonian. It is  bad merely that Estonian is being pinned on Russians forcibly,  with a stick. What is to be gained today, pray, from the whole  of Narva today learning Estonian by rote? There is no one in  everyday life to talk to in Estonian. I simply cannot understand  either why knowledge of Estonian is now an obligatory  requirement of a cleaner, even. What, will she converse in the  official language with a duster? It is surely more important  that the floor be washed clean.    Why does not Estonia take the Finnish route? Recognize as  the  official languages both Estonian and Russian. At least all the  tension in our society would then be lifted. In other words, the  Hippocratic precept: "Do no harm," should be introduced  immediately in Estonian language policy.    [Annus] Imagine for a moment that you are president of  Estonia. What would you do in your new capacity first and  foremost?    [Zybin] I would first of all adopt all measures to achieve  an  end to the inter-nation hostility at the everyday level. To  ensure that Estonians see in the Russians living in the republic  the same kind of people as themselves. Not their enemies, who  must necessarily be gotten rid of.    Second, I would make every effort and use all my  presidential  possibilities to ensure that Estonian industry once again begin  to operate at full power and that the countryside be  revitalized. I would necessarily erect legislative barriers in  the way of the conversion of tiny Estonia into a dumping ground  for unserviceable overseas products and all kinds of industrial  trash. In other words, I would create for all Estonian landsmen  normal conditions for earning some money for a decent human  life. Without normal production, the state cannot exist. There  can otherwise be no question of independence.    And, third, I would come to an arrangement with the  president  of Russia concerning the civilized admittance of the Russian  people who have declared a desire to move to their primordial  homeland. You cannot live your whole life nursing a grievance.  No good will come of this, and civil peace and harmony in  Estonia even less.</p>

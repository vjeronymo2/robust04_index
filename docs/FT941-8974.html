			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Kent council gives pay rises of 2.9% Kent County Council's white-collar staff have been awarded a 2.9 per cent pay rise, the highest yet to be made by the handful of local authorities which negotiate pay locally. The council, which under government guidelines has to pay the increase out of efficiency savings, has based the award for all its white-collar workers on the 2.9 per cent national award recommended by the pay review body for teachers. They make up 9,600 of the council's 11,500 white-collar staff. The Local Government Management Board, which negotiates pay nationally on behalf of local authorities, said that traditionally there was no direct link between teachers' pay and that of other white-collar workers in local government. The government will allow the two English counties facing reorganisation next year to borrow up to Pounds 9m to cover the transition costs. Isle of Wight authorities will be allowed to borrow Pounds 1.48m in total, while the five Cleveland councils will be able to borrow up to Pounds 7.52m. The government expects that early revenue savings and capital receipts from reorganisation will reduce the need for further transitional assistance.</p>

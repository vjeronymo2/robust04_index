However, the normal gross weight limit (80,000 pounds) remains in effect. This change is adopted by this final rule in &sect;658.17(j).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Reassignment of Size and Weight Responsibilities Within the FHWA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 1, 1991, responsibility for the vehicle Size and Weight and NN Programs in the FHWA's regional and divisional offices was transferred to the Office of Motor Carriers. Revisions to 23 CFR 657.11 and 657.17 were proposed in the SNPRM to reflect this change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received on this issue. This final rule includes the changes as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Size and weight responsibilities in the Washington, DC., Headquarters office remain assigned to the Office of Motor Carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule implements sections 1023 and 4006 of the ISTEA, which restrict the operation of LCV's on the Interstate Highway System and CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units on the NN to the type of vehicles in use on or before June 1, 1991, subject to whatever State rules, regulations, or restrictions were in effect on that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted in the following paragraphs, the FHWA has determined that this rulemaking is: (1) Not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866; (2) not a significant action within the meaning of Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; (4) does not require the preparation of a federalism assessment; and (5) does not require the preparation of an environmental impact statement. All of these findings were made and included in the NPRM and again in the SNPRM, in each case after the FHWA had carefully reviewed the applicable Federal statutes and Executive Orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The WTA submitted comments to the docket in response to both the NPRM and the SNPRM challenging what it saw as the FHWA's casual dismissal of determinations required by various statutes and Executive Orders. In comments on the NPRM, the WTA argued that a long-term effect of any freeze would be to prohibit the natural evolution of technology in the trucking industry. Such a situation, in turn, would be likely to cause major and significant impacts on competing transportation modes, related businesses, and the general public. Accordingly, the WTA insisted that the FHWA conduct (1) a full regulatory evaluation, (2) a full economic assessment, (3) a federalism assessment, and (4) an environmental impact study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Effects on Small Entities and Other Economic Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After undertaking the analysis required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA reiterated in the SNPRM its conclusion that this rulemaking would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This conclusion remains unchanged in this final rule. The WTA, responding to an earlier document, stated that ``there is no question that the form and substance of this NPRM are clearly harmful to small entities. Most businesses affected in Wyoming are small entities. The few large entities doing business in Wyoming are similarly adversely affected.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

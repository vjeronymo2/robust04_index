			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Inflation worries hit bonds and dollar Government bonds slid yesterday while the dollar fluctuated sharply, as markets were haunted by fears of rising inflation and interest rates and large budget deficits. Political uncertainty after the European elections reinforced the bearish sentiment that has dogged the markets this year. During the week, German, French and Italian bond prices hit lows for the year. Meanwhile, US Treasuries were bruised by a falling dollar, climbing commodity prices and data showing a rise in consumer confidence, all of which fuelled fears of further US interest rate rises. Continuing bond market weakness depressed equities in bourses across Europe and North America. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average ended 34.88 points lower at 3,776.46. The dollar fell sharply against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM1.6299. In New York, it lost a further two pfennings to finish at DM1.6095 as nervous markets reacted badly to a report that the Conference Board, an independent think tank in New York, had said the dollar might fall 10 per cent against the D-Mark over the next 18 months. The US bond market outperformed European markets last week, as German bond prices fell 3 points, forcing 10-year German yields above US Treasuries for the first time since last November. The 10-year German Treuhand yield ended the week at 7.14 per cent, while the 10-year Treasury was at 7.115 per cent. Ms Marie Owens-Thomsen, international strategist at Midland Global Markets, said yields on German bonds might rise by another 50 basis points compared with short-term interest rates, suggesting that European markets would continue to underperform the US. Government bond prices are highly volatile, because of thin trading volume. Large buy or sell orders are causing sharp price movements, and there seems little hope of any immediate improvement in sentiment. 'Institutions generally don't like to buy falling markets,' said Mr Phillip Saunders, fixed interest investment director at Guinness Flight. 'Indeed, with the end of the quarter in sight, some people are throwing in the towel' and selling bonds. Italian bonds posted the worst losses last week amid concern about the new government's handling of the budget deficit. The difference between Italian and German 10-year bond yields, which reflects investor confidence, widened to 388 basis points from 310 a week earlier. The UK bond market outperformed other European markets. Currencies, Page 13 London stocks, Page 15 World stocks, Page 21</p>

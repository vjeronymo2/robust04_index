			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Three-month COPPER came to within a whisker of Dollars 2,500 a tonne on the LME against a background of US investment fund buying, with selling well absorbed. The rise represented the resumption of the recent uptrend after a spell of consolidation, with early gains prompted by Far Eastern buying, dealers said. In afternoon trading Comex copper futures were setting lifetime highs on the back of continued fund buying. LME ZINC leapt higher during kerb trading, with speculative buying pushing the three-month price above Dollars 1,300 a tonne. New York arabica COFFEE futures were firm at midday on renewed short covering after Monday's fall. Analysts said sentiment that Brazil's coffee sector might be getting closer to a unified proposal on an international price support plan lent background support. In London, where robusta coffee closed ahead, news that Brazil would be happy with a 20m bag share of a global quota of 70m bags was seen as mildly constructive. In Chicago SOYABEANS were firmer at midday on concerns that hot temperatures next week could endanger the developing crops, traders said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

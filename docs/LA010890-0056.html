			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ERRATIC BUT GOOD-SPIRITED 'REJOICE IN L.A.' BENEFITS EDUCATION  </P> <P> The sound of gospel music may make some cynics hide their wallets in their  boots but, when it's good, it's hard to top.  </P> <P> That lesson was evident during Saturday's erratic but good-spirited "Rejoice in  Los Angeles" concert at the Forum benefiting the Inner City Foundation for  Excellence in Education. It was a case of the sacred easily outshining and  out-stomping the secular.  </P> <P> After emcee Sinbad jokingly reassured the audience that there was no reason to  leave early because there wouldn't be a collection plate passed around, the  affair got off to a walloping start with more than half an hour of pure gospel.  </P> <P> If anyone did indeed leave at that point, they would have already seen the  evening's highlights: Even a heavy hitter like Stevie Wonder, the benefit's  headliner, was no match for the premature climax reached by the show-opening  appearances of the West Angeles Church of God in Christ Choir, the Faithful  Central Baptist Voices of Faith Choir and gospel singer Daryl Coley.  </P> <P> Later on, everyone's favorite poster boys for the preservation of a cappella,  Take 6, proved crowd favorites with a brief set of their original spirituals.  </P> <P> On the secular side, Motown's precocious Boys offered nice back flips and sorry  singing during their untuneful two-song appearance; the Cruzados, providing the  only rock 'n' roll of the evening, turned in a barely passable four-song set;  advertised female vocal trio Expose failed to show up at all, and Wonder, as  much a welcome benefit perennial as Jackson Browne in recent years, seemed to  have no plan of action for his sporadically pleasing, low-energy, show-closing  performance.  </P> <P> At first, Wonder settled for sequencer-driven versions of a few hits, backed  only by a rhythm section; then he played piano on a couple of nice, jazzy  ballads; then he curiously started giving the microphone (and even his piano)  away to other, unknown singers.  </P> <P> Suddenly, it was time for the climactic appearance of the All-Star Celebrity  Choir, which first tentatively backed Wonder on "Ebony and Ivory" and then  collectively mauled Bob Dylan's defenseless "Forever Young," the theme song of  the benefit. Against a quasi-funky backing, various stars half-sang  half-verses, "We Are the World"-style, and Edward James Olmos even unveiled a  new verse about staying in school.  </P></p>

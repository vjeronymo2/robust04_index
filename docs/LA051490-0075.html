			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STREET SMART: TIMING ISN'T RIGHT FOR NEW TRAFFIC SIGNAL  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> During my commute to work, I head south on Euclid Street and turn left onto  Talbert Avenue in Fountain Valley. But since the installation of a new signal  just down Talbert at Newhope Street, my commute time has doubled.  </P> <P> My concern is the timing of the two signals. While making a left onto Talbert  from Euclid, traffic is continuously stopped in the middle of the intersection  because of a red light at Newhope, creating a hazard.  </P> <P> It appears that the timing of the Euclid and Newhope lights are not in sync.  Why is this? It seems that in order to keep traffic flowing safely, the timing  of the signals needs to be changed.  </P> <P> David M. Faris  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P> <P> There has indeed been some trouble with those signals. Jeff Sinn, Fountain  Valley city engineer, said the pedestrian button at the Newhope signal has been  malfunctioning, triggering the light to respond as if someone were trying to  cross the street. The result is a longer red for folks headed eastbound on  Talbert Avenue.  </P> <P> Sinn said that problem is being rectified. The city is also installing a master  computer to control signal lights throughout the city, which will allow traffic  engineers at City Hall to fine-tune the signal timing as the day progresses,  better customizing it to the vagaries of traffic.  </P> <P> Even then, he cautioned, life will be far from peachy for people turning left  from Euclid onto Talbert. The priority on Talbert is to keep the signals  synchronized for traffic headed eastbound. Unless they time it just right, left  turners may end up hitting an occasional red light at Newhope, he said.  </P> <P> "You have to get a compromise as best you can," Sinn noted, adding that the  city will try to give additional weight in the mornings to left turners so they  have a better chance of getting a green light through Newhope.  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> I'm really disappointed in your piece about window tinting (April 30). You're  so busy trying to look into other cars it's lucky you're alive. Keep your eyes  on the road, buddy!  </P> <P> I agree that dark window tint should be prohibited on driver's and passenger's  windows. But there is nothing wrong with having a light to medium tint. From  personal experience, I think it's safe and fantastic.  </P> <P> I was in a car accident. My head hit the side window, which was tinted. I think  the tinting helped keep the glass from flying and cutting my face and my child.  The glass shattered, but stayed intact. Also, if someone tries to break into  your car, there is no way they can get through the tinting film to get  anything.  </P> <P> I think your article was ridiculous and a waste of time. I love window tint in  my home and car. It preserves, protects and it's safe.  </P> <P> Brenda Smyth  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P> <P> Preserves, protects and is safe, eh? Sounds like a nice commercial endorsement.  </P> <P> Yours was one of several letters and phone calls spawned by the April 30 column  that dealt with window tinting. Seems there are lots of folks out there who  love the stuff. That's fine, gang. I was just trying to quote the law as  recited by the California Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> Several people said the Highway Patrol has something of a vendetta against  tinted windows simply because of a fear that the blackened sheets of glass can  hide an occupant with a gun, putting an approaching officer in danger.  </P> <P> Others felt I should have more forcefully stated that windows can legally be  tinted after a car has left the showroom floor as long as the windshield and  front side windows are left untouched and mirrors are installed on both sides.  </P> <P> One man called to note that the law allows people with medical conditions such  as skin cancer to tint all their windows. Makes sense to me.  </P> <P> Another caller disputed a Highway Patrol spokeswoman's claim that the darkened  windows are more dangerous at night because they create visibility problems. He  said there was no scientific proof. I won't hold my breath for that.  </P> <P> But let me make one thing perfectly clear: I do not spend all my time looking  into other people's cars. I have enough trouble keeping my own jalopy pointed  in a straight line.  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> Referring to the new diamond lane on the San Diego Freeway: On the freeways in  Hawaii they have signs posted that tell what the fine is for violating the  car-pool lane.  </P> <P> Maybe if Caltrans would post some signs along there, some of these turkeys  would give a second thought about getting into there.  </P> <P> Les Beauchamp  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P> <P> Funny you should mention this. Signs reading, "Carpool Violation $246 Minimum  Fine," recently went up at several spots along the Costa Mesa Freeway. If the  signs, which were paid for by the Orange County Transportation Commission,  prove to be an effective deterrent, we may soon see similar placards sprout  along the San Diego Freeway car-pool lanes.  </P></p>

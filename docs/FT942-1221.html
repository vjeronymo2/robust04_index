			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Kohl surges ahead of SPD standard bearer Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has moved four points clear of its election rival, Mr Rudolf Scharping's Social Democratic party (SPD), in the latest German opinion poll, for the first time in three years. The two percentage point gain for the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), comes just four months before the general election in October, and confirms the trend in the recent European elections. At the same time, two polls showed a growing lead for Mr Kohl in the personal popularity stakes, reversing the consistent trend of recent months. However, the latest forecasts do not show any clear majority for either a left-wing or right-wing coalition in the general election, due on October 16, leaving the final outcome still very much in doubt. The results of the Politbarometer poll, published last night by ZDF television, give Mr Kohl's CDU/CSU 40 per cent support if there were national elections tomorrow, compared with 36 per cent - down three points - for the SPD. The very sharp reversal undoubtedly reflects voters' perceptions after the European poll on June 12, but does not include any response to this week's SPD party conference, which could see some recovery in the party's fortunes. However, it augurs badly for the SPD's hopes of winning the most seats in tomorrow's election in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, where the party hopes to win power from the CDU. As far as personal popularity is concerned, both Politbarometer, and a separate poll by the Forsa institute in the weekly newspaper, Die Woche, put Mr Kohl well in front of Mr Scharping. The former gives the chancellor 48 per cent support, compared to 41 per cent for his challenger, reversing the 40:51 per cent position in May. Die Woche's poll gives Mr Kohl 42 per cent and Mr Scharping only 26 per cent, in response to the question: 'Whom would you elect directly as chancellor?' Party loses footing, Page 9</p>

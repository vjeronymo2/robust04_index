			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Courts floats subsidiary on Singapore stock market COURTS (Singapore), part of Courts, the UK home furnishing group, is making a public share offering prior to a listing on the main board of the Singapore stock exchange. The offering comprises 25m shares of 20 Singapore cents at 68 cents each to raise the equivalent of Pounds 6.3m. Courts (Singapore) was established in 1973 and now has five furnishing and electrical outlets in Singapore. It has established a reputation as an aggressive seller, becoming one of the biggest local retailers of household items. It plans to become the first company in Singapore to use TV advertising to publicise a flotation. The offering closes on November 3. Mr Albert Elphick, managing director in Singapore, said it was planned to open more stores there, increasing retail space by at least 50 per cent. He said although the local retail industry might be facing a downturn, the Singapore government's plans to upgrade and build new public housing should ensure a bright future for the company.</p>

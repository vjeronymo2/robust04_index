			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Arts: South Bank Schubert - Concert Although the South Bank took a leading role in developing the 'theme' or 'festival' as a focus of musical life in London, it has more recently allowed the running to be made by its rivals, as last autumn's ambitious Scandinavian festival at the Barbican and the Wigmore Hall showed. It may well have escaped the attention of most concert-goers that a Schubert 'series' (less than a theme, far less than a festival) has recently opened. A half dozen chamber music evenings at the Queen Elizabeth Hall during February promise some interesting items. A few choral and orchestral works are featured at the Royal Festival Hall, but spread over six months and probably totalling no more Schubert than we would have had anyway. This latter half of the series, devised by William Glock, looks like an attempt to balance the artistic books by sleight of hand. The 'Sundries' section includes a couple of novel make-weights, but two half concerts of choral music amount to the only unusual offerings of any substance. On Tuesday Franz Welser-Most conducted the first of these with the London Philharmonic, starting most promisingly with the Offertory 'Intende voci', D963. This is thought to be probably the last music that Schubert wrote. It has an inner calm, an ability to fix its eyes on horizons far distant even within its brief ten-minute span, that speaks powerfully of the Schubert of his final years. Its atmosphere takes time to dispel, but dissipate it did all too quickly, as it was followed by seemingly shallow youthful works - the Offertory 'Totus in corde lagueo' D136, a duet 'Auguste jam coelestium' D488 and the Mass No. 2 in G, all written in the composer's teens. A brighter attitude is called for, but that was manifested most noticeably here by Welser-Most driving on in the Mass's vivacious Gloria and Credo. The best of the solo music fell to the soprano Lynne Dawson, still sparkling of voice, but not uninhibited as she used to be. Too many phrases were tapered away into an artful piano. Kurt Azesberger and Simon Keenlyside were the tenor and baritone. Afterwards, a contrast. Welser-Most led the orchestra in Stravinsky's Firebird, complete, not the easiest of ballets to make work in the concert-hall; this performance, short on atmosphere at the start, took some while to work up momentum. When the spark did take, it ignited into a fiery Kastchei's Dance, headlong in pace. The score was performed in its earlier, lavish orchestration, but did not sound as impressive as I remember. At the 1991 Edinburgh Festival the brass around the hall made a thrilling effect. Here one hardly noticed there was anybody extra taking part.</p>

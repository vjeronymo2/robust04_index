			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dirk Achten: "Not Just Wait"] </F>   [Text] Jean-Luc Dehaene, a soccer fan and Belgian prime  minister, will probably not become the president of the European  Commission unless British Prime Minister John Major is ready to  lose face in public, and it certainly would not be the first  time. But even Dehaene's main sponsor, German Chancellor Helmut  Kohl, is inclined to put Dehaene on ice. It is called  realpolitik.    In the United Kingdom, Major's opposition to the 11 other  member states is being described by a considerable section of  his party as proof of bravery in the face of a steamroller,  steered by treacherous continental Europeans. The British prime  minister was applauded in his parliament.    What does Major reproach Dehaene for, because after all he  has to give some reason to justify his veto? That he is an  enthusiastic state interventionist and moreover a convinced  European federalist. Of course, in this country it does not have  to be explained that Dehaene is not a fanatic neoliberal. But  it is hard to imagine that his ideas are so far more to the left  than those of the Socialist Jacques Delors. The point about  being a European federalist is a very different story, because  here it is about the British way of seeing Europe, or rather  above all of not seeing it.    The United Kingdom, and certainly the present government  there, want to limit Europe to being as big a free-trade zone as  possible. Free trade, all the rest is superfluous or even highly  undesirable in the eyes of these British. There should be no  European works councils for large multinationals, preferably no  monetary union and no social legislation. Sometimes it gives  the impression that the British joined Europe to prevent a power  bloc forming in continental Europe within which they would have  no say or would only play second fiddle.    Therefore it is high time to give the United Kingdom what it  is apparently asking for: A special status somewhere on the  outside track, in such a way that the other countries, those  which want to go further, do not suffer any nuisance from it.  In fact it is already following this direction. The British  veto against Dehaene makes it clear that it must quickly follow  this path. It is a task for Belgian diplomacy among others.  Because what happened in Corfu will not be forgotten lightly.    Dehaene can now concentrate a little more on the problems in  his own country. Dehaene's prestige has increased. He has  evolved from being an electoral risk factor to someone who can  be put forward in elections by his party. In Europe, only the  British do not want to know about him, but what credibility do  the British still have in Europe?    Two major possibilities remain. Either Dehaene and the  Christian People's Party decide that it would be better to  immediately follow through on the impetus of the European  elections and not give the Flemish Liberal Democrats any chance  of recovery. That would mean early elections soon, but they are  not immediately conceivable in the prime minister's present  mood. Probably the choice will be for continuation, preferably  to the end of 1995.    That presupposes a government which does more than just wait  for its policies to bear fruit and then reap the harvest.  Therefore it requires a very serious budget for 1995, not a  paper operation which avoids the problems and reforms of the  social security system to give it real chances of survival.  Very quickly it should become clear if that is impossible, in  which case it would be better to give up immediately.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Injured boys -- A photo caption in Thursday editions of the Times incorrectly  identified Daveyon James, whose arm was broken in a car accident in South Los  Angeles. The story accompanying the photo also should have stated that an  injured playmate, David Jennings, was being treated for a broken thigh at  Martin Luther King, Jr./Drew Medical Center.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS STEPS TO FORE, 30-20;  </P> <P> LANCERS RALLY PAST CHANNEL ISLANDS TO BECOME FRONT-RUNNERS IN MARMONTE LEAGUE  </P> <P> No matter what, it seemed, Channel Islands High was always there for Thousand  Oaks -- on the horizon, lurking, plotting, waiting and matching win for win.  </P> <P> In seasons of the recent past, Thousand Oaks' and Channel Islands' football  teams have met later in the season, when the air is cooler and the Marmonte  League race is much, much hotter.  </P> <P> Friday night, however, the preseason favorites to finish 1-2 played in the  league opener at Thousand Oaks High, and fullback Chris Foster scored three  second-half touchdowns to lead the Lancers to a 30-20 victory.  </P> <P> "Last year," Thousand Oaks Coach Bob Richards said, "as we were winning we were  checking to see how Channel Islands did each week. At this point, it would have  been very demoralizing to lose this game."  </P> <P> Last season, Channel Islands won the match-up to forge a co-championship with  the Lancers. The year before, Thousand Oaks won, but Channel Islands captured  the title outright. The title, it seems, always hangs in the balance when the  two play.  </P> <P> It might again this year, but it will be savored in hindsight. Both teams have  five league games to play.  </P> <P> "I feel bad we lost the game but I don't feel bad about the way we played  tonight," Channel Islands Coach Joel Gershon said. "Before it's over, we'll be  heard from."  </P> <P> Channel Islands' offense -- especially its passing game -- was loud and clear  from the start. Quarterback Mark Contreras, who had completed 18 of 41 passes  for 353 yards in three previous games, was seven of 12 against the Lancers for  167 yards and three touchdowns -- two to returning all-league receiver Shawn  Young.  </P> <P> "I coach the defensive secondary, and, boy, that guy did a heck of a job this  week," Richards said, laughing. "Nobody better offer me toast tomorrow  morning."  </P> <P> Young's second scoring reception was one of 40 yards, eight seconds into the  fourth quarter, that gave Channel Islands a 20-16 lead.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks, however, fired back. Despite not completing a pass in the game,  the Lancers were able to control the tempo via their ground game.  </P> <P> Foster, who with 6:48 left in the third quarter scored from two yards, scored  again on Thousand Oaks' next possession after Young's touchdown.  </P> <P> His four-yard blast over right guard completed a six-play, 66-yard drive that  gave the Lancers a 23-20 lead with 9:08 to play. The key play was a 39-yard  reverse by wide receiver Jim Magallanes.  </P> <P> Then, after Ronnie Cruz intercepted a Contreras pass, Thousand Oaks added its  final touchdown when Foster plunged in from the one with 5:47 left.  </P> <P> Unable to move the ball consistently in the first two quarters, Thousand Oaks  turned to its special teams for a lift.  </P> <P> Moments after Young's 46-yard touchdown reception made the score 14-3 with 22  seconds left in the first half, Cruz dashed 83 yards with the kickoff for a  touchdown.  </P> <P> Cruz broke through the middle of the wedge at the Thousand Oaks 40-yard line  before cutting left and outrunning the Raiders the rest of the way.  </P> <P> "I just think we got down when they made a couple of big plays and we rose to  the occasion," Cruz said. "We could've done it all game. It took us a little  while to get going."  </P> <P> The Lancers opened the game with a 57-yard drive that appeared to be sending a  message to Channel Islands. Mike Lindsay carried six times for 47 yards as  Thousand Oaks moved to the Raiders' five-yard line before bogging down.  </P> <P> Jason Ybarra's subsequent 22-yard field goal gave the Lancers a 3-0 lead.  </P></p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Game of give and take - David Dodwell sees signs of closer co-operation between environmental groups and trade policymakers Environmental lobby groups, so long at loggerheads with trade policymakers bent on liberalising international trade, have in recent weeks been drawn into an intimate embrace. At meetings with staff of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), and last week with national delegations at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, the groups have been provided with an unprecedented platform to voice their concerns. Whether their arguments prove strong enough to moderate national policies on international trade rules has yet to be seen. They almost certainly come too late to have any direct impact on the outcome of the long-delayed Uruguay Round of world trade talks. But the fact that they have been drawn into the debate on reform of trade rules, rather than viewed by governments with a mixture of hostility and suspicion, is nevertheless significant. By the time some 50 environmental and development campaigners sat down last week at a joint meeting of the OECD's trade and environment committees, they had honed a common position, focusing on six principal areas of concern: The need for internationally-agreed standards, particularly on food and farm products, to provide a floor from which environmental standards should rise, rather than a ceiling which governments can aim towards. Indicative is concern over plans to harmonise the EC's 'E-numbers' of permitted food additives. Ahead of harmonisation, the UK has a list of 300 approved additives. This compares with 150 in Germany and Greece, for example. After harmonisation, all EC member states will have a list of 411 approved additives - an alarming backward step, as far as environmentalists are concerned. The result is that food products that in the past have been barred from Germany because they include prohibited additives may now be freely imported. The need for the Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO), a powerful new body proposed as part of the Uruguay round of trade reforms to oversee international trade, to give high and formal priority to environmental concerns and in particular sustainable development. The need for 'pace-setting' governments keen to set environmental standards higher than the international norm to be free to do so. This includes a more controversial conviction that such pace-setters should have a right to act unilaterally in blocking imports from countries with lower standards or dirty industrial processes. This worry strikes a chord with trade economists - so long as environmental standards are not being exploited by protectionist industries. For example, why should Sweden not be allowed to ban the import of goods containing CFCs if there is strong public pressure for the government to take a tough line, and sound scientific evidence to back the move? But such unilateral powers would become more controversial if Austria and the Netherlands, for example, insisted that all timber imports be 'forest friendly' - that is, the wood must come from forests that are being sustainably logged. The mind boggles as to how a customs officer is to distinguish 'forest friendly' timber from other kinds. The need for industry to 'internalise' the environmental cost of a product - ranging from electricity generators incorporating the true cost of treating nuclear waste to timber prices which include reimbursement to exporting countries for their loss of biodiversity. While trade economists are beginning to come round to this argument, they have yet to find an agreed set of formulae for measuring the environmental cost to be internalised. They are also anxious that industries should not be allowed to use these costs as an excuse to call for duties on imports from countries that are not bearing higher environmental costs. The need for industrial countries to recognise that they bear the main responsibility for the cost of environmental improvement in poor countries - both because they have the wealth to afford it, and because they are the principal source of globe-threatening pollution. This involves considering schemes such as recycling cash raised through tariffs back to developing countries to improve their environment. The need for international trade bodies to be more open and answerable. This would include not just the Gatt, but also organisations such as the Rome-based Codex Alimentarius, which sets international food standards. Trade economists are alarmed by various implications of these proposals. Several proposals condone protectionism and make environmental lobbyists easy prey for industry groups anxious to keep foreign competitors at bay. Others are administratively unmanageable. Some confer on powerful governments a right to interfere in the affairs of less powerful countries. Debate in the OECD and in the Gatt nevertheless appears to have made progress in paring down the areas of difference, and in helping either side to recognise the merits of the other's arguments. Not least it appears to have reduced the chronic suspicion with which free-traders and environmentalists have traditionally glared at each other. Groups emerging from last week's OECD discussions say that some intractable areas remain - most significantly over a country's right to attack 'process' standards, and to take environmental measures which interfere with another countries' sovereign right to set their own environmental priorities. At a more general level, advocates of free trade are likely to remain irreconcilable with environmentalists over their fondness for regulation. But it now appears possible that the Gatt will reconsider its draft proposals for the MTO, giving it a more explicit brief to take account of the need for trade to contribute to sustainable development, rather than trade growth on any terms. Trade policymakers also appear ready to pay serious attention to building into the price of products their true environmental cost. For their part, many environmental campaigners will continue to shun economic growth, arguing that the west's relentless quest for growth is a fundamental cause of environmental problems. Still more challenge the claim that growth - and the wealth it generates - will provide the resources needed to protect the environment. But an increasing number appear to acknowledge that strong environmental policies are unlikely to grow out of weak or recession-ridden economies. Since trade liberalisation is powerfully linked with strong economic growth, so there is a clearer recognition that free trade need not be an adversary in the fight for higher environmental standards, but indeed could be an ally. 'There is no question that OECD delegates have become much more sensitised to environmental concerns,' an OECD official said yesterday. She signalled that the next step would be to call a meeting between the OECD and industrial interests, probably in November. Beyond that, the ambition is to meet jointly with both environmentalists and industrial interests, probably early in 1993.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Arts: If wishes were horses .. / Review of Richard Hamilton at the Tate A full retrospective at the Tate Gallery is not an unusual honour for a living British artist, but it is a signal honour nonetheless. It was denied to Graham Sutherland, for example, in his lifetime, and is one which Lucian Freud and Frank Auerbach have yet to enjoy. To go on with the comparison and, with Melbourne relish it further for having 'no damned merit to it' may be going too far, but to look down the list is to begin to wonder whether merit has much to do with it. Richard Hamilton is now 70 and this present retrospective is his second at the Tate. The first was in 1970, and so familiar does the work remain - indeed much is the very same - that it seems like yesterday. But the familiarity is no mystery. Hamilton has never suffered by lack of documentation - ever copious on his own account as well as critics and curators ever willing to come forward to explain him to himself and to the world at large. Even by 1970 he was that rare creature in British art, a truly international figure, and so he has remained, his reputation resting quite as much on his general influence as on any physical work of art he might have made. Here was the neo-Dadaist who brought Marcel Duchamp back into the light as the spiritual father of modernism, the conceptual artist avant la lettre, the founding theorist of Pop Art. Here, above all, was the teacher who asserted the fundamental precedence of the idea over the practice. 'In the beginning was the word.' Hamilton has indeed lived and thriven by the written and spoken word. There is no proscription on writing and theorising on the visual arts, but for an artist whose creative efforts must be centred upon the work of art as such, the physical entity as the vehicle of his experience, the dangers that march with them are great. To the would-be creative writer, criticism and theory afford a perfectly legitimate opportunity, for the medium of language is the medium of the chosen art. Who would deny that Johnson or Hazlitt, Baudelaire or Pater, Eliot or Woolf were true artists, though wearing a critic's hats? The poor visual artist, however, is not so lucky. Whatever the quality of his ideas, and of the language into which he may choose to cast them by way of exegesis, he is still left with the work he must make, the painting to put on the wall or the sculpture in the middle of the room. When we come to look at Hamilton's works, as they are presented on the wall rather than in his head, the doubts are inescapable. From first to last, they are, where his own hand is evident, quite simply badly done, weak in the drawing, flaccid and insensitive in the handling of the paint. The image chosen may be striking enough - a bland Hotel Foyer, the H-Block Dirty Protest, an Andrex advertisement, Hugh Gaitskell as a Monster of Filmland, Mick Jagger arrested, Marilyn Monroe, an American limousine, a Hoover - but whichever it is, Hamilton's own intervention, once we get beyond the presentation, is almost invariably singularly inept. Only with collage does he show a truer assurance, and collage is the most seductive and facile of the graphic media. And it is to collage in the larger sense that he has always been drawn in practice, bringing together, in his paintings, sculptures and installations, elements already made, elements, more to the point, that he does not have to make himself. His career-long preoccupation with the camera and now the computer, and all the mechanical devices of print-making, bear the same rationalisation. Hamilton makes much of his experience as a student, even showing some youthful schematic studies of the figure by which to establish his academic credentials, but the demonstration is unconvincing. Returning to the Academy Schools after the War, he was soon asked to leave for 'not profiting from the instruction given', his self-justifying retort being that there was none by which to profit. After National Service he migrated to the Slade, and by 1953 was a lecturer in the Fine Art School of what is now Newcastle University. There through the 1950s, in collaboration with Victor Pasmore, he developed the principles of Basic Design upon which the authorities were persuaded to remodel the country's art schools, the effects of which reform we live with still. Two landscape paintings of 1954, 'Transitions III &amp; IV', show what he was about at this time, Pasmore-esque in their tentativeness, uncertain in their perspectives, woefully inadequate in their drawing, with hints at Cezanne and Seurat to mark their pretensions. And what, in the cant question of 1960s teaching, are these works about? An enquiry into the nature of pictorial space perhaps? The flat surface of the canvas? The mark? The moving eye? Nothing at all? For an intelligent man to wish to be an artist is an honourable ambition, but to suppose that it may be achieved merely by the intelligent application of the will is to suppose, pace the beggar's long experience, that wishes were horses. Talent, touch, intuition, technique - bogey-words all - are also necessary, and require long study in the cultivation. The sad truth, for Hamilton as for all of us, is that they cannot be fudged or evaded. We can only feel for him in his difficulty. This is not to doubt Hamilton's sincerity in any way, but the Emperor in the story was sincerity itself, for all his vanity. Hamilton has been no less ill-served by his courtiers. The Andrex 'Soft Landscape' paintings of the early 1970s, air-brushed and daubed onto a photographic base, invoke, so a caption tells us, the 'magical ambiguity' of a Watteau. Who, we might then ask ourselves, has only stood before Watteau with his eyes closed? It was ever easier to strike an attitude than paint a picture.

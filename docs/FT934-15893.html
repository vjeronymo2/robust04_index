			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Major urges party to unite behind traditional values: Appeal on law and order, family and responsibility gives prime minister breathing space MR JOHN MAJOR won a breathing space for his premiership last night after a successful plea to the Conservative party at its Blackpool conference to unite behind its traditional values. In a speech tailored to the preoccupation of the party faithful with law and order, the family and individual responsibility, the prime minister dismissed speculation about his hold on the leadership. Referring to the furore this week over Lady Thatcher's forthcoming memoirs, he joked: 'I'm not about to write my memoirs.' He added: 'There is a job to be done, a job I was elected to do, and I propose to go on doing it.' In a thinly veiled rebuke to his critics on the back benches, he continued: 'We cannot have a lobby against every difficult decision. Decisions are what governments are for and we have to take them.' Mr Major then made a deliberate pitch to cement an alliance with the Ulster Unionists that could effectively double his thin majority at Westminster. He flatly rejected any prospect of negotiations with the IRA or Sinn Fein as long as they were responsible for, or supported, violence. Emphasising his commitment to the Unionist majority, he added: 'We are not going to bargain away the people's democratic rights.' His closing speech to the conference was rewarded with a 12-minute standing ovation, an enthusiastic response that marked the end of a week in which the government has managed to contain the disenchantment of Tory party activists. It was also judged by cabinet colleagues to have closed off completely the remote possibility that Mr Major might face a direct challenge to his leadership next month. But cabinet ministers acknowledged that the return of MPs to Westminster for the reopening of parliament later this month might could mark a renewed outbreak of internal strife in the party over taxation, spending and the privatisation of British Rail. The rightwing tone of the speech - emphasising the Conservatives' commitment to traditional values and calling for 'a return to basics' in education - marked a drive to win back disgruntled Tory supporters. Judging that the voters have become increasingly angry with what he called 'fashionable opinion', Mr Major told the conference: 'It is time to return to the old core values.' He reserved his toughest phrases for law and order. The attack on crime would be the centrepiece of the government's legislative programme, and the measures announced this week by the home secretary represented only the first instalment. He added that the government would introduce new legislation to clamp down on pornography and impose tougher sanctions against child pornography. The deliberate attempt to direct the Conservatives' message to the elderly was reinforced by specific pledges for pensioners. There would be no charges for National Health Service prescriptions for the elderly, no charges for hospital stays and no move to stop pensioners receiving their state benefits at rural post offices. Mr Major also bowed to the growing mood of Euroscepticism by emphasising that the Conservatives would fight next year's European elections on a platform of opposition to a centralised Europe.

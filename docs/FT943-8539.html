			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Tokyo protests to Moscow Japan yesterday protested to Moscow after a Japanese fishing boat in disputed waters was fired on by Russian coastguards and its crew detained, Gordon Cramb reports. At the same time, Moscow launched legal proceedings against the captain of the boat that was hit by Russian gunfire off the disputed Kurile islands off north-eastern Japan on Monday. One crew member was injured in the incident. The Kuriles were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the second world war and their status continues to bedevil relations between Japan and Russia. In Moscow Mr Koji Watanabe, the Japanese ambassador, called on Mr Alexander Panov, Russian deputy foreign minister, to complain about the 'highly regrettable shooting and seizure'. Russian reports said two unmarked boats were fishing in its waters and when challenged, ignored warning shots and attempted to head for home.</p>

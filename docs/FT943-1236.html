			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Berlusconi set for showdown talks with unions on pensions The Italian government will today make a third and possibly final attempt to convince the sceptical trade union movement to accept proposals for pension reform. The proposals, already watered down last week to meet union objections, are central in the preparation of the 1995 budget, which has to be presented to parliament by Friday. The centre-right coalition government's credibility with financial markets hangs on the final form of the budget. The lira has been under pressure since early August because of fears that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, will lack the leadership to push through a convincing austerity package. Before meeting trade union leaders, Mr Berlusconi has scheduled a summit of his coalition partners. This is intended to co-ordinate the government's final position; but Mr Berlusconi must also resolve the increasingly thorny problem of the future of the RAI, the state broadcasting organisation. Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the populist Northern League, is committed to introducing legislation to overturn recent government appointments to the new management and editorial control of the RAI. The League has forged an alliance with the opposition, which is worried that the government now controls both public and commercial television. A League-opposition alliance would have a parliamentary majority and the government could be completely humiliated. Over the weekend Pres-ident Oscar Luigi Scalfaro gave implicit backing to the League and opposition protests, and warned that television must be run with an even hand in the interest of all Italians. This continued guerr-illa activity against Mr Berlusconi from among his own coalition partners risks impinging on the preparation of the budget. Matters are further complicated by a report, which is due out this week, by three legal experts whom Mr Berlusconi has asked to draw up proposals to avoid a conflict of interest between his ownership of his Fininvest media empire and his role as prime minister. For the 1995 budget, the government is seeking to find up to L50,000bn (Pounds 20.3bn) in extra revenues and spending cuts to hold the public sector deficit in 1995 to below 9 per cent of gross domestic product. Under pressure from the trade unions, the government has reduced its emphasis on spending cuts and placed more importance on revenues. But the precise amount to be found from cuts in pension benefits still has to be negotiated. The treasury originally sought L8,000bn but last week this figure appeared increasingly unrealistic. The unions are threatening a general strike if the government is unable to bridge the gap in their positions. On Saturday, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, the head of Fiat and recognised spokesman for Italian business opinion, hosted an informal dinner for Mr Berlusconi and industrialists. Though the occasion was reportedly amicable, it was nevertheless a clear indication of the industrialists' growing impatience at the series of own-goals committed by the five month-old Berlusconi government. Mr Agnelli is understood to have conveyed the industrialists' fears if the budget fails to convince financial markets.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 4 (XINHUA) -- More than 2,000 students  from 40 universities in the Seoul area demonstrated here today,  urging the United States to withdraw its troops from South Korea  and opposing the government's decision to open the country's  rice market.    The students condemned the U.S. for posing a nuclear war  threat to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and  creating a war atmosphere on the Korean peninsula.    They called for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and a peace  pact between the U.S. and the DPRK.    Some 37,000 American troops are now stationed in South Korea  and the U.S. deployed Patriot missiles in South Korea last month  in the name of enhancing its ally's defense capabilities against  the DPRK.    The demonstrators also accused the South Korean government  of  opening the domestic rice market and called on the National  Assembly not to approve the government's final documents related  to the world trade accord of the Uruguay Round.    Police forces were mobilized but no clash was reported  during  the demonstration.    Earlier today, some 400 students staged a demonstration near  the American center in Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South  Cholla Province, charging the U.S. with creating a war  atmosphere on the Korean peninsula.    The students tried to storm into the American center but  were  blocked by riot police firing tear gas.    A clash between the police and students wielding paint  bottles and rocks followed, wounding some 10 policemen and  students who were then taken to nearby hospitals for treatment.</p>

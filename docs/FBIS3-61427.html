			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. V. Yevstropov, Yu. V. Zhilyayev, N. Nazarov, </F> D. V. Sergeyev, L. M. Fedorov, RAS Technical Institute of  Physics, St. Petersburg, Russia]    [Abstract] Epitaxial phosphide-gallium p-n-structures on a  Si-substrate were obtained by the method of gas-phase epitaxy in  an open chloride system. Their electrical and electroluminescent  characteristics were examined. The current-voltage  characteristic at small values of current (6x10[.sup]-8[/] -  6x10[.sup]- 4[/] A/cm[.sup]-2[/]) exhibits a tunnelling  behavior. At direct currents, it is exponential (with a  pre-exponential multiplier 10[.sup]-8[/] A/cm[.sup]2[/]  and a 75 meV characteristic energy); at reverse currents, it is  to a power 4). The voltage cut-off is about 1.85 V, the  breakdown voltage is 12- 18 V and the differential resistance is  4.5 Ohm. The capacitance- voltage characteristic is to the  second power with a cut-off voltage of 1.8 V, the slope  1.75x10[.sup]-4[/] nF[.sup]- 2[/]/Vxcm[.sup]-4[/]. With  a reverse bias, the obtained structures emit a visible light.  The electroluminescence spectrum is wide, decreasing to the side  of large energies of photons in the 1.6 - 2.5 eV range; the  quantum output of the electroluminescence comprises  10[.sup]-3[/]%, and does not depend on current. The  totality  of experimentally obtained data agrees with the concept of  avalanche breakdown (with a reverse bias above 12 - 18 V), due  to shock ionization, which generates the light radiation.

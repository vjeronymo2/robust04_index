			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / North Yemeni forces seize Aden suburbs: Prospects of intervention diminish as stranglehold tightens on secessionist South North Yemeni forces yesterday seized two northern suburbs of the beleaguered city of Aden as their strangulation of the secessionist south appeared close to delivering outright victory in the two-month civil war. Forces loyal to the Sanaa government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh have now secured, after several days of fierce fighting, the south's second city of Mukallah, its al-Rayan airport which had been critical to the southern airforce, and the south's sole oil producing operations at Masilah, east of Aden. The self-declared southern government also lost immediate hope of formal recognition by its more powerful neighbours yesterday, when a meeting in Kuwait of the Gulf-Co-operation Council (comprising Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar) as well as Egypt and Syria concluded with a statement condemning the fighting and calling for a ceasefire, but shied away from supporting the south's secession. However, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, Kuwait's foreign minister, said later that if fighting in Aden descended into 'a tragedy', then 'we will have to take our measures, and those are possibly recognition of the (southern) republic' - though the course of fighting threatens to leave less to be recognised. Arab League officials are due to fly this morning to Sanaa in a further attempt to urge enforcement of United Nations ceasefire resolutions, but diplomats said they thought President Saleh was determined to see the war through to victory. 'As Saleh makes more and more ground, he's less and less likely to want to stop,' said one western official. Witnesses quoted by news agencies in Aden yesterday said northern troops had won control of the heavily populated suburbs of Sheikh Othman and Mansoura, around 8km north of the rocky peninsula which houses both the port and city centre. Fighting was continuing at the airport, which lies between northern forces and the city centre. The International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva said humanitarian conditions continued to worsen, and fighting was so intense that local Red Cross workers had been unable to repair damaged water wells, vital to the city of 450,000 now more than three weeks without fresh water. An official said two Red Cross-supplied vessels off Aden remained offshore, unable to dock and unload medical and sanitation equipment for want of security guarantees from officials either in the south or north. He said hospitals were overcrowded in Aden, Mukhalla and Taiz, all in south Yemen, but said there were no accurate estimates of casualties after the past few days' heavy bombardment of Aden. Canadian Occidental said in the group's Calgary base that its Masilah operation - which produces 160,000 barrels a day - had resumed pumping after a brief overnight closure between Monday and Tuesday 'to test our shutdown mechanisms' and production continued 'without any problem at all'. The company said the Masilah area had come under northern control in the past two days. Diplomats in Sanaa were also quoted by Reuter as saying output was back on stream from the north's main Marib oilfield, which Yemeni officials said at the weekend had been halted by a southern air raid last week. The Dallas headquarters of Hunt Oil, which operates the 190,000 b/d operation, refused to comment.</p>

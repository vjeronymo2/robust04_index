			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Technical rally boosts share prices THE UK stock market broke its seven-day run of losses yesterday but moved uncertainly at first before responding firmly to the latest statistics on domestic unemployment, industrial production and wage trends. Trading results from Royal Insurance helped sustain the brighter trend in the sector and water stocks responded favourably to the official report on the prospective costs of meeting environmental demands. The broader range of the market was featured by sharp but irregular movements among the Footsie stocks. Equities opened lower with investors discouraged by a bearish review of dividend prospects at Barclays bank from a UK brokerage house. Share prices took a further knock when stock index futures opened lower and the Footsie was nearly ten points down. By mid-morning it was below the 2,300 mark which has proved a painful testing point for market confidence over the past fortnight. However, the clutch of economic data, showing a small increase in production and some moderation in wages and unemployment, gave relief to a stock market badly unsettled by economic uncertainty. Although buying support was not on any great scale, the Footsie climbed steadily into positive territory. London gathered pace when Wall Street opened firmly and, at best, the Footsie was more than 20 points ahead. However, gains were trimmed as the early advance in New York was reversed in UK trading hours. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,318 for a net gain on the day of 14.9. Trading volume remained very disappointing and the market became very quiet before the end of the session. Seaq volume reached a mere 441.3m shares. Wednesday's 406.2m reflected retail business worth only Pounds 699.6m, still woefully inadequate in terms of profitable trading for the London-based securities industry. With some other European markets remaining on the downward tack, London analysts were wary of changing their views after yesterday's rise, which was regarded as largely technical; many traders needed to buy stock to meet selling orders taken aboard since the equity trading account started on Monday. Bearish views on the stock market continued to dominate the investment stage. At Goldman Sachs, Sushil Wadhwani said that if the UK economy shows no sign of recovering in a year, he still expects that the Footsie will then trade around 2,000. In the near term, he predicts a technical bounce in an oversold market. While yesterday's economic data gave the stock market some cause for a revival of confidence, attention is now focused keenly on the July retail price index, due at 11.30am this morning. Expectations are for a slight rise, perhaps of 0.1 per cent on the month, to show an annualised rate of 4.2 per cent on the year, excluding mortgage charges. The resumed flow of economic data will continue next week with the July Distribution Survey from the Confederation of British Industry and the latest Public Sector borrowing statistics.</p>

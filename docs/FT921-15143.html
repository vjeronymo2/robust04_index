			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Abusers of premium phone service face cut-off A CRACK DOWN on abuses of premium-rate telephone services, which customers pay 48p a minute to use, was announced yesterday by the watchdog responsible for the industry. The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services unveiled a code of practice which Mr Louis Blom-Cooper, its chairman, described as the most comprehensive the watchdog had produced. Premium-rate services include the heavily advertised 0898 numbers. The code was necessary because the industry was constantly developing new services, Mr Blom-Cooper said. Last year the watchdog dealt with 6,500 allegations of abuse. The code, which comes into effect on February 1, deals with specific types of abuse - some of which are described in the panel - as well as general principles. It is tougher than the previous code drawn up in 1989. Mr Blom-Cooper said the watchdog had tried to find a balance between taking too lenient a line on abuses and protecting consumers excessively. The code contains stronger penalties for those who break it. The watchdog will be able to recommend that an offending company should be barred from providing a particular category of service or that its premium-rate lines should be cut off for a defined period. Penalties will be particularly severe for companies which persistently break the rules. Companies which are found to have broken the rules will have to pay costs incurred by the watchdog in investigating the abuse. In a small number of cases these could run into thousands of pounds. The watchdog's authority stems from the telecommunications licences of BT, Mercury Communications and Vodafone. It is able to recommend to these network operators that service providers breaking the code are cut off. Mr Blom-Cooper said the watchdog had received 'total co-operation' from the operators. He said most premium-rate services, of which there are about 15,000, provide the public with useful infor-mation and entertainment. The Association of Telephone Information and Entertainment Providers, which represents the industry, said it hoped the code would not be constantly changed. BOGUS JOBS An advertisement says Pounds 12,000 can be earned repackaging batteries. A jobless person pays Pounds 6 on a call only to discover the job does not exist or is not what it seems. Under the new rules adverts will have to state the full cost of the call and advertisers will have to be able to prove the jobs are real. COMPETITIONS An advertisement promises a holiday to winners of a telephone quiz. The quiz lasts half an hour, costs Pounds 15, and contestants do not automatically win, even if they answer all questions correctly. Adverts will now have to explain how the games work and how much they cost. FANTASY GAMES Callers are drawn into a tantalising game looking for dragons. It is only when they receive their phone bills that they find they have been charged Pounds 10 for each time they played. Now, interactive entertainment calls will be limited to 10 minutes unless callers are told how much they have spent every five minutes. TEENAGE LINES A boy spends Pounds 6 listening to a recording giving advice on how to get a girlfriend and the best ways of kissing. Services aimed at young people will now be restricted to a maximum of seven and a half minutes, which would mean a maximum charge of Pounds 3.60, after which they will be cut off. SEXY DATES A woman's name and phone number are given to a 'wife-swapping' line as a hoax. She is pestered by people wanting dates. Now, callers to date lines will hear a reference number, not phone numbers. To get the phone number they will have to speak to an operator who will sift out cranks.</p>

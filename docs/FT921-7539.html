			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher becomes 'freelance writer'  -MPs' interests MRS Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, has become a 'freelance writer, lecturer and broadcaster', according to the latest annual register of MPs' business interests, published yesterday. She also records some staff to help with her lecture tours in the US and Japan, and visits around the world. Sir Geoffrey Howe, former deputy prime minister, is now listed as non-executive director of BICC, the international cables and construction group, and Glaxo Holdings, the pharmaceuticals group. He is also a special adviser to Jones Day Reavis and Pogue (International Law Firm), and lists occasional fees from lecturing, broadcasting and writing. It is the first time these activities have been set out in the register, as last year's register was published too close to the Tory leadership contest of November 1990 for the departing protagonists to have acquired their new interests. Other former ministers have continued to add to their business activities. Mr Nicholas Ridley, former trade and industry secretary, has become a consultant to Whittingdale Holdings, the unit trust group, and Mr Nigel Lawson, former chancellor, has joined the international advisory board of Creditanstalt, the bank. Apart from his brief connection with Maxwell Communication Corporation, Mr Peter Walker, former Welsh secretary, lists new interests as a director of the Vietnam Fund, which will invest in joint ventures with Vietnamese companies. He is also an adviser to the Treuhandanstalt, the body for privatising former east German companies. Under parliamentary rules MPs have to register interests as they are acquired, but the register itself is printed only annually. The all-party committee responsible for the register is due to publish a report early next month on tightening up the registration and declaration of interests.

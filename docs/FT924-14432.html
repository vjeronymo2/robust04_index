			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Warning on 'shoehorning' sterling back into ERM TWO Conservative economic commentators took the argument about the government's new strategy to the conference fringe yesterday, and reached diametrically opposed conclusions about whether sterling's suspension from the European exchange rate mechanism was a liberation. Sir Alan Walters, Lady Thatcher's former economic adviser, welcomed the return to monetary targets but accused Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of fudging the issue. He warned that the political imperative of pressing ahead with the Maastricht treaty would ensure that the pound would shortly be 'shoehorned' back into the ERM within the next six to nine months without the UK's conditions for reform being met. 'The idea that we are not going back until the conditions are met is a statement that we are not going to get on the Maastricht bus,' Sir Alan told a fringe meeting organised by the rightwing Selsdon group. Sir Alan suggested that the mechanism would last no more than 18 months after sterling's re-entry before exploding again. He reserved particular criticism for the 'ominous' statement that the government was not going to target the exchange rate but was going to take it into account. That meant, he argued, that when the exchange rate moved, the markets would begin testing the government to see if and at what level it was prepared to stop sterling's slide, because of fears of the inflationary implications. Even if the government did not want to intervene, it would be forced to do so, he said. By contrast, Sir Leon Brittan, one of Britain's two European commissioners, said that the government had had no immediate alternative but to try to steer monetary policy with reference to a range of indicators. Speaking at another meeting, he warned his Bow Group audience that past Tory administrations in which he played a role had met difficulty when adopting a similar blueprint. A policy based on a range of indicators, he said, did not have the credibility of steering via precisely defined targets, since it was difficult for outsiders to tell whether the strategy was being observed. There was 'a high element of discretion' in such an approach. It would need to be 'buttressed' by fiscal policy, he said. The former cabinet minister added that sterling's suspension from the ERM was likely to last 'quite a while', but dismissed the idea that quitting the ERM would be a liberation. Referring to the opt-outs negotiated by Britain on monetary union and the social chapter, Sir Leon argued: 'The case for ratifying the Maastricht treaty is far stronger for Britain than for anyone else.' Britain would derive no competitive advantage from not joining the social chapter if the chapter were not implemented by its European partners, he said.</p>

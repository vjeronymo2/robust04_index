			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / British Gas snubs rival's claim BRITISH GAS yesterday hit back against Alliance Gas, one of its chief competitors, for its claims that it could cut domestic gas bills by 10 per cent if allowed to supply households. It said: 'Anyone can cut prices for high-volume customers near gas terminals, but low-volume customers and those farther away would inevitably pay more.' The company said that standards of service, safety and security of supply could be affected by the introduction of competition to the household supply market.</p>

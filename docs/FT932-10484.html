			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Letter: Royal Ballet in decline Sir, In his piece on the Royal Ballet's Don Quixote ('A Don without redemption', April 28), your ballet critic Clement Crisp has written the most devastating review of a production by a leading company that I have ever seen. As a regular - but ever less regular - visitor to the Royal Ballet since 1968, I believe this production is a crowning confirmation of the shameful slide in the company's reputation. I have friends in several foreign companies who routinely go to performances by other companies as they travel the world but who consider a visit to the Royal Ballet a waste of time. I am encouraging them to see the new Don Quixote but for all the wrong reasons. The miserable paucity of the repertoire and the pitifully unimaginative choice of choreographers make the current Royal Ballet the also-rans of the ballet world. That audiences are close to full capacity is no indication of high standards. If New Yorkers can fill 7,000 seats at two Lincoln Centre theatres in one evening, it should not be difficult to fill Covent Garden's 2,000. During the next 10 days my travels will give me the opportunity to see the Royal Danish Ballet, the Royal Swedish Ballet, New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater. I confidently expect that each of these performances will contain more drive, enthu-siasm, style and varied repertoire than the last five years at Covent Garden put together. The Royal Ballet used to be a national treasure and in most other countries would be treated as one. This week's announcement from Covent Garden that there will be more opera performances and less ballet (with an even duller repertoire), simply because opera tickets bring in more money, is final proof that the ballet company is considered a very poor second to the opera company and that artistic achievement is less and less important.

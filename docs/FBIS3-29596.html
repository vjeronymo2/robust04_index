SPSI  Secretary General Bomer Pasaribu said this in Jakarta yesterday  in response to the U.S. decision to postpone the review of the  GSP privilege for Indonesia from 15 February to September 1994.  Bomer Pasaribu said Indonesia is redoubling efforts to enhance  worker rights such as the rights of union and negotiations and  increases in minimum wages and social benefits.    Earlier, Manpower Minister Abdul Latief said the U.S.  Government decided to postpone the review of GSP privilege  because it will discuss the GSP law in September. Thus, the  Indonesian Government highly appreciates the U.S. Government's  decision to postpone the review of U.S. 643 million worth of the  GSP privilege for Indonesia.</p>

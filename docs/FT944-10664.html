			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (7): The bad news may be over - The banking sector Finland's battered banks are still struggling to overcome the huge credit losses which engulfed them two years ago. But though the path to recovery is long and hard, the banks are sticking to their forecasts of a return to profit next year or in 1996 at the latest. Overall, the Finnish Bankers' Association expects the sector's total losses in 1994 to be about two-thirds of the FM13bn deficit run up in 1993 - which was in turn a sharp improvement on the worst year, 1992, when losses exceeded FM20bn. This year has been a frustrating one. In the early months, there was a burst of optimism as interest rates tumbled and Finland's economy began to emerge from severe recession. But a jump in long-term interest rates over the summer, the resultant turbulence in bond markets and additional credit losses slowed down the banks' recov- ery process. Finland's banks fell victims to a wicked combination of circumstances in the early 1990s. The recession, which hit elsewhere in Europe, was deepened by the loss of the country's big trade with the Soviet Union. The slump exploded a frantic credit boom which had been fuelled by financial deregulation. As interest rates shot up and asset values collapsed, hundreds of companies were forced into bankruptcy, particularly in real estate, construction, trading and tourism. By the end of 1993, the banks as a whole had non-performing assets of FM53bn, only slightly less than a year earlier. This was after write-offs of FM16.5bn - equivalent to 5.2 per cent of average balance sheets. In 1992, the banks had been forced to write off FM22bn. Most leading figures in the banking sector say the worst is now over. Mr Pertti Voutil- ainen, chairman of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the leading commercial bank, summed up the position facing his bank: 'I think we have come to the situation where we know where we stand. The worst risks have already been written off, so when the economy gets better - and it has turned around - that will help us to return to profit.' But KOP's own difficulties this year highlight how heavily the banks are still burdened by credit losses - and how vulnerable they are to unex- pected twists in the economy. KOP announced a new bad loan charge of FM800m in its eight-month results, triggered by problems in the construc- tion company Puolimatka. This pushed credit losses in the period up to FM1.67bn, not far below last year's loss at the same stage of FM1.96bn. Meanwhile, a FM150m loss in bond trading helped push net income from financial operations down 7 per cent to FM1.48bn. Overall, KOP's operating losses in the first eight months rose to FM1.3bn from FM869m. The bank has been forced into a further round of fundraising to strengthen a capital base drained far beyond the expectations of most share- holders. It has launched a FM2bn share issue and the sale of FM1bn in assets this autumn, on top of share issues last year worth FM2bn and hefty bonds issues. In the case of Unitas, the main rival to KOP, credit losses rose by FM137m in the first eight months to FM1.82bn compared with the same period last year, due mainly to the collapse earlier in the year of two companies - a construction group called Haka and Eka, a retail and wholesale group. But, like KOP, Unitas insists that all the bad news is now known and accounted for. The bank says credit losses in the last four months of the year will be sufficiently reduced to make overall loan losses for the year less than those of last year. Unitas expects to halve last year's overall pre-tax loss of FM2.57bn and hopes to break even in 1995. KOP still forecasts a profit in 1995. Although borrowing demand remains low in Finland, Mr Vesa Vainio, the president of Unitas, believes the country's return to significant growth - GNP is expected to rise by 5 per cent next year - and its entry into the European Union will trigger more investment. 'We are still on the track we estimated,' says Mr Vainio. 'I am quite confident the worst is over.' Part of the dogged optimism shown by the banks is due to their belief that a significant post-crisis restructuring of the bank sector will work to their benefit. At the end of 1993, the government sold off the savings banks of Finland in four equal parts to KOP, Unitas, state-owned Postipanki and Okobank, the umbrella bank of the country's big co-operative bank sector. The SBF and Skopbank, which acted as a central bank for the savings banks, were taken over by the state at the height of the loan loss crisis and swallowed most of the FM60bn that the government was forced to pledge to keep the banking system afloat. After transferring FM40bn in non-performing SBF assets to Arsenal, a specially created state 'bad bank', the government parcelled out the rest of the FM86bn in SBF assets to the four main players. The effect has been a significant boost in customer base and assets for the buyers, combined with a narrowing of competition. Mr Voutilainen says this has helped restore interest rate spreads which previously were extremely tight. 'The competition situation is much sounder - it is causing less damage to the banks,' he says. Certainly, the rationalisation has reinforced an overdue trend to slim down the banking sector. The recipient banks were free to close SBF branches they acquired and in many cases have done so. The Bankers Association says the numbers now employed in banking have fallen to 37,000 from 53,000 in 1989 and will fall further to around 30,000. Meanwhile, the number of bank branches has contracted by almost 900 to 2,500.</p>

Chiang said that Taiwan's intellectual property rights  (IPR) protection efforts should help avert possible trade  sanctions from the United States.    Chiang made the remark late Wednesday [2 March] following  the  conclusion of three days of IPR talks between Taiwan and the  United States.    Taiwan attached great importance to the negotiations as  results of the meeting will help determine whether Taiwan will  be removed from the "Special 301 Priority Watch List" and no  longer be targeted by the United States for trade retaliation.    The US will make a final decision on the issue in late  April.    The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said in a statement  that the US side "will conduct a review as soon as possible to  assess Taiwan's progress in providing adequate and effective  protection of IPR."    The statement noted that the US delegation "recognized the  considerable accomplishments of the Executive and Legislative  Yuans, especially in the passage of the very important cable TV  law, approval and signing of the bilateral copyright agreement  and the passage of the amendments to the patent and trademark  laws."    AIT represents American interests in Taiwan in the absence  of  diplomatic ties between the two countries.    During the talks, both sides agreed to enter into a  reciprocal patent protection agreement, which will ensure better  protection for inventions by people of the two countries.    The United States will be the first country to sign such a  reciprocity accord with Taiwan, details of which will be worked  out later in the year.    In addition, Taiwan pledged to work for an integrated  circuit  display protection law and to make rules on industrial design  part of the amended patent law by the end of July. Taiwan,  however, has yet to decide whether to enact a law to protect  business secrets.    American delegates, who had expressed deep concern about the  reduction of jail terms for violations of the trademark law from  five to three years, reluctantly accepted the provision after  Taiwan's explanations that the prison sentence will not be  convertible to fines.    The US side also accepted Taiwan's current ban on foreign  investment in the domestic cable television business and the 20  percent ceiling on foreign stakes in cable TV programs, while  Taiwan agreed to the US request that broadcast of foreign  satellite programs without authorization would be considered an  IPR violation.    Taiwan's computer software export inspection system will  remain in place after repeated US demands, although Taiwan hopes  to end the inspection soon because of its expense and  inconvenience.    Meanwhile, US negotiators said they were satisfied with  Taiwan's protective measures for patented pharmaceuticals and  copyrights, saying Taiwan has done a good job in this regard.</p>

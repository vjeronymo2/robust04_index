			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by EC correspondent Boris Johnson: "Euro ID Card on </F> Brussels Agenda"]    [Text] Britons may be issued compulsory European ID cards  as part of the new Maastricht programme of police and judicial  co-operation if ideas under consideration by Brussels come into  force.    With "Europol" due to be formally opened this Friday [18  February] in The Hague as the prototype of a federal EC police  force, a range of secretive Brussels committees is considering  how to pool national information on everything from terrorism to  traffic offences to divorce settlements.    According to a confidential action plan already agreed by  the  12 governments, Europol's remit is to expand from monitoring the  drugs trade to dealing with illegal immigrants, pollution and  traffickers in stolen cars, works of art and nuclear materials.    The latest European plans go further still, considering ways  of enforcing driving bans and chasing fathers for maintenance  payments across the continent.    According to a leaked "priority action plan," a working  party  of interior ministry officials is investigating "harmonising the  conditions for combating illegal immigration and illegal  employment" -- a reference to the personal identification cards  used in most EC countries.    British officials acknowledged last night that the  discussion  was going ahead. But despite recent reports that Mr Major was  attracted to the ID scheme, sources said the conclusions would  not be binding on British ministers.    They said the aim of the discussion was to "share best  practice" across the EC. "We'll be looking at those who find  carrying ID cards beneficial," said a source.    In countries such as Belgium it is an offence punishable by  imprisonment not to be carrying an ID card at all times.    At the centre of these plans is a "European Information  System," due to be running by the end of the year.    This potentially vast data bank is the subject of acute  controversy, with Denmark leading calls for privacy to be  respected. The convention establishing it has yet to be settled.    The Government, strongly supported by Germany, sees  European-wide co-operation as the best means of tackling  cross-frontier crime.    The plan's main purpose is to launch a clampdown on  criminals, illegal immigrants and bogus asylum-seekers. It  envisages a European archive of images of forged documents, a  European inventory of terrorist acts, a European data-collection  system on criminal methods and new measures against "drugs  tourism" and prostitution rings.    One group of 12 national experts is even looking at ways of  increasing co-operation on government phone-tapping and other  forms of "electronic interception."    Another group has been charged with finding a way of  communicating driving bans to other police forces. It is due to  report by June.    A group is also looking at ways of extending the Brussels  Convention on enforcing court judgments to include "family  matters and succession." It would ensure that maintenance  awards can be enforced in all 12 EC countries.</p>

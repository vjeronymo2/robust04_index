The province's  revenue growth resulted from developments in production. The  suspension of tax reductions and exemptions was also an  important factor causing the growth.    Last year's financial expenditure throughout the province  increased over the previous year. The main reason was that  administrative institutions adjusted their wages beyond budgets  and some city-level counties increased their spending for the  construction of some basic facilities and transformation  projects. In addition, as a result of lifting controls over  grain prices, subsidies were provided to workers and staff  members. This was also one of the reasons.    In August last year, principal leaders of governments at all  levels in various localities began to implement central  macrocontrol and regulatory measures, thus strictly controlling  tax reductions and exemptions, gradually alleviating fund  shortages, and bringing about monthly growth in industrial and  commercial taxes on the basis of speedy economic development.  By the end of last year, 10 cities and counties including  Nanyang, Ruzhou, Gongyi, Luyi, and Shangqiu topped 100 million  yuan in revenue, fulfilling the provincial plan ahead of  schedule. Eleven enterprises including the Anyang steel  company, the Luoyang glass factory, the Pingdingshan [words  indistinct] factory, and the Henan [words indistinct] factory  topped 100 million yuan in taxes. The number of  100-million-yuan enterprises increased by seven over the  previous year and 93 enterprises topped 10 million yuan in  taxes, an increase of 13 over the previous year.</p>

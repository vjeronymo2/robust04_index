			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sharp fall at Sabena prompts shake-up SABENA, the Belgian national airline, said its first-half earnings fell by BFr1.5bn (Dollars 45m) reflecting the difficult conditions in the international air transport industry, Reuter reports from Brussels. Sabena gave no final figure on its first-half 1993 earnings. It said the earnings drop reflected the serious structural crisis in the sector and the drop in prices this was causing, the economic crisis, currency devaluations in a large number of European countries and the political events in central Africa. The board of directors had approved measures worth BFr5bn to deal with the crisis in the air transport sector. The package involved an adjustment of wage costs during three years to save BFr2bn, Sabena said. It included measures to optimise its intercontinental and European networks, where the hub and spoke network at Brussels airport would remain the focus of Sabena's strategy. Sabena said there would be large savings by making work organisation flexible. This would be done by striking a balance between the workload and available workforce in accordance with the agreement with organisations representing the workforce. Sabena employs about 9,000 staff. Sabena is 37.5 per cent owned by Air France and about 49 per cent by the Belgian state.</p>

The Council said that the  exchange of prisoners was a fundamental precondition for the  continuation of the implementation of the agreement and the  restoration of trust.    The Presidential Council reiterated that the Croat people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina would enter the setting-up and the  establishment of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, but only  with the simultaneous setting-up and establishment of a  confederation between the Republic of Croatia and the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation.    Lending its full support to a delegation of the Croat people  at the Vienna negotiations led by [Council President] Kresimir  Zubak, the Presidential Council at the same time stressed that  the delegation was duty-bound to coordinate its views daily with  other members of the Council who are not attending the  negotiations.

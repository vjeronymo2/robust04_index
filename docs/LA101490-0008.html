			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OBSERVATIONS ON 'THE CIVIL WAR'  </P> <P> As I watch the remarkable account of the American Civil War on PBS, I am  reminded that during that war most of the combatants and civilians forgot, over  time, what the war was all about: to preserve the Union.  </P> <P> I am reminded that today in the situation we face with Iraq many of us have  forgotten already why the Union is in the Middle East.  </P> <P> It is not oil that introduced our armies to Saudi soil, but the right of  self-determination of peoples. Now we talk only about oil prices, oil supplies,  oil prices.  </P> <P> If we are to enter into a conflict that may terminate the lives of innocent  Americans and others, then let it be for the right reason -- the primary reason  Americans have put their lives on the line throughout our history -- for the  right of liberty.  </P> <P> L.M.

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Accounting changes help Norsk Hydro back to black NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest stock-listed company, said yesterday that a change in accounting principles enabled the group to return to a net profit of NKr1.76bn (Dollars 253.6m) in 1992 from a loss of NKr498m a year earlier. Last year's figures reflect a NKr2.09bn positive cumulative affect of changes in accounting to GAAP standards in the US. The new principles also resulted in a NKr131m charge in 1992 for estimated costs of future health and social benefits. Before the effect of accounting changes, Hydro suffered a net loss of NKr195m in 1992 compared with a loss of NKr498m in 1991, when accounts were charged with NKr2.9bn for restructuring compared with a charge of NKr160m last year. Hydro proposed to cut its dividend to NKr3 a share - the lowest in five years - from NKr3.50 in 1991. Group operating revenue fell by NKr2.55bn to NKr58.1bn due to a weak world economy and sharply lower prices for main products, the company explained. Weaker sales were, however, partially offset by sharply lower operating costs which fell by NKr2bn to NKr49.6bn in 1992. Hydro said the effect of higher petroleum production, which rose by 16 per cent to 8.3m tonnes of oil equivalent in 1992, was counteracted by weak oil prices which fell, on average, by Dollars 1 a barrel to Dollars 19 in 1992. Group operating profit rose sharply to NKr2.88bn from NKr925m in 1991, but net financial expenses increased to NKr2.62bn from NKr1.21bn because of a NKr1.39bn foreign currency loss in 1992, compared with a NKr19m gain in 1991. 'The turmoil in currency markets and the rise in the exchange rate for the dollar at the end of the year had a strong impact on Hydro's 1992 result,' the company said, adding that a large part of financial expenses comprised unrealised foreign exchange losses associated with dollar-denominated loans. For individual operations, agriculture saw sales fall by NKr813m to NKr25.45bn as operating losses narrowed to NKr237m from NKr649m in 1991. Hydro said restructuring costs of the division had been NKr160m higher than expected but that reductions in fixed costs had reached an estimated annual rate of NKr900m in the fourth quarter. Oil and gas boosted sales by NKr622m to NKr12.68bn as operating profit rose by NKr154m to NKr2.64bn. Light metals suffered a NKr2.03bn plunge in sales to NKr15.6bn but returned to an operating profit of NKr540m from a NKr1.18bn loss in 1991. Aluminium prices were lower last year while magnesium suffered weak demand and poor margins as extrusion operations weakened.</p>

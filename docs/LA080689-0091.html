			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFSHORE DRILLING AND OIL TANKERS  </P> <P> In regard to recent oil tanker disasters we seem to have several California  legislators coming to the rescue of their constituency by advocating a  comprehensive ban on offshore drilling and pre-lease activities. It is very  vote productive to take such a stance, but being the extreme stance that it is  it has many flaws and one major irony which is evidence that our rescuers  haven't done their homework.  </P> <P> Question: If we ban our domestic supplies how will we quench our thirst for  petroleum products?  </P> <P> Answer: Foreign oil.  </P> <P> Question: How will it get here?  </P> <P> Answer: Tankers, or to be accurate, more tankers. The weakest link in the  petroleum chain.  </P> <P> California is the third largest consumer of oil and gas in the world, just  behind the Soviet Union and the rest of the U.S. But while everyone is jumping  on the "ban offshore drilling" bandwagon, we are still jumping into our cars,  boats, planes, etc. We eat food from all around the world but don't think of  how it got here. We do all these oil consuming things but don't want to look  offshore and see an oil platform.  </P> <P> Oil exploration, drilling and production can be performed with environmental  safety and must be. Leaps and bounds have been made in safety technology and  oil industry technology in the past 20 years. We need to improve the tanker  link. We don't need to put ourselves into a situation which equates to more  tankers, i.e., a domestic ban. We need to be realistic.  </P> <P> KEN DENTON  </P> <P> Buellton  </P></p>

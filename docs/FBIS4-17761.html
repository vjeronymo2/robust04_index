			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Uzbekova report under the "Party Organization" </F> rubric: "One More Patriotic Movement Has Constituted Itself.  `People's Alliance' Is `a Young and Powerful Party of the  Ordinary People'"]    [Text] The constituent conference of the "People's  Alliance" Russian patriotic movement, including such movements  as the Russian Social Democratic Union [RSDU], "Smena-New  Policy," and the "Soyuz" ["Union"] electoral club, was held on  25 April. In the platform statement on the goals and objectives  of the Russian patriotic movement, Sergey Glazyev and Andrey  Golovin (former leader of "Smena-New Policy") pointed out that  "People's Alliance" is "not a Moscow party of a mythical  'majority,'" but "a young, powerful, and energetic organization  of a political center. A party of the ordinary people, who are  the linchpin of vast Russia." According to Dmitriy Olshanskiy,  "People's Alliance" is a party in which all political structures  capable of forming a coalition are interested.    The alliance leaders see their main objective as the  unification of all patriotic forces. In their view, the great  political potential of "People's Alliance" members will help the  party to influence the way the country is governed, and to rule  the state if it wins the next elections. The "People's  Alliance's" program of political and economic reform in Russia  confirms the seriousness of its founders' ambitions.    The conference approved the Russian patriotic movement's  charter unanimously and without any amendments, just as they  adopted a program statement, which was only required to be  finalized by the political council. The conference also elected  a political council made up of 14 members. Also unanimously,  "People's Alliance" elected its cochairmen -- Andrey Golovin and  Dmitriy Olshanskiy.    As stated at the conference, "People's Alliance" has already  set up 10 regional branches. The constituent conference of the  "People's Alliance" Russian Movement was scheduled for June.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: The costs of quicker settlement  -SEC share-trade reforms do not suit everyone Although it was six and a half years ago, the repercussions of the stock market crash of October 1987 are still being felt on Wall Street. The latest seismic ripple from 1987 comes in the form of a rule proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission that will shorten the period in which investors in the US have to settle their securities transactions. Currently, after a trade has been executed on US financial markets, investors have five days to either pay for securities they have bought or deliver securities they have sold. Under the new rule, the SEC wants to reduce the settlement period to three days. The rule - called T+3, for trade day plus three - comes into effect in June 1995, and is designed to reduce risk in the US securities markets by cutting the number of unsettled trades at any one time. It will also make it harder for investors to renege on transactions during periods of market volatility, which is what happened too often during the 1987 crash. One of the key recommendations made by the Brady Commission which investigated the 1987 crash was that the settlement period should be reduced. Yet, the planned introduction of T+3 has not been welcomed by everyone in the securities business. Although most firms agree that reducing settlement risk is a good thing, some are unhappy at the prospect of having to spend millions of dollars to update their settlement systems to handle T+3. The smaller, regional brokers feel particularly exposed. The big firms, which are used to settling institutional transactions electronically, should find it relatively straightforward, if not necessarily cheap, to adapt their systems to retail business. Smaller firms outside the main financial centres, however, do most of their business with individual investors, and many of their retail trades are settled only after cheques or securities have been delivered by the US mail, a notoriously slow and unreliable service. As one stockbroker at a retail firm explains: 'In most cases, unless the client has funds in an account with us, there is no way we are going to be able to send a confirm (trade confirmation slip) out to a client, and get a cheque back through the mail, and clear it, all within three days.' Also, when many individual investors buy shares they want the stock certificates delivered to them, a demand which only complicates and slows the process further. The smaller brokerage houses know that if they are to meet the requirements of T+3, they have either to invest in an electronic trade settlement system that links the retail customer with the broker, or set up facilities enabling customers to keep funds permanently on account at the firm. The problem with the first choice is that there is little chance that such a system will be developed soon. For it to work, every retail customer would need access to a computerised network, through which they could transfer funds and securities to their brokers. Brokerage houses, therefor, are more likely to take the second route. Many will do so reluctantly, because they would have to start acting like banks, keeping clients' funds and securities on deposit and offering bank-style services such as cheques, electronic funds transfer and cash management accounts. Some of the big brokers already offer bank-style services as part of their asset management business. However, for the smaller firms, setting up the systems to provide such services would be prohibitively expensive. Even those firms which could afford to offer clients bank-style services are not necessarily keen on the idea of having to operate more like banks. Mr Peter Devine, vice-president of operations and administration at the brokerage firm Oppenheimer, says: 'The momentum is gathering for brokerage firms to offer more banking services. Yet, traditionally, brokerage firms are good at execution services, investment advice and clearance. Banking services have not been our forte, although I'm not saying we don't have the expertise to offer them.' The securities industry is also worried that T+3 will bring more banks into the broking business. Although banking and stockbroking have been kept separate in the US by law, a few banks have been allowed to offer customers brokerage services through separate subsidiaries. With their experience in deposit-taking, asset-gathering and funds transfer, they could prove powerful competitors for the broking community. Any bank keen to develop this business, however, will be closely watched by industry regulators. While bank deposits are federally insured, money held in an account at a bank's brokerage subsidiary enjoys no such guarantee - regulators do not want customers confused about whether their funds are insured by the government or not. The brokerage industry's unhappiness was clear when the SEC last year asked firms to respond in writing to their T+3 proposal. Of the 349 replies, a clear majority - 248 - was critical of T+3. The SEC, however, believed reducing settlement risk was worth the disruption to the industry. Competition is increasing between international markets for stock listings and order flow, and the volume of cross-border securities transactions is growing. In the face of these developments, the agency is eager to ensure the US does not fall behind markets in those countries which settle trades in less than five days. Reform of the settlement system is unlikely to stop at T+3. Regulators see it as only the first step in a process leading to securities transactions being executed and settled on the same day, as happens in the US government securities market. If US brokers are finding it difficult adjusting to T+3, wait until they are faced with T+0.</p>

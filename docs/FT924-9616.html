			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Leading Article: At last, a small victory The narrow but sufficient majority of three, the prime minister won the vote on Europe in the House of Commons last night. The house can now proceed with the committee stage of the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty. The government's victory could not have been achieved without the support of the Liberal Democrats and a number of abstentions by opponents of the bill. It does, however, give Mr John Major a chance to make a fresh start. It is the first success he has chalked up since Black Wednesday, September 16, when the ejection of Britain from the exchange rate mechanism knocked the stuffing out of his European and economic policies. It is a welcome change from the series of disasters that has struck the Conservatives since then. The prime minister did the right thing and won. He can now reasonably hope to work on the immensely difficult task of restoring both his personal authority and that of the government. It will be a long and painful slog, with no guarantee of success. The next important stage will come with the statement on public spending plans, due a week from today. The prime minister has, characteristically, tied his reputation to a single figure, Pounds 244.5bn. He will try to meet it, but he is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. If spending for 1993-94 cannot be held to Pounds 244.5bn he will be condemned for another U-turn; if it is met, it will entail a severe squeeze on public services. Mr Major and his colleagues will have to show greater skill in apportioning this pain than they did in the case of the pit closures. Following the autumn statement, which needs to be accompanied by a fleshing out of the government's still uncertain economic strategy, a reshuffle of ministers would demonstrate to the public that the prime minister means business. The reintroduction of the Maastricht bill may be less difficult to push through the house now that last night's vote is safely over, but the Conservative rebels are not going to retire. The ratification bill promises to gum up the parliamentary works for months, keeping at simmering point the party's recriminations and distracting the government's attention from the management of the economy. There will be many occasions for slip-ups, not least as the EC wrestles, initially under Britain's presidency, with the Danish demand for legally-binding changes to a treaty that eleven member states have sworn not to renegotiate. In short, there is no quick route back to the victorious atmosphere which followed last April's general election. The irreconcilable Thatcherites and diehard nationalists within the Conservative party will continue to obstruct the government. They have tasted power in a house where the government's supposed majority is a mere 21. Their continuous rebellion is sustained by the continuing recession. Mr Major must live from crisis to crisis, if he can, until the economic upturn comes.</p>

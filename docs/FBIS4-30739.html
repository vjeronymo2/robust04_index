			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with Hungarian Socialist Party </F> Chairman Gyula Horn by reporter Peter Gyuricza; place and date  not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Gyuricza] Mr. Chairman, you have promised that  a new policy has to prevail in Hungary from June. What does  this mean in practice?    [Horn] This means, first and foremost, that the real  problems  of the people have to be dealt with. This means that the new  parliament and the new government should not deal with masses of  abstract ideological questions. This really means that all  questions, without whose solution we cannot ease the people's  fate and life, must be put on the agenda on the first day after  the formation of the new government, if possible. There are a  lot of questions of this kind.    [Gyuricza] Some examples?    [Horn] I mean, first of all, the social strata in the most  difficult situation -- pensioners, families with many children,  young career-starters; we have to ensure that people are housed  and that in practice these young people can get a job. Just  look at the catastrophic housing situation. The new government  cannot avoid establishing a credit system, with state  participation, for the construction of homes or for the  acquisition of homes. This is no longer just another of the  many promises being made, since the elections are behind us.    Concerning all this, I am convinced that we have to keep in  mind -- since we could spend hours just listing all these  necessary steps -- that people do not exist to implement a  change of system; on the contrary, the change of system has to  serve the people. There was some kind of misunderstanding here  over the past months and years -- as though the change of system  was regarded as an abstract aim. [passage omitted]    [Gyuricza] [passage omitted] Will the MSZP [Hungarian  Socialist Party] be forced to form a coalition, or should we  regard a coalition as a necessity?    [Horn] There is no necessity for a coalition because we have  an adequate majority, but we do want a coalition. We would like  to form a coalition.    [Gyuricza] At what price?    [Horn] Not at any price, obviously. [passage omitted]    [Gyuricza] Is it possible that you could be the object or  the  stake of the coalition talks?    [Horn] I do not think so. Why should that be? [passage  omitted]    [Gyuricza] Before the elections you said you would not be  short of coalition partners. What are you thinking of, or not  thinking of, in addition to the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ]?    [Horn] We also said that we are open about the Federation of  Young Democrats [Fidesz]. Well, Fidesz got far poorer results  than they expected. [passage omitted] I naturally think there  are a lot of valuable people there.    We have asked the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]  to get rid of its extremists. The election campaign showed that  they have not managed to do this, or have not wanted to this.  However, I do not think the KDNP would reject a coalition  cooperation proposal if I offered it.    [Gyuricza] You have said that your first journey will be to  Bonn. Why?    [Horn] On the one hand, because I consider Hungarian-German  ties as being exceptionally important. On the other hand, I  have personal links with the present German leaders -- including  Chancellor Kohl and others -- and this will make it possible to  conclude an agreement, or series of agreements, which would  significantly ease the treatment of the acute and very serious  illnesses of the Hungarian economy. [passage omitted]    I am not planning to hand them an invoice. We are not  talking about some kind of repayment of debts, which has not  been completed yet. However, it has to be considered that our  country is in a very serious situation and that Hungarian-German  relations could ease these difficulties.</p>

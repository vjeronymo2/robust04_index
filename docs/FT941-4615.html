			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Share sales help Singer to Pounds 34m Singer &amp; Friedlander, the diversified merchant banking group, yesterday exceeded market forecasts with pre-tax profits of Pounds 34.4m for 1993, up from Pounds 6m in the previous year. The figures were distorted by Pounds 12m in exceptional profits, from the sales of shareholdings in Burford and ACT, but profit before tax and exceptional items rose by 38 per cent to Pounds 22.4m (Pounds 16.2m). The recommended final dividend of 1.75p, makes a total pay-out of 3p (2.6p). The core merchant banking and investment management operations increased their contribution by 73 per cent to Pounds 16m. A Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 4.5m) provision was made against bad and doubtful debts. The corporate finance division benefited from increased activity among medium-sized companies. Singer owns 51 per cent of stockbroker Collins Stewart, which had 'an outstandingly successful year'. The private clients fund management business had more than Pounds 1bn under management. Further growth could come from fledgling businesses. The structured finance operation was profitable in its first year of operation, while the retail fund division is expected to contribute in 1994. Property contributed Pounds 4m profit from rental income. There was an exceptional Pounds 3.9m write down against the Pounds 70m property portfolio, but this was more than off-set by profits from investment sales. Singer announced yesterday that its property division had raised Pounds 30m from a 25-year fixed rate debenture, releasing further funds for banking activities. During 1993, Singer increased its stake in The People's Phone Company, provider of cellular telephone services. It now owns 26 per cent, assuming the conversion of debentures. In addition, it has invested in Associated Nursing Services and insurance broker Edgar Hamilton. Mr John Hodson, chief executive, said these stakes were intended to build up funds to invest in fee earning businesses when opportunities arose. Earnings per share amounted to 13.19p (0.76p) including, and 7.77p (5.86p) excluding, exceptional items. COMMENT Singer &amp; Friedlander has been switching emphasis from property and stock investments into developing fee-based businesses. Yesterday's results demonstrate its success. Exceptional items bumped up the bottom line, but the increase in higher quality recurrent earnings has been impressive. Concerns remain over Pounds 53m in legal claims connected to Barlow Clowes, and this uncertainty could continue to dampen enthusiasm. However, brokers expect pre-exceptional profits of up to Pounds 25m in 1994, putting the shares on a p/e of 10.9, based on yesterday's closing price of 99p. With asset backing estimated at about 100p, the management has earned a higher rating.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> URGES WHITE HOUSE ACTION;  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER SUGGESTS A TOP-LEVEL GAY DRIFT  </P> <P> In a strongly worded letter to President Bush, Rep. William E. Dannemeyer  (R-Fullerton) suggests that homosexuals in the Administration have tilted White  House policy away from "traditional family values" to promote the "homosexual  movement."  </P> <P> Reacting to local reports that a Washington male prostitution ring catered to  clients high in the Administration, Dannemeyer called on Bush to sign an  executive order banning federal employees from directly or indirectly  encouraging homosexuality, as well as bisexuality, bestiality and pedophilia.  </P> <P> "The public might ask how two consecutive, conservative administrations can do  more to advance the influence of the homosexual movement in public policy than  an overtly sympathetic Administration might have," Dannemeyer said in the  letter, which was sent to the White House on Thursday.  </P> <P> He added: "One answer may turn up in the current investigations (of the alleged  male prostitution ring). This would explain much."  </P> <P> The Washington Times reported Thursday that federal authorities are  investigating a ring of male prostitutes whose clients allegedly included Paul  R. Balach, political personnel liaison to the White House for Labor Secretary  Elizabeth Hanford Dole. Balach resigned Thursday, citing public disclosure of  "activities concerning my personal life."  </P> <P> In addition, Dannemeyer told the President that Bush's announced support for a  so-called "hate crimes" bill, that would require the Justice Department to  annually catalogue crimes linked to the victim's race, religion, ethnic group  or sexual preference, "is a subtle affirmation of homosexuality." The  legislation was approved by the House this week and now must be considered by  the Senate.  </P> <P> "This bill is a precursor to amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include  sexual orientation along with race, religion, creed and national origin,"  Dannemeyer wrote.  </P> <P> The White House had no immediate reaction.  </P> <P> However, the response from the nation's oldest homosexual rights group was  swift.  </P> <P> "This letter is so extreme in tone that I can only extend to Mr. Dannemeyer my  gratitude," said Thomas B. Stoddard, executive director of the New York-based  Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund.  </P> <P> "This letter will greatly enhance our fund-raising efforts and demonstrates  more concretely than any other document I have ever seen that gay people are  still the object of irrational hatred in this country, even at the level of the  U.S. Congress."  </P> <P> Stoddard, who has debated Dannemeyer on national television several times on  the issue of homosexual rights, added: "Mr. Dannemeyer's personal fascination  with the subject of homosexuality transcends that of any gay person I know. . .  . It's more than interest. It's really obsession."  </P> <P> Stoddard said his organization believes that an executive order along the lines  of the one suggested by Dannemeyer would be found to unconstitutionally limit  the right to free speech.  </P> <P> In his letter to the President, Dannemeyer cited half a dozen examples of what  he described as the federal government's promotion of the homosexual life  style. They included:  </P> <P> * A decision by the National Endowment for the Arts to finance the display of a  homosexual artist's work at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, an exhibit that  Dannemeyer described as "homoerotic."  </P> <P> * A proposal by the National Institutes of Health to study the sexual habits of  Americans. Dannemeyer said a principal involved in the proposal "has a long  list of credits favoring homosexual behavior."  </P> <P> * The U.S. Postal Service's announcement that it will commemorate with a  special cancellation the 1969 "Stonewall riot" in New York City. The incident,  in which homosexuals battled with police, has been cited as a turning point in  the homosexual rights movement.  </P> <P> Finally, Dannemeyer told Bush, "The greatest misuse of government funds in  promotion of the homosexual life style in your Administration, as that of your  predecessor, is the creation of our federal AIDS industry."  </P> <P> Dannemeyer has long called for widespread testing for HIV, the virus that is  believed to cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The congressman has  argued that such testing should be confidential, but not anonymous, so that  public health officials can trace the sexual partners of those found to be  infected.  </P> <P> "National leadership has only offered us the pathology of anonymity, a  testament to homosexual influence in the policy-making process," Dannemeyer  told the President.  </P> <P> "I believe the public does not care who in the federal government is  homosexual," the letter states. "But I do believe they care when this sexual  pathology subjectively biases otherwise rational thought or in some way  compromises the national interest or national security."  </P> <P> In an interview Friday, Dannemeyer said of Stoddard's remarks: "I think the  question we should ask the Stoddards of this world is very simple. 'Am I  supposed to apologize for affirming the heterosexual ethic that is the  foundation of our society?'  </P> <P> "I feel sorry for Mr. Stoddard. He and others of his persuasion tragically have  been misled by leaders in our society in the last 20 years . . . who have  effectively questioned our standards of sexuality . . . and in so doing have  sent the false signal . . . that if it feels good, do it."  </P></p>

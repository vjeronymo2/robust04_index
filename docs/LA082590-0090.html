			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY TO PAY FINE FOR ROLE IN CONTRACT;  </P> <P> SETTLEMENT: MAYOR UNINTENTIONALLY VIOLATED LAW IN AWARDING OF JOB TO A  CONTRIBUTOR, FPPC SAYS.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley has agreed to pay a $2,000 fine for illegally  participating in a decision to give a contract to a political contributor,  state officials announced Friday.  </P> <P> The settlement, which is expected to be approved by the state Fair Political  Practices Commission next month, concludes a year-old investigation of  decisions involving Bradley when he served as chairman of the Los Angeles  County Transportation Commission in 1987.  </P> <P> The fine is similar to one levied in July against Los Angeles City Councilman  Michael Woo, who illegally voted to give a political donor a contract while  serving on the transit panel.  </P> <P> Bradley's fine is a result of failing to properly disclose $1,800 in  contributions from Gruen Associates, a consulting firm, when he participated in  a decision to award the firm a contract to study a controversial San Fernando  Valley trolley line.  </P> <P> The FPPC imposed relatively light fines on Bradley and Woo after concluding  that their violations were unintentional. The FPPC also found that the  transportation commission lacked adequate procedures to alert members to  potential legal conflicts involving contractors.  </P> <P> Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said that Bradley has "initiated steps to  rectify this (transportation commission) oversight."  </P> <P> The state Political Reform Act imposes special anti-favoritism requirements on  commission members, including a ban on voting on matters involving political  contributors who have given members $250 or more in the previous 12 months.  </P> <P> The investigation began after The Times reported that Bradley and other  prominent transportation commissioners had collected nearly $600,000 in  campaign contributions from commission contractors and that, in some cases, the  state law was being violated.  </P> <P> Bradley and Woo quickly returned nearly $20,000 in contributions from several  contractors after inquiries from The Times.  </P></p>

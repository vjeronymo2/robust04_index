			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Talbott's Mission"] </F>   [Text] US Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is  expected to visit Pakistan and India towards the first week of  April carrying, according to Press reports, the outline of a  package deal to implement the American nuclear non-proliferation  agenda for the region. The deal would first ask Pakistan and  then India to cap their nuclear programmes. To sweeten the pill  for Pakistan, the undelivered 38 F-16s Pakistan has already paid  for as well as some P-3 Orion anti-submarine attack planes would  be delivered as a one-time exception to the Pressler Amendment.  Both the nuclear programmes of Pakistan and India would be  opened up to international inspection and verification. A  five-power conference comprising Pakistan, India, China, Russia  and the US, with the possible inclusion of Britain, France,  Germany and Japan, would be convened to obtain pledges from  Pakistan and India that they will ban nuclear tests. Both  countries would be asked not to develop and deploy ballistic  missiles as potential delivery systems for nuclear warheads.  For some time now, conflicting signals have been emanating from  the Clinton administration which indicate its desire to find a  way round the Pressier Amendment, not out of any love for  Pakistan, but in order to have sufficient leverage to persuade  us to forego our nuclear option. Congressional opposition led  by Senator Pressler has so far made that difficult for the US  government. Even the package under discussion has come under  fire during hearings of the US Senate Foreign Relations  Committee.    Whether the Clinton administration will be able to negotiate  all these reefs before Mr Talbott's arrival in South Asia is  highly doubtful, given the strength of opposition to its  proposals from Congress. It seems premature therefore for us to  be speculating whether Pakistan has agreed to any of these  proposals, which could hardly be said to have jelled even within  the American foreign policy establishment, in any case. Mr  Talbott's package hardly contains anything new or startling.  All these proposals have been mooted in the recent past, some,  like the five-power conference, by Pakistan itself. The  obstacles too, are well known and formidable. The most  intractable is India's continuing hegemonistic ambitions in the  area which have led it to develop a nuclear weapon which it  tested as far back as 1974, arm itself to the teeth despite  possessing the fourth largest army in the world which lends it  overwhelming military superiority over all its neighbours, and  its stubborn refusal to engage in meaningful discussions let  alone accept any reasonable solution to the Kashmir issue. It  has tried to defect the US pressure for non-proliferation in the  region by hiding behind the demand for global nuclear  disarmament. It has tried to defect the US pressure for  non-proliferation in the region by hiding behind the demand for  global nuclear disarmament. It has not even been prepared to  take seriously the five-power conference proposal which seeks to  meet its argument that it faces a nuclear threat from China.  Given this reality, it might be more productive if Mr Talbott  could first persuade India to cap its nuclear programme and  discuss the core issue of Kashmir seriously with Pakistan before  the `demonstration effect' could assuage Pakistan's very real  concerns. If, however, flying in the face of these facts, the  US is training its guns on Pakistan because it thinks it can  pressurise us more easily than India since it has greater  leverage over us, it is seriously underestimating the will of  our people to forego even badly needed aircraft in order to  safeguard our national interests. In the furtherance of those  interests, before Mr Talbott arrives, it would be in the fitness  of things if the government were to take the nation into  confidence and sit down with the Opposition to chalk out a joint  position to resist any pressures the US may be planning to exert.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Observer: Studded Welcome The British Tourist Authority would seem to have scored an own goal. In a campaign aimed specifically at enticing Germans to the UK, it has put its boot right in it. Its latest ad in the Britain is Great series running in Stern magazine is couched entirely in footballing metaphor. 'Their week in England started with a goal way offside,' it says of the lucky German tourists. 'For him football and holidays had one thing in common: England. This was the motherland of football . . .' As the ad is co-sponsored by seven ferry companies there also has to be mention of the 'very special kick' the couple got out of their crossing. On the last day a Mr Aston invites the couple to his villa (sigh) in Beverley for 'Yorkshire pudding' and their trip to England ends with 'exciting extra time'. The BTA could not be hinting at the exciting extra time experienced by some other Germans when they lost the World Cup a mere 27 years ago, could it?</p>

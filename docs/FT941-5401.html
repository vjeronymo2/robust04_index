			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / People: Double act of Japan's UK diplomats A formidable diplomatic double act is about to take the centre stage at Japan's UK embassy, writes William Dawkins. Hiroaki Fujii, 60, will take over as the new ambassador on March 17, joined by his long-standing junior colleague, Sadaaki Numata, as minister plenipotentiary, the embassy's number two, 51 on that day. The pair have shared offices on and off several times since 1975, when Fujii became Numata's boss at the foreign ministry's north American division. They were together in the late 1970s in Japan's Washington embassy and then turned up again back in Tokyo's north American division in the mid-1980s. Fujii later became ambassador to Thailand, his most recent job. The new ambassador has never lived in London, so he will be a newcomer to his posting - similarly, his friend Sir John Boyd, Britain's ambassador to Japan since mid-1992, had also never lived in Tokyo. However, Fujii will not be completely in the fog in London, since Numata is a self-confessed Anglophile. Oxford- educated, he worked in the UK embassy for two years in the late 1960s. A useful skill is his ability to put some of the finer nuances of Japan's foreign policy into plain English.</p>

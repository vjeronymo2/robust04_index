			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Clinton reverses US Angola policy and ditches Savimbi THE US yesterday accorded full diplomatic recognition to the former Marxist government of Angola headed by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Speaking before a meeting with Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, President Bill Clinton made it clear he had acted because Mr Jonas Savimbi's Unita movement had refused to accept the latest peace plans designed to end the civil war in Angola. 'The Angola government,' Mr Clinton said, 'has by contrast agreed to sign that peace agreement, has sworn in a democratically elected national assembly and has offered participation by Unita at all levels of government. Today we recognise those achievements by recognising the government and republic of Angola.' He said he had tried to use the leverage of recognition as a means to end the civil war. He also wanted to reaffirm 'the high priority that our administration places on democracy.' He did not say if he thought an end to the carnage in Angola was now in sight. The decision to isolate Unita internationally appears to mark the end of a long relationship between the US and Mr Savimbi, regarded for much of the Reagan and Bush administrations as a bulwark against the ambitions of the former Soviet Union and Cuba in Angola. US financial and materiel support for Unita ended in 1991, before the peace agreement which also saw the withdrawal of Soviet aid and Cuban troops. However Mr Savimbi has remained a popular figure in US right-wing political circles, frequently escorted around Washington by the likes of Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina. However, his refusal to accept the results of elections last year, narrowly won by Mr dos Santos and his party, and his resumption of the civil war angered the Bush administration in its final weeks and has increasingly frustrated Mr Clinton's government. The last straws were continuing reports of Unita's territorial gains and atrocities on the ground in Angola and its rejection last week of the latest peace proposals put forward by international mediators in Abidjan, capital of Ivory Coast. Mr Clinton had also been subject to increasing domestic pressure to recognise the dos Santos government. This has been most evident from influential black leaders such as the Rev Jesse Jackson and Congressman Kweisi Mfume of Maryland and also, if more discreetly, from US oil companies with interests in Angola. Some external influence was also brought to bear. Bishop Tutu said he was 'thrilled' by Mr Clinton's action, which would help improve human rights in Africa. The emerging Clinton approach to Africa involves the promotion of democracy and market-oriented reforms, debt relief, an activist approach to 'disasters in the making', such as Somalia, and attempts to resolve a number of conflicts such as Zaire, Liberia, Sudan and Togo.</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Eruption on the political landscape: A rebellion in the ruling party could crack Japan's postwar parliamentary system The Japanese are growing accustomed to their most cherished assumptions being overturned. In the past year the salarymen whose loyalty is the life-blood of Japanese companies have found even they are expendable, as companies cut costs. Japan's traditional deference towards the US has been replaced by a defiant refusal to give in to the Clinton administration's calls for a greater US share of Japanese markets. But if there was one thing the Japanese could rely on, it was the Liberal Democratic party. The party has ruled the country since 1955, steering it from poverty and hunger in the wake of the second world war to become the world's strongest economy in the 1980s. Now, even the LDP is losing its grip. Amid extraordinary scenes in the Japanese parliament yesterday evening, a 35-strong group of dissident LDP members revolted against their leaders. Their rebellion threatens to crack the postwar edifice of Japanese politics. The dissidents voted with an opposition party no-confidence motion, lodged in complaint at the LDP's unwillingness to compromise over plans for political reform. The revolt led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister, brought down the government by 255 votes to 220. A general election will be held in late July. Japan's international partners will be the first to feel the effects of the turmoil. The government will be paralysed just as Tokyo is preparing to host the annual summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in early July. The consequences for Japan could be momentous, according to the snap judgments offered yesterday. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, founder of the small but popular New Japan party, compared the defeat to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Perhaps more appositely, Mr Hideo Sakamaki, the thoughtful president of Nomura Securities, said the revolt was more far-reaching than former UK prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher's sacking. Business leaders and civil service bureaucrats in private said it was a turning point. There are two reasons why they could be right. First, the future of the LDP is in doubt. With the economy not yet out of a downturn which began two years ago, the LDP, stained by scandals, faces losing its majority in parliament's lower house. A split in its ranks is almost inevitable. The 35 rebels are likely to be expelled. Second, the LDP's weakness could pave the way for a government committed to reform of the political system. However, history teaches caution on both issues. As parliamentarians begin campaigning they will not rely on their parties for support, but on their support groups, built up over many years. The personalised character of Japanese politics is the root of many of its problems. Japan has large parliamentary constituencies which each elect about five members of parliament. To win election a member of the LDP has to compete against other people from his own party. As it is difficult for members of the same party to differentiate themselves by their policies, they choose other methods, mainly involving money. A good member of parliament brings home public works spending - railway lines and bridges, sports stadiums and parks. He wins construction contracts for local companies and presses the case for agricultural subsidies. One of the main expenses born by a Japanese member of parliament is weddings. It is usual for a representative of the local member of parliament to show up at a wedding bearing an envelope of money. The clearest evidence that Japanese politics is about personalities more than policies is the way in which people get into parliament. The fastest-growing group of parliamentarians are offspring of former politicians who have inherited their father's support group and thus his seat. The results of this system are obvious. Politicians need large sums of money to finance their support groups, which makes them prone to corruption. Their concerns are local, so their views tend to be parochial. The inward-looking character of Japanese politics is unlikely to change quickly. Nor is the LDP, though deeply unpopular, likely to be catapulted out of power. There is no credible alternative. The opposition parties have no well-defined economic policies, no experience of handling trade disputes with the US, and their foreign policies pre-date the end of the cold war, particularly in the case of the Social Democratic party, the largest opposition party, which adheres to socialist ideology. While many LDP supporters want to punish the party for its unwillingness to reform, they do not want to dislodge it. They would prefer the party to clean up its image, rather than to risk the unpredictable consequences of ruffling the entire political system. However, even if the LDP offers a change of leadership - Mr Miyazawa's position is so weak that he will be forced to resign - it cannot return to politics as normal, even if it emerges from the election as the single largest party. The reason is simple and powerful: the rapidity and scale of change in Japanese society is finally forcing political change. Pressure for reform is converging from several sources. Many business leaders and bureaucrats believe Japan needs political institutions which are more transparent to the outside world if it is to fulfil a larger global role. The public wants reforms to limit corruption. Urban voters want reform because the electoral system gives far greater weight to rural constituencies. These pressures are threatening to crack the LDP from within. This week's crisis marks the collapse of the hierarchy which has run the party since the 1970s. Until last year the party had been dominated for almost 20 years by the giant Takeshita faction, which kept discipline. But last year the faction's powerbroker, Mr Shin Kanemaru, who also maintained friendly relations with the opposition parties, was brought down in a corruption scandal. The party's leaders failed to fill the vacuum left by his departure. Their loss of authority reflects a growing division within the LDP's ranks between reformers and conservatives, younger politicians who represent younger, more independent-minded voters and older traditionalists who come from rural constituencies. Since the mid-1970s, the LDP has maintained its position by transforming itself from a rural conservative party into a catch-all coalition representing farmers and office staff, construction workers and those in high-tech manufacturing. The Hata group's revolt may break up that coalition. Attention will focus on whether the eclectic band of reformers will coalesce into a new centrist party - by no means a foregone conclusion. Yet the rebel Mr Hata and Mr Hosokawa of the NJP are both popular among urban Japanese. The incentive of holding the balance of power in a hung parliament could encourage them to agree a common platform. Mr Hata's group is beginning to develop specific proposals, but he has made it clear that merely changing the rules of the electoral system will not be enough. 'You have to change the way of thinking,' he says. He argues that the LDP is incapable of coping with the economic and diplomatic responsibilities Japan will face in the 1990s. The country needs a clear line of political command, not the opaque policymaking of a faction-ridden LDP. With few policy details worked out, Mr Hata's group has nevertheless pledged to be radical, calling, for instance, for an overhaul of Japan's so-called 'peace constitution' to allow it to play a larger role in United Nations activities. But before they get as far as deciding their strategy after the election, the rebels will have a more pressing problem on their minds this weekend - making sure they have collected enough money to deliver to all the weddings between now and the end of July.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: ERM reform sidelined by need for unity REFORM of the European exchange rate mechanism is the cause that has faded from the agenda of today's summit. In the tense and difficult days after sterling's departure from the ERM on 'Black Wednesday', Mr John Major, the prime minister, complained of 'fault lines' in the European monetary system and gave notice that he would press the case for ERM reform at today's meeting. After several acrimonious exchanges between Britain and its EC partners, this ambition has been largely shelved. Finance ministers will not be attending the summit. Instead, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, director of the French Treasury and chairman of the EC monetary committee, will be on hand to give an oral report on reform efforts. The UK's attempt to blame the humiliation of Black Wednesday on the ERM has foundered because the other member countries stand firmly behind the system. At a difficult meeting of the economics and finance ministers' council in Brussels last month, Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor, was forced to retreat from demands for an overhaul of the ERM when he found himself threatened with isolation. That meeting patched over the differences by agreeing that last month's turmoil on the European exchange markets should be followed by 'reflection and analysis' of developments in global capital markets and in the European and world monetary systems. The EC monetary committee from the member states' finance ministries and central banks has been charged with this task. In a letter last week to the Commons treasury and civil service committee, Mr Lamont said 'that work needs to be carried forward'. However, it seems that little has been achieved so far. There will be no formal written report from the monetary committee for the EC leaders at the summit. Nor is a detailed discussion of ERM problems planned. The UK now argues that a summit of EC leaders is not the forum to discuss the nitty gritty of economics and finance - an argument that ignores the fact that in 1978 two such summits negotiated the creation of the EMS. Birmingham, officials say, will not be the place for market sensitive decisions. The UK's retreat from having the Birmingham summit address the supposed fault lines in the ERM has been accompanied by continued uncertainty as to what its defects might be. Mr Lamont talked mainly in general terms about the ERM at his appearance before the Commons treasury committee this week. He mentioned the strains created by the incompatibility of monetary conditions and the lack of synchronisation of the economic cycles of the UK and Germany and the tensions arising from the large short-term interest rate differential. The UK has also called for a fairer sharing out of burdens in the ERM. In its quest for greater 'symmetry' in the system, it has complained about certain aspects of the way ERM members support their currencies through intramarginal intervention. The British government believes the Bundesbank supported the French franc strongly through intramarginal intervention last month, while according to Mr Lamont it gave no such support to sterling. The Bundesbank, for its part, has said that it did buy sterling intramarginally before the pound left the ERM. However, the summit will not want to explore such detailed differences for fear of opening old wounds. They will encourage the monetary committee to continue its studies. But there is no sign that the majority will swing behind the British belief that the ERM needs substantial change.</p>

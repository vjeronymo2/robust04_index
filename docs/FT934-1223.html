			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Madrid move upsets EU growth talks Spain yesterday threw already vexed European Union membership negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into confusion by demanding that they be left out of the Maastricht mechanisms for setting up a single European currency by 1999. Although the Spanish proposal won little support from EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels, it could hold up attempts to close the Maastricht chapters of the entry negotiations when the 12 meet the four candidates today. The EU and the four are working against the clock to finish the accession talks by March, for the enlargement to take place as planned on January 1 1995. New delays in areas which until now had been relatively uncontroversial could make this already receding goal even more remote. Spain says that on the earliest date, 1997, for the third phase of economic and monetary union (Emu), only the 12 member states which negotiated the Maastricht treaty should be taken into account. Under Maastricht, a single currency would go ahead in 1997 only if a majority of the 12 met the strict convergence criteria on debt, budget deficits, inflation and interest rates. At present, only Luxembourg of the 12 meets these criteria. But it is a theoretical possibility that a small 'hard core' grouped around Germany and the Netherlands, added to Austria and the Nordic economies, could constitute a majority among 15 or 16 member states. That, in the Spanish view, would move the momentum of European integration decisively northwards, a prospect Madrid rejects. It is therefore insisting that the majority referred to in the Maastricht treaty must come from among the original 12. New member states could join Emu at the early date but would not constitute part of the required majority. Spain also wants to prevent the generally better financial performance of the four applicant countries from being factored in to the Emu convergence criteria, thereby making it a harder goal for the existing 12. After the near implosion of the EU's exchange rate mechanism in August, the notion of a first try at Emu in 1997 is widely considered academic. Several EU diplomats speculated yesterday that Spain was trying to keep the Emu chapter of the accession talks open as a counterweight to later and more difficult negotiations on Norwegian fisheries resources. But the ploy could have a damaging ripple effect. The electorates in all four applicants are already sensitised by vigorous 'No' lobbies about EU decisions affecting them taken without their governments' participation. Austria already wants a declaration in its accession treaty that its currency will not be diminished by participating in the full Emu project.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> LAFCO APPROVES ANNEXATION OF STRIP  </P> <P> A county commission voted Wednesday to allow the city to annex a strip of seven  office buildings and six homes along Newport Boulevard, although some neighbors  objected.  </P> <P> The Local Agency Formation Commission unanimously approved annexation of the  7.8-acre strip on the northwest side of the avenue between Wass Street and  Windsor Lane in North Tustin.  </P> <P> "It takes a big chunk out of our community," said Nancy Hamilton, 35, a  homemaker who lives nearby.  </P> <P> Removing the strip from the jurisdiction of the North Tustin Municipal Advisory  Council denies local residents a say in the use of the property, Hamilton said.  </P> <P> The council advises the County Board of Supervisors on matters in  unincorporated North Tustin.  </P> <P> William C. Weber Jr., president of the Foothill Communities Assn., also opposed  the annexation. The Tustin City Council, he said, could someday change the  zoning to allow larger commercial ventures on the property.  </P> <P> City Councilman Richard B. Edgar said the council has no plans to change the  use of the land from residential and low-density office use.  </P> <P> Before the annexation becomes official, the City Council must hold a hearing to  allow landowners in the proposed annexation area to protest, LAFCO executive  director James J. Colangelo said. If owners holding a majority of the assessed  value of the land say they do not want to be in Tustin, he said, the annexation  proposal dies.  </P> <P> Most landowners have already requested annexation, so a protest is not likely,  he said.  </P></p>

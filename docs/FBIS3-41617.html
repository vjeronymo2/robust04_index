			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: ``Seconds Away From Nuclear </F> Accident''--first paragraph is AFTENPOSTEN introduction]    [Text] The near accident at the nuclear power plant at Kola  in February did not surprise Russian authorities: The KGB warned  of the danger of an accident in July of last year.    This can be seen in a letter written by Deputy Minister N.  Gulushko of the Russian Ministry of Safety to the Russian  Government addressed to then Deputy Prime Minister Chernomyrdin  in July 1992. The environmental foundation Bellona was recently  given a copy of the letter while on a visit to Moscow.    It says in the letter that half of Russia's nuclear power  plants have such serious structural faults and such a poorly  trained staff that they constitute a large threat. In the letter  the Ministry of Safety is focusing in particular on the poor or  completely nonexisting safety training of the employees at the  nuclear power plants. According to the letter the internal  safety training is wretched. Further it has been pointed out  that internal unrest resulting from quarrels over wages at the  nuclear power plants leads to a further reduction in the level  of safety at the plants. The Kola plant is one of the plants  that the Ministry of Safety uses as an example of this.    Thomas Nilsen from Bellona visited Kola two days ago: ``For  the past two weeks there has been renewed unrest at the Kola  nuclear power plant. The plant is not paid for the power it  delivers to heavy industry. This has resulted in the workers not  receiving their pay. When the plant's director protested and  threatened to shut down the reactors, he was fired by the  Ministry of Nuclear Power, which however quickly withdrew the  dismissal when the director was supported by the employees,''  Nilsen says, pointing out that such lasting administrative chaos  contributes to reduced safety.    ``Unrest concerning wages, etc., comes on top of already  poor  safety caused by a lack of professional understanding for what  they are really doing, a lack of training in safety measures,  and also the physical structural faults of the plant. I am  convinced that on the day that a real accident happens at the  Kola plant, it will be caused by operator error,'' Nilsen says.    An inspection team from the International Atomic Energy  Association (IAEA) has recently visited the plant, and the  leader of the inspection team, the Japanese Van Lee Zong, said  to the paper NORDLYS that the near accident during the night of  2 February this year could have been a new Chernobyl catastrophe  with a reactor core meltdown. During his visit to Kola, the  inspector told local journalists that the reactor core was only  seconds away from a meltdown--and not minutes, as the public has  been informed.    When the hurricane that raged over Kola the night of 1  February caused a break in the power supply to the nuclear power  plant, a long time passed before the operators were able to  start one of the emergency generators and add cooling water for  the two reactors. Without cooling water the reactor core would  have suffered a meltdown.    Inspector Van Lee Zong from the IAEA says that the near  accident in February was caused by operator error. They were  faced by a situation they had never been trained to handle, he  says. IAEA has previously characterized the Kola plant as one of  the 10 worst in the world. Van Lee Zong says, however, that from  a purely technical point of view, the plant is not so bad today,  among other things because the leadership has carried through  some of the proposals for improvement submitted by the IAEA. But  the personnel failed, and as Van Lee Zong says: ``I have never  heard of such a dramatic episode.''    The near accident in February is the most serious known near  accident in any nuclear power plant. On 27 May this year there  was also an accident at the Kola plant when a valve in the  reactor's cooling cycle broke. The reactors had to be shut down  again.</p>

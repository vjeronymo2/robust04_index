The comment came in a Foreign Ministry statement after  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic arrived here Monday for  talks with Russian officials hours after NATO aircraft shot down  four military planes believed to belong to the Bosnian Serb  forces.    "Whatever party (Serb, Moslem or Croat) flew over Bosnia in  violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, it  must carry the full responsibility for what happened," the  statement said.    The Ministry said it continued to analyse the situation,  implying that the downing could be criticized at a later date.    A high-ranking Russian diplomat earlier told the INTERFAX  news agency that the Ministry had asked the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia to explain the shooting down of the four  Galeb planes by US F-16 fighter jets in a pre-dawn strike Monday.    He added that if UNPROFOR information proves to be true,  "the  Bosnian Serbs have violated one of the UN Security Council  resolutions banning any miltary flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina."    The resolution, adopted last year and backed by Russia, has  repeatedly been violated by Bosnia's three warring factions --  Serbs, Moslems and Croats, the diplomat said.</p>

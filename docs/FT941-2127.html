			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (13): Wind of change sweeps courses - US Business Schools The elite schools of management education in the US are rapidly retooling their MBA programs, adjusting to the changing climate for business in the US and elwehwere. Successful for decades at turning out highly-skilled specialists to people corporate bureaucracies, universities are now striving to mould leaders who can manage change. With most of the giants of corporate industry downsizing, re-engineering, and revamping their market focus, businesses need a different product from that which traditional MBA programmes have been turning out, explains Mr. Yoram (Jerry) Wind, director of Wharton's Center for Advanced Studies in Management. Mr. Wind interviewed more than 300 executives in key industries to determine their views on how changes in technology, environment, demographics, and international politics were changing their jobs. 'We were basically seeking to define the characteristics of 21st century enterprise,' Mr. Wind said. 'We found we weren't providing what the market needed - managers who can operate across functions, in flat hierarchies, in teams, and who can handle globalisation. Our programmes were mostly domestic and didn't deal at all with technology.' Wind's research contributed to a radical redesign of the Wharton MBA, where a new curriculum is being implemented throughout the graduate business school this year. While the Wharton programme varies in design - it makes heavy use of mini-courses in the first year of the 2-year MBA - its building blocks and philosophy are similar to those being adopted at most top-tier schools of management in the US. The new look MBA strives to incorporate new disciplines, such as information management, leadership, innovation, people skills, and crisis management into curriculums heavy with coursework in traditional fields such as marketing, finance, accounting, human resources, and management strategy. Along with the new topics comes a new teaching approach - integrating diverse material so students learn to operate effectively across functions. This innovation is more difficult for faculty than students, since it requires the often balkanised departments of academe to co-operate. Another sign of the move toward a different sort of manager is a planned change this year in the standardised business school admission test, commonly known as the GMAT. Aspiring MBAs will be asked to write two essay questions, a sign that companies and universities are beginning to value verbal and analytical skills as highly as mathematics aptitude. In addition to on-site coursework, management schools such as the University of Michigan, the University of Chicago, and Harvard, are introducing heavy doses of international exposure to their students, unusual in the US even five years ago. Northwestern University's Kellogg School, a pioneer in the internationalisation push, will send a third of its MBA students around the world this spring in special study programmes. Michigan's business school has reformed its MBA around a model that requires extensive real-life experience working at corporations, in what Dean B. Joseph White likens to a medical school approach. At Harvard Business School, where the case method of teaching has been sacrosanct for decades, there is an ambitious review in the works. Though radical changes are not expected, a recently released position paper advocates a more integrated curriculum, a diversification away from case study, and an explicit emphasis on creating business leaders rather than general managers. The criticism of the case method, one professor says, is that in a case study the parameters are well defined. 'In the real world, the problem is that the problem is not obvious at all,' he says. As for leadership, Harvard has always assumed its graduates would become leaders, says Mr. John Kotter, a professor of leadership at Harvard Business School. However, for the first time this year, a course in leadership has become part of the required curriculum. Sensitive to criticisms that egghead MBAs with financial or accounting acumen, but few social skills fit poorly in most corporate cultures, the University of Chicago has recently added people skills to the agenda of its Graduate School of Business. While still recruiting top-level math wizards, Chicago now subjects its MBA-recruits to outward-bound-style leadership adventures to promote teamwork, and asks second-year MBAs to design socialisation activities for first-year students. Not long ago, for example, a local theatre group was invited to campus to help pull students out of their academic skins and engage in role-playing. Some of these changes appear to be faddish. 'The problem with the MBA business, like any business, is that MBA programmes have been too successful. The new look is more for public consumption rather than a reality,' says Harvard University's Kotter. In fact, there are some 700 MBA programmes in the US, and competition among second-tier schools is fierce. Top students and students with funds to pay graduate fees will become scarcer as demographics change, and the US population ages. However, top-level schools are reporting an upswing in both applications and job placements, and are confident of survival no matter what curriculum revisions are made. This year, Wharton, University of Chicago, Northwestern, Harvard, and others of the MBA elite are reporting applications up on average about 15 per cent. Recruiting figures are more difficult to pin down, but most of the top schools report that more companies are making campus recruiting visits than last year, and that graduates are receiving more job offers than during the recession-distressed years of 1991 and 1992.</p>

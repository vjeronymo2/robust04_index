			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / FDP to hold out on use of bugging Germany's governing coalition faces further strain following rejection by the Free Democrats (FDP), the junior partner, of proposed legislation to widen the use of electronic bugging devices in the fight against crime, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. Such a measure would require an amendment to Germany's constitution. The FDP has argued against increased electronic monitoring on the grounds that it would be an infringement of individual rights. But the Christian Democrats believe the measures are needed to act as a deterrent against growing crime. The proposal, put forward by Mr Manfred Kanther, the interior minister, was intended to present Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, as champions of law and order ahead of this year's local, state and federal elections. Internal security, the fight against crime, and unemployment are the main themes on which the parties will campaign. The opposition Social Democratic party has indicated that it will support the bugging proposals. However, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and chairman of the FDP, and Ms Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, justice minister and his party colleague, have refused to have anything to do with the bugging proposal. The FDP has argued consistently that any change in the law must be coupled with tackling the reasons behind crime.</p>

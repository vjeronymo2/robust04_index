			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Discord over US pressure on Nafta MEXICO and Canada are at odds with the US over accords on environmental and labour standards which would form part of the North American free trade agreement (Nafta). Following a three-day negotiating session in Ottawa, Mexico and Canada expressed misgivings over Washington's demands for measures to enforce the accords and for sanctions for non-compliance. Nafta is due to come into force next January. However, the Clinton administration wants to stiffen the environmental and labour provisions of the agreement to counter fears that low Mexican wages and weak anti-pollution standards will attract many US companies to Mexico. Canada and Mexico are concerned that US companies may use environmental and labour disputes as a pretext for broader trade complaints. The two governments also contend that a separate enforcement mechanism could undermine the provisions of Nafta.</p>

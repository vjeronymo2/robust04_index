			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Ecuador seeks to entice investors ECUADOR'S sweeping reform of investment regulations last week has opened all sectors of the economy to foreign capital. Direct foreign investment will be treated under the same conditions as national capital and will no longer require prior government approval, while profits can be freely expatriated and converted into hard currency. Under the new law, which replaces one enacted in June 1991, all transfers of company shares will automatically be approved by the Ministry of Industry, opening the way for foreign acquisitions of domestic companies. Mr Mauricio Pinto, minister of industry, commerce and fisheries and one of the driving forces behind the new law, says sectors which have been completely opened up to foreign investment include the public services, banking, telecommunications and insurance. Banking, for example, had been limited to 49 per cent foreign ownership. While many observers of the Ecuadorean economy acknowledge that the new law is a big step towards liberalising foreign investment, they are cautious. Mr David Edwards, an economist at the US embassy in Quito, says some issue have not been addressed by the regulations, including price fixing in the pharmaceutical industry, weak copyright protection, and the macro-economic climate. While he does not see US investors rushing in to the Ecuador market, he says US companies have expressed interest in the telecommunications industry. He also expects Colombian and Venezuelan investors to buy majority shares in Ecuador's banking industry; they have already acquired minority stakes in recent months. According to Mr Carlos de la Paz of the British government's Overseas Trade Service, companies such as British Petroleum and British Gas, which left Ecuador in 1990 and 1991 respectively, may now reconsider returning. 'Some British mining companies will be happy,' he says. Above all, he adds, the new regulations are a sign that the government is heading in the right direction. One issue the new regulations do not address is the unequal tax structure. While domestic companies are taxed at a flat 25 per cent, foreign companies pay an additional 11 per cent on remitted profits and in some cases more. Reforming the tax structure would require congressional approval, but Mr Jose Villacis, an economist at the sub-secretary of commerce, expects a law to be passed soon.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Greek Reaction"] </F>   [Text] The Greek Government has so far been reacting to the  increasing Turkish provocations with most enduring coolness and  moderation, which give rise to doubts in a large segment of the  public. This is because PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement],  when it was an opposition party, always criticized the  nationalism of the ruling party and strongly condemned every  moderate tactic regarding Ankara, even using such terms as  "national underestimation," "betrayal of national rights," and  so forth.    This column merely notes this inconsistency without, of  course, impeaching the official opposition under the excuse that  it does not follow the tactics of its basic political opponent.  This is because our foreign policy must be charted and  implemented over and above any party antagonism. In this  specific case the motives and goals of the Turkish  provocativeness are known. The Turkish Government is now facing  a major domestic problem. The Kurdish uprising has developed  into an endless civil war, whose casualty totals over the past  decade have reached 12,000 dead!    During the same period the Kemalist element--that is the  military establishment who consented to a controlled  democratization of that country--has suffered a rapid loss of  its strength and glory. On the other hand, the Islamic spirit  has revived and expanded, as a result of which the  trustworthiness and prestige of the official Turkish leadership  is being doubted in the European and, more generally, the  Western sphere... [ellipses as published]    Therefore, a faltering Prime Minister Tansu Ciller is  anxiously seeking ways to rally the nation together and to  create concord by resorting to well-known methods--that is, to  create artificial tensions in the foreign policy sector and then  embark on acts of bullying (in Turkish daylik) with regard to  nonexistent threats against her country. Obviously, Mrs. Ciller  and her associates feel that such "appropriate" tactics could be  implemented in the most (internationally) painless and  (internally) beneficial manner only in regard to the  Greek-Turkish disputes.    In the foreign policy sector, coolness, wisdom, and  tolerance  result primarily from a feeling of supremacy. On the contrary,  insolent provocativeness and pointless aggressiveness in most  cases are an expression of weakness, despondency, or even panic.  So, the extent to which the Greek reaction toward the Turkish  provocations has developed, based on the above-mentioned facts,  is certainly justified. It remains for this reaction to be  proved right during the development and the outcome of this  specific "crisis"....</p>

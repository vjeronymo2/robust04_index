			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Yang, affiliated with the Finance and Trade </F> Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences:  "Establishing a Highly Efficient Capital Market Is an Important  Component of Financial Reform"]    [Text] Abstract    --Under the traditional system, there was basically no  capital market in our country    --Many of the current financial problems are just  spontaneous  reactions which represent market economy forces' breaking down  the confines of the rigid financial system    --Vigorously developing nonbank financial institutions  should  be an important part of the renovation of our country's  financial system    --Vigorously developing the stock market and corporate bond  market is even more unavoidable    The CPC Central Committee's decision on establishing a  socialist market economic system set the general policy of  achieving the "sustained, rapid, and healthy" development of the  national economy. In this respect, the necessary condition for  the rapid development of the national economy is the maintaining  of a high investment rate over a long period of time; meanwhile  the sufficient condition for the healthy development of the  national economy is that this high investment rate is supported  by a corresponding savings rate. Only under the situation in  which the savings rate and investment rate are kept in  equilibrium on a constant basis, will it be possible to achieve  the sustained development of the national economy. In short,  balancing investment with savings is the key to implementing  this general policy. Effectively mobilizing savings, or in other  words establishing a highly efficient capital market, will be of  even greater importance to China because investment demand has  always been high in China.    Under the traditional system, there was basically no capital  market in our country. Then the situation was based on a fiscal  system characterized by unified revenue collection and  expenditures, and savings of the entire society were  concentrated in the hands of the government and were then  allocated to enterprises in the form of fiscal appropriations to  be used for investment. Such a method of fund handling could be  said to be a special form of internal-source fund gathering.  Since the start of reform of the economic system, with the  adjustment of the structure of primary distribution of national  income, the share of government savings in overall savings of  society has gradually decreased (the amount of net government  savings is now negative), and the shares of enterprise and  resident savings have gradually increased. Based on such a  savings structure, external-source fund gathering has gradually  come to occupy a dominant position in China. According to  statistics, external-source fund gathering accounts for  approximately 70 percent of the sources of funds for enterprise  investments in our country; the manifestation in the "plate" of  state investments is that bank loans and enterprises'  self-gathered funds have become the main sources of funds.  Compared with the external-source fund gathering rate of 30-50  percent in developed market-economy countries, this rate is  rather high.    Because of the aforementioned changes of various kinds,  financial policy has come to assume a leading role in our  country's macroeconomic regulation and control system. Such a  change manifested itself as a tendency in the early period of  reform; after the three years of improvement and rectification,  the change has been widely appreciated by people. But the reform  of the financial regulation and control system in our country  has failed to keep up with this change. The main manifestations  are: First, we are still using the traditional means of credit  allocation to manage finance; however, not only is it  increasingly difficult to use such a means to control the total  amount of credit and the total money supply in society, but the  situation regarding the distribution and circulation of credit  funds in the economy is also very far from conforming to the  subjective wishes of the financial authorities. Second, we are  still using the method used for managing credit funds to manage  the issuance of various securities, artificially setting volume  limits. Third, we still lack effective means of regulating the  fund-gathering activities of various kinds carried out  independently by enterprises outside the direct fund gathering  carried out by the state. All this has resulted in financial  disorder over the past few years.    Rectifying financial order is certainly very important; but,  while there exist the so-called unhealthy tendencies as well as  the inertia of the old system behind the various phenomena of  disorder, there are also buds of financial renovation. It can  even be said that some of the current financial problems are a  kind of spontaneous reactions which represent market economy  forces' breaking down the confines of the rigid financial  system. Without an appropriate analysis of the various factors,  not only will it be difficult for rectification to produce the  desired results, but even the further growth of the Chinese  economy may be hampered. As we have seen, since the start of  economic reform, with the transformation of the system, the  growth mechanism of the Chinese economy has undergone  significant changes, The economic growth over the past decade  and more has mainly stemmed from the rapid development of  nonstate enterprises as far as economic actors are concerned,  has been mainly due to the expansion of tertiary industry as far  as the different industries are concerned, and has mainly  depended on the rapid growth of coastal regions as far as  geographical regions are concerned. Nevertheless those economic  actors and industries do not occupy an important position in the  state's credit plan; meanwhile the gains made by economically  developed regions are obviously insufficient as far as their  demands are concerned. A profound contradiction has consequently  emerged: on the one hand economic development is to a large  extent dependent on nonstate enterprises and tertiary industry  as well as on the growth of coastal regions; on the other hand  the state's official credit plan does not satisfy the needs of  those enterprises, industries, and regions for funds. As a  result, moving funds from state banks to nonstate-owned banks,  nonbank financial institutions, nonstate-owned enterprises,  tertiary industry, and economically developed regions in the  form of "short-term financing" became an unavoidable trend. As  the needs for funds thus created are not mainly based on the  objective of solving liquidity problems, it is inevitable that  "day-to-day financing" turns into "month-to-month financing,"  "quarter-to-quarter financing," and "year-to-year financing." As  such financing is mostly outside the scope of activities  permitted by the state, discipline violations are inevitable,  and high prices for funds are also to be expected. The situation  is rather similar in the area of direct fund gathering: as many  new investment projects are unable to get fund supplies through  regular channels, the phenomena of unauthorized fund gathering  and of levies not approved by the regulatory authorities have  occurred on a widespread basis.    If so, is it possible to use the method of "perfecting" fund  allocation to improve the situation? We believe that the method  is not proper and will not work. First, having the monetary  authorities allocate funds in society is a typical  planned-economy method, and it is logically consistent with  plan-based overall management, unified allocation of materials,  and unified fiscal revenue collection and fiscal expenditures;  but those economic conditions have now basically disappeared.  Second, successful fund allocation also requires several  conditions regarding the financial system. Firstly, financial  institutions should be highly unified (a situation just like  what we experienced in the past when there was only one bank in  the entire society); in this way there would not be the problem  of large-scale flows of funds within the financial system.  Secondly, actors making expenditures in society are uniform (a  situation just like what we experienced in the past when  state-owned enterprises constituted the dominant, largest sector  while the government practiced unified revenue collection and  unified expenditures with regard to them); in this way there  would not be the phenomenon of flows of funds among different  economic actors. Thirdly, financial products are undiversified  (a situation just like what we experienced in the past when  there were only simple deposits and loans across society); in  this way there would not be the exchange of various financial  products for one another, which would result in the problem of  fund transfers. Fourthly, the national economy should be closed  (a situation just like what we experienced in the past when  one-sided emphasis was given to self-reliance); in this way  there would not be the problem of unanticipated disruptive  effects of increases or decreases in international reserves and  fluctuations in exchange rates on the domestic money supply. All  such conditions have obviously disappeared today. Without the  necessary foundations and conditions, it is impossible to carry  out the "perfecting" of such a system. More important, today  when the marketization reform has been deepened significantly,  the credit plan is not only increasingly unable to meet the  demands of increasingly vigorous economic development, but has  also to an ever greater extent become a huge haven for "rent  seeking." Therefore it should be terminated as soon as possible.  It is necessary to establish a set of mechanisms for indirectly  regulating and controlling the money supply to replace the  credit plan. Under such a system, the monetary authorities will  mainly use indirect regulation and control means to regulate the  total money supply and market interest rates; the direction of  flow of funds in society is mainly determined by profit-oriented  financial institutions and securities markets in accordance with  market signals.    Under the new situation regarding financial regulation and  control, establishing an efficient capital market has become an  important task.    In the area of indirect fund gathering, establishing policy  banks is surely important, but they can only resolve fund demand  problems encountered by a few industries with bearings on state  plans and people's lives. Transforming existing specialized  banks is absolutely necessary. But, relying on commercial banks  for long-term funds is not only unable to meet the needs, but  also dangerous to some extent. This is so because commercial  banks acquire their funds mainly from the highly fluid savings  deposits of residents and enterprises and because their  liabilities also constitute the main part of the money supply;  relying on such fund sources for sustaining long-term investment  expenditures is very prone to lead to payment crisis. This is  the fundamental reason why the monetary authorities require  commercial banks to keep reserves and disbursement funds in  relation to their deposits, enforce strict requirements on the  banks' own-capital rates, regulate the banks' asset-liability  ratios, and impose strict restrictions on the banks' asset  operations. In terms of the situation in market economy  countries, the long-term funds supplied through indirect  fund-gathering channels mainly come from nonbank financial  institutions. The nonbank financial institutions discussed here  mainly refer to various insurance companies, pension funds,  trust and investment companies, common funds, savings and loan  associations and financial companies. The common characteristic  of those financial institutions is that they all have long-term,  stable sources of funds. It is exactly under such a liability  structure that they are able to play a leading role on the  capital market. If it is said that our country's financial  institutions are very underdeveloped, then our country's nonbank  financial institutions are just in the beginning stage.  Therefore, vigorously developing nonbank financial institutions  on the basis of proceeding from the demand for the establishment  of an efficient capital market should become a focus of the  efforts to renovate our country's financial system.    In the area of direct fund gathering, the important thing is  to vigorously develop standardized stock and corporate bond  markets. It should be soberly realized that volume-based  regulation of securities issuance will inevitably hamper the  process of transforming enterprises into corporations currently  under way. Furthermore, this is a regulatory means which  conflicts with principles of market economics; only by  terminating such volume restrictions would it be possible to  achieve the healthy development of the securities market or even  the market economy as a whole of our country. However, some  ideas on the issue of stocks should be clarified. When being  transformed into a corporation, an enterprise certainly has to  convert its existing assets into a certain number of shares.  Nevertheless, first, converting corporate assets into shares  does not mainly mean a simultaneous increase in assets and in  the number of shares. It is absolutely necessary to prevent the  kind of transformation into corporations which is focused on  expanding the investment scale, while neglecting the adjustment  of the structure of property rights. Second, transforming  enterprises into joint-stock companies does not necessarily mean  that their stocks have to be listed; should they be listed, such  listing does not necessarily mean that they have to be listed in  securities exchanges. After the joint stock company becomes the  main form of enterprise in our country, stocks of most  enterprises should be traded on the over-the-counter market.  That is, we may have to maintain a steady pace with regard to  the listing of stocks in securities exchanges, but we should  certainly promote the development of over-the-counter trading in  stocks. We propose that any enterprise which meets requirements  regarding securities issuance should be permitted to gather  funds on the market. Artificially setting volume limits on  securities issuance can only contribute to the expansion of  irregular fund-gathering activities. In view of the abnormal  situation of excessively high debt ratios of our country's  enterprises and in view of the fact that such a situation can be  fundamentally resolved only through transforming enterprises'  capital structure, vigorously developing the stock market and  the corporate bond market is unavoidable.    In short, it is necessary to endeavour to create a more  relaxed, liberal, pluralistic, and competitive financial system  through financial reform. Only on the basis of such a financial  system will the central bank be able to assume a detached  position and be truly capable of playing the role as the umpire.  On the other hand, if there are only a very small number of  financial institutions and a very small number of financial  instruments in the economy, resulting in a situation in which  "leadership is rendered ineffectual by recalcitrant  subordinates," the central bank's macro-regulation and -control  will become truly irrelevant.</p>

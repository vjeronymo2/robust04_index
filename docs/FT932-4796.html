			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Mines owner set to be president: Unofficial results in Bolivian poll give Sanchez de Lozada clear lead MR Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, a US-raised mine company owner, looks set to be the new president of Bolivia, after the most peaceful elections in the country's history, held on Sunday. Unofficial results gave him a clear lead of almost 14 percentage points. His Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) won 35 per cent of the vote, against 21.1 per cent for the ruling Patriotic Accord (AP) led by a former military dictator, ex-General Hugo Banzer. Claiming victory yesterday, Mr Sanchez said: 'The people have voted for change.' However, the final outcome will emerge from a secret vote by Congress on August 6. Projections of the results of the congressional elections, also held on Sunday but not to be confirmed for 20 days, gave Mr Sanchez's party 69 of the 79 seats required for a majority. He will need a deal with one of the 12 smaller parties. Despite administrative problems, which have delayed voting in some areas until next Sunday, the election proceeded smoothly under the supervision of a new and independent electoral court. The results confounded pollsters, all of whom had predicted a very close contest. Mr Jose Gramunt, head of FIDES, the Bolivian news service, described it as 'the best possible outcome'. He attributed the success of Mr Sanchez to disillusion with the government, as well as to his choice of Mr Vctor Hugo Cardenas, an indigenous politician, as his vice-presidential running-mate. This made a contrast with the European-descended minority, which provides most of Bolivia's politicians, and attracted many rural voters. Mr Sanchez is well-respected abroad as the author of a stabilisation plan in 1985 which reduced inflation from more than 24,000 per cent a year to 15 per cent. Bolivia now has one of the lowest inflation rates in South America, at 9 per cent, but is also the continent's poorest country and has considerable fiscal and balance-of-payment problems. Mr Sanchez being pledged to continue the country's free market policies and austerity programme, his victory was welcomed by the business community.</p>

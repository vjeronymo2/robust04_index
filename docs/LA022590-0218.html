			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GRADCO STRUGGLES TO REPRODUCE PROFIT;  </P> <P> ENTREPRENEURS: KEY PATENTS HAVEN'T SHIELDED THE IRVINE-BASED MAKER OF COPIER  ACCESSORIES FROM LOSSES. CHIEF EXECUTIVE KEITH B. STEWART IS BATTLING TO  RESTORE HIS COMPANY'S FORTUNES.  </P> <P> Keith B. Stewart, an articulate man with a graying beard and a stern demeanor,  has built a company that looks on the surface like a classic entrepreneurial  success. In little more than 10 years, his Irvine-based Gradco Systems Inc. has  grown from a lowly distributor of paper-feeders to a $100-million company that  claims a virtual monopoly on certain copy machine accessories.  </P> <P> And with the continued proliferation of copiers, computer printers and fax  machines, a company specializing in sorters and paper-feeders would seem to  have a great future, especially when it can boast, as Gradco does, of broad  patents and strong relationships with the major Japanese electronics companies.  </P> <P> But Gradco has never quite lived up to Wall Street's expectations. Stock was  initially offered to the public in 1983 at $18 a share, and it now languishes  around $9. A proposed management-led buyout announced by Stewart last fall --  which drove the stock to $19 -- never materialized, apparently because the  Japanese financiers who were backing the deal grew skittish. And last month  Gradco announced an unexpected quarterly loss and a sharp decline in revenue.  </P> <P> While Stewart maintains that these setbacks are temporary, others are not so  sure. Gradco recently lost a key contract to supply sorters to Xerox Corp., and  analysts suggest that other copier companies may find ways to design around  Gradco's patents. Some have also raised questions about Stewart's management  style, and both Gradco and Stewart are facing several unrelated lawsuits  alleging various forms of fraud.  </P> <P> Stewart, a controversial figure described by associates in terms ranging from  "excellent manager" to "autocratic, charming and ruthless," says the lawsuits  are all groundless. And he maintains that the poor quarterly results were an  aberration that will be emphatically corrected in the coming year. "Demand for  our products is greater than ever," Stewart said in an interview. "We have  contracts with every major copier manufacturer going forward."  </P> <P> Indeed, some securities analysts still believe Gradco has a lot of potential. A  recent report from the Los Angeles brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards  states that the company has a "bright, long-term future" and predicts that  either a buyout or simply good operating performance will drive the stock back  up to at least to the $12 level and possibly much higher. New York-based Plenum  Publishing Corp. now owns about 8% of Gradco's shares and has said it might  pursue a takeover, though most analysts discount that possibility and say a  Japanese takeover is more likely.  </P> <P> Stewart has taken the offensive in countering the recent troubles, and is now  putting the finishing touches on a complex restructuring of Gradco that will  shift the core operations to Japan. A management buyout, he said, still remains  a possibility, as does a takeover by another firm or a public offering of the  beefed-up Japanese subsidiary.  </P> <P> The restructuring plan calls for Gradco's Japanese subsidiary to assume  operational responsibility for all copier products, which account for some 70%  of Gradco's revenue and include the patented "moving bin" sorter that has long  been the core of Gradco's business.  </P> <P> The remaining operating entity in the United States will be called Gradco  Printer Products and will be headed by a new president, with candidates now  being recruited from outside the company. Gradco Systems in Irvine will  effectively become a holding company for the operating entities, carrying out  some basic research and development as well as corporate finance and  acquisition functions.  </P> <P> The Japanese unit will be headed by Mark Takeuchi, whose track record includes  a long stint at C. Itoh &amp; Co., and Gradco Japan will establish its own  subsidiary in the United States under the name Gradco Systems America. Ikegami  Tsushinki Ltd. of Japan and Sindo-Ricoh &amp; Co. Ltd. of South Korea will take  small equity stakes in the Japanese company and will be responsible for all  engineering and manufacturing of Gradco's copier and printer products,  respectively.  </P> <P> The equity stakes, whose exact size has not been determined, constitute a  "predistribution" of shares that would speed up any future public offering of  the Japanese subsidiary.  </P> <P> Stewart said equity or joint venture partners will also be sought for the  U.S.-based printer business, and a new distribution network for those products  will either be internally developed or acquired. The fate of Gradco's  100-employee Santa Ana manufacturing facility has not yet been determined, but  it might be closed.  </P> <P> "On the surface, the printer and copier markets look very much the same,"  Stewart said in explaining the reorganization. "But the more you look at them,  they are totally different markets with products sold through entirely  different channels, and they take different sets of skills and experience." The  new manufacturing arrangements will yield substantial cost reductions, he  added.  </P> <P> Stewart hopes the new structure will enable Gradco to build up the  printer-products side of the business to 50% of revenue and reduce the  company's heavy dependence on copying machine sorters. The moving-bin sorters,  which consist of a column of as many as 20 paper bins that move up and down to  catch the copies as they emerge from the machine, are the technology of choice  for small office copiers known as "convenience copiers."  </P> <P> Gradco has attributed its recent woes -- a quarterly loss of $1.5 million on  revenue of $20.5 million, contrasted with a profit of $1.4 million and revenue  of $30.4 million a year ago -- to the loss of a major contract, product delays  on the part of the copier manufacturers and problems in getting some of its own  printer products out the door. Stewart confirmed that the lost contract was  with Xerox Corp., one of the company's oldest and biggest customers.  </P> <P> Xerox still does business with Gradco, and Stewart notes that Fuji Xerox of  Japan remains a major customer. But the fact that Xerox is increasingly using  its own sorter technology points to a potentially broader problem for Gradco.  Much of Wall Street's enthusiasm for the stock over the past five years grew  out of the perception that Gradco had a virtual monopoly in its niche, and that  is becoming less and less the case.  </P> <P> "There are ways to get around the patents," said Robert Sostilio, who follows  copiers for the market research firm Dataquest. If copier manufacturers can  develop their own technology, they can make their own sorters and not rely on  products or licenses from Gradco. Nicholas Pantazis, an analyst with the New  York stock research firm Monness Crespi &amp; Hardt, added, "Gradco has had the  most effective technology, but not the only technology."  </P> <P> A former Gradco executive who asked not to be identified said the company had  done "a very poor job of taking advantage of its place in the market,"  remaining far too dependent on moving-bin sorters. Gradco's effort to penetrate  the printer-feeder business through the acquisition of Ziyad Inc. in 1986 for  $24.5 million has had mixed results, and Gradco's newest market -- sorters for  fax machines that would route incoming documents to personalized mailboxes --  is unlikely to develop for some years.  </P> <P> The dent in Gradco's image that became visible last year was especially  ill-timed for the firm, coming just as Stewart was trying to put together a  management buyout. After a run-up in the stock price, Stewart disclosed last  September that he was pursuing a buyout and had retained the Lodestar Group for  financial advice. But on Dec. 1, after several days of rumors, Stewart revealed  that the financing had fallen through.  </P> <P> Stewart said Ysuda Trust Co. and Yamaichi Securities were both part of the  proposed buyout, though he would not confirm reports that the buyout consisted  of a novel plan to take the company private and then refloat it on the Japanese  stock exchange. This would have enabled Gradco to take advantage of the fact  that share prices in Japan are far higher for the same level of earnings than  they are in the United States, and it made sense for the company because so  many of its major customers are in Japan.  </P> <P> The Gradco deal was still being put together when the failure of the United  Airlines leveraged buyout cast a pall over all such transactions, Stewart said,  though he conceded that the earnings problems may also have contributed to the  collapse of the deal. Stewart owns 12% of Gradco's shares and indirectly  controls another 11%.  </P> <P> Jane Gilday of Gruntal &amp; Co. in New York and several other analysts said  the buyout discussions diverted the attention of Stewart and other Gradco  executives from the day-to-day operations of the business, contributing to the  poor results. Stewart rejects the criticism. "It's just not that time-consuming  a process," he said, adding that the bad results were caused by factors beyond  his -- or anyone else's -- control.  </P> <P> Some outside observers agree that Gradco's difficulties are nothing out of the  ordinary. Elliot Steinberg, a San Francisco investment manager who helped  advise the wealthy Pritzker family when it bought a 6% stake in Gradco, said  the problems were similar to those experienced by many small companies.  "They've just fallen behind in their game plan," Steinberg said. "But they  should make up for it this year."  </P> <P> Frank K. Moore, a former Gradco director who owns an Orange County copier  dealer, said he believed the company has scraped bottom and "the upside  potential is excellent." Gradco, he said, has "gone through some struggles" but  is now in "better shape than ever."  </P> <P> One securities analyst criticized the investment community for not looking more  closely at the company and for building up expectations that could not be met.  Stewart echoed this notion, saying there had been a lot of speculation over the  last several years. He attributed the financial community's interest to the  fact that it was a niche company with a strong market position whose business  was easy to understand. But while $19 a share might have been based on takeover  speculation, at $9 the stock is undervalued, he added.  </P> <P> But some Gradco watchers remain wary of the company, in part because of Stewart  himself. A native of the United Kingdom who was raised in Rhodesia, Stewart --  who lives in Laguna Beach and drives a Rolls-Royce with "GRADCO" license plates  -- tends to evoke strong reactions from those who come in contact with him.  While many associates praise him as a dynamic businessman with a tremendous  amount of energy and excellent sales skills, others say he is autocratic,  unable to delegate authority and disrespectful of those who disagree with him.  </P> <P> Peter Shea, who co-founded Gradco with Stewart as a simple collator distributor  in 1972, describes Stewart as an excellent salesman who can be very charming  but can also be very ruthless. Shea, now the owner of Entrepreneur magazine,  said he and Stewart no longer talk.  </P> <P> Analysts question his management style. "It's definitely a one-man show," said  Donna Hostetler, an analyst with Crowell Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles.  "Whatever Stewart wants, he'll get. I don't think the company is run by the  board of directors. When a company gets to a certain size, you have to start  delegating, and I don't think he's done that."  </P> <P> Gilday of Gruntal &amp; Co., a one-time touter of Gradco stock when she was  with McKinley Allsopp, added: "Steps have been taken that have failed, and the  business has dropped off, so I don't give him high marks."  </P> <P> But Moore called Stewart "dynamic, intelligent and very creative in the way he  does business," though he said Stewart had in the past made some mistakes in  choosing managerial talent. "He has given up the reins and it hasn't worked  out; he's had to step back in."  </P> <P> Two former employees have much harsher criticism for Stewart. In separate but  related lawsuits filed in Connecticut, John C. Hamma and R. Clark Dubois, both  former Gradco engineers, allege that they were the co-inventors of the sorter  technology and that Stewart fraudulently deprived them of royalty payments.  </P> <P> They charge that Stewart induced them to accept lump sum payments in lieu of a  percentage of sales by misrepresenting the status of Gradco's efforts to  license the technology to major copier manufacturers. Hamma also alleges that  he was intimidated by Stewart and threatened with termination if he hired a  lawyer, and Dubois claims he was fired and locked out of his office for  complaining.  </P> <P> Stewart said the claims are completely without merit. Gradco's key technology,  he said, was invented by Frederick J. Lawrence, who remains the company's chief  engineer.  </P> <P> Stewart also has been sued for $6 million by Alton Laguna Partners, owner of  Gradco's headquarters in the Irvine Spectrum. Alton Laguna alleges that Gradco  backed out of a deal for an expansion of the office space after the partnership  refused to enter a "usurious" loan agreement with an off-shore company  affiliated with Stewart.  </P> <P> Stewart called the allegations "fictitious" and "a joke," and said he had  refused a recent offer to settle the case out of court. Robert Beauchamp, an  attorney representing Alton Laguna, said his client offered to settle for $3  million. "We are not concerned about the strength of our case; we think it's  very strong," Beauchamp said.  </P> <P> In the wake of the failed management buyout, Gradco also has been sued by  several shareholders claiming breach of fiduciary duties.  </P> <P> Stewart has in the past suffered reversals in the courtroom. In 1986, an Orange  County Superior Court judge ruled that Stewart had fraudulently persuaded his  wife to accept a $750,000 divorce settlement in 1983 by concealing from her the  true value of Gradco. Under the settlement, Connie Stewart agreed to give up  any claim to 2.1 million Gradco shares the Stewarts owned. A day after the  agreement was signed, Gradco sent a letter to shareholders announcing its plans  for a public stock offering, which eventually valued those shares at more than  $37 million.  </P> <P> The case was subsequently settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.  </P> <P> No matter how many feathers he has ruffled, though, Stewart can still lay claim  to building a successful company that competes in a part of industry where few  American companies dare tread. Standing in the lobby of Gradco's headquarters,  Stewart gestures brusquely at row of plaques on the wall -- quality awards from  International Business Machines and several other companies. "Why does everyone  look at the negative and never talk about that?" he grumbles.  </P> <P> Indeed, if Stewart's latest plan succeeds, Wall Street may again be talking  about Gradco as a great American entrepreneurial success.  </P> <P> </P> <P> KEITH B.

Most  copier manufacturers offer it as an accessory on their machines, and either buy  it from Gradco or manufacture it under license.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GRADCO REVENUE, BY CUSTOMER, FISCAL 1989  </P> <P> Percent of total revenue, millions of dollars in parentheses:  </P> <P> Other: 37% ($42.0)  </P> <P> XEROX*: 24% ($27.2)  </P> <P> RICOH: 14% ($15.9)  </P> <P> TOSHIBA: 13% ($14.7)  </P> <P> KONICA: 12% ($13.6)  </P> <P> * Xerox includes Rank Xerox and Fuji Xerox  </P> <P> </P> <P> GRADCO STOCK HISTORY  </P> <P> Dollars per share, closing bid at end of each month:  </P> <P> 1983: Gradco offers stock to the public at $18 a share.  </P> <P> 1985: Analysts begin to recommend Gradco stock.  </P> <P> April 1986: $16.50  </P> <P> June 1986: Gradco reports earnings of $1.8 million for fiscal 1986.  </P> <P> Nov. 1987: $5.00  </P> <P> Sept. 1989: Gradco announces that it is pursuing a management led buyout of the  company.  </P> <P> Sept. 1989: $18.50  </P> <P> Feb. 1990: $9.63  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1973: Gradco founded as a distributor of paper-handling gear.  </P> <P> 1979: Gradco designs the moving&amp;bin sorter for copying machines.  </P> <P> Jan. 1985: Gradco moves most of its manufacturing operations from Santa Ana to  South Korea.  </P> <P> June 1985: Gradco reports a $5.5-million loss for fiscal 1985, attributing it  to the shutdown of its dealer network and the cost of moving its manufacturing  offshore.  </P> <P> Dec. 1986: Gradco acquires Ziyad Inc., a New Jersey manufacturer of  paper-feeders for computer printers.  </P> <P> 1987: Gradco makes a series of small acquisitions, including Dyna Five Corp.  and Venture Engineering Inc.  </P> <P> Mar. 1988: One-time Gradco engineer John C.

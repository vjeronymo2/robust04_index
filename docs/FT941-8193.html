			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: The board of I G Metall, the German engineering workers' union, meets to decide on possible strike ballot. A ballot will take several days to organise and at least two days to conduct. Tuesday: The French trade balance for December is expected to show a Ffr6.7bn surplus, compared with Ffr6.6bn in November. Thursday: German cost of living figures, expected today, are forecast to show a further fall from January's 3.5 per cent to an annual rate of 3.2-3.4 per cent in February. Underlying inflation pressures have eased, allowing the Bundesbank to cut rates last week. Friday: The CBI monthly trends report for February will provide further evidence of the strength of the UK economy. The quarterly report, published last month, presented a fairly upbeat picture of business confidence. The UK will also publish its trade balance with non-European Union countries in January. The deficit is expected to have widened to Pounds 790m, from Pounds 675m in December. French consumer price index figures for January are expected to show that inflation still remains low at 2.1 per cent.</p>

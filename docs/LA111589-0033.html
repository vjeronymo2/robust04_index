			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTING  </P> <P> How discouraging to read the letter (Nov. 5) from the reader who suggested that  a $5 rebate be given to the citizens who voted. Aren't people aware yet that  there are those willing to give their lives for the free elections that so many  Americans seem to take for granted? We have seen what happened in China. What  more is it going to take for people to realize that the right to vote should  not be treated as an inconvenience but as a privilege?  </P> <P> In the words of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, "Nobody will ever deprive the  American people of the right to vote except the American people themselves --  and the only way they could do that is by not voting."  </P> <P> VICTORIA SANDBERG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

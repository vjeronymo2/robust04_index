			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Arts: In pursuit of plays for tomorrow - Television Last week 86 playwrights wrote to The Guardian (where else) with a letter they had sent to subsidised theatres in Britain asserting that there had been a drastic decrease in the production of new plays. This, they claim, has sent British theatres into a decline and irrelevance - their phraseology  -which is proved by the failure to attract audiences, and there must, therefore, be a return to new work if subsidies are not to be withdrawn. They ask each theatre to undertake to produce at least three new plays a year, two of which must be in the main house (rather than some small experimental area, presumably). They must be full scale productions of world premieres by living writers, must not include pantomimes or book adaptations, and must run for at least 18 performances. 'It is very little to ask', they say. My first reaction was to wonder why the list of signatories - which contains such famous names as Arden, Pinter, and Wesker - lacks those of Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn. Could it be that the work of the latter pair attracts enough paying customers to avoid the need for subsidies? If so, what does that tell us about the others? Next I wondered whether it had occurred to the playwrights that, until about 40 years ago, people had had to go out for their drama but that now virtually everyone has the means of watching drama in their own home every day. Can the writers not see that, in the age of television, to demand that your work be done in the theatre is rather like demanding that, in the age of the car, we go back to the horse and cart: more traditional and charming, and possibly more enjoyable for those with the time and patience, but impractical and too expensive for most. It would surely have made better sense if the playwrights had written the following letter to Alan Yentob, Michael Jackson, Marcus Plantin, Michael Grade, and David Elstein, responsible respectively for the programming on BBC1, BBC2, ITV, Channel 4, and Sky: 'There has been a drastic decrease in the number of new plays being produced by British television and also in the proportion of your budgets spent on new plays. We believe this shows an unacceptable set of priorities. The loss of vitality caused by the abandonment of new work and the increasing reliance upon stereotyped 60-minute drama series about the police, firemen, criminals and so on, threatens to reduce British television, which had become one of the most important channels for the introduction and consideration of new ideas, to the level of a mundane medium of undemanding entertainment. 'It was not ever thus. In the 1960s and 70s your predecessors nurtured our predecessors, in some cases the very people whose signatures appear below, for example David Edgar, David Hare, Mike Leigh, John MacGrath, Alan Plater and David Rudkin. Their names may be widely known now, but that was not so when they began working for television. Twenty five years ago there were entire departments at the BBC and in ITV devoted to finding and bringing on new talent. The result was what is now seen by many as a golden age of television drama. In 1968 one umbrella title alone - the BBC's Play For Today - commissioned work from scores of writers including Dennis Potter, David Mercer, Simon Gray, Fay Weldon, Michael Frayn, John Mortimer, William Trevor, Peter Nichols, and Alun Owen. 'Today the drama output of British television must be two or three times greater than in 1968 and yet you have virtually turned your backs on the sort of work done by the writers listed above. This is precisely the sort of work which we believe we should be doing and you should be making available to the public in addition to what television is already providing. We have nothing against Martin Chuzzlewit: Tom Wilkinson is giving the performance of his life as Pecksniff, and when you notice that it is not only the roads which have been covered in horse dung but also the hems of the ladies' dresses, you realise that the BBC is paying as much attention to detail as it ever did in its classic adaptations. The fact remains that Martin Chuzzlewit was written 150 years ago. 'We do not pretend that all your drama is that old. BBC2's Saturday night 'Performance' slot has just given us a new production of JB Priestley's Summer Day's Dream which was much concerned with the interplay of ideas - socialism, mysticism, capitalism - and was written in 1949. A week earlier it was a new production of Paddy Chayefsky's 1954 American TV play Mother, and three weeks ago in the same slot, Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea written in 1952. As playwrights we are of course glad to see that the work of some of our predecessors is not forgotten, yet we find it odd that you should choose to revive mediocre work such as this rather than commission new material. 'True, your potboilers - Peak Practice, Soldier Soldier, Between The Lines - are mostly contemporary, yet even in the best of them - Cracker and Finney - the greater degree of ambition is concerned more with creating a slicker product than with moving beyond the business of entertainment. Good though Cracker is there is nothing very unusual in 1994 about shrewd psychological insights into the mind of the criminal; it has been standard fare in modern literature and Hollywood for decades. Finney is well enough acted and nicely photographed; the funeral in the opening episode must surely be among the Top 50 filmed funerals in British television drama this year. But since the film noir of the 1940s, urban crime feuds of this sort have become another staple of cinema and television drama. 'There is more thoughtful writing by living authors in Channel 4 films and 10-minute 'try-out' spots for new directors and writers on BBC2 and Channel 4, but those are rare outcrops. As a general rule you now seem to ignore the sort of work that we offer, work of the kind that used to create such interest among British viewers and gave British television such an extraordinarily high standing in other countries. If you leave the seed corn to rot, and never develop new strains, your crops will grow weak and fail. Live theatre has done an amazing job in keeping contemporary drama alive at a time when more modern media of communication have acquired overwhelming popularity, but it is surely time for television, with its enormous budgets, to resume its vital role as chief patron of living drama.' Yours etcetera.</p>

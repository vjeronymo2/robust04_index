			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: X-RATED TRANCE TEXTURES FROM CHRIS &amp; COSEY  </P> <P> Steve &amp; Eydie. Sonny &amp; Cher. The Captain &amp; Tennille. Chris &amp;  Cosey.  </P> <P> Chris &amp; Cosey? This pair of X-rated, industrial-strength English multimedia  manipulators probably won't be joining those show-biz couples in any Vegas  showrooms in the near future. But like many other show-biz couples, Chris and  Cosey have developed an act reflecting the tastes of their particular audience,  and their performance at Bogart's on Friday night was pretty much the same show  they've brought to past Los Angeles appearances.  </P> <P> Against a video collage featuring images of sexual play and subconscious  disarray, the stone-faced Chris Carter created a synthesized series of sensual,  cyclic, rhythm-heavy trance textures while Cosey Fanni Tutti, dressed in  Spandex/bondage finery, whispered dire nothings, blasted a trumpet for a note  or two, pulled a series of white noise clusters from a guitar, thwacked a drum  machine and moved and grooved like a dancer in the London girlie bars where she  once worked.  </P> <P> Nowadays there's a slightly sinister sub-text to the couple's sex-and-psyche  explorations; hearing Cosey murmur "Infectious" against a throbbing,  midnight-blue sound track has obvious implications. Yet Chris &amp; Cosey are  not celebrating death; if anything, the physicality of their subterranean dream  drones investigates the most primal of life forces. And for some, that's  entertainment.CRAIG LEE  </P></p>

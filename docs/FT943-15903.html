			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Power companies accused over databases Some electricity distribution companies are breaking the law by using customer databases to promote services other than electricity, the Data Protection Registrar said yesterday in a statement which has implications for all privatised utilities. Mr Eric Howe, the registrar, also raised the prospect of conflict between the data protection office and the financial services industry over the confidentiality of personal financial information. He said in his annual report that he believed a number of current and planned uses of customer data information by regional electricity companies in England and Wales were in contravention of data protection law. He said that under the Electricity and Data Protection Acts it was illegal for companies either to use their customer mailings as 'host' for non-electricity promotions or to pass names and addresses to commercial third parties. 'There may be implications for the activities or proposed activities of other utilities,' he said. Mr Howe intends to write to the electricity companies and to consult the utility regulators on the issue. But he 'anticipated' that his successor as registrar, who takes office in September, would issue formal guidance in the next year. But the registrar's office left the legal position ambivalent by adding that it might be possible for the electricity companies to use personal data in some cases provided they offered customers a chance to opt out. At present few utilities use their databases for more than customer-client administration, but many are believed to be considering doing so as a means of generating new earnings. Eastern Electricity said Mr Howe's statement 'added to existing legal ambiguity' over the use of customer data and that it would approach the Department of Trade and Industry for clarifi-cation. Mr Howe said legal action between the financial services industry and the data protection office could take place in months following a paper circulated by the registrar earlier this year over the disclosure of information about customers. The paper said that disclosure of personal financial information could only follow specific consent from the individuals concerned, and that such consent might in any case be insufficient under a European Union directive set to be enshrined in UK law. The paper has met a hostile reaction from the financial services industry, including one claim that it amounted to a 'fraudsters' charter'. Mr Howe said a response from the government appeared to support his legal view. Mr Howe said he was 'not unsympathetic' to arguments that defaulters on loans should lose some rights to confidentiality. He remained convinced, however, that 'those who do service debts properly should have control over whether their financial affairs should be revealed to others'. Mr Howe also raised concerns about the introduction of national identification through policies such as driving licences with photos, social security 'swipe' cards and the use of national insurance and national health service numbers for new purposes. He said: 'The issue is too fundamental for the UK to allow itself simply to slip into having a de facto national identification system without the necessary safeguards and restrictions.'</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MOTOROLA STOCK SLIDES ON PROFIT REPORT  </P> <P> Semiconductor producer Motorola Inc. reported weaker-than-expected  third-quarter earnings Tuesday, sending the company's shares tumbling nearly  12%.  </P> <P> Motorola's stock fell $7, or 11.7%, to close at $52.75 on the New York Stock  Exchange after the company said its profit in the period was $102 million, up  from $89 million a year ago.  </P> <P> But that was well below what analysts had predicted. The consensus was that  Motorola would post earnings from 90 cents to "just over $1."  </P> <P> Motorola said semiconductor product sales rose by a record 14% in the quarter  but that its core cellular telephone businesses had lower operating profits,  primarily because of heavy investments in technology.  </P> <P> The company was nonetheless bullish about its performance, which included  higher sales and earnings for the third quarter and the first nine months of  1990.  </P> <P> George Fisher, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the  third-quarter earnings were on target with Motorola's expectations.  </P> <P> "I feel good about the results," Fisher said in an interview, although he  declined to comment on prospects for the balance of the year or on the  company's stock activity.  </P> <P> "Our customers are investing in Motorola products, systems and services that  will improve productivity and efficiency and save time," Fisher said.  </P> <P> The Schaumberg, Ill.-based company reported that third-quarter sales rose 12%  over the same period last year, to $2.7 billion from $2.41 billion.  </P> <P> For the first nine months of the year, profit rose to $390 million, from $366  million in the year-ago period. Sales were $7.95 billion for the nine-month  period, up from $6.97 billion.  </P> <P> Motorola released its earnings a day after it announced the settlement of a  patent infringement lawsuit with Hitachi Ltd.  </P> <P> Motorola has refused to give details of the settlement. Hitachi had threatened  to cut off supplies of key parts to American computer manufacturers.  </P></p>

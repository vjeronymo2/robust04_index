			<p>BFN     [Text] Forestry Minister Xu Youfang arrived at the  forefront of the (Hongba) forest fire site on 20 April to direct  the operation of extinguishing the fire. After hearing a  briefing on efforts to extinguish the forest fire, Minister Xu  Youfang relayed the following four directives by the State  Council:    1. Efforts should be made to adopt practical and effective  measures for the operation and to make use of topographical  advantages to create a separation gap and to pay attention to  watching the fire situation.    2. We should be determined to concentrate strong forces on  waging a battle and make good arrangements for ensuring support  services for the safety of personnel.    3. We should maintain close contact with the meteorological  departments and be aware of weather changes at all times.    4. We should report the disaster situation to the State  Council at all times.    Minister Xu Youfang said: The pine trees of Zhangzi species  are rare and the forest zones of such trees are the state  wealth. The State Council attaches great importance on the seed  forest base of Zhangzi-species pine trees in the Honghuaerqu  forestry administration bureau. Thus, the struggle against the  forest fire is important and greatly significant. The  organizational and commanding work undertaken by the  headquarters to extinguish the fire should be keyed up and  carried out in a orderly manner. Responsibilities for the  operation should be clearly defined, in addition, the policies  and orders should be carried out in a unified manner.  Meanwhile, efforts should be made to ensure support services to  avoid missing opportunities to fight the fire.</p>

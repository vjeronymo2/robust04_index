The paper says the rural theses is a perfect programme of  rural construction which indicates the way of a most successful  solution of the socialist rural question on the basis of the  chuche idea.    It quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying:    "`Theses on the socialist rural question in our country'  authored by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is our party's  programme of building the countryside and a bright blueprint for  a final solution of the rural question."    In the past period the theses has been successfully applied  to the rural construction in Korea, demonstrating its great  vitality and proving its greatness, correctness and truth, the  paper notes, and goes on:    The validity and invincible vitality of the rural theses  lie,  above all, in that it has powerfully accelerated the  revolutionization and working-classization of the peasants and  immensely strengthened the driving force of socialism in the  countryside.    All the agricultural working people in Korea are now firmly  armed with the great chuche idea of our party and closely  rallied behind the party and the leader in ideology and purpose  and in-morality and sense of obligation. They are making  vigorous efforts to bringing into practice the party's  far-reaching plan of rural construction, helping and leading  each other forward under the slogan of collectivism--one for all  and all for one. This is the noble traits of our peasants.    Its validity and vitality are also manifested in that it has  constantly consolidated the material and technical foundations  of the rural economy and brought a fresh development of the  agricultural production.    With the successful implementation of the policy of rural  technical revolution, irrigation and electrification were  flawlessly completed on a high level long ago and a signal  progress has been made in mechanization and extensive use of  chemicals in Korea.    Modern means of agricultural science and technique have been  massively introduced into the rural economy and the most  advantageous chuche farming method has been applied with the  result that Korea reaps bumper crops every year.    The validity and vitality of the theses are highly displayed  also in that the level of guidance and management of the rural  economy has been steadily enhanced and the gap between towns and  countryside considerably narrowed in all spheres.    Thanks to the chuche-based agricultural guidance system with  the county cooperative farm management committee as its center,  the guidance and management of the rural economy have been  improved and the leadership role of the all-people property over  cooperative property enhanced to eliminate the distinctions  between the towns and rural areas in ownership and management.    The level of the general knowledge of the peasantry and  their  technical and cultural standards have been markedly raised with  the cultural revolution pushed ahead in the countryside, and  the gap between the towns and the countryside in cultural living  conditions has been narrowed with the introduction of water and  bus services into the countryside and the expansion of the TV  networks to cover it and the conversion of village clinics into  hospitals.    Those proud victory and achievements made in rural  construction through the successful application of the great  rural theses in Korea are entirely results of the wise  leadership of the party and the leader, concludes the article.</p>

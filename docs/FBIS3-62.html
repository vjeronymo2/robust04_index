			<p>Chiba     Prefecture has been successfully carrying out construction  of the "Kazusa Academia Park," the second project of an ambitious  plan to establish three new industrial-based cities in Chiba  Prefecture.  Chiba Prefecture incorporated a semi-public corporation  in 1991 to establish this world-class science park.  This  cooperative effort included four Chiba cities, the Japan Development  Bank, and private companies.  Zoning and infrastructure development  for the first phase of the Kazusa Academia Park is to be completed  by the end of 1995.  It has been estimated that the first phase will  cost approximately 41 billion yen ($370 million) of which over 22  billion yen ($200 million) is designated for the construction (NIHON  KOGYO SHIMBUN  26 Jan 94).      (The hard copy version of this FMN contains a photo of the final  proposed site plan for the Kazusa Academia Center which will be the  central facility of the Kazusa Academia Park.)      Three Industrial-based Cities in Chiba      Chiba Prefecture is making steady progress in the construction of  its new science park, Kazusa Academia Park.  Establishment of the  Kazusa Academia Park was part of Chiba Prefecture's conceptual plan  submitted in 1983 to establish three new industrial-based cities in  Chiba.  These cities include Makuhari New Metropolis, in Chiba City;  Narita International Airport Community, in Narita City; and Kazusa  Academia Park, in Kisarazu City.  Chiba Prefecture aims to establish  the Kazusa Academia Park as a world-class research and development  city, integrating primary R&amp;D facilities for prospective industries   (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN  26 Jan 94).      Construction of the Kazusa Academia Park was initiated in March  1991, following the completion of the first stage of the Makuhari  New Metropolis.  The total area of the project site is  approximately 1000 hectares.  Chiba Prefecture predicts it will take  approximately 10 years to complete each of the three phases of the  project completing the construction in 30 years (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN  26 Jan 94).      The first development phase will result in approximately 278  hectares of the site.  The table shown in Figure 1 represents the  projected size of each construction site (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 Jan  94).      Kazusa Academia Park, World-class R&amp;D Center     Compared to Tsukuba Science City, in Ibaraki Prefecture, in which  the majority of the research organizations are national research  institutes, the center of the Kazusa Academia Park will be comprised  of private companies.  These companies are expected to be the  driving force of Japanese science and technology in the 21st  Century.  Chiba Prefecture's objective is to establish an  international R&amp;D center for high-tech industries including  electronics, advanced materials, and biotechnology, centered with  private research institutes.  The prefecture also aims the  development growth of Kisarazu City and Kimitsu City as "mother  cities," along with development of the new cities.  When a new road  that crosses over the Tokyo Bay is completed in 1996 it will be  approximately 30 minutes to the Kazusa Academia Park from either the  Haneda Airport or Kawasaki City and about 50 minutes from downtown  of Tokyo by car (See Map shown in  Figure 2.) (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 Jan 94).      Kazusa DNA Research Institute      The highlight of the Kazusa Academia Park will be the "Kazusa DNA  Research Institute," which is scheduled to be open in the fall of  1994.  The research institute will be Japan's first research center  specializing in structural analysis of DNA.  The construction of the  institute is near completion, with approximately 15 billion yen  ($136 million) allocated.  The institute is expected to be one of  the world's largest research centers when completed.  The institute  will be operated by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute Foundation,  which was established in March of 1991.  Gaishi Hiraiwa, senior  advisor to The Tokyo Electric Power Co. and chairman of the Japan  Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), has been appointed  as the chairman of the board of the institute (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN  19 Jan 94, DENKI SHIMBUN 13 Dec 93).  The institute will initially  be operated with 70 staff members, including Mitsuru Takanami,  professor emeritus of Kyoto University, who will be the director of  the institute, Susumu Tonegawa, Nobel Prize-winning molecular  biologist and MIT professor, and Itaru Watanabe, professor emeritus  of Keio University -- both appointed as special advisors (NIHON  KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 Jan 94).      The institute will encourage joint research projects between  Japanese researchers and researchers from overseas as a research  institute with an "open-door policy."  The institute plans to  establish lecture rooms for visitors and observers (NIHON KOGYO  SHIMBUN 26 Jan 94 and 19 Jan 94).      (The hard copy version of this FMN contains the final proposed  site plan for the Kazusa DNA Research Institute.)      The Research Institute, equipped with supercomputers and 18 of  the latest DNA sequencers, will focus on 1) analytical research on  DNA structure, 2) research on analytical technologies for DNA  structure, 3) research on mechanisms of DNA, 4) production and  provision of DNA data, and 5) education of personnel for DNA  research.  Along with these research activities, a primary mission  of the institute will be to provide research data to the private  sector in order to promote biotechnology industry (NIHON KOGYO  SHIMBUN 26 Jan 94).      So far, the institute has made agreements with seven Japanese  companies to construct high-tech R&amp;D centers and R&amp;D-focused plants   in the Park.  These companies include Fujitsu, Canon, Nissan  Chemical Industries, Denki Kagaku Kogyo, Nippon Zeon Co., Maruzen  Petrochemical Co., and Tokyo Tanabe Co. (NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 26 Jan  94)  Tokyo Tanabe Co. will obtain approximately 34,000 square meters  on the site.  Total area of its research center will be  approximately 20,000 square meters.  The company plans to allocate  about 200 researchers and invest approximately 12 billion yen ($109  million) into the project excluding the cost for the land (NIKKEI  SANGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93).

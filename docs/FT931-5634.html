			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Polish trade view worsens POLAND'S trade performance was far worse last year than originally thought, according to preliminary figures released by the Foreign Trade Ministry, Christopher Bobinski writes from Warsaw. The new customs data reveal that Poland ran up a Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.76bn) deficit last year, while payments figures collated by the NBP, the central bank, had earlier reported a Dollars 512m trade payments surplus. The new figures also show a Dollars 1.4bn deficit in Poland's trade with the European Community, strengthening Warsaw's argument for greater EC access. Mr Andrzej Byrt, a deputy foreign trade minister, said Poland last year exported goods worth Dollars 12.9bn and purchased Dollars 15.5bn worth abroad.</p>

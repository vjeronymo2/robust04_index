			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Letter: Ford's fully-integrated operations across the EC Sir, I read with interest your leading article, 'Developing cars across borders' (February 27). Many of your readers may remember that Ford of Britain and Ford of Germany used to develop competing models, which they sold to whichever Ford company could sell them. It was to make more productive use of the company's considerable assets across Europe that Henry Ford II formed Ford of Europe in 1967. Most of the duplication has been steadily removed over the years, so that today, on the eve of Europe's single market, Ford probably has one of the most fully-integrated, European Community-wide operations of any industry. Cross-border teamwork is the approach that we use. And it is in this vein that we have been studying whether we could effectively increase this teamwork by bringing members of particular teams together in the same locations. For example, engineers from Britain and Germany recently moved temporarily to our Genk plant in Belgium to oversee the development and start-up of a big project we have there. When it comes to developing cars, our own in-house video-conferencing and our global computer networks mean that Ford in Europe can share skills and solutions between teams located in different countries. This approach is indeed - as you point out - different from the one used by many of our competitors. Most - especially the Japanese - do all their basic design and engineering in their country of origin, but are increasingly turning to overseas groups to help adapt the central design for local market conditions. Ours is a different philosophy. Ford believes that the excellent engineering resources that it has in different countries, and on different continents, can be a source of strength. It is perhaps significant that Ford's European design team, located in Britain and Germany, is leading the 'world car' project that within the next few years will lead to the replacement of the North American Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz, as well as the European Sierra.

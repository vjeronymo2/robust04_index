			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Italian Municipal Elections: Fear defines poll in Italy's steel city - Jobs are Taranto's only election issue The smoke from the blast furnaces of Europe's largest steel complex always colours a part of the sky over Taranto. But the city's 250,000 inhabitants care little about the pollution. For them, the sound of the blast furnaces echoing across the harbour and the pall of foul air above their homes is a guarantee of jobs and wage packets. Begun in 1960, the state-owned steelworks converted Taranto, in the heel of Italy, into one of the rare zones of prosperity and job security in an otherwise depressed mezzogiorno. It offset the declining fortunes of the naval dockyards, falling profits from fishing, and cuts in the defence budget, which lessened the importance of Taranto as the base for the Italian home fleet. Now Taranto has become one of the casualties of Europe's over-production of steel. Ilva, the state steel company, is being forced to rationalise and privatise by the EU Commission in Brussels, putting a quarter of the jobs at risk - perhaps even more if the Italian government fails in its efforts to implement its latest privatisation plan. 'The effect is always worse when a town is based round a mono-culture,' observes, Mr Francisco De Ponzio, head of the local branch of the engineering workers union. He has seen jobs at the steel complex fall from a high of 22,000 to 13,000. 'The restructuring of Ilva means 4,500 jobs will go over the next three years in a city which already has 25 per cent unemployment.' The issue is dominating the forthcoming municipal elections of November 21, forcing all the political parties to make brave talk of job protection and special deals on new industries. The elections will take place in some 450 municipalities throughout Italy, involving a quarter of the electorate. At stake in Taranto is whether any party can prevent the city sinking into urban decay and the organised crime which characterises so much of southern Italy. 'Of all the municipal elections on November 21, Taranto is the only instance of all the force of the left uniting behind a single mayoral candidate,' observes Mr Luciano Mineo, who is organising the campaign for the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) in Taranto. The coalition, dominated by the PDS, consists of the Greens, Radicals, the Democratic Alliance movement, elements of the Socialist party and Reconstructed Communism - the latter being hardline marxists that refused to join the PDS when the Communist party broke up in 1991. The joint left mayoral candidate is Mr Gaetano Minervini, a former magistrate without previous political affiliations, although he is believed to be close to the PDS. Against him is Mr Alfengo Carlucci, a Christian Democrat former mayor backed by Liberals, Social Democrats, Social Democrats, some Socialists and Republicans. This represents the coalition that ruled Taranto during the 1980s, but which has been riven by divisions and corruption scandals, forcing the administration to be disbanded 18 months ago. The wild card is an unorthodox figure, Mr Giancarlo Cito, who owns a small local television station. Promising a people's government, he enjoys a degree of popularity, but has yet to overcome a whispering campaign against the mysterious source of funds for his television station. Meanwhile, traders in Taranto are sceptical that any city hall administration can affect the economy since so many decisions are outside local hands. 'Look, the decision to privatise Ilva and cut production at Taranto wasn't even taken by an Italian government, but by Brussels,' said one bookshop owner. Mr Mineo, however, sees the chance to create a flagship administration in the south. 'The nature of the governing town council is important in at least two ways. First, it determines how Taranto's case is represented both in Bari (the regional capital) and in Rome. Second, it determines the extent to which the municipality is run efficiently, transparently and honestly.' Like almost every Italian city, Taranto's finances are in a mess. The previous administration ran up off balance sheet expenditure to the tune of L80bn. The municipally owned transport is deficit-ridden, and incapable of providing a competitive service. And the crumbling city looks as though it has yet to come to terms with the Allied bombardment during the second world war. Whoever rules in city hall will preside over a Taranto traumatised by the fear of a descent into joblessness. Two months ago 170 workers for sub-contractors at the steel-works chained themselves to the production lines in protest over job losses, and nearly brought the entire complex to a standstill for five days. At Taranto's demonstration to mark the October 28 nationwide general strike a record 20,000 took part. 'There was only one cry  -jobs, jobs, jobs,' said Mr De Ponzio.</p>

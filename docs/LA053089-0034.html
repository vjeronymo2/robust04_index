			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> An abandoned copper mine is polluting nearby water supplies with copper sulfide  and other toxic compounds that are threatening vacationers and aquatic life in  the Spenceville Wildlife and Recreation Area about 50 miles north of  Sacramento, Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board officials said.  The Spenceville Mine was first mined in the late 1860s and remained in  production until 1918. Steve Bond, a control board geologist, said vacationers  often camp in areas polluted by hazardous tailings from the mine.  </P></p>

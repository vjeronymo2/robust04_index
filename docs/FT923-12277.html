			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Battle with Aids 'at impasse' THE worldwide Aids epidemic is racing ahead while the international response has stalled, 11,000 delegates to the seventh world conference on the disease heard last night. Dr Jonathan Mann, conference chairman, told the opening session of the week-long meeting in Amsterdam: 'The global effort against Aids has reached a dangerous impasse. 'A realistic analysis reveals that the gap between the expanding epidemic and lagging national and international response is growing rapidly, leaving the world more vulnerable to the spread of Aids.' The Harvard Aids Institute in the US, which Dr Mann directs, has just completed an independent analysis of the epidemic. It predicts that the number of people infected with HIV, the virus that causes Aids, will rise from about 13m now to 20m by 1995 and somewhere between 50m and 120m - including more than 10m children - in the year 2000. The latest official prediction from the World Health Organisation is only slightly less alarming. It predicts that 30m to 40m men, women and children will have been infected by the turn of the century. About 60 per cent of the adults are expected to develop full-scale Aids within 12 years of infection. As Dr Joost Ruitenberg, conference co-chairman, noted: 'The developing world is increasingly bearing the burden of the HIV/Aids pandemic, accounting for approximately 80 per cent of the world's HIV infections.' The virus is racing through Asia. Dr Max Essex, of the Harvard School of Public Health, who is chairing the conference's scientific programme, said the fastest heterosexual spread seemed to be in northern Thailand - perhaps because a new and virulent HIV strain had evolved there. No one is expecting any dramatic scientific or medical breakthroughs to be announced in Amsterdam this week, although with more than 960 speakers scheduled for conference sessions there is bound to be some progress. One area where hopes are relatively high is vaccine development; 15 HIV vaccines are currently undergoing early clinical trials in human volunteers. The meeting will hear of long-term research into 'gene therapy' - using a genetic approach to attack HIV.  - Greater emphasis is also to be placed on social approaches to the disease.

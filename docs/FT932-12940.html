			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Tarmac Building material and construction companies have announced some thumping provisions in recent weeks but Tarmac could lay claim to the clear-out cup when it reports its results this week. The UK's biggest housebuilder provisions may exceed Pounds 300m, knocking a quarter off the value of shareholders' funds. Yet despite the profusion of red ink, both Tarmac and its sector have been star stock market performers since sterling's devaluation. Tarmac's shares have risen from a low of 53p in September to 140p now; the building materials sector is up by two-thirds. Investor demand has been fuelled by falling interest rates, the continuing strength of housebuilding starts and evidence that recent price rises from the likes of Pilkington, Blue Circle and RMC appear to be sticking. Many such companies have high financial and operational gearing ensuring that even small sales and price increases have a startling impact on profits. Savage cost-cutting has also left the sector primed for recovery. Much of this, though, is already in the price. The prospective rating on both the building materials and construction sectors now stands at a considerable premium to the market. Many companies will doubtless exploit such buoyancy and seek extra funds. Nevertheless, few investors will want to sell such stocks at this point in the cycle. Guessing the intentions of the predatory and cash-rich MB-Caradon will only add spice to the market.</p>

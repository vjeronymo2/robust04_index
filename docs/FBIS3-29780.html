[KEPC] plans to  begin demonstration tests of a superconducting magnetic energy  storage (SMES) system, which employs superconductivity  technology to overcome the difficult process of storing  electricity and transmits power when necessary. Under a  five-year plan starting in fiscal year 1994, the company intends  to spend about 880 million yen to install the nation's largest  demonstration system at a transmission station in the suburbs of  Fukuoka to collect various data which could not be gathered at  the existing small-scale facilities. Power companies have been  asked to seek ways to level out fluctuations in power loads  caused by a gap between normal power demand and peak demand  experienced during summer afternoons. This problem would be  greatly alleviated should storage of electricity become  possible. At KEPC's research institute, researchers feel "the  upcoming experiments will be a big step toward making the system  practical."    Major electrical machinery manufacturers and four  universities, including Kyushu University, plan to participate  in the demonstration test. Work on designing the model system  is to begin next fiscal year, and test operations will begin  after the system is installed between 1997 and 1998, following  partial tests and other initial procedures.    The model system will store electrical energy up to 1  kilowatt-hour, with an output of 1,000 kilowatts. This compares  with conventional systems' storage capacity of 200 to 300  watt-hours and output of 50 kilowatts. In the United States,  the U.S. Defense Department embarked on a project in late 1980's  to develop a device to store 20,000 kilowatts per hour as part  of its Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) plan, but apparently  "not much progress has been made in the development project,"  (as stated by an official at the KEPC).</p>

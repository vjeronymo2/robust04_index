			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (5): Relatively unscathed by recession - The Banking Sector THE Danish banking and financial sectors have come through a five-year recession relatively unscathed - relative, that is, to developments in the other Nordic countries, where the governments have had to move in to support the banks. Indeed, Danish bankers are unhappy when they hear the words 'Nordic banking' these days because it lumps Denmark together with countries where the financial and banking crisis has had far more serious consequences. The Danes have suffered one big disaster, the collapse of the Hafnia insurance group's holding company. Hafnia Holding suspended payments to creditors in August, when the falling value of strategic shareholdings in its domestic rival, Baltica, and Swedish insurer Skandia wiped out its equity capital. Hafnia's insurance companies are now up for sale. The big bond-issuing mortgage credit institutes, which dominate mortgage financing in Denmark, are under pressure. Their structure is such that they do not run a risk of collapse, with loss to creditors, but they can reach a situation in which they can no longer make new loans. Kreditforening Danmark, one of the two big institutes (the other is Nykredit), has come so close to this point that its chief executive, Mr Ole Andresen, has called on the government to consider easing the capital-adequacy ratio requirements as they apply to the mortgage credit business. The banks are not having an easy time either. Taken together with savings banks, they suffered a net loss of DKr2.9bn in 1990, and DKr400m in 1991. Loss provisions soared from DKr6.57bn in 1989 to DKr10.40bn in 1990; and to DKr11.86 in 1991, when they were an unhealthy 4.5 per cent of loans and guarantees in the commercial banks and 4.8 per cent in the savings banks. Loss provisions will be large again this year, perhaps just as large as in 1991. Nevertheless, the leading banks have not so far had serious problems in maintaining their capital adequacy ratios, and are able to raise subordinated loan capital without difficulty. The basic reason why the banks have been able to absorb considerable losses, said Mr Knud Sorensen, chairman of the Danish Banker's Association and chief executive of Den Danske Bank, the country's largest bank, is that they were very strongly capitalised when the recession took hold. When the new Bank of International Settlements (BIS) rules for capital adequacy were applied to the Danish banks, their average capital ratio was found to be almost 14 per cent. The banks were not faced with the problem of having to strengthen their capital ratios in the middle of a recession. The government and the National Bank (central bank) fixed the minimum capital ratio at 10 per cent for 1990 and 1991, coming down to 9 per cent from January 1, 1993, and to 8 per cent in 1995. But the reduction in the ratio of equity capital to risk-weighted assets will be counter-balanced by a reduction in the share of subordinated loan capital which can be counted in the capital base. The banks find that the rules are becoming a problem. 'We are interested in maintaining high capital ratios, but at the same time we do not want to suffer competitively through having to maintain higher ratios than others,' said Mr Sorensen. Mr Thorleif Krarup, who in August was appointed chief executive of Unidanmark - the parent company for Unibank, the second largest bank - was more forthright. The rule that Danish banks, from next January, can only count 20 per cent of subordinated loan capital in the capital adequacy base is tougher than required by the BIS rules (in the UK, for example, banks will be able to count 50 per cent of subordinated loan capital in the capital-adequacy base). 'I would like to see a discussion about this,' said Mr Krarup. 'It is very natural that the government and the National Bank should want to maintain absolute confidence in the system, but we need to ask whether the BIS rules are not enough in themselves. 'We have to be careful that credit policy does not become so restrictive that all new developments are brought to a halt,' he said. Mr Krarup emphasised that Unidanmark did not have a solvency problem. 'There is no doubt that we can meet our capital adequacy requirements. We have an earnings problem, but not a solvency problem.' Unibank reported a DKr1.5bn first half loss this year, following losses of DKr1.1bn in 1990 and DKr1.7bn in 1991. A slightly higher loss than last year is forecast for 1992, depending partly on how prices move in the bond and share markets. While Denmark's largest banks, which in addition to Danske and Unibank include Bikuben and Jyske Bank, remain strongly capitalised, a run of difficult years is putting pressure on some of the medium-sized regional banks. Analysts will not be surprised if some of these banks run into capital-adequacy problems. In the past, it has been the rule that when smaller banks run into trouble, larger banks absorb them, often paying a considerable goodwill payment to the troubled bank's shareholders for the privilege. 'If a middle-sized bank went down now,' said Mr Sorensen, 'it would not be so easy for the bigger banks to go in and save it. They are too preoccupied with their own problems.' A situation would arise in which the finance industry supervisors and the National Bank had to mount a rescue action. Depositors' funds, however, are guaranteed by the authorities. The banks generally have worked hard to reduce their costs, chiefly by reducing staff; but what they need now is lower interest rates and a more lively economy. 'We are living in a vacuum. Nothing is happening. People can hardly even be bothered to paint their kitchens,' said Mr Sorensen. During the high-inflation years, the assets used as collateral for loans to businesses and households rose steadily in value, and so did nominal incomes, while the value of debt was steadily reduced. In a low-inflation society, the value of assets used as collateral will not rise and neither will nominal incomes - which means that if a household or a business is faced with a financial shock, it will be much more vulnerable. For the banks, said Mr Krarup, this might mean that loss provisions would rise by a factor of three compared with former times, so that instead of averaging 0.5-0.75 per cent of loans and guarantees, as they did until the late 1980s, the average would be closer to 2 per cent. This would require adjustments to interest-rate margins (between rates on deposits and advances), which are still based on the expectation that loss provisions will come down to the old levels, and more sensible pricing, reflecting the new conditions, he added. Meanwhile, there is a political problem troubling the banks. The government is considering how to lower the income tax rate, which would automatically reduce the tax value of mortgage relief. This would cause a new fall in property prices, leading to a decline in the collateral for loans, said Mr Peter Erling Nielsen, specialist in monetary policy at Copenhagen University. 'The system would not be able to stand this,' he said. 'We must not rock the boat just now. I am not sure that the politicians have understood this.'</p>

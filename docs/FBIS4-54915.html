			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Democratic Federation Chairman Imre </F> Pozsgay by Pal Sombathy; place and date not given: "We Are Now  More Courageous in Our Political Activity"]    [Text] In our series of interviews, head of parties  that succeeded in presenting election lists are talking about  their parties' programs and ideas. This time we interviewed  National Democratic Federation [NDSZ] Chairman Imre Pozsgay, who  said that Hungary needs a broad coalition.    [Szombathy] When establishing your party, you called it a  center party open to the left and closed to the right. What  program differences lie behind this unusual definition?    [Pozsgay] Our party is characterized by greater freedom and  greater political courage. We can offer society program points  that others also know about but, because of the limitations of  their roles and the historical precedence, they do not have the  possibility of speaking about. Why, otherwise, would the  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] speak about a national  coordination congress, a party that was forced to give up the  program of constitutional national assembly? Why would a number  of parties speak about debt reductions and debt diplomacy, while  they were accepting the payment burdens as fate? The NDSZ did  not get involved in any of these restrictions and, thus, it can  be more open to various methods of treatment. We focus on  values and methods, and we only accept ideological  considerations when absolutely necessary. The essence of our  new economic policy is that the time has come to place our  national economy on a growth path and find sources necessary for  economic progress. We need a new constitution that would create  a consensus and unity, also in carrying out the budget and state  administration reform.    [Szombathy] There are several parties that are talking about  economic growth, but it seems that the issue of debt reduction  is a taboo. What solutions does the NDSZ offer?    [Pozsgay] The Polish example clearly shows that it is not  the changes in course that determines the opportunities of debt  diplomacy. Under the ruins of the Soviet empire, we are the  last who are still paying. We know the counterarguments, but  this is only an excuse and a defense mostly on the part of those  who have been handling this debt for the last 20 years, and  their chances are connected to preserving this ideology. I  consider the debt issue to be a badly treated economic policy  affair. We should get rid of superstitions. At the same time,  other parties promising economic growth mention new credits as  the source of financing this growth. This is where we differ  from them. We do not exclude the possibility of new foreign  credits to the Hungarian economic development, but these credits  must not appear as state debts. The country should determine  the role of foreign debt, and not the other way round.    [Szombathy] How does the NDSZ's national character differ  from that of the coalition and from that of other similar  parties?    [Pozsgay] We do not live in the constant fear of moral  danger to the nation. In our view, the community form of the  accepting nation is well compatible with the conditions of  modernization. Regarding the European integration institutions,  the national awareness of Western European small countries like  Denmark are exemplary for me. The Danes first rejected the  Maastricht agreement, and then voted in favor, because their  conditions of participation had been met.    [Szombathy] The MDF speaks of a leftist danger and Istvan  Csurka called on the national forces to cooperate. What is your  opinion of these efforts? Is the gathering of the national  forces into a bloc necessary and is there any chance of  restoration?    [Pozsgay] The danger of a leftist restoration does not  exist. We are witnessing an information disturbance here,  something understandable in a country in which the people lived  through a change in the regime that took place without the  people, and even against the people. However, I, myself, see a  danger of revenge. I follow the appearance of people on the  side of the left who should have been called to account for  their deeds long ago with concern. However, this phenomenon is,  to a certain extent, normal in the struggle of political forces.  One should not sound the alarm because of this phenomenon,  because this only increases its danger. The conditions for a  national bloc are not met, because it is impossible to form a  government only based on alarm. The coordination of programs  failed to materialize; on the one hand, it is too early, on the  other hand the alarm is late, an alarm that weakens precisely  the center forces because of the distancing. Every phase of  these elections must be carried out, and the lessons should be  drawn after the elections.    [Szombathy] What role is your party facing after the  elections?    [Pozsgay] The NDSZ will make it into Parliament, and I hope  we will set up a faction. The 100,000 nomination slips gathered  under an eventful campaign show that there will be voters for  the NDSZ. Many figures coming from the real sphere accepted an  NDSZ candidacy. The new parliament will be a split one, with  many parties present in the National Assembly. The small  parties will also participate in the coalition talks. The NDSZ  does not wish to form a coalition with extremist forces.  According to the experience so far, the new coalition should  not be based on program coordination, because this would bring  inadmissible compromises and subsequent blackmail conditions  into the government. It is a much better method to agree on two  or three basic tasks, like working out a new economic policy for  the benefit of economic growth, social policy consolidation, and  a new constitution. It is not worth accepting more than that  for one legislative cycle.</p>

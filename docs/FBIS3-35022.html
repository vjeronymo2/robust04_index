The Jordanian side was  led by Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime minister and minister of  higher education, while the Palestinian side was led by Faruq  Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department. Following the  end of the talks, the two sides issued a press statement  reviewing the subjects the committee discussed. Details are in  the following report from our correspondent Khalil al-Qaryuti:    [Begin recording] [Al-Qaryuti] The two sides expressed their  satisfaction with the atmosphere of understanding that prevailed  in the meetings -- an atmosphere that will enhance coordination  between the two sides, as well as efforts to improve it in  various areas, because such coordination represents a realistic  response to the special historic and fated relationship of the  two peoples. Following the meetings, a press statement was read  by Yasir 'Abd- Rabbuh, member of the PLO Executive Committee and  head of the PLO's Information Department.    ['Abd-Rabbuh] The committee reviewed the points listed on  its  agenda. These covered issues of bilateral and Arab concern in  order to promote overall cooperation and coordination between  the Jordanian and Palestinian sides to the required level in all  areas. The committee reviewed recent overall developments  pertaining to the peace process, including the agreement signed  by the PLO and Israel in Cairo on 9 February, which is a basic  step toward implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement that  represents the first part of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration  of Principles.    The committee discussed future prospects and the concept of  joint action in light of expected developments in order to  formulate a unified Arab vision and to take the initiative in  the service of the Arab nation's goals and its aspirations for a  comprehensive, just, and lasting peace, based on the resolutions  of international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace.  This should guarantee Israel's total withdrawal from all  occupied Arab territories and secure the Palestinian people's  legitimate national rights on their national soil.    The committee attached special importance to the status of  Jerusalem. It stressed the need to carry out programs to  reinforce the Arabic and Islamic character of the city, to  confront Israel's attempts to Judaize and devour it, and to  protect its sanctities. The committee studied the  recommendations of its working teams on economic, security, and  administrative issues. It stressed the need to draw up specific  mechanisms to enable cooperation and coordination in the peace  process by making preparations, exchanging information, and  continuing consultations on all tracks of the bilateral and  multilateral negotiations, within the framework of the  directives of the Jordanian and Palestinian political leaders in  order to serve the interests of the Jordanian and Palestinian  peoples and their distinguished relationship.    The committee adopted an agenda for the meetings of its  subcommittees, including the Jerusalem committee, the economic  committee, the security and borders committee, the committee on  refugees and displaced people, and the legal committee, and also  for the meetings of some specialized technical committees, which  were stipulated in the economic agreement signed by the  Jordanian Government and the PLO Executive Committee on 7  January 1994. The two sides decided to form an administrative  affairs committee. They stressed the need to coordinate Arab  positions, particularly those between the cordon states,  regarding bilateral negotiations.    [Al-Qaryuti] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for  cabinet affairs and information minister, then responded to  questions from a number of journalists:    [Al-'Anani] We have agreed to coordinate our positions. We  stressed the need for each side to respect what is taking place  on any other fraternal Arab track of negotiations because we, in  the final analysis, are seeking a comprehensive peace solution.  What takes place on one negotiating track will certainly affect  the other negotiating tracks.    [Al-Qaryuti] Responding to a question on the economic  agreement, the Jordanian-Palestinian economic committee, and the  issue of reopening Jordanian banks in Gaza Strip and Jericho,  Dr. al-'Anani said:    [Al-'Anani] You know that the economic agreement stipulates  the formation of a technical economic committee and a joint  banking committee, which we also call a joint monetary banking  committee. The Jordanian side named the committee members. We  expect the brothers to name their members, too. We expect the  committee to begin its meetings next week. We, in Jordan, are  ready for the process. I believe the Palestinian side is also  ready to reopen the Jordanian banks' branches in the West Bank  and Gaza Strip. [end recording]</p>

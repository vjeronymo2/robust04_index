			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Italians to build Moscow plant TECNIMONT, the plant-building subsidiary of Italy's Ferruzzi-Montedison group, has won a Dollars 200m (Pounds 112.9m) turnkey contract to build a polypropylene plant in Moscow. The deal comprises a plant able to produce 100,000 tonnes of polypropylene a year, with auxiliary equipment. The unit will be fed from an existing refinery and will make value-added plastics such as film for packaging, household items and the motor industry, most of it for use in Russia. Financing will come through exports of unspecified refinery products not used on the domestic market. The project should be completed by March 1995. Breda, the Italian railway equipment company which is part of the state-owned Efim group, now in liquidation, has won a Dollars 161.5m contract to rebuild 298 carriages used for the past 20 years on the Washington DC subway system. The work is expected to take four years. The contract for the carriages, originally built by the US Rohr group, will be done at Breda's US subsidiary in New Jersey. Benetton, the Italian clothing group, has given further details of its joint venture in India with Delhi Clothes Mills (DCM). They have set up a jointly-owned company to make Benetton-badged goods for the Indian market. Sales will be through a chain of 200 shops expected to be opened within the next three years.</p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWTH PLANS FOR LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> Your editorial incorrectly and unfairly leaves one with the impression that  Mayor Bradley's concern with, and attention to, issues of responsible growth  management is both newly developed and sporadic. Contrary to the image  presented in your editorial, Mayor Bradley has been a strong and consistent  supporter of thorough land use planning at both the project level and on  citywide issues.  </P> <P> Programs like the community plan revisions and the updating of the citywide  elements of the General Plan now under way are restructuring and strengthening  the planning framework of the city, bringing them up to current standards. When  combined with other programs such as the growth management element now being  developed, Los Angeles will have the final element of the "fair, but flexible"  plan, for which your editorial calls and towards which the city has been  steadily working.  </P> <P> In reference to the mayor's positions on specific projects your editorial is  self-contradicting. On the one hand you chide the mayor for not speaking out on  the Farmers Market or Central City West before either has been thoroughly  reviewed or gone through necessary hearings, while on the other hand primly  reminding everyone that the Ambassador site deserves to be judged solely on the  merits. Neither the Farmers Market nor the Central City West specific plans  have been brought forward for a full hearing, nor have all the facts been put  on the table. I suggest that for the mayor to take a position without benefit  of all the facts would be not only unwise but uncharacteristic.  </P> <P> WILLIAM G. LUDDY  </P> <P> President, City Planning Commission  </P></p>

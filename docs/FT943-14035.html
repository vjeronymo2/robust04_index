			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Harrods Bank independently managed, but owned by the store Sir, Harrods Bank is and always has been owned by the department store, Harrods Limited, contrary to your report of July 12 ('Harrods' new bank manager'). Since 1991 the bank has been independently managed through a trustee, Law Debenture Trust Corporation, but has continued to offer a full banking service to our customers. The change followed the publication in 1990 of the Department of Trade and Industry report into the takeover of the House of Fraser, the validity of which we have never accepted and which we are challenging before the European Court of Human rights. Michael Cole, director of public affairs, Harrods, 87-135 Brompton Road, London SW1X 7XL</p>

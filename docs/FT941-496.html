			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Peers back Sunday trading changes The House of Lords last night agreed with the Commons that there should only be partial de-regulation of Sunday trading for shops in England and Wales. In a series of free votes peers rejected total de-regulation by a majority of 257 (303-46), and an attempt to impose the restrictions advocated by the Keep Sunday Special campaign by 55 votes (206-151). In a final vote peers agreed without a division to keep the provision in the Sunday trading bill already approved by the Commons which permits small shops to set their own opening hours, but restricts supermarkets and other large stores to six hours of trading. While stressing that the party whips would not be in operation, Earl Ferrers, home office minister, warned peers that there would be little advantage in passing amendments which required the Commons to 'think again'. Dr George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, led a full bench of bishops into the lobby in favour of the Keep Sunday Special option against total deregulation.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUGS EXPAND THE PROGRAMS;  </P> <P> THEY'RE OUT THERE CRYING FOR HELP;  </P> <P> THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE STUDY SHOWS THAT TREATMENT DOES WORK. WE NEED BETTER  TRAINING AND WIDER AVAILABILITY.  </P> <P> How effective is drug-abuse treatment? Every program has its successes -- and  its failures. Better training and higher standards for drug counselors are  desperately needed.  </P> <P> But the success rate of America's drug-treatment centers is impressive, even  with all their problems. The largest and most comprehensive academic survey of  private and public in- and outpatient centers ever done, the so-called TOPS  study, showed that 80% of the treated addicts were still off hard drugs five  years after completing such a program. The results, published late last year,  also showed that the percentage of addicts holding jobs doubled and the  percentage committing crimes dropped two-thirds.  </P> <P> Yes, some addicts do relapse. And some professionals conducting treatment are  incompetent. But these anomalies provide no grounds for limiting the  availability of treatment.  </P> <P> Today, there is an acute shortage of drug-abuse facilities. Many addicts  seeking help are told they must wait weeks, even months. There is only enough  space to treat one-quarter of addicted pregnant women and juveniles.  Compassion, common sense and self-interest dictates that we provide help for  these people.  </P> <P> The fact is that the returns on investing in drug treatment are considerable. A  three-month outpatient program costs taxpayers about $600 per addict. But  during that time, we save about $1,600 in reduced welfare and Medicaid costs  and about $1,300 in law-enforcement expenses. An addict in treatment is more  likely to hold down a job, require less medical attention and commit fewer  crimes. All in all, $1 invested in drug treatment pays society back $5. Few  other social programs can match that outcome.  </P> <P> But do we have a choice? Do we continue to stand by and watch a new generation  of crack babies come into the world? Do we continue to let hard-core addicts  run amok in the streets, robbing, mugging or worse to support their habits?  </P> <P> Or perhaps we should put all addicts behind bars? Even if we believed that  prison was preferable to treatment, the price tag for such a policy would be  staggering. The cost of putting an addict in jail is 10 times that of placing  him in a treatment center. A national program to provide drug treatment for  every hard-core addict who needs help would cost us $8 billion. Building jails  to house them would cost more than $100 billion.  </P> <P> By sundown today, 56,000 hard-core addicts will have sought treatment and been  turned away for lack of staff or space. Tonight, many of them, along with  hundreds of thousands of other addicts, will be on the streets looking for the  money it takes to support their habits.  </P> <P> For our sake, if not for theirs, we must expand our drug treatment system --  now.  </P></p>

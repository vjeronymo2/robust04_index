			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Arts: A hit, from Wales - Proms IN SEPTEMBER the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra changes its name to the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. The ingredients of the title may be the same, but the subtle shift in emphasis underlines the orchestra's enhanced status and the fact that the BBC is not its only source of finance. At the moment the future for several of the BBC orchestras looks uncertain. (Pessimists say that the bottom line is to save the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the flagship, which could be dire news for the rest of the fleet.) But the BBC Welsh SO has manoeuvred itself into a strong position: active local support, funding from the Welsh Arts Council and SC4, a territory over which it reigns supreme, a hall of its own at St. David's in Cardiff. More important - it plays as if it has confidence in itself. The orchestra's visit to the Proms at London's Albert Hall for two concerts this week could hardly have been a better advertisement for the high standards to which it now aspires. Although it has only been at full permanent strength of 90 musicians since 1987, there is an unanimity about the way they play that suggests a well-knit ensemble, keenly rehearsed by their Principal Conductor, Tadaaki Otaka. The performances were not self-regardingly glamorous, or virtuoso displays. What they had was discipline. This amounted to more than just being tidy, as Strauss's Don Juan, a characterful opening to Tuesday's concert, announced from the outset. Grieg's Piano Concerto, with Martin Roscoe the very able soloist, was much the same - not grand, not bombastic, but every note came across as though the work had been thought about afresh. Otaka's views on the music of William Walton were clearly going to be both fresh and worthwhile. (Has there ever been a Japanese conductor of the First Symphony before?) Any amount of detail was fastidiously put in place. Ravel, rather than Stravinsky, seemed to be an inspiration for the music, so exquisite was the blending of timbres in the slow movement; but the finale did ultimately rise to an resounding conclusion. The second concert comprised just one work: Mahler's Sixth Symphony. If there is one criticism of Otaka, it is that he expresses himself in neat clauses and sentences rather than paragraphs, which robbed both the Walton and the Mahler of some of their long-term intensity. But for precision of playing, clarity of focus, the Mahler was another performance which hit the bull's eye. It is difficult to recognise in these two programmes the orchestra as it used to perform 10 or 15 years ago. The BBC Welsh SO has started undertaking international tours (Germany and the US planned for 1994) and is well on the way to becoming an impressive cultural ambassador.</p>

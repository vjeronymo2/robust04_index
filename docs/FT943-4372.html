			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Italian subsidies anger unions Two trade unions in the North Sea oil industry are complaining to the European Commission over what they believe to be the unlawful use of Pounds 147m-worth of subsidies by the Italian government to aid oil-production facilities. They are also seeking an urgent meeting with the Department of Trade and Industry over the construction of the Spirit of Columbus floating production facilities at the Fincantieri yard in Genoa for Sana, the Italian subsidiary of Midland and Scottish Resources based in Aberdeen. Officials from the AEEU engineering and electrical union and the GMB general union released a letter from Mr Karel Van Miert, the EU commissioner, dated July 29. In it Mr Van Miert suggested that the Italian authorities had provided only Pounds 22m of the Pounds 173m production costs for the building of the Spirit of Columbus. But the unions pointed out yesterday - on the evidence of the company's annual return for 1993 - that as much as Pounds 147m had been 'funded by subsidies received or receivable from the Italian government' - about 60 per cent of its production costs, not the 12.7 per cent claimed by Mr Van Miert. The unions said Britain might have expected to secure 80 per cent of the work for building facilities for the North Sea oil industry. But they warned that the growth in floating facilities production and falling requirements for more fixed platforms could lead to a loss of business to yards abroad. They said: 'We need to have a thorough investigation into what was agreed through the EU as state aid on the Spirit of Columbus. If the Pounds 147m is not legal then immediate action should be taken. If this kind of subsidy is legal then the UK government will have to ensure our industry is not disadvantaged and similar state aid is made available here.'</p>

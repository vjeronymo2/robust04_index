			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NO. 5 DRUG LORD SLAIN IN COLOMBIA;  </P> <P> POLICE KILL MASTERMIND OF COCAINE CARTEL'S WAR AGAINST GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> Police have shot and killed the mastermind of the Medellin cocaine cartel's  10-month-old war against the government that has left hundreds of people dead,  authorities said today.  </P> <P> The killing occurred Wednesday night in an exclusive Medellin suburb, and this  morning a car bomb went off near a police post in the same suburb, killing at  least two people and injuring 20, the RCN radio network reported. No one  immediately claimed responsibility for the blast.  </P> <P> John Jairo Arias Tascon, considered the cartel's No. 5 leader, was killed in  the El Poblado neighborhood when police, acting on a tip, found and tried to  arrest him, said Gen. Octavio Vargas, operational police director.  </P> <P> The killing was the biggest victory for the government's war on drugs since the  slaying of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the cartel's No. 2 boss in December.  </P> <P> Vargas did not say if any police were hurt in the shoot-out but he said four  more law officers were killed in Medellin on Wednesday night. Their deaths  bring to 110 the number of Medellin policemen assassinated so far this year.  </P> <P> Arias, 28, led a terrorist organization that killed scores of Colombians,  including an attorney general, a state governor, a judge and a leading  journalist, Vargas said.  </P> <P> "He served as chief of the armed organization of the Medellin cartel," Vargas  said, and was considered the cartel's fifth most important leader.  </P> <P> He said Arias was also responsible for two car bomb attacks on Colombia's  secret police chief, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez.  </P> <P> The blasts killed at least 70 people, but Maza escaped unharmed.  </P> <P> Authorities blame drug traffickers for killing more than 400 Colombians since  August, when the government began a sweeping anti-drug crackdown.  </P> <P> Vargas said police relied on cooperation from Medellin's residents to locate  Arias. He said the person who provided the crucial information will receive a  $200,000 reward.  </P> <P> The terror campaign came in response to a crackdown on the cartels that  President Virgilio Barco Vargas began in August after a leading presidential  candidate was assassinated and the traffickers were blamed for the killing.  </P> <P> Since then Barco's administration has extradited 15 drug suspects and  confiscated hundreds of properties belonging to the cocaine magnates.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the government announced that it will dispatch 570 more police  officers and soldiers to the trafficking center of Medellin.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOODY SUNDAY  </P> <P> Simon Brett, whose hard-drinking actor-sleuth Charles Paris is one of the joys  of the mystery form, has begun a new series starring Melita Pargeter, a  handsome widow whose late husband, a member of the criminal class, has left her  plenty of money and a host of seedy but invaluable friends.  </P> <P> In Mrs, Presumed Dead, Simon Brett (unequaled as an inventor of titles) has  Mrs. Pargeter leasing a house in a spiffy suburban tract for the  nouveau-mortgaged. The previous owner has left a false forwarding address and  Pargeter correctly senses foul deeds. Her researches -- and Brett's dissection  of the neighborhood and its upwardly striving residents -- make for very  enjoyable reading.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara's Sue Grafton has worked her way through Alibi, Burglar, Corpse,  Deadbeat and Evidence and, with 'F' Is for Fugitive, shows no sign of faltering  or flagging. Her Kinsey Millhone, one of the principal ladies in the private  investigator line, is this time holed up in a California coast town that could  be, let's say, Pismo Beach.  </P> <P> A man, then a teen-ager, convicted of strangling his pregnant girlfriend,  escaped from prison and now has been recaptured after 17 years of a blameless  life under another name. Millhone has to rake through the dead past to see if  he was, in fact, guilty as charged.  </P> <P> After all those years there are enough lively suspects to fill a jail and  enough evil to make "Peyton Place" seem like a retirement home for the serenely  virtuous. Millhone's own life is finally at high risk. She is a wonderful  character, tough but not brutish, resourceful and sensitive, a fit knight to  walk those mean streets with her male predecessors, and high time.  </P> <P> Robert B. Parker's Spenser books have seemed slighter right along, the paddings  of sex and food ever more evident. But his new one, Playmates, while the  pausings for play and nourishment are still overabundant, has an unusually  interesting and affecting main thrust.  </P> <P> A star college basketballer, who is black, has been shaving points and the  scandal could imperil the team's shot at an NCAA title. Parker is here having  his say about college athletics as the tail that wags the academic dog. He is  also showing his wrath at the corrupting of the athletes themselves. There are  corrosive portraits of a faculty choosing to ignore (and conceal) the fact that  the star is functionally illiterate.  </P> <P> The gamblers are of course murderously resentful of Spenser's interference,  although murder when it happens is almost a side issue. Spenser, as is his  admirable custom, is risking his own image in hope of reclaiming a single,  sullen life, redirecting an athlete whose physical skills, seemingly a way out  of poverty, have only made him a pawn in other people's nasty games.  "Playmates" is one of Parker's best in some time.  </P> <P> It's not surprising to learn that Bernard Schopen has completed a critical  study of Ross Macdonald's work. Schopen's own first mystery, The Big Silence,  is very strongly in the Macdonald tradition.  </P> <P> There is, to begin with, a knowing and affectionate celebration of a particular  turf. In Schopen's case it is the Nevada desert (he studied in Reno but now  lives in New Hampshire). More important, there are the roots of present murder  which go deep into an incredibly entangled past of hidden and concealed  identities and undisclosed crimes.  </P> <P> Schopen's hero is a lawyer-investigator named Jack Ross, who has about had it  with death and betrayal, and is teetering at the brink of total emotional  collapse. But when a young hooker asks him to find her grandfather, missing  these 40 years, and Ross' old friend, an Indian, asks him to help her, what can  he do? The writing occasionally strains too hard for poetic and rhetorical  effects, trying for but missing Macdonald's heightened feeling for but careful  control of language. The impersonations, the cross-breedings, the blood and  marital ties, are almost too confusing, even compared with the messes Lew  Archer ran into. But the action is vigorous and well-described, the Reno  environs (even including the Mustang Ranch) excellently evoked, and Schopen and  Ross are names to watch for henceforth.  </P> <P> The prolific Lawrence Sanders ("The Anderson Tapes" and "Timothy's Game" most  recently) has built Capital Crimes around a fascinating central figure. He is a  vodka-swilling, womanizing faith healer who calls himself Brother Kristos and  operates out of a decrepit tobacco barn in Virginia, with a pair of sluttish  women as his handmaidens.  </P> <P> The fascination is that he is not a fake; the cures appear to work,  inexplicably, and word of him gets to the White House, where the President --  Abner Hawkins by name -- has a hemophiliac son, whom Kristos helps.  </P> <P> Kristos quickly becomes a political issue, living in Washington, frequenting  the White House, advising on social policy, becoming the inadvertent catalyst  in a conspiracy. Sanders, infusing his thriller with an unusual amount of  ambiguity, has written a suspenseful story that doubles as an essay on the  corruptions of power, including power that may be unearthly.  </P> <P> In the way of most softcover originals, Gerald Laurence's One Bang-Up Job, is a  rocketingly fast, sleek-surfaced, larger-than-anything thriller. It confirms  that the lessons of eventful pacing that made the pulp magazines as good as  they were in their heyday have been noted and retained.  </P> <P> Laurence's caper is a master-planned robbery of everything in San Francisco  simultaneously, with a resulting haul of $30 million in cash, which seems  modest enough, every till in the city having been raked clear, although  naturally mastermind Daniel Langer had expenses.  </P> <P> The author enlivens his fable with alternating first-person narratives, the  pursuer reciting one chapter, the pursued the next. The chase leads to the  jungles of South America, and Things Happen. Do they ever. In the end, of  course, crime does not pay, but getting to this ancient wisdom is all the fun.  </P> <P> While My Pretty One Sleeps is the seventh and latest by Mary Higgins Clark (15  million copies in print, her publisher says). This one begins with the macabre  disposal of the body of a murdered gossip columnist who had a flair for  exposes.  </P> <P> The rest of the book charts the slow realization by the columnist's friends  (few) and acquaintances (many) that she is not simply unaccountably away, but  dead. The central worrier is a boutique owner whose father, conveniently, is a  former police commissioner. The suspects include a weak and sponging nephew, an  ex-husband and his shrewish wife and some garment trade executives about whom  she knew too much.  </P> <P> The denouement is exciting if not overly surprising, and the book, for which a  high competence is the accurate accolade, is hammock fare, if anyone still has  hammocks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MRS, PRESUMED DEAD  </P> <P> by Simon Brett  </P> <P> (Scribner's: $16.95; 248 pp.)  </P> <P> 'F' IS FOR FUGITIVE  </P> <P> by Sue Grafton  </P> <P> (Henry Holt: $15.95; 261 pp.)  </P> <P> PLAYMATES  </P> <P> by Robert B.

			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Arts: Drama from bestsellers - Andrew St George has mixed feelings about two current adaptations First Dickens and George Eliot, now John Steinbeck and Fyodor Dostoyevsky are rushing to the stage. All are strong writers with a definite view and a fixed viewpoint; this makes them easy to film but hard to stage. Now in London there are two examples of adaptation: The Grapes of Wrath at the Shaw Theatre and Crime &amp; Punishment at the Battersea Arts Centre. John Steinbeck (1902-68) was not above a little punishment. He once dangled a recalcitrant girlfriend by her ankles out of a top floor window. The writing, like the life, was direct and uncompromising. His best, The Grapes of Wrath (1939) scooped the Pulitzer Prize and the John Ford film treatment. Given that Steinbeck's American epic splashes the primary colours of American literature over a canvas 2,000 miles long, the 7:84 Theatre Company's production at the Shaw Theatre does well to render the story without losing its sprawling quality. This is the ultimate road book, following the Joad family west on Route 66 from the prairies of Oklahoma to the fruit valleys of California. En route, the family faces death, hunger, unemployment and humiliation. Some travellers break off, others stick with it; there are funerals, floods and famine. The large Shaw stage is throughout filled with the hopeful family, but clears for the closing scene of a childless woman breast-feeding a starving man. The adaptation scores with the set, like the inside of an orange crate, the light seeping through from the back, and an understage stream (for the excellent flood scene); the Joads' car is a sensible trolley with headlights and a radiator, and all the other scenery is light and shadow. The acting - particularly Paul R. Meade as Tom Joad and Tom McGovern as the ex-Reverend Casy - keeps the action tense; there is a fine performance from Anne Kidd as the matriarch of the Joad family, the strong reliant woman found everywhere in Steinbeck's fiction. For all its qualities, this staged Grapes of Wrath has little of the book's power or the film's scope. The production misses Steinbeck's unremitting outrage at the careless economic forces pushing the Joad family further from itself; and it misses the beauties of Steinbeck's visceral prose. There is a narrator and a group of musicians who speed the action along, but they rarely step over the divide between literature and theatre. Iain Reekie's direction finds Steinbeck's strengths: the moral shoot-out, the loss of self-belief, the search for friendship; but they are too loudly treated. The play lacks quiet, powerful moments. 'Most people', wrote Steinbeck in his unpublished 1933 Journal, 'do not like themselves at all, do not even know themselves well enough to form a true liking.' Enter Dostoyevsky (1821-81) and his self-tormenting hero Raskolnikov at the Battersea Arts Centre. This production, by Red Shift, amounts to the hi-volume cartoon version of the 1856 Russian classic. It works by selecting rather than including, so swathes of the novel are rightly unrepresented, but at the expense of Dostoyevsky's impact. This is the play of the detective novel inside Crime &amp; Punishment. Jonathan Holloway's adaptation is subtitled The Killer's Story; it lasts 135 minutes and keeps the action to four characters: Raskolnikov, Razumikhin his friend, Sonya his lover and Porfiry his nemesis. Gone are the Marmeladovs, but purists will be happy to know the scene where Marmeladov is crushed to death finds a place. Other parts are played in latex masks, and the action concentrates on the duel between Porfiry and Raskolnikov: 'a murder is incomplete without detection, a murderer incomplete without punishment.' The finest scene is a dream sequence of Raskolnikov murdering the old woman and her sister, darting into the flat, stealing her pearls, avoiding detection. The scene plays backwards and then forwards to nervy and nagging music. The cast (particularly Tristan Sharps as Porfiry and Philip Brook as Raskolnikov) deliver with point and verve, and Holloway's direction keeps the action scooting around with walls and doors on plinths. But this touring show has none of the quiet, daily horror of Crime &amp; Punishment; it lacks the calm concentration essential to the story. Red Shift has produced a good introduction to its fine brand of innovative theatre, but not to Dostoyevsky. The Grapes of Wrath: Shaw Theatre (071 388 1394) until 30 April; Crime &amp; Punishment: Battersea Arts Centre (071 223 2223) until 14 May. Both then go on tour.</p>

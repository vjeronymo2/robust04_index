			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K. Kabayev: "This Is Not a Conservatory for </F> You. Everyone Is Monitored Here: Chekists in Kyrgyzia  [Kyrgyzstan] Have Started an Apparatus War"]    [Text] Bishkek -- "Hello, is this the hospital? No? Then  excuse me..."    What does this mean? If you are not a statesman, not an  important businessman, or, finally, not a "hard-boiled"  journalist, the error can be written off to lousy telephone  communications. But, if you fall into the aforementioned  category of people, then you should think twice.    A special cable stretches from each of the 16 operating  telephone stations in Bishkek to the department with three, now  four, initials -- GKNB [State Committee for National Security].  The KGB has its own people on each shift at the 16 stations.  With some degree of exaggeration, the Ministry of  Communications can be safely called a daughter of the KGB firm.    A note with a request to monitor one or another subscriber  (addressed to the chairman of the KGB) is submitted by the  manager of one of the two leading directorates of the office.  After an appropriate endorsement, the paper is returned to the  executor. Further, it is a matter of equipment. A ring can be  heard at the necessary ATC [automated telephone station]:    "Masha (Aigul, Sveta, Larisa...), hook us up with this  number."    Soon a small light shows up on a panel in a special KGB room  -- "the subscriber is on the line!" In order to determine  whether the "object" is in place in the apartment of the person  who is "under surveillance," the buzzer rings: "Hello, is this  the hospital (hotel, bathhouse, kindergarten, etc.)?" The  trustful master of the house replies indignantly that, no, this,  he says, is an apartment... As a rule, it is here that the  recorder is turned on with each incoming and outgoing telephone  call. By the way, the click in the telephone receiver that is  described in detective stories cannot be heard. The GB's [state  security] apparatus is well balanced. Sometimes conversations  are listened to directly. But in both cases in the apartment (or  the office), a noticeable deterioration in sound quality occurs.  Approval to monitor a telephone is granted for a period of not  more than one month; however, this does not mean that the  approval cannot be extended. According to the testimony of  reliable persons, up to 20 subscribers are monitored in Bishkek  each day.    However, the situation in an apartment (or office) can also  be monitored without lifting the telephone receiver. In this  case, the telephone apparatus itself acts as a microphone.  Therefore, knowledgeable people either disconnect the apparatus  from the system or turn on a source of additional sound (two is  better, in different corners of the room) -- a radio, a  television set. The author of these lines frequently had  occasion to be witness to this during conversations with highly  placed Kyrgyz officials.    Notes containing approval for monitoring are supposed to be  kept in a special archive. However, if a note is "lost" for any  reason, the loss may not even be noticed. Thus, it has become  known that in December of 1980, after the murder of Chairman of  the Council of Ministers Sultan Ibraimov, several notes of  approval and deciphering of telephone conversations of suspected  persons disappeared.    With the victory of democracy in Kyrgyzia, discussions about  telephone monitoring have not diminished. Complaints and  suspicions are coming both from governmental figures and also  from journalists and politicians.    There are a lot of examples. When leaving for home Felix  Kulov, former vice president of the state, sealed the door of  his official office and, while talking with someone,  disconnected the telephone apparatus from the system. Topchubek  Turgunaliyev, head of the Erk Party, suspecting the "office" of  monitoring his telephone, officially appealed to the head of the  KGB-GKNB.    Alas, the essence of the department did not change with the  change of signboard. Just as in the epoch of totalitarianism,  the department continues to engage in political investigation,  and it actively intervenes in the affairs of the state and the  personal life of its citizens.    After the downfall of communism in the Baltics and Eastern  Europe, the state security organs were the masters of the  political Olympus for three or four years. With their assist,  parliamentarians divided each other into "clean" and "dirty."  The chiefs of committees removed objectionable figures from the  political arena without particular problems. Undoubtedly, given  all its antiespionage (read antistate security) orientation,  this prolonged action was managed and coordinated by departments  that "were being criticized." It is sufficient to mention that  after the accusations of "cooperation with the KGB," Kazimiera  Prunskiene was forced to resign as prime minister of Lithuania.  But who else could have arranged the compromise of the prime  minister except the KGB? No one! The axiom says: "Divulgence  of agent information is a matter for the hands of the department  that put such agent network together." The intelligence  services of Czechoslovakia were able to isolate Aleksandr  Dubcek, who recently died in an automobile accident under  questionable circumstances. The state security people of Poland  were not satisfied with Lech Walesa, who there and then was  accused of cooperation with the organs. Moreover, rather  convincing documents were leaked to the press.    Kyrgyzia, apparently, is also no exception. In the opinion  of a number of former employees of the Kyrgyz KGB, the firm in  one way or another controls up to half of the state employees  and members of parliament. Some of them were and are secret  agents, others were seen in the organs at one time carrying out  delicate instructions of the KGB, and still others were driven  at one time "to do the devil's work" by writing a denunciation  against a neighbor, and the paper providently settled in the  "office." Today (as they believe), the publication of three to  five names that are well known in the Republic (with a specific  demonstration of their agent activity) is capable of causing a  profound governmental and parliamentary crisis.    Getting ahead of the story, it should be noted that with  this, apparently, these state security people have captured  parliamentarians who are scared to death. At the last session  of the Kyrgyz parliament the people's representatives  unanimously passed a law concerning the organs of state security.    According to this law, the Chekists acquired the right of  unimpeded entry into dwellings "and other premises belonging to  citizens" (a reason will always be found!), and the procurator  has to be notified of this only after 24 hours. Now state  security people can quite informally intervene in the activity  of commercial structures, "demand and receive from them  necessary information, check the presence of property with  registered and current data, and receive information in banks on  operations, accounts, and deposits." Where is the guarantee that  the commercial information will not be turned over (sold) to  competitors afterwards? Where is the guarantee that the  Chekists (and today they are graduates of Kyrgyz higher  educational institutions who have merely gone through a Bishkek  system of personnel selection) will not ruin the firms and  organizations they are checking up on? After all, the law does  not say a word about the measure of responsibility of the  employees of the GKNB in the event of causing moral, physical,  or economic damage.    The state security people have retained control over  governmental special communications, they have retained for  themselves the investigative isolation cells that just a year  ago were filled with then "foreign money speculators," though as  it turns out today--with legal financial brokers. Now the  Chekists, suspecting someone (and, as is known, anyone and  everyone can be suspected), can quite informally check the  contents of your pockets and go through your car and personal  things. Moreover, without the approval of a procurator.    Incidentally, Kyrgyz Chekists now enjoy the use of all types  of public transport (except taxis) free of charge.    And more: The services of state security informers will be  paid from the republic budget.    Thus, in the most democratic Central Asian republic, the  parliamentarians not only did not restrict the activity of its  monster, but, on the contrary, placed it above all society,  having legalized the penetration of all spheres of Kyrgyz state,  public, and economic life.    Only the president has the last word. After all, whether the  law on state security organs passed by the deputies will be  confirmed depends only on him. But the president is keeping  silent... for the time being.</p>

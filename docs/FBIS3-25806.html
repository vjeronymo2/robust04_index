			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "China Economic News" column: "The Main Points of the </F> `Chang Jiang Strategy' Plan"]    [Text] It is learned that the State Planning Commission  has recently worked out the main points of a new "Chang Jiang  strategy" plan. The methods of specific implementation and main  points are as follows:    --Establish an economic ring along the Chang Jiang which  takes Pudong of Shanghai as the dragon head and covers eight  areas and 28 large and medium-sized cities between Chongqing and  the Chang Jiang Estuary.    --Speed up the construction of infrastructure and key  projects in the region, including over 100 backbone projects  with an investment amount of over 200 billion yuan each, such as  the Shanghai Jinshan 1-million-metric ton oil refinery project,  the Pudong international airport, the Shanghai sedan project  with an annual production capacity of 300,000 cars, the Shanghai  acetic acid standard project, the second-phase Qinshan Power  Plant project, the Panzhihua nonferrous metal project, the  Beijing-Shanghai express railway project, the Hubei sedan  project with an annual production capacity of 300,000 cars, and  the Three Gorges project.    --Quicken the pace of using foreign funds in areas along the  Chang Jiang and diversify the fields in which foreign capital is  used. Except for the pornography and gambling industries, which  should be banned, and state-level telecommunications facilities,  which are not open to the outside world, other fields may in  principle utilize foreign capital, which is estimated at around  $10 billion.    --Open the domestic market to foreign businessmen. Use  foreign capital according to international practice, i.e. the  BOT [Board of Trade] method, with foreign businessmen being  responsible for investment, construction, and operation for a  period of 15 years and the Chinese side purchasing the products  manufactured by foreign-invested enterprises.    --Remove the "restricted areas." Given that state interests  are not infringed upon, foreign businessmen should be allowed to  invest in those trades they deem appropriate.    It is disclosed that, to implement the plan, the state will,  between now and the year 2000, build a number of key projects in  areas along the Chang Jiang and the scope of investment is 1,000  billion yuan.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: THE VALLEY  </P> <P> For artist and gallery owner Phillip Orlando, the way the figure is depicted  can be telling. He sees in figurative representation something of a cultural  mask that can simultaneously reinforce certain ideas or hide them from the  uninitiated. This idea, pretty basic to social archeologists but not often  discussed in relation to figurative art, forms the premise to his paintings and  small constructions.  </P> <P> Sadly, the naive, somewhat predictable paintings of African masks and spirit  effigy don't add much to the notion. Like hero worship content with  appearances, they seem happy to copy the artifacts in a sort of Dadaesque  appreciation of the abstract figurative form. Meaning isn't amplified.  Occasional pieces like "Marka With Shadow" look good and keep the original's  mysterious aura of spirituality. But even collaged magazine photos can't  connect the overall symbolism to this culture.  </P> <P> In his trendy magazines turned trashy masks, however, Orlando sets up an  interesting analysis of figuration-as-symbol in this culture. It's a point of  view reflecting the harsh glare and hype of media promotion on ideas of  sexuality and success. Not incidentally, the glitzy magazines make strangely  empty masks. Fascinating yet repellent, they pointedly turn Orlando's cutting,  collaging and painting into something part exorcism, part adolescent fan club.

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Sky is the limit BSkyB is the classic ugly duckling turned swan. The satellite network has rapidly turned losses into profits and is now ready to float away. The immediate benefit to shareholders will be the release of Pounds 1.2bn in shareholder loans and guarantees. Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, still heavily indebted after near-insolvency in 1990, could certainly use its Pounds 600m share. As shown by last week's plan to issue preference shares, Mr Murdoch is searching for ways to raise capital without losing control. Speculation is bound to mount that he is back on the acquisition trail. A BSkyB float will also have the benefit for its present shareholders of making the value of their stakes more visible. Further cash could be raised by cutting their stakes after the planned one-year lock-up expires. Granada does not need cash now given that its approach to caterer Gardner Merchant has been rejected. But if the government relaxes rules on cross-media ownership, the group may wish to add to its ITV interests. Cynics will say the float's timing is dictated by the fact that the threat to Sky from cable TV is not yet fully apparent. Sky currently makes the same profit irrespective of whether its programmes are distributed by cable or via dishes. But as cable companies roll out their networks and start making their own programmes, they may take fewer Sky channels. Cable groups will also be in a stronger position to bargain for a better deal on those channels they do take. That said, this threat will take several years to materialise. Meanwhile, BSkyB stands to benefit from growth not only in subscriber fees but in advertising revenue which currently accounts for only 20 per cent of its income.</p>

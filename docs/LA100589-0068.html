			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MOSCOW VIRTUOSI, SPIVAKOV RETURN TO ARTS CENTER  </P> <P> The Moscow Virtuosi gave its first Southern California performance two years  ago on the night of the stock market crash.  </P> <P> No such excitement colored the first concert of the Soviet troupe's return  visit Tuesday night, back in Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing  Arts Center -- and again sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society.  </P> <P> (The ensemble was scheduled to move on to Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena on  Wednesday night.)  </P> <P> But there were thrills enough, as violinist-conductor Vladimir Spivakov led his  chamber orchestra -- including oboes and horns and now numbering 26 players --  on a jolly romp through standard works by Bach, Stravinsky and Haydn and one  novelty, Penderecki's Capriccio for oboe and 11 strings (1965).  </P> <P> As before, the all-male orchestra demonstrated polished technical  accomplishment and high spirits, a modicum of interest in matters of style --  its use of harpsichord turned out to be arbitrary and sometimes inaudible, for  instance -- and a palpable wish to please. Such a wish seemed to be expressed  in three audience-courting encores after the program proper: the Waltz from  Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings; Bartok's Romanian Folk Dances, and the  Polka from Shostakovich's ballet, "L'Age d'Or."  </P> <P> But top-drawer -- a word one learned, lest we forget, from Virgil Thomson --  performances characterized this entire event. At the beginning, when Spivakov  and first violinist Arkady Futer became soloists in Bach's familiar D-minor  Concerto for two violins, there may not have been a lot of Baroque definition,  and not even very much transparency in the string playing, but the solidity,  directness and scrubbed nature of the reading still left little to be desired.  </P> <P> And Stravinsky's Concerto in D for strings elicited the best kind of  Russian-style pungency with lushness, in an immaculate account marked by a  tight blend of urgency and relaxation. Spivakov may look like a fussy conductor  -- he often seems to be making twice as many gestures as he needs -- but the  sound-results usually contradict that impression.  </P> <P> In the brief Penderecki piece, in which Alexei Utkin was the resourceful and  witty soloist -- it is an amusing little essay full of emotional twists as well  as insect imitations -- Spivakov &amp; Co. seemed to find all the nuances of  color and contrast the composer may have envisioned.  </P> <P> Best came last, in a full-throated but style-conscious performance of Haydn's  ever-wondrous "Farewell" Symphony, a work of many facets and moods, as well as  changing textures. With 30% less string vibrato and 25% more instrumental  transparency, it would probably have approached perfection.  </P></p>

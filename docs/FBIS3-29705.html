			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary under the rubric: "Nation Analysis -- </F> Military-Govt Ties"]    [Excerpts] The military's resistance to the government  suggestion that future arms purchases could be funded through  barter agreements with foreign suppliers is in every way typical  of the armed forces' reaction whenever they feel their home turf  is being violated.    Previous government attempts to have the military trade  agricultural products for defense equipment have proved futile.  This time the armed forces are saying once again that bartering  is neither feasible nor appropriate for arms procurement,  particularly when it concerns the need to modernize weapons  systems.    Barter would require the use of international commodity  trading firms to handle sales of agricultural products with the  proceeds going to pay the weapons suppliers. This is a  cumbersome, complicated arrangement, personally unrewarding --  and not preferred by those who want something under the table.    Multi-billion baht arms procurements in the past usually  meant a lot more than professional pride to military leaders,  who staunchly protected their vested interests under the pretext  of "national security" and argued that acquisitions should not  be subject to any scrutiny by the government.    The present generation of military leaders -- though with a  relatively good image -- still owe some explanation to the  government as to why they think barter trade is not acceptable  when arms procurement is needed.    They know they still bear the brunt of public criticism  arising out of questionable deals concluded by their  predecessors, with doubts over possible kickbacks heightened due  to the huge wealth of many in the top brass.    The public has a clear memory that whenever a barter deal  has  been suggested in the past, senior military officers have  defended their preference for commercial deals or direct cash  purchases by arguing that the best and most suitable weaponry  could not be purchased by barter.    But subsequent embarrassing incidents revealed there had  been  more than just simple shady dealing involved. The weapons  acquired were sometimes found to be far below acceptable  standards, their shortcomings raising serious doubts about their  effectiveness in a war.    Controversies involving Stingray light tanks, the Spada air  defense system, and Bell Helicopter purchases, for example, have  caused the generals to scramble for lame excuses to dilute the  negative effects of the public outcry over suspicious deals --  about attractive commissions and kickbacks for all, from those  responsible for preliminary arrangements up to the top decision  makers.    There have been only a few successful bidders for arms  deals,  as the record of the armed forces shows. Fewer than five firms  have shared in cozy arrangements with the military, with  Commercial Associates Co Ltd at the forefront with huge deals  every fiscal year.    The company represented the makers of Stingray light tanks,  the Spada anti-aircraft missile system, Bell Helicopters and AMX  jet fighters, among others. The Stingray and Spada purchases  proved embarrassing for the Army last year when defects were  detected. In the end, the manufacturers agreed to carry out  repairs free of charge.    When the deals for the Stingray tanks and Spada rockets were  proposed in the late 1980s, top Army figures were strong in  their support, saying they were appropriate for Thailand's  defense capability. Key military figures of the time, such as  Supreme Commander Gen Sunthon Khongsomphong and deputy Army  chief Gen Wanchai Ruangtrakun, have all since retired and, as  expected, none of them came forward to defend the equipment last  year.    If the military genuinely wants to modernize its defense  capability, it should have avoid weapons not in use in the  armies of other countries [sentence as published]. For example,  the military keeps on buying Bell combat helicopters which are  no longer used by the US armed forces. At one time, they wanted  to buy used helicopters decommissioned from the US forces,  arguing that they were still in good condition having been  repaired and refitted. [passage omitted]    A notable point is that the Thai armed forces have  frequently  been the "launch customers" of an item of defense equipment,  such as the Stingrays. This raises the question whether there  was something more involved than just a direct commercial  arrangement.    It could be that many types af weapons purchased by Thailand  were procured on the assumption that they would never be used in  battle and whatever defects there might be would never be known  to the public. Risks of exposure were considered minimal,  except in the cases of bad luck or a power play among military  figures.    The controversies surrounding the Stingray light tanks and  the Spada missile system have proved otherwise -- that they were  not the most modern or most suitable weapons, as claimed.</p>

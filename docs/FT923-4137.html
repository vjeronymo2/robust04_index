			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, The Netherlands (5): Important breakthrough on terminals - Electronic payments LEADING supermarkets and department stores in the Netherlands will soon be bristling with electronic point-of-sale payment systems, in a development which promises to help the country's banks lower their traditional losses on payment transfers, cheque-cashing and cash withdrawals. The banks' efforts to promote point-of-sale payments achieved an important breakthrough in 1992 when the Netherlands' leading supermarket chain and its biggest non-food retailer both agreed to install a large number of automatic payment terminals in their outlets. Albert Heijn, the biggest Dutch supermarket chain, and Vendex, the holding company for a variety of stores, including its flagship department store Vroom &amp; Dreesmann, have signed separate, landmark deals with BeaNet, an electronic-payments company owned jointly by the Netherlands' banking industry. Another grocery-store chain, Unigro, has also committed itself to install electronic payment equipment in its shops. Until now, large-scale penetration of point-of-sale equipment had been limited to Dutch petrol stations and, more recently, to Ikea, the Swedish furniture group, and to selected clothing retailers such as Peek &amp; Cloppenburg. The two latest deals are significant not only because they are expected to set a trend which will bring many more Dutch companies into the BeaNet fold. They are also noteworthy because Albert Heijn, which is operated by the Ahold group, and Vendex have both pledged to generate 45m point-of-sale transactions a year by 1995. This guaranteed total of 90m transactions will put BeaNet well on the way to reaching an operational break-even point of 150m transactions a year by 1995, compared with 23m in 1991. Thanks largely to the automatic payment machines to be installed at Albert Heijn and various businesses within the Vendex retail group, the number of electronic point-of-sale machines is set to surge to 14,000 in 1994 from 6,500. The sharp rise in point-of-sale systems looks likely to parallel the swift advance in recent years of automatic teller machines (ATMs) on the walls of Dutch banks and post offices as well as in public concourses, such as train stations, during the 1980s. Mr Robertus Hazelhoff, chairman of ABN Amro Bank, says: 'ATM withdrawals now account for 50 per cent of all cash withdrawals compared with only eight years ago, when the percentage was still zero.' The Netherlands has roughly 4,000 ATMs in service, representing one machine for every two bank branches and post offices in the country. The use of ATMs is now so common and widespread in cash withdrawals that Dutch consumers are expected to take easily to using the same bank card and PIN (personal identity number) code to pay for their purchases in shops. Credit cards are also becoming increasingly popular, with more than 1m in circulation today compared with less than 300,000 in 1985. In return for their guarantee on transaction levels, BeaNet agreed to give Albert Heijn and Vendex a discount on costs-per-transaction. Specific figures for the two deals have never been disclosed but industry analysts estimate that Ahold will pay about Fl 0.13 or Fl 0.14 per transaction, compared with the current minimum of Fl 0.15 for other BeaNet users. BeaNet is just one of the banks' various initiatives to reduce the cost of the Netherlands' payments system and, by extension, their own expenditure on moving around their clients' money. Mr Hazelhoff of ABN Amro, which estimates that it loses Fl 300m-Fl 400m a year on payment transfers, says the fact that payments transfers for private customers are 'free' masks the real costs which are required to move money from one bank account to another. Dutch banks have already moved to place restrictions on free services, such as limiting the number of free Eurocheques per customer to 60 a year. They are also considering introducing charges on current accounts to defray the costs of transfers, following the introduction of charges for corporate clients. But the banks are proceeding cautiously in the light of the experience of Rabobank, the big Dutch co-operative, which was forced in March to retract its plan to levy an annual Fl 25 fee on its current-account holders. The fee caused a large outflow of savings from Rabobank to its competitors, particularly the Postbank which has vowed never to charge current-account holders for basic banking services. Rabobank is reconsidering its options and intends to launch a revised plan in January. Rather than charging a flat Fl 25 fee, it will begin limiting the free use of the most expensive types of transfer instructions, particularly hand-written ones. But Rabobank says most clients will be able to avoid paying charges by tailoring their payment pattern to emphasise the cheapest types of transfers. At industry level, the Dutch banking community as a whole has joined forces with the retail industry and employer groups in a national campaign to persuade consumers not to write out cheques for small amounts. The banks' figures for 1991 show that the average cheque was made out for Fl 125, well below the maximum allowable Fl 300. This average means that many cheques are written out for relatively small amounts, exacerbating the banks' cost problem. To change this cheque-writing behaviour, the campaign, launched on August 24 under the motto 'Betaal op maat' (Pay to measure), aims to educate consumers about the true cost of paying by cheque. Through nation-wide advertisements and quiz games on an afternoon television programme, the banks are seeking to encourage people to use cheques only for larger purchases of Fl 100 or more. Cash is preferred for smaller transactions, while electronic point-of-sale payments are desirable whenever possible, as long as the purchase price is not so small as to make cash the better option. The banks say that by taking these steps, consumers could help save the banks Fl 200m a year in payment transaction costs. The implication is that if they do not, they can expect to start paying for current-account facilities and payment transfers. For all their apparent readiness to adopt bank cards with magnetic strips and PIN codes, the Dutch are unlikely to take to 'smart cards' - or cards which have a computer chip embedded in them, avoiding the need for on-line computer connections - anytime soon. After an experiment lasting more than two years in Woerden, a town near the city of Utrecht, researchers found that only 3 per cent of transactions were carried out by smart cards, far below an initial target of 15 per cent. The experiment, the most comprehensive of its kind in the Netherlands, involved 180 shopkeepers and nearly 8,000 smart card-holders, or about 25 per cent of the town's population, in the period 1989-1991. Among shopkeepers, non-food retailers such as clothing shops tended to be the most satisfied with the use of the new type of cards, while food retailers and other purveyors of daily, household items were less enthusiastic, which researchers put down to 'their relatively low transaction amounts, their high number of cash purchases and heavy traffic at the check-out counter.' Commenting on the experiment's results, Mr Wim Kok, the Dutch finance minister, told parliament earlier this year: 'It shows that other means of payment, such as cash or cheques, are not easily supplanted by chip cards.' Magnetic bank cards, however, look like becoming a permanent feature at the check-outs of Dutch petrol stations, supermarkets and department stores.</p>

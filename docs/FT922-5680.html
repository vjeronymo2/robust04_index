			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Rolfe &amp; Nolan dips to Pounds 1.39m Rolfe &amp; Nolan, the futures and options computer bureau and software specialist, reported a 4 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.39m for the year to February 29. That compared with Pounds 1.45m last time and came from a 7 per cent improvement in turnover from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 6.74m. Mr Tim Hearley, chairman, said the company had significantly more short and medium-term licence sale prospects than at this time last year, particularly in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the UK. And there were signs that the ordering cycle was speeding up again. A final dividend of 3.9p is proposed, making an improved total for the year of 6.2p (5.6p). Earnings per share came out at 15.9p (17.7p) after a higher tax charge of Pounds 507,000 (Pounds 496,000).</p>

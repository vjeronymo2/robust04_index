			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Union spice in Cathay Pacific glamour: Air hostesses set awkward agenda for Governor Patten IN STARK contrast to their advertising image of passive glamour, Cathay Pacific's air hostesses have sparked a controversial re-evaluation of Hong Kong's labour laws, following the ending of their 17-day strike on Saturday. It is a theme that could prove awkward for Governor Chris Patten. Mr Patten's push for further democracy has helped earn him the label of a man of the people. He has proposed a more representative government, despite opposition from a conservative business lobby, and made a great show of introducing transparency and accountability into the administration. But although he has talked of Hong Kong having a first-world economy and a third-world environment, he seems unlikely to want to alter the colony's working environment by encouraging its nascent trade union movement. The flight attendants' strike initially focused on the issue of being forced temporarily to fill junior positions. The dispute escalated when Cathay Pacific fired three flight attendants for following union recommendations not to 'work down'. Neither Cathay nor the strikers wanted the issue to be politicised, but when the airline insisted on retaining its legal right to discipline striking staff - and ultimately to sack them - the dispute evolved into a debate over whether workers should be allowed to strike. The argument literally moved onto Mr Patten's door-step, when the so-called 'perfume picket line' relocated to the entrance of Government House in the hope of forcing his support. However, the strikers' only glimpse of the governor was when he drove out en route for the airport and Bali, and the administration has kept surprisingly quiet on the issue. Employees are allowed to strike, but they have to face the consequences of any breach of their employment contract. Dr CK Law, research director at South China Brokerage, says: 'The labour laws in Hong Kong are very much out of the 19th century.' One vocal commentator might have been expected to take sides in a fight between a group of workers and a traditional British company, has been noticeably silent: China. The fact that Beijing-controlled company CITIC Pacific is a big shareholder in Cathay is one possible explanation, but it is also likely that Beijing would not wish to see the trade union movement strengthened prior to 1997. Cathay itself has urged change, since the wildcat strike that started the walk-out - and may have cost the company more than Dollars HK200m (Pounds 16.6m) - was started with the agreement of just 114 of the 3,700 members of the Flight Attendants Union (FAU). Furthermore, Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democratic party, has been highly critical of the role of Mrs Katherine Fok, the Commissioner for Labour, who turned down requests by legislators for the appointment of a special conciliation officer for the dispute. 'We were compelled to draw the conclusion that the people above (Mrs Fok) did not want her to do anything,' said Mr Lee, who indicated that the administration could be influenced by the fact that Cathay Pacific is a company controlled by both British and Chinese interests. Mr Lee's party, which thus far has been a staunch supporter of Mr Patten, controls 12 of the Legislative Council's 60 seats. It would expect support from other liberal factions, for any legislative changes which the United Democrats put forward. But this might not be enough. Mr YN Yiu, deputy commissioner for labour, said a review would be conducted, but he emphasised that the review would 'have to take into account local conditions.' He said that minimum statutory benefits for Hong Kong workers were already at least as good as those in other similar South Asian economies. The Co-operative Resources Centre, the conservative political grouping, welcomed the government's review, but it is also unconvinced of the need for drastic change. CRC spokesman Mr Ronald Arculli pointed to the fact that there had been very few labour disputes in Hong Kong's history and said 'one wonders whether the current difficulties are not being unduly politicised by the unions.' The last major industrial dispute in Hong Kong, was the 1989 strike by China Motor Bus drivers, which lasted 2 days and was almost immediately resolved to the satisfaction of the union. Since then, a tight labour market has enabled dissatisfied workers to obtain alternative employment. February will herald the review by the Legislative Council of Mr Patten's controversial blueprint for political reform, and it is easy to assume that this will overwhelm any reaction to Hong Kong's most high profile industrial dispute - despite the attempts of Martin Lee. As Dr Law said: 'If the business community stands firm, I don't think the government will make any changes. I think the issue will just die down'. The business community appears happy to dismiss the strike as a glamorous aberration.</p>

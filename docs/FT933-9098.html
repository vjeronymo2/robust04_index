			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / PLO seeks revised strategy for peace process PALESTINIAN leaders holding crisis talks in Tunis focused debate yesterday on how best to co-ordinate positions on peace negotiations with Israel and ensure a democratic debate. The broad debate on Palestinian strategy, which also reflected desire for a revision in the framework of the Middle East peace process, came as Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, acknowledged for the first time that three Palestinian negotiators had threatened to resign. Mr Arafat said that after three days of talks within his Fatah faction, the PLO executive committee would now decide whether to accept the resignations offered by Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Mr Faisal Husseini and Mr Saeb Erekat. The three negotiators are upset about a lack of consultation by Mr Arafat. As a concession to the three moderates, Palestinians are considering setting up a joint 'administration' linking PLO leaders with negotiators from the Israeli-occupied territories which would decide on a unified negotiating position. Such a move, if approved, would lessen Mr Arafat's grip on strategy, improve communication and strengthen the influence of negotiators from inside the occupied territories. A senior PLO official, however, said that the issue at the heart of the crisis was the framework for peace talks agreed in Madrid by all the parties in October 1991. He said it was recognised that after 21 months of fruitless talks the process contained two 'funda-mental flaws' - no direct talks between Israel and the PLO and a two-phased agreement which leaves resolution of the most sensitive issues, such as control over Israeli-occupied Arab east Jerusalem, until after an interim agreement on self-rule has been signed. 'The restrictions imposed by the Madrid framework has caused this latest tension and confusion because it makes divisions between the PLO and the negotiating team,' said the official. 'The framework no longer works and it must be changed if we are going to make quick progress on peace.' He also said Palestinians concurred that direct talks between Israel and the PLO, besides unifying leaders from inside and outside the territories, would help to accelerate peace talks. There is less consensus on the need to abandon talks on the interim phase of Palestinian self-rule and move directly on to talks about the 'final status' of a Palestinian entity. Both the US and Israel oppose any change in the Madrid framework until the possibilities of an interim agreement without direct talks with the PLO have been exhausted.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / International Company News: Lafayette to bid for French rival GALERIES Lafayette, the Parisian department store group, has been forced against its intentions to launch a takeover bid for rival retailer, Nouvelles Galeries. The offer values Nouvelles Galeries at FFr5.4bn (Dollars 964m). The French stock exchange council ordered Galeries Lafayette to bid for control after the stores group had spent FFr800m lifting its existing stake in Nouvelles Galeries, with apparently friendly intentions. Galeries Lafayette last week bought a 16.4 per cent block of Nouvelles Galeries shares from Proventus, the Swedish retailing group, so lifting its stake in Nouvelles Galeries to 39 per cent. The buyer unsuccessfully sought an exemption from French takeover laws, under which it had to make an automatic offer for two thirds of Nouvelles Galeries' capital on passing the 33 per cent threshold. The stock exchange council refused to accept Galeries Lafayette's argument that the fact that 47.5 per cent of Nouvelles Galeries' voting rights are held by the controlling Devanlay textiles group exempted it from the obligation to launch a full bid. If Mr Leon Cligman, Devanlay's chairman and his family shareholders now accept Galeries Lafayette's bid, securities analysts believe this could start off a wide and overdue reshuffle of ownership in the French retail sector. The winner of any such contest would be under clear pressure to finance the acquisition by selling Nouvelles Galeries' 51 per cent ownership of BHV, the French chain of home improvements stores. Galeries Lafayette has offered FFr863.5 per share for the 1,560,039 extra shares needed to control two thirds of Nouvelles Galeries' capital, which would cost it FFr1.34bn if fully accepted.</p>

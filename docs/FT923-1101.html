			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Forum proposes solution to treaty impasse A ROUTE around the legal and political obstacles now blocking ratification of the Maastricht treaty by European Community member states has been drawn up by an influential London think-tank. The independent European Policy Forum, which has close links with the British Conservative party leadership, claims to have won considerable support from the UK foreign office and Treasury. Mr Graham Mather, EPF director, said yesterday he believed the plan will form the basis of proposals to be submitted by the EC's British presidency for debate at next month's emergency heads of government summit. Described as a protocol, it spells out a 12-clause treaty annex, couched in legal language, that would strengthen the Council of Ministers' ability to limit the policymaking powers of the European Commission. Its intention is to add teeth to the treaty's wording on subsidiarity - the principle that power should be devolved to the lowest appropriate level - without requiring any tampering with the main treaty text. The EPF says its proposal aims to review the Commission's ability to initiate policy or pursue its own agenda and, instead, stresses its function as a civil service to the Council, supplying it with policy options. But the core of the plan centres on putting the onus on the Commission to justify its policy proposals as appropriate for Community-wide, as opposed to national action. Among its proposals are requirements that: The Commission explain at the outset of any policy development why an initiative should be dealt with at Community level, before tabling proposals; If its arguments are opposed by states controlling more than 20 per cent of the Council's votes, the Commission's proposal would drop; Proposals for legislation must be initiated by the Council, not the Commission; and A strengthened Council secretariat be developed with strategic planning functions. The EPF plan is understood to be the first published text, couched in the appropriate legal language, on how to press ahead with the Maastricht treaty in a way that might convince the Danes and other Euro-sceptics to agree ratification. In the wake of the narrow Yes vote in the French referendum, President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed that some action must be taken to reassure their electorates that curbs are being placed on the Brussels bureaucrats. However, it is far from certain whether the proposals would go far enough to satisfy opponents of the Maastricht treaty within the British Conservative party.

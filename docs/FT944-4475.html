			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Wealth of tax options to make up Budget shortfall The chancellor has probably received as much advice as to the contents of his so-called mini-budget to be delivered today as for the main event delivered to the House of Commons only nine days ago. Newspapers, economic analysts, and even his political opponents have all offered their chosen tax options - but Mr Clarke has a well-earned reputation for being able to produce political surprises. His announced intention is to plug the gap left in the Budget by the decision to drop the proposed increase on value added tax on fuel. The size of this gap is the first area of dispute, for while the gross cost of the measure was Pounds 1.5bn, that included measures to offset its impact on the elderly. Mr Chris Giles, a researcher at the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said yesterday that withdrawal of all or part of the planned safety net for those hit by the increase in VAT would result in 'clawback' of between Pounds 100m and Pounds 400m. 'In fact he doesn't have to do anything at all,' said Mr Giles. 'This is a drop in the ocean compared with the forecast for the PSBR for 1995-96 of Pounds 21.5bn. The forecast error on the PSBR is around Pounds 6bn wrong every year.' The chancellor may be enticed by the idea of putting together a package of smaller measures. That way he will avoid hitting one group of taxpayers. One option fast becoming a favourite yesterday was putting a penny on a litre of all road fuels: leaded, non-leaded, and diesel. This would bring in Pounds 500m and serve to replace one measure portrayed as environmentally friendly - increasing VAT on fuel - with another 'green' tax. A rise of 2p would achieve the chancellor's aims in one move. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, favours the petrol option as it would add only 0.2 per cent to the Retail Price Index compared with the 0.4 per cent which would have resulted from the rise in VAT on fuel. Until yesterday morning, when the chancellor decided to put up interest rates by a half point, another favoured option was a reduction in mortgage interest relief to 10 per cent. This would bring in the required Pounds 1bn revenue but would be politically troublesome after an interest rate rise. 'He has a whole variety of options,' said Mr Neil McKinnon, chief economist at Citibank. 'Clearly the revenue-raising option is more politically contentious . . . but he may decide to raise revenue through the back door.' One suggestion was cutting the married couple's allowance by 10 per cent - another measure which could bring in Pounds 1bn. Most analysts ruled out an increase in direct taxation as too politically risky for a government which has staked so much on the long-term reduction of income tax. A 0.5p rise in the basic rate of income tax, however, would bring in the required Pounds 1bn as would a  1/2 percentage point rise in VAT. Mr McKinnon judged that the VAT option 'would be adding fuel to the fire' after Tuesday night's defeat at the hands of opposition parties and rebel Conservative MPs. 'I think what he might do is either lift a freeze on (some) excise duties or dip into the contingency reserve.' However, Mr Adam Cole, economist at James Capel, was one of several analysts who believed that it was important for the chancellor to strike a tough fiscal stance in the mini-budget and that raiding the contingency reserve - the government's emergency fund - would displease the markets.</p>

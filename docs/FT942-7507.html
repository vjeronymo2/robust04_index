			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional treatment revised BET has agreed to amend the treatment of exceptional items in its 1993 report and accounts following discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog. The effect will be to eliminate a series of separately itemised exceptional items totalling Pounds 76m on the face of the profit and loss account and re-allocate them. The adjustment comes after discussions with one of the largest companies the panel has examined. Other large cases include British Gas and Trafalgar House. The review panel said yesterday it acknowledged BET had disclosed the nature of the exceptional items in the notes to the accounts. However, it 'felt that this did not fulfil the requirement of the standard that these items should be shown on the profit and loss account under the statutory format headings to which they relate'. In a revised note to the accounts, BET has had to re-allocate the exceptional items between cost of sales and administrative expenses. The panel is believed to have been concerned about the presentation of the exceptional items in boxes and comments in the chairman's statement which drew attention away from the pre-tax profit line stressed in FRS 3. BET said last night: 'This was a technical detail probably of most interest to those in the accounting profession. The analysts did not ask one question about it this morning.' It said it had adopted FRS 3 earlier than many companies and there was a lack of clarity about how it should be implemented at the time. It believed its original treatment was more helpful in showing its underlying performance.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Defense Minister Rafael Pardo </F> Rueda by Diego Hernan Canal from the Defense Ministry in Santa  Fe de Bogota; from the "NTC Newscast"--live]    [Text] Military forces have reported normalcy throughout  the country at this time, though there have been certain  incidents of public disorder in various places. For example, in  San Juan de Rioseco, Cundinamarca Department, two FARC  [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] members died during a  clash; three other subversives died during clashes in (Matanza),  Santander Department.    The president of the Barranca de Upia Council, Meta  Department, was killed, and several buses were attacked in  Barrancabermeja. The most complicated situation is still in  Carcasi, where more than 30 people are still being held hostage.  The guerrillas have not allowed the elections to start in  (Santa Rita de Iro) and Condoto, Choco Department.    Voting officers have not yet shown up in Montecristo, Achi  Municipality, Bolivar Department; their whereabouts are unknown.    Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda is here. Mr. Minister,  despite these public disorder incidents, do you think the  elections are taking place normally in the country?    [Pardo] You reported on actions directly related to public  order; that is, on clashes with the subversives and criminal  acts. They are unrelated to the electoral process. As for  things concerning the electoral process, I could specifically  mention the situation in Carcasi, where the voting officers were  kidnapped on 12 March. Carcasi has three voting tables and a  little more than 1,000 registered identification cards. A small  armed group has tried to prevent the people from voting in  Condoto, which has fewer than three voting tables. In  Montecristo, a corregimiento of Achi, Bolivar Department, the  voting officers failed to show up at 0800 to comply with their  duty and start the voting; that is, there are problems at less  than 10 voting tables out of 45,000 or a little more than 45,000  voting tables.    [Canal] Could we assume the voting officers in Montecristo  were also kidnapped?    [Pardo] We have no information in this regard.</p>

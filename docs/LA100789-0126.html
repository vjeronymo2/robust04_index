			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIAL PROGRAMS ARE FACTORS IN STATES' FALLING REVENUES, SURVEY SHOWS  </P> <P> State governments facing current or potential declines in revenues are being  asked by Congress to spend billions on social programs and will have to dip  into their reserves, cut other spending and raise taxes, state officials said  Friday.  </P> <P> In their annual fiscal survey of the states, the National Governors' Assn. and  the National Assn. of State Budget Officers said many Northeastern states ended  fiscal 1989 with balances smaller than they enjoyed at the end of the previous  year.  </P> <P> Many other states closed out the year with ending balances higher than before  because they had anticipated economic slowdowns that did not occur, the two  organizations of state officials said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, their report said, the states of the populous Northeast are often  a harbinger of things to come in the economy as a whole and "the rapid decline  in revenues in these states could portend downturns in other states."  </P> <P> Raymond G. Scheppach, executive director of the governors' association, said  that "early indications are that a number of states (in the Northeast) are not  seeing any revenue growth at all in the first three months" of fiscal year  1990.  </P> <P> The fiscal year ends on June 30 in 46 states, on March 31 in New York, on Aug.  31 in Texas and on Sept. 30 in Michigan and Alabama.  </P> <P> Scheppach said programs for catastrophic medical care will cost states an  estimated $4.2 billion over the next four years, despite repeal and cutback  measures currently being considered in Congress.  </P> <P> He said changes in nursing home laws enacted in 1987 will cost states an  estimated $2 billion.  </P> <P> If Medicaid revisions being considered become law, states will have to find an  additional $11.2 billion to pay for them.  </P> <P> "They (Congress) still want to do a lot of things and they don't have any money  and we are probably the easiest place to shift it to," Scheppach told  reporters.  </P></p>

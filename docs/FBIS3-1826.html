			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By M Y Sung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Former Hong Kong permanent residents with foreign  passports will lose the right of abode in the territory after  1997, but will be provided privileges of free entry and  unconditional stay upon return.    China's working group on transitional matters, the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), yesterday removed doubts  over the right of abode after 1997 by issuing clear guidelines.    PWC members found ambiguity in the Basic Law over the  definitions of permanent residence of the Special Administrative  Region (SAR).    Under Article 24, section 1 of the Basic Law, Chinese  citizens born in Hong Kong before or after the establishment of  the SAR shall be permanent residents.    An argument arose whether Hong Kong-born Chinese who  obtained  foreign nationalities would be able to preserve their right of  abode in Hong Kong according to Article 24 section 1. But the  PWC ruled that the section would not be applicable to such  people.    Speaking after the opening day of the PWC's public security  group sessions in Beijing yesterday, the mainland group leader  Wang Shuwen said people who obtained foreign nationalities were  no longer regarded as Chinese citizens but as foreign citizens.  Mr. Wang said Article 24, section 4 of the Basic Law was  applicable to those who were no longer Chinese nationals but had  returned to Hong Kong permanently. Section 4 set a requirement  of seven years' continuous residence in Hong Kong for persons  not of Chinese nationality to obtain the right of abode.    However, the SAR government would take a lenient attitude  and  would welcome returning migrants who were ethnic Chinese and  were formerly permanent residents of Hong Kong. They would be  allowed to enter the territory without visa requirements and  stay and work in Hong Kong as long as they liked.    Hong Kong group leader Rita Fan said the members agreed  returnees would automatically have the right of entry and the  right of unconditional stay in Hong Kong. But they would not  have the right to vote, the right to stand for elections or the  right to social welfare in Hong Kong according to the Basic Law  unless they regained permanent residence status. No consensus  has yet been reached in the PWC on the methods of defining the  seven years' continuous residence in the territory to regain the  right of abode.    Mr. Wang revealed that four different views were expressed:    -- Seven years' residence in Hong Kong before moving to a  foreign country should be counted;    -- The seven years' residence should not be counted if the  person moved away from the territory more than once;    -- If a migrant returned to Hong Kong permanently within a  certain period after the establishment of the SAR, seven years'  residence in Hong Kong before emigration should be counted;    -- Seven years should be counted from a new beginning when a  migrant returned to Hong Kong.    Mr. Wang said it was a very complicated issue and further  studies would be needed to reach a conclusion.</p>

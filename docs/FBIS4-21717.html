			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Gonzalez Batista] </F>   [Text] Alleged Colombian guerrillas who are guarding poppy  and coca plantations in the jungle areas along the border  between Panama and Colombia have threatened the members of the  National Air Service (SAN) with future attacks on their  aircraft, according to reports issued yesterday.    A police source who declined to be identified has revealed  the alleged guerrillas informed SAN personnel ``if they continue  to overfly those areas where they had their narcotics  plantations, they would execute artillery attacks against their  aircraft.''    The insurgents threatened to down every helicopter that  overflew the region and gave a 48-hour deadline to cease those  incursions. ``The Colombian Army in the area where crops are  located is warned, and so their lives would be endangered.''    During the past weeks, several SAN airplanes carrying  filming  equipment and Panamanian policemen have overflown the  inhospitable jungle of Darien Province, where they have detected  coca and poppy plantations extending over an immense number of  hectares.    Once the report about the alleged guerrillas was confirmed,  Panamanian policemen made a new incursion with the aid of the  U.S. Army, the result of which is unknown.    It seems in the next few hours the air operations will be  intensified in those regions to reach the sites where the rebel  groups and drug traffickers are guarding the plantations.    Until now and unofficially speaking, it is believed the  guerrillas belong to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  (FARC), which protects the drug traffickers' million-dollar  plantations for hefty sums of money.    A report indicated that after announcing their intentions  the  FARC rebels may stage an attack against Panamanian aircraft,  because the report stated the rebels are protected with  sophisticated weapons of war.    In February 1993 a contingent of Panamanian policemen, with  the backing of the U.S. Army and DEA officials, destroyed coca  and marijuana plantations on 90 hectares located in the remote  Darien Jungle on the border with Colombia.    The operation, called ``Frontera Libre,'' was conducted to  rescue three U.S. ``New Tribe'' missionaries whom the rebels had  kidnapped. Several drug traffickers and undocumented aliens were  arrested during that operation.    According to preliminary reports by the Panamanian police,  the new poppy and coca plantations are scattered in strategic  jungle areas between Darien and Colombia, making access to them  difficult.    Opium is the plant from which heroine is extracted. It is  one of the world's deadliest drugs and to date has killed  thousands of people in the different countries where it is  consumed.</p>

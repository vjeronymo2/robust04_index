			<p>BFN     [Text] On 12 April, Sugar Minister Nelson Torres stated  that the remaining part of April is decisive for the sugarcane  harvest and that we have to do everything possible, and more, to  meet the production plan. He made this statement during a  harvest emulation assessment over the last 10 days in the  eastern provinces. Torres, who is also a member of the  Politburo, added that the weather is helping; we therefore have  to take advantage of it during the last 20 days of April and  make the best effort in cutting and grinding with great  efficiency.</p>

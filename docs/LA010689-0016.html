			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OBSERVATORY ATOP MT. WILSON AIMS TO REJOIN SCIENCE  </P> <P> After running the venerable Mt. Wilson Observatory in the mountains overlooking  Los Angeles for 84 years, the Carnegie Institution Thursday formally handed  over the facility that was once the world's leading center of astronomy to a  small Pasadena institute with an ambitious dream.  </P> <P> The Mount Wilson Institute, a nonprofit group headed by Arthur H. Vaughn, a  veteran astronomer, is seeking several million dollars in private funds to  expand research and restore the facility's 100-inch reflecting telescope to  active service.  </P> <P> In a small ceremony in Washington, Vaughn said that -- despite the dazzling  lights of Los Angeles a mile below the observatory and the occasional high-tide  of smog that envelops the peak -- Mt. Wilson is considered the finest site in  the continental United States for observing the skies.  </P> <P> His plan, he said, is to put the observatory and its 100-inch telescope to work  in a neglected area of astronomy -- the study of closer, brighter stars to  better understand the turbulent behavior of the sun and to search for other  planetary systems.  </P> <P> "It is old, no doubt. But it forms very sharp images. That is what matters,"  Vaughn noted. With modern computer processing of its images, he said, the  telescope's performance under some conditions could equal that of the  billion-dollar Hubble Space Telescope that the space shuttle is scheduled to  carry into Earth orbit in about a year.  </P> <P> The most promising sources of funds, Vaughn said, will be private corporations  and possibly public subscriptions. In return, the Mount Wilson Institute  proposes to make the observatory serve double duty as a regional astronomy  education center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Once the World's Largest  </P> <P> The Mt. Wilson Observatory was established in 1904 with money from  industrialist Andrew Carnegie. In July, 1917, a spindly truck wheezed up a  perilous mountain road with a 100-inch mirror made of French wine-bottle glass,  and four months later the world's largest reflecting telescope -- a distinction  Mt. Wilson held for 31 years -- was probing the universe.  </P> <P> With this telescope in the 1920s and '30s, astronomer Edwin P. Hubble  discovered that what appeared to be nebulous wisps of glowing gas were in fact  other galaxies, receding at unimaginable distances and speeds at the rim of an  expanding universe.  </P> <P> Maxine F. Singer, president of the Carnegie Institution, said it was decided in  1984 to stop funding Mt. Wilson to divert money to construction of a mammoth  new telescope in the Andes Mountains of Chile. The Magellan telescope's mirror  is to measure 315 inches, making it by far the world's largest.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Vaughn noted, reports of the demise of science on Mt. Wilson have  been greatly exaggerated. "The public may think it's closed, but it's really a  beehive of activity up there."  </P> <P> Five research projects based at five universities are under way, financed by  about $300,000 in federal grants, mostly from the National Science Foundation.  </P> <P> But the observatory no longer has funds for its own independent scientific  staff. Vaughn said that he hopes to raise the operating budget to about  $750,000 a year, but that another $1 million to $2 million will be needed to  bring the 100-inch telescope out of mothballs.  </P> <P> "Before the National Science Foundation was there, astronomers knew how to  raise money from private sources," he said. "We're going to have to learn that  again."  </P></p>

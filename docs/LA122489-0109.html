			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KUDOS TO FIREFIGHTERS  </P> <P> On behalf of all the residents in North City West, and particularly those of us  who live in the Carmel Valley area, I want to thank the San Diego Fire  Department as well as the other state and local fire departments that helped  fight the Nov. 28 and Dec. 3 fires.  </P> <P> Eighty-foot-high flames swept up the hillside, driven by 50-mile-an-hour winds.  We watched the fire explode out of the canyons and spread so fast, we were  genuinely horrified and terrified.  </P> <P> And, as if one fire wasn't enough, five days later the second fire struck.  Again, residents were threatened by walls of flames tearing through the brush  and heading for 15 homes on the top of Shaw Ridge. As we stood there watching,  we felt completely helpless about any possibility of saving homes in the fire's  path.  </P> <P> But firefighters came to our rescue with extraordinary bravery, expertise and  determination. Through their coordinated efforts of attacking the fire with  aerial bombers, helicopters and ground crews, miraculously not one life or home  was lost in either fire. Under extremely dangerous conditions, we saw  firefighters put themselves and their lives on the line to save other peoples'  homes and property. It was an incredible sight and a noble act.  </P> <P> JOHN DEAN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

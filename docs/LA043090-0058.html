			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHESNOKOV BREAKS BANK WITH MONTE CARLO VICTORY  </P> <P> Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union, sprinting all over the court, downed  Thomas Muster of Austria, 7-5, 6-3, 6-3, Sunday in the final of the Monte Carlo  Open.  </P> <P> Chesnokov picked up $125,000, the biggest paycheck of his career. Muster won  $65,800.  </P> <P> "It was a big win and something I will remember for the rest of my life," said  Chesnokov, ranked 20th in the world. "It is a great tournament and I think this  is the biggest win for a Russian tennis player."  </P> <P> Not only the most important, but also the most lucrative.  </P> <P> "I already have the money in my pocket," Chesnokov said.  </P> <P> Chesnokov has in the past been forced to split his winnings with the Soviet  Federation, but after a tournament victory last year he said he would talk to  officials about arranging a better deal between himself and his agents.  According to his agents, Chesnokov now retains about 40%.  </P> <P> It is considerably better than the $496 he collected on the $59,500 he won for  the Orlando tournament in 1988.  </P> <P> Chesnokov, seeded 12th, had little trouble against Muster after winning a long  first set that lasted 70 minutes.  </P> <P> "The first set was very tough," Chesnokov said. "I got more confidence after  that."  </P> <P> Muster, ranked 30th in the world, was trying for his fifth tournament title  since coming back to the circuit. Last April, he made the final of the  International Players Championship, but was unable to play due to a leg injury  after a car backed into him, causing knee damage. He was sidelined for more  than six months.  </P> <P> Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain settled down after a shaky second-set start to  beat Isabel Cueto of West Germany, 6-4, 6-2, in the final of the Spanish  Women's International at Barcelona.  </P> <P> Sanchez, the top-seeded player in the $150,000 tournament, held serve  throughout the first set but faltered early in the second, giving up  consecutive breaks to Cueto, who qualified for the final with an upset over  Mary Joe Fernandez.  </P> <P> But Cueto, who appeared to hurt her left thigh early in the second set, failed  to hold her serve even once, and double-faulted at break point to go down 2-3.  </P> <P> Australian Pat Cash won his first tournament since an injury sidelined him  eight months ago, beating Alex Antonitsch of Austria, 6-3, 6-4, in the Hong  Kong Open.  </P> <P> Cash had nine aces in the 80-minute match and scored repeatedly with strong  attacks at the net that often left Antonitsch stranded on the wrong side of the  court.  </P></p>

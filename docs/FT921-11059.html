			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Syndicated Loans: Middle East deals hold the limelight THE Middle East has emerged as an important source of large syndicated loans over the past year in an otherwise drought-stricken market. The latest Middle Eastern borrower to tap the international loans market is Saudi European Petrochemicals Corporation - or Ibn Zahr - which has launched a Dollars 500m eight-and-a-half-year term loan. The deal follows the huge syndicated loans to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which raised Dollars 4.5bn and Dollars 5.5bn respectively in the international markets last year. Other Middle Eastern deals in preparation include a large loan to Saudi Aramco, the Saudi Arabian oil group, and a large project financing for an MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) plant in Qatar. Kuwait Airways has also been in discussions with bankers recently about financing the purchase of new aircraft since much of its fleet was destroyed in the Iraqi invasion. The Kuwaiti airline signed a Dollars 2bn contract with Airbus last year for up to 24 new aircraft. Bankers in London say there are rumours of a Kuwaiti oil project financing as well. Originally, Ibn Zahr planned to borrow Dollars 600m, but now it has decided to reduce the loan to Dollars 500m, having made some savings on the project costs. The funds are intended to cover two particular projects. The first is the expansion of an existing MTBE facility. The second project is the construction of a polypropylene plant. Both plants are expected to come on stream in 1993. The deal has been underwritten by The National Commercial Bank (the agent), Riyad Bank (the book-runner), Saudi American Bank and Saudi French Bank. The borrower (70 per cent- owned by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation - or Sabic, the Saudi Arabian petrochemical group, which is itself 70 per cent-owned by the Saudi government) carries a full 100 per cent risk weighting for capital adequacy purposes. Bankers say this factor is reflected in the overall pricing on the deal. While the interest margin over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) is relatively tight, the front-end fees are considered generous. Ibn Zahr is paying a margin of 50 basis points over Libor, against the 37.5 basis points the Saudi government is paying on the Dollars 4.5bn syndicated loan launched last May (in the case of the Saudi government, the borrower has a zero risk rating). The front-end fees are 75 basis points for banks lending Dollars 40m, 65 basis points for Dollars 30m, 50 basis points for Dollars 20m, and 40 basis points for Dollars 10m. Less attractive, however, is the commitment fee structure of 25 basis points on available amounts and 12.5 basis on unavailable amounts. Many bankers dislike being paid less on unavailable amounts. They argue that even if the borrower does not use the full loan initially, the banks still have to be prepared to lend the full sum. However, with so many Middle Eastern deals in the pipeline, bankers who dislike this two-tier structure can probably afford to wait for a more attractive loan.</p>

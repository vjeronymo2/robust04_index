			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (10): Exotic menus to suit all tastes - Eating Out: choices abound in Hong Kong, from the entire spectrum of traditional Chinese cuisine to European, American and Japanese restaurants, says David Dodwell TAKE a kilo of fine pacific prawns, still live and succulent. Drop them into a wide bowl filled two inches deep with Madeira wine, and positioned at the centre of the diners' table. Leave the prawns to swim for five minutes or so (making sure to cover the bowl because they thrash around a lot as they drink in the wine). Then lift them from the wine, and drop them into boiling water. Drain and serve, once pink. 'Drunken prawns' will taste like none you ever savoured before  - so long as you still have an appetite after the experience of watching prawns drink themselves to death. Feasting off the beaten track in Hong Kong is not for the faint of heart. But if you don't suffer from squeamishness, it can offer a culinary orgy hard to match anywhere in the world. Expect to eat chicken with the bedraggled head of the chicken staring up from the dish at you. Suckling pig may be displayed before you, glazed chestnut brown, with fruit stuffed in its now-silent snout. Many seafood  - including lobsters, crabs or abalone  - may be brought to the table alive, or still twitching. Sometimes the proprietor will simply be showing you how fresh everything is. Sometimes, he may be leaving it with you for you to cook yourself before it walks off the table. Across the spectrum of regional Chinese cuisines, you can eat Shanghai hairy crab by the dozen in autumn, snake soup throughout the winter months, clay-baked beggar's chicken (a Hangzhou speciality), Peking duck or meat dumplings from the far north of China, or mandarin fish from the lakes in central China along the Yangtze river. As the city has prospered, and locals have become more cosmopolitan, so the spectrum of western cuisines have found a home. French and Japanese restaurants spread across the territory rank among the best (and sometimes the most expensive) in the world. The latest vogue is for regional Italian restaurants, and for Californian cuisine. Some have become so abashed about the sudden rush of Californian-style restaurants, that they are trying somewhat implausibly to set themselves apart as south-western American. Hong Kong's prosperity has also led to soaring restaurant prices. Most foods are imported  - including fresh fish, because local waters are too polluted, and vegetables, which come over the border from China. This of course adds to costs. A meal for two will cost very much the same as it would in London or New York. If it includes steamed fish, or exotic foods like shark's fin, abalone or birds' nest, prices could leave you breathless. Some general tips on eating out might be worth setting out: Many of Hong Kong's best restaurants are in hotels. Unlike hotels in Europe, which often keep guests in solitary splendour, Hong Kong's hotels are frequently at the heart of shopping arcades, and positively encourage local people to come through the doors. When eating Chinese food, try to have at least three of you eating together, and try to ensure a Chinese friend does the ordering. Menus in Chinese restaurants are often written only in Cantonese, and then in such flowery language that it is all but impossible to detect from the name what food is involved. If you have no Chinese friend to hand, do not feel embarrassed walking from table to table with a waiter behind you, pointing over shoulders at dishes you think would appeal to you. In Chinese terms, a good restaurant is a busy one. The best are often close to pandemonium, with a din inside, and milling crowds wait-listed outside. Chinese eaters spit bits of inedible food out onto their plates, burp loudly, and slurp soup. They also use toothpicks with great vigour. Believe it or not, they claim good reasons for all of these unsightly habits, so you should try not to be shocked. Since a table cloth can often be used as a temporary rubbish bin, do not worry about stains, marks or splashes on it. At the end of most robust meals, the table will look like a battlefield. Chinese food, much of it chopped to small pieces, is often much more easily handled by chopsticks than knives and forks, even if you use chopsticks poorly. You lose a lot of 'face' by using western table weapons, so persevere unless you are really starving. Don't bother drinking wine with Chinese food. Wine is expensive in Hong Kong (it is one of the few items to be taxed), and anyway rarely suits the flavours of Chinese cuisine. Instead, drink tea (jasmine or chrysanthemum if you have a fragrant palate, bo lei for something darker and stronger), or beer  - San Miguel is the local brew, but China's Tsingtao is the most flavoursome. Entertaining a client: Choices abound in Hong Kong, both inside and out of hotels. If you opt to eat Chinese food, and a number of guests are Chinese, it is wise to ask one of the Chinese to do the ordering. Otherwise, it is not a bad idea to dine in your own hotel's best Chinese restaurant, asking the head waiter beforehand to concoct a good balanced menu for a particular price per head. If you say you need to impress, the waiter will rarely let you down. Pinpointing favourite restaurants is invidious, but in Central, the Hilton's Eagle's Nest and the Mandarin's Man Wah take some beating. In Kowloon, the Shangri-la's Shang Palace is often praised, as is the Regent's Lai Ching Heen. Near Wanchai, the Island Shangri-la's Summer Palace has many fans, as does the Grand Hyatt's One Harbour Road. Outside hotels, Fook Lam Moon is renowned, as is the Spring Deer in Kowloon (for its Peking duck), and Sun Tung Lok for its shark's fin dishes. Entertaining in a western restaurant will be easier, though many of Hong Kong's more traditional Chinese dislike the heavy north European flavours, often avoid lamb and cheese, and pass on wine - particularly those afflicted with a common Chinese allergy to wine which turns them bright red with less than half a glass. Many of Hong Kong's business elite dine in clubs at lunch time  - like the Hong Kong Club, the Pacific Club, the American Club, the Shanghai Club and the China Club. Some of these clubs have reciprocal relationships with clubs overseas, so if you are a member of a club in your home country, it can be a good idea to check if such reciprocity exists. You could then entertain at one of these clubs, gaining great face, and probably paying less at the same time. The single most popular French restaurant would probably have to be Gaddi's in the Peninsula. Also in Kowloon, the Restaurant de France in the Regal, Margaux at the Shangri-la and Plume in the Regent Hotel would be fierce competitors. On Hong Kong Island, the Mandarin's Pierrot and the Shangri-la's Petrus take some beating, though quiet retreats like La Rose Noire and Cafe de Paris in the Lan Kwai Fung area above Central have loyal followings. Stanley's on the southern side of Hong Kong island is popular for dinner, but too distant to be practical for lunch. For American cuisine, the Bostonian in Kowloon's Ramada Renaissance, and the Verandah in the Peninsula were first to set the standards. Among the Italians, Grissini at the Grand Hyatt, Nicholini at the Conrad, and Capriccio at the Ramada Renaissance, offer delectable north Italian cuisine at sobering prices. Among the Japanese, Tomowa in Causeway Bay has many fans, while the two Nadaman restaurants in the Island and Kowloon Shangri-las, and Genji at the Hilton, have prime locations for entertaining. Power breakfasts: Most prominent hotels provide tables large and secluded enough to manage a useful breakfast meeting. The Mandarin Grill is probably in a league on its own for style as well as convenience. Dim Sum: These chinese 'hors d'oeuvres' can be delicious, and at the same time - to a western palate at least  - disgusting. They are certainly worth trying, and offer a much more nutritious lunch than a Big Mac or Pizza. Many restaurants serve little but dim sum between 11.00 in the morning and 3.00 in the afternoon. They are rowdy places, with diners being served by waitresses pushing trolleys around the restaurant, each trolley specialising in one dim sum or another. Menus are rarely in English. Waitresses rarely have the patience or ability to explain in English what they are offering. If you want to avoid dishes of chickens' feet, marinated tripe or pungent 1,000-year-old eggs, then it is advisable to try such a restaurant firmly alongside a Hong Kong person. Exotica: These should rarely be tried without locals at your side, but can add a memorable dimension to Hong Kong as a gourmet experience. The seafood restaurants at Lei Yue Mun, north east of Kaitak airport, are among the most marvellous in the territory, but are a devil to find. In a labyrinth of streets awash with tanks full of fish, molluscs and crustaceans, diners order seafood directly from the fishmonger, who carries it to the restaurant you are dining in. Snake restaurants in the Western district are popular in winter (snake meat is thought to be heating, and to make a man virile). Throughout the year, locals eat the semi-medicinal turtle jelly to cleanse their blood and improve their complexion. These inconspicuous shops usually have large brass urns at the entrance, which are used to dispense a pungent herbal tea that is supposed to complement the turtle jelly. Molluscs of every conceivable variety can be consumed al fresco in Temple Street night market in Mong Kok. Alternatively, the Lung Wah in Shatin specialises in pigeon  - baked pigeons, pigeon eggs, roasted Shek Ki pigeons, and even steamed pigeon hearts. It serves an average of 2,000 a day, and more than 1m a year.

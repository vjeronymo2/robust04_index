			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Morland wins bitter battle of independence MORLAND, the Thames Valley brewer, yesterday decisively repelled the Pounds 104m hostile bid from Greene King to retain its 280-year-old independence. The Suffolk-based brewer's bid lapsed after it ended a nine-week takeover campaign with control of 45.95 per cent of Morland's shares. Greene King launched its bid in May after buying a 28.5 per cent stake in Morland from the Whitbread Investment Company, which also pledged a further 14.9 per cent. Despite this strong base, Greene King gained less than 4 per cent acceptances from other shareholders at the peak of its assault; and it lost ground in the final days as some Morland shareholders who had accepted the offer withdrew. The outcome hit the shares of both companies - Greene King's closed 40p lower at 467p while Morland's fell 41p to close at 420p. Morland's Abingdon brewery - which Greene King would have closed - celebrated the victory yesterday with a barrel of its Old Speckled Hen ale. Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, chief executive, said: 'We are delighted that shareholders have shown their confidence in us. Now it will be back to business. We intend to put into operation the plans we announced during the campaign which will benefit the company enormously.' The Pounds 16.9m purchase of 72 pubs from Inntrepreneur Estates is expected to be completed next week. The pubs will increase Morland's estate by 25 per cent. A deal will also be clinched with Courage under which the Australian-owned brewer will buy 5,000 barrels of Old Speckled Hen a year and brew 20,000 barrels of its own beers at Abingdon. The move could generate initial pre-tax profits of Pounds 800,000 a year, Mr Clutterbuck said. Greene King, which has been left with a 29.3 per cent stake in Morland, would take time to assess all its options, said Mr Simon Redman, chairman. 'The least attractive option at the moment would be to come back in a year's time with a revised offer.' Greene King intended to continue the expansion of its 800-pub estate and would consider buying a depot in Morland's trading area to push its IPA and Abbot ale brands in the free trade, Mr Redman said. The company will publish its 1991-92 results, which were held up by the Takeover Panel. Whitbread Investment Company will retain its 14.9 per cent shareholding in Morland - the maximum level allowed to enable it to comply with the government's beer orders. It has yet to reduce its stakes in Marston, the Burton-based brewer, and Devenish and Boddington, the pub operators. See Lex</p>

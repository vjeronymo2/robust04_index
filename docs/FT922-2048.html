			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Increased selling pressure hits shares DEPRESSING news from the corporate sector, but this time from overseas, added to the woes of a UK stock market already upset yesterday by a firm rejection overnight from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, of another early cut in domestic interest rates. Later, the chancellor followed his strong line on interest rates with a speech reaffirming the government's commitment to the Maastricht proposals, in particular to economic convergence and to sterling's entry to the narrow bands of the ERM range; the market read this as final rejection of political pressures for an immediate base rates cut. But it was shock waves from Amsterdam, where Philips warned that second-quarter profits would be below the comparable period, that finally upset the UK stock market. Having been 21 Footsie points down in reaction to Mr Lamont's overnight speech, London was rallying successfully towards midsession, halving its early fall and regaining the Footsie 2,606 mark, until the news from Philips threw it into reverse. Share prices moved lower for the rest of the session and the FT-SE 100 Index closed 17.9 down at 2,598.4. The market's view of near-term prospects was fairly gloomy, although most strategists took a cautiously positive view of the day's list of important economic data. The rise of 0.3 per cent in retail sales in May was slightly above expectations, while a 0.2 per cent gain in manufacturing output in April was regarded as an indication of an uptrend in production. 'Today's economic data are consistent with a slow, steady recovery in the economy,' said Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull, UK securities arm of Societe Generale. But he drew attention to further data due this week, led today by wages and unemployment statistics. The international blue chips were held in check yesterday by firmness in sterling, which hurts overseas revenues. On a more domestic level, nervousness was caused again by the prospects of tomorrow's expiry of the June future on the FT-SE Index. Large positions, both bullish and bearish, remain open on the June Footsie contract and prices of the underlying blue chip stocks could be in for heavy and contrasting pressures as the leading securities houses strive to balance positions ahead of Friday's futures expiry deadline. Seaq-reported trading volume remained unimpressive at 423.7m shares, against 391m in the previous session when retail business remained well short of the Pounds 1bn mark regarded as the sign of a healthy equity market. However, traders said that 'some stock came out yesterday'. While not too happy to see the Footsie 2,600 mark so quickly abandoned again, market professionals held to the view that, while share prices may remain uncertain for the near future, the relative value of equities against gilts will provide support. The mildly positive response to yesterday's economic statistics suggested improved confidence but the Philips statement turned the spotlight back on to the corporate sector.</p>

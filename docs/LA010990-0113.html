			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: GANDARA IS THE TOP GUN AT UNIVERSITY  </P> <P> Doug Sorey, girls' basketball coach at University High School, knows the best  way to handle his team's best shooter, Denise Gandara.  </P> <P> He lets her shoot.  </P> <P> "If my team's going to get beat, then I have to get beat with (Gandara)  shooting the ball," Sorey said.  </P> <P> And that hasn't been very often. University is 10-3.  </P> <P> Gandara, The Times' Athlete of the Week, scored 27 points in University's 70-19  victory over Irvine Wednesday, and scored 26 more in a 53-36 victory over  Woodbridge Friday.  </P> <P> But before Gandara can shoot, her teammates have to get her the ball.  University's offense revolves around that task.  </P> <P> "This past summer, we had a girl transfer to our team and she didn't get the  idea," Sorey said. "Finally I had to take her aside and say, 'Throw (Gandara)  the ball.' "  </P> <P> Still, it hasn't been easy. Not only did Sorey have to encourage Gandara's  teammates to throw her the ball, he also had to tell her to shoot it.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of good shooters last year," Gandara said. "I look to shoot  now because I'm the only starter returning from last year."  </P> <P> Gandara was a reluctant shooter last season, but Sorey was confident she would  take the initiative this season.  </P> <P> "I knew Denise would score this year, in part because she had a great summer,"  Sorey said. "In (assistant coach) Bruce Bernal, we have a great offensive  coach. And he's encouraged Denise to shoot the last couple of years because she  was a little reluctant.  </P> <P> "She has the ability to shoot outside, put the ball on the floor and drive, and  to post up. But I didn't dream she would be this successful."  </P> <P> Gandara, a 5-foot-7 senior, does more than shoot, though. She is averaging nine  rebounds a game.  </P> <P> "She's a good offensive rebounder," Sorey said. "She has good quickness, good  leaping ability and good hands. Defensively, she screens out real well."  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Allison Arrendondo of Los Alamitos scored 34 points, 20 in the second half, in  a 50-47 loss to El Dorado Thursday. She had 19 of Los Alamitos' 29 points in a  45-29 loss to Fountain Valley Saturday.  </P> <P> Senior post player Nicole Champion of Orange had 26 points, nine rebounds and  five steals against El Modena Tuesday in a 69-52 victory. She scored 15 points  and had 11 rebounds in 61-35 victory over Sonora Thursday.  </P> <P> Chrissy Coppage had three goals and had three assists to lead Esperanza's  soccer team to a 9-0 victory over Loara Thursday.  </P> <P> Amy Jalewalia had 34 points for La Quinta in a 76-16 victory over Pacifica  Wednesday and had 35 points in a 62-60 overtime victory over Rancho Alamitos  Friday.  </P> <P> Linda Lunceford had five goals to lead Trabuco Hills' soccer team to a 9-0  victory over Bolsa Grande Thursday.  </P> <P> Denise Gandara  </P> <P> University High School  </P> <P> * Position: Forward  </P> <P> * Height, Weight, Class: 5-7, 130, Senior  </P> <P> * Last Week: Gandara scored 27 points and had 13 rebounds in a 70-19 victory  over Irvine Wednesday and added 26 points and 11 rebounds in a 53-36 victory  over Woodbridge Friday.  </P> <P> * Season: Gandara is averaging 22 points and nine rebounds.  </P></p>

Construction is proceeding on Kyoto  Research Park (KRP, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto) where once stood a line of  gas tanks belonging to the Kyoto plant of Osaka Gas. KRP is  attracting attention as the ``heart'' of the ``brain city.''    KRP is a city-type research park of national prominence on  the scale of Kanagawa Science Park (KSP, total floor area  approximately 150,000 square meters) in Kawasaki City. Its  eastern area (total floor area 48,000 square meters) opened in  October 1989 as its first phase.    About fifty organizations are located and active in the  eastern area, in addition to the main business entity fully  funded by Osaka Gas. These include institutions performing  contract research in software and mechatronics, Kyoto Higher  Technology Research Institute and Kyoto Prefecture Small and  Medium-Sized Industry Center, and laboratories of high tech and  start-up companies. The central area is currently under  construction for rental research space, hotels, and convention  facilities. When it is completed in 1997, total floor area will  be 250,000 square meters, making it the largest in Japan.    While Kyoto is a mecca for traditional arts such as Nishijin  textiles and Kiyomizu pottery, it has also produced many  prominent high-tech and start-up companies such as Kyocera,  Omron, and Rohm. Since factors such as rising land prices have  made corporate start-ups more difficult, KRP is emphasizing its  role as an incubator for R&amp;D-based industries by putting  effort  into strengthening capacity for doing research in rented  facilities.    It's not just a matter of gathering research institutions.  ``We would like to offer many capabilities such as  industry-academia exchange, business matchmaking at a global  level, and even consulting on foreign companies' entry into  Japan and on foreign research parks,'' says Hiroshi Endo,  president of KRP.    The International Technology Exchange Center (ITEC) which is  scheduled to be set up in the central area in Spring 1994 will  be the first in Japan to specialize in supporting world-scale  joint ventures and market development. Tenants will include  full-scale venture capital firms, firms that manage databases of  intellectual and industrial property rights, and consulting  companies.    KRP will also be active in an international network of 22  research parks formed upon KRP's initiative. A personal computer  network is being set up for the mutual exchange of information  on the world's high technology and high tech companies. KRP  plans to hold an international research part conference in Kyoto  on the park's fifth anniversary in spring 1994 which will be a  leading event of the 1200th anniversary of the founding of  Kyoto. The goal of the event is to exchange information on  research park management, world market trends, and technology.  Participation from research parks in Europe and the U.S. is  currently being sought.</p>

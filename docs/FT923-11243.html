			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Property: Choppy waters for marina sales - The recession has hit the market for homes with a berth, but David Hoppit finds grounds for optimism THEY TOOK a swampland near Southampton, covered with silt, dug some ditches through it and built some homes around them - and they called it Hythe Marina Village. That was back in 1984 and the idea of a home with a berth at the back door was born. Suddenly, everyone wanted to build by the water: by 1989, there were plans around the UK coast for 40 developments costing a total of Pounds 2bn. Not everyone welcomed the revolution, though. Those not interested in boats, notably the Worldwide Fund for Nature and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, saw development of the nation's mud flats as a threat to the environment. Before the advent of the marina village, the UK's 3m 'boaties' and 'yachties' had to content themselves with a few overcrowded and expensive marinas and estuaries. The concept of the marina village, though already established in areas such as the south of France and Florida, seemed set to revolutionise boat ownership in the UK. Depending upon one's definition of 'boat,' there are between 500,000 and 3m owners in the country. Those unable to live permanently alongside the object of their desire, be it dinghy, sailboard or 50 ft yacht, wanted to leave their London office at 5pm on Friday and be with their vessel in good time for hot toddies and plat du jour. That is one reason why Peter de Savary's marina development in Falmouth, Cornwall, has been so slow to sell - it is too far from the capital to travel for the weekend. The cost of building the marina and infrastructure at Hythe was Pounds 20m. The lock alone cost Pounds 1.5m, coping with double tides with a range of 18 ft. Mooring fees would never repay the price (the pioneers at Brighton Marina discovered that to their cost) and so, with the aid of expensive piling, the houses and apartments were built beside the berths. For a while, the properties sold well. Marina Developments itself constructed four more marina villages to add to its scheme at Hythe. Then the property market sailed into the doldrums - and we have been in recession ever since. In a bubbly market, no property has more froth than a marina home, but prices have gone flat and boats, like houses, have sunk in value. Recessions do not last forever, though, and marina homes could represent good value today. Peter Thompson, acknowledged guru of the marina village, is heading a management buy-out of the housebuilding interests of Marina Developments as the parent company, Yattendon, wants to focus on its core activity of marina ownership and management. 'Sales of homes in genuine marina villages have, in fact, held up quite well despite the recession, but there has been a serious realignment of prices. The desire to own a property with adjacent berth is as strong as ever,' says Thompson. 'At least 90 per cent of our buyers have no material borrowings. They buy their second or retirement home by the water with inherited money or out of personal savings.' The Pounds 17.5m management buy out (or 'buy in' as Thompson prefers to call it) will give the new company about 70 built and unsold properties in the five villages, some 300 plots, plus certain commercial and retail interests. The average price of homes in the next year or two is likely to be about Pounds 200,000, only half that of the 336 flats and houses sold since 1986. So, are marina homes a good buy? Martin Edgar, whose company, Waterside Properties, specialises in (yes) waterside properties, believes they are. 'Environmental and planning restrictions mean that marina homes built today, together with the last few still in the pipeline, represent a finite total number that will be built along this stretch of coast,' he says. Prices are down 35 per cent on two years ago and there might be a further short-term fall back, but he feels there will be profits to be had in the medium term. The temporary glut of property 'at astonishingly low prices' is unlikely to reappear, he believes. (Waterside Properties: 081-542-9599). At the shore of the huge Poole Harbour in Dorset, southern England, not far from the town centre, 60,000 cubic metres of earth was excavated by developer GEMSA to build Moriconium Quay. Now, 100 Mediterranean-style houses and flats are being built there (the name was given to the area by the Romans in AD 45). Each house will have a wet berth. Flats will have a dry berth, operated by a fork-lift truck and paid for out of the annual maintenance and security charge of Pounds 1,550 a unit. Despite a rather unprepossessing approach, these are excellent homes with generous room sizes. Savills is selling the houses and apartments. The houses, from Pounds 285,000, have four bedrooms plus a ground floor yachting room. Smaller flats will be built later; those available now are large (2,300 sq ft) and cost Pounds 450,000. One great advantage of this marina, opened recently by yachtswoman Clare Francis, is that the tides permit easy 24-hour access without lock gates. Many of the big house-building companies also have dipped their toes into the marina business. Barratt is no exception, having recently completed 277 homes at the 110-berth St Peter's Marina Village in Newcastle, northern England. This is the first purpose-built marina on the Tyne and is close to the city centre. Houses and flats remaining are priced between Pounds 90,000 and Pounds 121,500. Laing Homes is proud of the town houses at its West Quay Marina in Yeading, near London; moorings are available for buyers and there is also a 100 per cent part exchange scheme and a 9.5 per cent mortgage. Houses there cost from just under Pounds 130,000; apartments from around Pounds 58,000. Houses fit for most wallets are being built by Charles Church at Avonmere Marina, in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, by the Kennet and Avon Canal. The first phase of houses and flats costing between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 150,000 has sold out; work is now progressing on the next phase. The same builder has found a formula for beating recession in Richmond, south-west London, where its waterside homes at Richmond Bridge have attracted enormous interest - since Easter, 14 reservations have been made. The 124 houses and flats in the first phase cost between Pounds 122,000 and Pounds 675,000. Hunting Gate Homes, which has an interesting marina development in London's Limehouse Basin, also is selling homes to people with a passion for water sports at St Lawrence Bay, in Essex. The houses and bungalows, some with gardens sloping down to the River Blackwater, are close to the new Bradwell Marina. Prices are between Pounds 72,950 and Pounds 115,450. Not far away, at Burnham-on-Crouch, one of the country's top yachting centres, is the new 350-berth Burnham Yacht Harbour with 42-year leases starting in price at just under Pounds 20,000 for an eight-metre boat. Nearby, there is a splendid development of houses and flats beside the river at King's Wharf. Prices, through Savills with Bairstow Eves, range from Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 245,000, so there is something for most pockets. The market in marina property might be dormant at the moment but there are plenty of people still dreaming of oiling the pintle and sailing into the offing. A fair breeze might not be long coming.</p>

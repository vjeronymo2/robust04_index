			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bankers fail to see trading room joke - Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board is on the defensive There is a joke told in the dealing rooms of Frankfurt which explains the debacle at Metallgesellschaft, the German metals, mining and industrial group which came to the brink of collapse last month. Bankers, it is said, only read the documents pertaining to the companies where they are supervisory members when they are being driven to supervisory board meetings. This happens four times a year, and normally there is an hour or more to look through the papers on the journey from Frankfurt. However, because Metallgesellschaft's head office is only 200 metres away from Deutsche Bank's own headquarters in the heart of Frankfurt, the bankers never had time to read the documents - hence it's really no surprise that the group nearly went bust. The joke encapsulates the widely-held view that supervisory board members do not take their responsibilities for overseeing a company's affairs seriously, a view which Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director who is also chairman of the Metallgesellschaft supervisory board, did his utmost to rebut yesterday. Addressing thousands of shareholders at Metallgesellschaft's extraordinary meeting, convened to approve the DM3.4bn (Dollars 2bn) rescue plan agreed with banks last month, Schmitz defended his own actions since taking over as chairman of the the supervisory board in March last year. Criticism has focused on the fact that the supervisory board failed to prevent an explosion in oil futures business at Metallgesellschaft's US-based MG Corp subsidiary. The speculative business gave rise to losses of DM2.3bn, which drove the group to the brink of bankruptcy. In a confident, forthright performance, Mr Schmitz laid the blame for the debacle with Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the group's former chief executive, and with Mr Meinhard Forster, the former finance director, both of whom were sacked at Mr Schmitz's initiative on December 17 last year. Giving an unusual level of detail about the relationship between the supervisory board chairman and the management board, Mr Schmitz said he intensified supervision of Mr Schimmelbusch to extraordinary levels, as shown by his initial unwillingness to prolong his contract as chief executive. His scepticism was based on the group's poor operating performance, he explained. Far from 'going to sleep', as critics have alleged, Mr Schmitz portrayed himself as bringing a high degree of activism to the job. He said he held 11 one-to-one meetings with Mr Schimmelbusch during 1993, and that the group's weaknesses were systematically addressed at a further 19 meetings involving the supervisory board and other committees. KPMG, the group's auditor, was appointed in the summer to examine the risks inherent in MG Corp's trading activities, and Mr Schmitz held talks with Mr Schimmelbusch as early as April 1993 about controlling, 'including the question of risk management in trading'. Mr Schmitz said the first he had heard from Mr Schimmelbusch about liquidity problems at MG Corp was on December 3. Before then, 'the information supplied by the management board was, as it later transpired, incomplete and untrue as regards to the risks from the oil transactions'. The risks were clearly hidden from other members of the management board, Mr Schmitz said. 'Evidently not all members (of the management board) were appraised of the situation,' he said. Even his argument that documents were falsified was not enough to win over Mr Herbert Hansen, a representative of small shareholders who spoke after Mr Schmitz had finished. He asked, incredulously, whether an even bigger disaster had to take place 'before anything happened to a member of a supervisory board'. He said Mr Schmitz and all the other representatives of capital (as opposed to labour) on the board should resign. For Mr Schmitz, resignation is clearly out of the question. He maintained yesterday that the supervisory board had done more than could have been expected of it, under the circumstances, and that without its prompt and unprecedented action in ousting Mr Schimmelbusch and his boardroom colleagues, Metallgesellschaft would definitely have gone bankrupt. Moreover, the 'German system' of close relations between industry and banks had proved itself. 'Without the stability and strength of the shareholder banks and major shareholders, Metallgesellschaft would be undergoing insolvency proceedings and criticism of the banks would then be even louder,' Mr Schmitz claimed. It was possible to learn something from Anglo-American best practice - in future, the Deutsche Bank would consider introducing a form of 'audit committee' for the companies in which it has a major stake, he said. However, an audit committee would not have prevented the Metallgesellschaft case, Mr Schmitz insisted.</p>

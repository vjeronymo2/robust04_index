			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Slick and scarcely subtle but undeniably potent, Steven Spielberg's 1975 Jaws  (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) builds single-mindedly to its big, scary climax  involving that awesome shark. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss  star.  </P> <P> Curiously, that description of Jaws fits Fatal Attraction (CBS Sunday at 9  p.m.) if you simply substitute shark for Glenn Close, the woman with whom  Michael Douglas has a brief affair only to discard her at enormous peril to  himself and his family. The trouble with this 1989 blockbuster is that  everything is loaded so heavily against the Close character from frame one that  the effect is repellent in the utmost.  </P> <P> A two-part miniseries, "The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake," (NBC  Sunday at 9 p.m., concluding Monday at 9 p.m.) stars Joanna Kerns as a  seismologist who is sure the 'Big One' is about to hit. Also stars Dan Lauria  and Ed Begley Jr.  </P> <P> Call Me Anna (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) stars Patty Duke in a new TV movie of her  harrowing autobiography.  </P> <P> Jagged Edge (Channel 11 Monday at 8 p.m.) may vanish from memory like an old  grocery list, but while you're in it you're caught, held all the way by this  hit 1985 suspense thriller in which San Francisco attorney Glenn Close defends  Jeff Bridges, accused of murdering his newspaper-heiress wife.  </P> <P> In the 1989 Uncle Buck (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), writer-director John Hughes  fuses his two genres of choice: the clashing family members comedy and the  tortured teen pic, with predictable results. John Candy, the titular behemoth,  is an eccentric relative from blue collar hell who's called in to baby-sit his  three stuffed-shirt brother's kids.  </P> <P> The Border (Channel 13 Wednesday at 10 a.m.), absorbingly directed by Tony  Richardson, is the most unjustly neglected picture of the career of Jack  Nicholson. It takes a compassionate look at the plight of illegal aliens along  the U.S.-Mexican border, and Nicholson plays a border patrolman increasingly  disaffected with his job of forcing Mexicans back to their side of the Rio  Grande.  </P> <P> Rocky is back (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), with Rocky II Thursday and the  dreadful Rocky IV on Friday. Why not "Rocky III," which is pretty good?  </P> <P> Airing opposite Rocky II Thursday (8 p.m. on Channel 13) is the lurid, mindless  1986 Stallone hard-action picture Cobra.  </P> <P> Bill Murray sends up the Army in the 1981 Stripes (Channel 13 Friday at 8  p.m.), a raucous summer refreshment that's amiably silly and unmistakably aimed  at 18-year-olds (but you may finds yourself laughing along with the kids).  </P> <P> There's plenty of classic vintage fare airing Saturday evening: the original  King Kong (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 p.m.); The Hustler (Channel 9 Saturday at 8  p.m.), with Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason and Piper Laurie; a film noir double  feature on Channel 28, Murder, My Sweet (at 9 p.m.) and D.O.A. (at 10:30 p.m.),  and one of the greatest of all British comedies, The Ladykillers (Channel 9  Saturday at 11 p.m.).  </P></p>

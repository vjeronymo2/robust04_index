			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Move to implement EU insurance rules British insurers should be able to operate more competitively across Europe under draft regulations to be introduced by July, Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday. He announced draft legislation designed to bring UK law in line with the EU's directives for a single market for insurance. The directives will make the home country of any insurer its regulator wherever it operates within the EU. The draft legislation includes requirements for additional disclosure on derivative contracts, shareholder controllers and valuations.</p>

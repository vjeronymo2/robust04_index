			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Greek economy's convergence plan, made  public by National Economy Minister Ioannis Papandoniou,  provides for a decrease in expenditures and an increase in  revenues. The plan has entered the process of approval by the  EU [European Union] Commission. Papandoniou dismissed rumors to  the contrary and stressed that through the five years of the  plan, real wages and pensions will experience a positive  increase. Correspondent Mimi Spiropoulou has the following  report.    [Begin Spiropoulou recording] National Economy Minister  Ioannis Papandoniou announced the basic directions of the  amended convergence plan and stressed that the plan includes  policies that aim for social justice and economic growth, and  that reflect the economic philosophy of the PASOK [Panhellenic  Socialist Movement] government. The plan's philosophy provides  for gradual acceleration of the rate of the GNP [Gross National  Product] from 1.1 percent this year to 2.6 percent by 1997 and  3.5 percent by 1999. As is known, the minister stressed, the  fiscal handling by New Democracy led to surpassing the deficit  of the state budget by thousands [as heard] of drahmas in  relation to the goal. That represented an excess of 5 percent  of the GNP. In general, the convergence plan provides that from  1996, there will be a clear trend toward decreasing the ratio of  the public deficit to the GNP. The convergence plan also puts  emphasis on the fiscal adjustment that will result from an  increase in revenues and a decrease in expenditures. However,  the government ruled out the possibility of new taxes. The  increase of revenues will come from direct and indirect taxes.  The national economy minister stressed that, regarding new  hiring in the public sector, there is a commitment for a drastic  decrease. On the other hand, the limitation on the public  deficit will be facilitated by the 150 billion drahmas that will  be available annually from the sale of shares of DEKO [Public  Firms and Organizations]. The sale of OTE [Greek  Telecommunications Company] and DEP [Public Petroleum  Corporation] shares on the stock market is planned for 1994.  Regarding inflation, the convergence plan aims for a decrease  by 2.5 percent annually on average, ending with 5.9 percent in  1999 down from 10.8 percent which is the figure today. [passage  omitted] [end recording]    Former National Economy Minister Stefanos Manos criticized  the process with which the convergence plan was submitted.  Furthermore, Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras said at  Thessaloniki Airport that the convergence plan is an austerity  program.    [Begin recording] [Manos] They [the government] will be  discussing it with the Europeans and they do not show it to us.  Today they present it as if they had agreed on it with the  foreigners.    [Samaras] In the next few days we will submit a plan for  convergence through growth. Without dialogue, the government  today submitted a convergence plan, unfortunately through  austerity again. [end recording]    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that the Greek  economy's convergence plan does not include any surprises, but  it represents a systematization and confirmation of the already  implemented fiscal and tax policy. He stressed that there was a  need to draw up a new convergence plan, because the previous one  drawn up by New Democracy was impossible to implement and did  not lead anywhere. The spokesman also said that New Democracy's  reaction yesterday was unjustified, improvised, contradictory  and politically motivated. Venizelos said that New Democracy  should have had the wisdom to wait and study the convergence  plan before opening wounds for which it is responsible. He  stressed that it is not enough to say one supports the national  economy, but it is necessary to put one's plan into effect too.</p>

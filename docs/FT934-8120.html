			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Business and the Environment: Driving force behind a tale of two cities - David Lascelles visits Freiburg and Oxford which have both adopted different solutions to the problems of heavy traffic Oxford in England and Freiburg in Germany have much in common. Both are important university cities with some industry attached. Both have a unique heritage of architecture and culture and in both places the environment poses big issues, particularly where traffic is concerned. But there, the similarities end. Walk through Freiburg's historic city centre and there is not a car in sight. The entire old city has been pedestrianised. Access is allowed only to trams which glide noiselessly down the cobbled streets and to bicycles. The place is orderly and unblemished, almost like Disneyland. Walk down Oxford High Street and the place is a mayhem of buses, exhaust and noise. Vehicles and pedestrians jostle at the crossings; the place throbs with life. Why is it so different? The answers provide a revealing object lesson not just about well-known features of the British and German character, but also the very different ways they organise their communities. By coincidence, Freiburg and Oxford both started to address their traffic problems seriously in the same year, 1973. That was when Freiburg pedestrianised the first section of the old city and Oxford launched a park-and-ride scheme to reduce city centre traffic. Freiburg, in south-west Germany, was fortunate to have space alongside the old city wall to build an inner ring road, making pedestrianisation much easier. Oxford did not, and its attempt to create one across Christ Church Meadow sparked a national controversy. Freiburg voted in a 'green' city council which took aggressive steps to deal with traffic. The objective was to remove all cars and lorries from the centre. This was complemented by heavy investment in the public transportation system and in a network of bicycle lanes. Today, few Freiburgers live more than a few minutes' walk from a bus or a tram stop and there are more than 400km of bicycle lanes, many of them away from the road. The driving force behind Freiburg's traffic plan is Peter Heller, a youthful deputy mayor who carries the title of environmental mayor. For him, the battle against the car is not merely a transport issue, but part of a wider environmental campaign for more sensible use of resources. He is trying to encourage new housing developments which do away with the need for transport  -everything would be to hand. Oxford, by contrast, has been unable to pedestrianise the city centre for a number of reasons, partly political. The highway authority for the city is the county council which has been deadlocked between Tory-led, out-of-town opponents of traffic schemes and supporters of the Labour-led city council's desire to banish the car. But there were also practical problems. There was no inner ring road, so closing the city centre would only push traffic into suburban residential streets. Most of Oxford's effort, therefore, has gone into the park-and-ride scheme which is already the largest in the country and will be expanded to a capacity of more than 3,600 cars by the end of this year. Although people grumble about it, use of the scheme is growing by 10 per cent a year, which has made a noticeable impact on car numbers. The level of traffic in Oxford has remained almost constant for 15 years. Some effort has been put into bicycle lanes as well and recently the city launched an experimental electric bus service in co-operation with Southern Electricity, the local utility. However, the political balance on the county council shifted in the last elections. The anti-city component was weakened, leaving the city council in a stronger position to tackle the traffic problem in a more fundamental way. The county commissioned a study from Colin Buchanan, the leading traffic consultant, and this now forms the basis of a Pounds 17m-Pounds 18m plan to ease congestion over a period of five years. The plan will involve investing more in public transport and bicycle lanes, reducing city-centre parking spaces by up to 10 per cent, closing the high street and making a variety of environmental improvements. The plan won support from 70 per cent of the people of Oxford in a recent survey. But it needs government approval for the spending and that is far from certain. As this tale of two cities shows, the points of contrast are stark. First, Freiburg managed to achieve the political consensus to take action much more quickly than Oxford. Although Freiburg city council is evenly divided between three parties, the right-wing CDU, the socialist SPD and the Greens, they support a common objective in this area. Oxford was hobbled not just by inter-party rivalry but also by city-county conflict, although that may now be changing. Eva Barnes, Labour environment spokesperson on the county council, says: 'It's been a travesty for a heritage city. But I think there's support from all four parties to pursue most of these measures now.' John Tanner, chairman of the city's highways and traffic committee, agrees. 'There's been a sea change in attitudes right across the parties,' he says. Nor did Oxford have someone in Heller's position to push through an environmental master plan, though it does now have a city centre manager, Martin Wright, on a two-year secondment from Marks and Spencer. When Oxford applied to Whitehall for the traffic scheme grant it prepared the required cost and benefit analysis. But for the first time, this measured the benefits in terms of the non-car user rather than the motorist. For once, a traffic scheme was intended to benefit the pedestrian, the tourist and the atmosphere. Second, Freiburg had the money to finance the heavy investment in public transport which is essential to replace the car. This year, the city will pour a subsidy of DM30m (Pounds 12m) into transport. It can afford to do this because it owns the local gas and electricity utilities from whom it creams off profits for cross-subsidisation. Thus Freiburgers pay more than necessary for their home heating in order to have a good tram service (which has the additional beneficial effect of encouraging them to heat their homes more efficiently). Oxford will this year spend a mere Pounds 300,000 to subsidise city transport. And its ability to finance the Buchanan plan in full depends largely on central government approval because it has few other sources of funds. On the other hand, the bus services on the park-and-ride scheme are close to making a profit, although the more successful they become, the more the council loses city centre parking revenue, one of its few extra sources of income. Third, Freiburg owns the public transport system in the region and can therefore make it do exactly what it wants. In Oxford, the bus system was privatised in 1986. This initially led to a chaotic growth in bus numbers. It has now settled down, but the various bus companies are reluctant to co-operate. In Freiburg, people can buy a single, heavily subsidised 'green' ticket which entitles them to use the whole regional transportation system. In Oxford there is no cross-ticketing and, according to city officials, unlikely to be in the foreseeable future. All this suggests that Freiburg is much better organised than Oxford, which it evidently is. But is there more to it than meets the eye? Interestingly, the traffic profiles of the two cities are not as different as might be expected. In both, the proportion of people-journeys made by motor vehicles is exactly the same: 47 per cent. And in Oxford, public transport's share is much higher than Freiburg's (40 per cent versus 26 per cent). Oxford only falls behind with the bicycle (12 per cent versus 27 per cent). One reason why Oxford does well is that it has a relatively low level of car ownership. Ernst von Weizsacker, an environmental specialist at the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy, also says Freiburg's high standards are being achieved to some extent at the expense of the surrounding region; traffic is being pushed elsewhere and the city's high costs are burdening the poorer rural communities nearby. 'They are cherry-picking,' he says. Oxford, by contrast, might be said to have paid the price for leaving the centre accessible to motorists from outside the city. Nor is there much awareness among the people of Freiburg about the level of cross-subsidisation. 'Most of them don't even know about it,' says Uli Hohmann, the editor of the local public radio. However, he doubts that there would be opposition to the arrangement, even if it was more widely debated. Freiburgers would support an even tougher environmental policy, for example in energy efficiency, he says. However, it is clear that Freiburg's standards depend on a level of co-operation that would be inconceivable in the UK: between political parties, between council and utilities, and within the transportation system. Oxford might achieve greater political coherence if it became a unitary authority under proposed local government reforms. But the privatisation of bus and utility services means it will never have control of key municipal levers like Freiburg.  -------------------------------------------------------------- OXFORD                                                 FREIBURG  -------------------------------------------------------------- 120,000                    Population                   190,000 Pounds 300,000             Subsidy for                    DM30m                            public transport*       (Pounds 12m) 40 percent                 Car ownership             53 percent             PROPORTION OF PEOPLE-JOURNEYS MADE BY: 47 percent                 Motor vehicles            47 percent 40 percent                 Public transport          26 percent 12 percent                 Bicycle                   27 percent  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

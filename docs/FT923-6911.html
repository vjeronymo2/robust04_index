			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Bangladesh strike sees clashes Police yesterday fired tear gas and used truncheons on pickets during a 12-hour opposition-led strike in Bangladesh called to protest against the shooting of an opposition member of parliament, Reuter reports from Dhaka. Clashes erupted when police staved off a group of activists trying to set fire to a government bus plying in central Dhaka in defiance of the strike call, a police official said. In another incident, police fired tear gas on pickets who hurled fire-bombs at them, he said. Shops, banks, offices and factories across the country stayed shut and streets in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi were empty during the 12-hour shutdown, officials said.</p>

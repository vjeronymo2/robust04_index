			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS NOTE GROWING PERIL FROM CLIENTS  </P> <P> Social worker Kathleen Kott recalls the time a psychotic woman came at her with  a butcher knife.  </P> <P> Kott, an Orange County mental health worker, was interviewing the woman to  determine whether she needed to be hospitalized. Kott looked away a moment to  phone for an ambulance, then looked up to see the client charging her.  </P> <P> "She was moving the knife slowly from side to side," said Kott, who wrestled  the weapon from the woman's grasp.  </P> <P> Psychologist Michael Foust remembers the day he was working at the county's  Santa Ana mental health clinic when a patient reported to a small anteroom for  a psychological test, calmly took out a gun and shot herself in the head.  </P> <P> Nearly two years later, the incident still shocks him -- not just that it  happened but because he knows how much worse it could have been. "Potentially  she could have used the gun on any one of us," Foust said softly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Incidents on Minds  </P> <P> Recent incidents in Los Angeles County, including one in February when mental  health worker Robbyn Panitch was stabbed 31 times and killed by a patient, have  mental health workers in neighboring Orange County worried that violence could  strike them too.  </P> <P> Administrators are discussing installing hidden alarms in each of their eight  outpatient clinics. They are also beefing up staff training in how to calm  agitated patients, adding a seminar this summer in crisis intervention and "how  to defuse an explosive situation."  </P> <P> The issue of mental health workers' safety has drawn statewide concern.  Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) has introduced a bill that requires  county mental health agencies to draft a security plan. In the absence of such  a plan, the bill says, county workers may refuse to meet with a potentially  dangerous client.  </P> <P> And, troubled by the Panitch slaying, the state mental health director, Michael  D. O'Connor, recently urged county mental health agencies to work with employee  unions to improve their training in preventing assaultive behavior.  </P> <P> The hope is to make a potentially dangerous job less dangerous. Attacks on  workers are rare, mental health officials say; most mentally ill people are not  a threat to anyone but themselves.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increasingly Volatile  </P> <P> But around Southern California, county mental health administrators and  psychiatric technicians alike acknowledge that the people they treat -- usually  people too poor to afford private therapy -- are increasingly volatile.  </P> <P> "We're dealing with people here who've been through state hospitals, who are  off medication . . . hard to handle," said Alan V. Albright, an Orange County  mental health coordinator who is in charge of staff training. "It's not like  we're in private practice and can pick and choose who we treat."  </P> <P> Lately, many of the county's clients are homeless and mentally ill.  </P> <P> And some of the patients who visit county outpatient clinics have carried guns,  knives -- or, in one December, 1987, incident, a homemade hand grenade.  </P> <P> So administrators are quick to acknowledge that a mental health worker could be  killed in Orange County too.  </P> <P> "I always live in the nightmare of what happened" in Los Angeles County, said  Timothy P. Mullins, Orange County mental health director. "It's going to happen  somewhere, sometime. . . . We do not run clients through metal detectors. We  haven't yet reached that state of siege."  </P> <P> Agreed Douglas C. Barton, deputy mental health director: "These things can  happen anywhere in L.A. or San Diego -- or Santa Ana. We have a very similar  patient population in our mentally disabled homeless."  </P> <P> Part of their problem in treating these difficult patients, Barton and other  experts on mental health explained, has come from frequent budget cuts for  mental health as well as a major policy shift in treating the mentally ill.  </P> <P> In the 1950s, schizophrenic, manic-depressive and other seriously mentally ill  patients were held in state mental hospitals. But in the early 1960s, new  anti-psychotic drugs allowed many of these people to make a remarkable  recovery. In addition, legislation discouraged "warehousing" mental patients  and freed them from mental hospitals to be cared for in their communities.  </P> <P> But local officials contend that they were never prepared for the seriously  disturbed patients who came home.  </P> <P> "Twenty years ago, these patients would not be treated in Orange County,"  Barton said. "They would be in state hospitals."  </P> <P> But local mental health professionals cannot send many of the chronically ill  patients back to state hospitals because some of the facilities have closed  over the last two decades. "Twenty years ago, we had 30,000 beds available for  civil commitment. Now we have only 2,500 beds available for civil commitment,"  Barton noted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $200-Million Cut Vowed  </P> <P> And the coming fiscal year could be worse, Barton predicted. Because if Gov.  George Deukmejian does not get the budget he wants, he has threatened a  $200-million cut in all mental health funds -- about a $13-million cut to  Orange County mental health.  </P> <P> In this tense fiscal environment, there is not a lot of money to spend on  hidden alarms or security guards.  </P> <P> Although concerned about safety, the county's mental health professionals  stress that they also want to balance that with preserving the "therapeutic  environment" of a clinic.  </P> <P> "Perhaps it's negligent of us, but we don't routinely inquire if people are  carrying weapons," Foust said. "The whole nature of this business is trying to  engender some kind of safety or trust" between therapist and patient.  </P> <P> For that reason also, some mental health workers react with horror to the  suggestion that perhaps they should carry guns. And some workers say they don't  want sheriff's deputies or security guards at their clinic.  </P> <P> There is one exception, however. Foust's Santa Ana clinic has two armed  sheriff's deputies on guard during work hours -- but they are there because the  neighborhood, along 17th Street near Bristol Street, is regarded as a  high-crime area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warning Buzzers  </P> <P> The county's seven other out-patient clinics are "wide open -- there's minimal  security," Barton said. The Fullerton and Anaheim clinics do have a warning  buzzer in some, but not all, offices; otherwise there are no alarms.  </P> <P> But working with or without guards and alarms, workers say they have learned  through experience to treat each client with caution.  </P> <P> They speak of counseling clients with the office door open so neither the  worker nor the client is "trapped." They say they alert co-workers to walk  frequently past the door when they are counseling a difficult patient.  </P> <P> Veteran social workers Kott and Aurora Young say they wear comfortable clothing  so they can run from a client if they have to. "We dress so we can move --  loose clothing and not real high heels," Kott said.  </P> <P> They and other workers also speak of learning to stay calm, to let an angry  patient "ventilate."  </P> <P> Always, they say, a therapist must be alert to the patient's mental state,  because to relax and daydream can be dangerous.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'You Could Lose a Finger'  </P> <P> Working in county mental health is "like being in a factory job where if you  don't pay attention you could lose a finger," psychologist Foust said.  </P> <P> Agreed psychologist Douglas Schiebel: "The key element is to be very aware of  who's in the waiting room, be open to cues of agitation. The most fatal mistake  is to ignore someone who is agitated. That will push them over."  </P> <P> But it is hard to stay cool when the patient in front of you is also  threatening to kill you, clinical social worker Ralph DeMarco said. "You have  your stomach churning. As a professional, we often practice denial -- that this  is not going to happen."  </P> <P> Psychologist Edward Oliver recalls one street-wise patient who sat down in  front of him and said: "What do I have to do to get put in a long-term hospital  -- kill you?"  </P> <P> "I think I just kept talking to him," Oliver said. "I put him in a  board-and-care home."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confident About Safety  </P> <P> Ironically, confidence about safety was expressed by several workers in the  county's emergency hold facility, which is for patients who are homicidal,  suicidal or so disordered that they must be legally detained. But then, these  employees work in a locked ward where they can place a patient in restraints or  inject calming medications, whether the patients agree with that or not.  </P> <P> "I think it is pretty safe," said nurse Barbara Murillo, service chief of the  unit. "Not that we let our guard down for a moment." Murillo said she continued  to work at the unit during a recent pregnancy, and "I did my share of holding  feet, holding arms" when patients were placed in restraints.  </P> <P> One of the most dangerous situations, many workers said, is outside the locked  unit and outside the clinics, during field evaluations.  </P> <P> In this situation, one or two mental health workers respond to a report that  someone is deranged -- and might need to be hospitalized. (Under Section 51-50  of the state Welfare and Institutions Code, a person can be hospitalized  against his will for 72 hours if a designated mental health worker declares him  "gravely disabled" because of a mental condition, or a danger to himself or  others.)  </P> <P> Because calls to evaluate suspected "51-50s" can be unpredictable, the workers  often call police to back them up. But sometimes they are on their own.  </P> <P> Some of the most dramatic accounts of abuse, threats and even attacks on mental  health workers come from field evaluations. Kott was menaced with the butcher  knife on an evaluation. Schiebel once answered a call at a "lovely home" in  Laguna Hills and discovered the distraught homeowner inside, brandishing a tire  iron.  </P> <P> Tony Giusti, a nurse who works out of the Santa Ana clinic, counsels patients  but also performs most of the clinic's field evaluations several days a week.  </P> <P> After doing this for three years, he said, he doesn't think the work is that  dangerous. Still, he acknowledged, "when I was a rookie in this field, bad  things happened all the time. I've had my brains knocked in. I've been hit,  kicked, bit."  </P> <P> But these days, Giusti tries to prepare as much as he can for each evaluation.  Also, he said, "I know how to remain calm, how to talk in a calm soothing  voice" even when clients "get in my face and maintain a threatening posture."  </P> <P> A young man with a ready sense of humor, Giusti dresses casually for his calls.  Although he carries a leather briefcase full of paper work for ordering  involuntary hospitalizations, he often goes on his calls dressed in jeans, a  T-shirt and perhaps a bulky sweater.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Delusional' Woman  </P> <P> He answered a call last week about a "delusional" young woman at the main  courthouse in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The woman, a blonde with dirt-smudged bare feet, was sitting near a county  information kiosk. She had been passing notes to county marshals that said:  "God has his own timing.. . . The reason for fear God is the perfect."  </P> <P> The marshals and Giusti didn't think the notes made any sense.  </P> <P> Giusti wanted to talk to the woman to determine whether the rest of her life  made sense. "Sometimes as we know them more, they get a little more flaky," he  said.  </P> <P> The blonde laughed and talked freely to Giusti. She said she had just gotten  out of jail and was waiting for her husband's attorney to meet her. She said  she could have $100,000 cash if she wanted it. Yes, she was sleeping well. No,  she didn't want to see a doctor, she said, explaining: "Today's food technology  is going to be tomorrow's doctor."  </P> <P> Giusti was joined by another mental health worker, Wilbert Jacobs, who offered  the woman a bed in a nearby shelter. She accepted, then suddenly walked away  from them, hopped on an escalator and disappeared.  </P> <P> Jacobs and Giusti debated whether she was sick enough to be held in the county  emergency unit. Jacobs didn't think so. But Giusti thought she was getting  "more grandiose" in her thoughts the longer she talked. He and Jacobs found the  woman again as she emerged from an upper-floor restroom. Now, however, she  wasn't interested in the shelter; she was determined to wait for the attorney.  </P> <P> Giusti made his decision to hold the woman after calling the office of the  attorney she had named and learning from an office worker that the lawyer was  not coming for her.  </P> <P> "I'm going to go ahead and pick her up," Giusti said.  </P> <P> To head off a struggle or an attempt to flee, Giusti alerted the county  marshals that he was going to hospitalize the woman, then asked her to step  over to their booth. When she obediently walked into a small office inside the  kiosk, a marshal stepped in front of the door, blocking it. Giusti informed  her: "At this point you are not free to leave."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I'm a Free Person'  </P> <P> The woman rebelled. "I'm a free person and I don't take drugs," she said  angrily.  </P> <P> Giusti began quietly calling for an ambulance and filling out his 51-50 forms  as the woman, resigned to being detained, sat quietly in the marshal's office.  </P> <P> "We initially tried to get her some shelter but as we stayed with her longer,  she kind of deteriorated," Giusti said. He called her "gravely disabled"  because she was barefoot, had no way of obtaining food and shelter, and had  "grandiose" thoughts.  </P> <P> The young woman was silent as a marshal led her to a waiting ambulance. But as  she climbed aboard a stretcher, she yelled at Giusti, "You guys ripped me off!"  and then cursed him.  </P> <P> Giusti merely shrugged. "I've been damned to eternity. It's the third time this  week. She's not happy but she handled it better than most people do."  </P></p>

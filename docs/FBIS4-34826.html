			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli has strongly  criticized the Argentine Senate's statement on the legal  proceedings of the trial of former Venezuelan President Carlos  Andres Perez. Burelli believes the Argentine parliament has no  right to interfere in Venezuelan affairs. Vicente Briceno  reports:    [Briceno] As the foreign minister left the special Council  of  Ministers meeting at Miraflores Palace, he said the branches of  the Venezuelan Government have properly handled the case of  former President Perez. Despite the Argentine Senate's  statement, he said Venezuela will not break relations with the  Argentine Government, because the Senate issued that statement,  not the executive branch. He also said Venezuela will not send a  protest note to Argentina, because the Venezuelan diplomatic  delegation in that country handles these types of statements by  expressing regret over them.    [Begin Burelli recording] The government branches have  seriously and flawlessly handled Perez's case. Congress, in its  own right, and the judicial branch have intervened in the case,  thus allowing the former president to enjoy the rights to which  he is entitled. The process has been so impeccable that Perez's  own party had expelled him as the judicial branch made a  decision. The Venezuelan Senate and state would never dare give  opinions on decisions that foreign governments have made. [end  recording]    [Briceno] Burelli again broached the controversial case of  the Haitians who will reportedly be granted asylum in Venezuela,  a case which has triggered opposing opinions in the executive  cabinet. He has said that only those Haitians whom the  government has approved will be granted asylum and that our  embassy will select them. The exact number of these Haitians has  yet to be determined, however.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Big TV networks can own cable THE Federal Communications Commission yesterday announced that it would allow the three traditional US television networks - NBC, CBS and ABC - to own cable TV systems, subject to conditions. This ends a 22-year ban. The agency prohibited cross-ownership of cable and broadcast networks in 1970, when the networks dominated home viewing and the FCC feared they would trample on the fledgling cable industry. Since then, however, the networks have suffered a sharp decline in their share of the national audience as viewers have switched to cable. The FCC first raised the possibility of relaxing the ban in 1982, but met strong political opposition. It revived the idea last December. The new ruling includes safeguards to allay the fears of local broadcasting stations, not owned by the networks, which fear financially ruinous competition. The networks would not be permitted to own cable systems serving more than 10 per cent of homes nationally and 50 per cent of homes in a local market served by only one cable company.</p>

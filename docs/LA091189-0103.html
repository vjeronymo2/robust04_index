			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> 'Mahagonny' Opera -- In Saturday's Calendar, two inadvertently transposed lines  altered quotes about director Jonathan Miller by singers Marvellee Cariaga and  Louis Lebherz. Cariaga said, "He's infectious" and admires him . . . "for  letting us bring in our own ideas." Lebherz said, "Jonathan helped me out with  the verbal image. He talked about the wooden cob-webbed cog that began to turn  in my brain and how everything developed from that."  </P></p>

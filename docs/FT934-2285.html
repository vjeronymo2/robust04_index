			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / EU banks warned on money transfers People ought to be able to transfer money from one European Union country to another more quickly and cheaply, to subscribe to a foreign newspaper or buy goods by mail order, the European Commission said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. And it was ready to force banks to comply if they failed to do so of their own accord. Transferring 100 European currency units cost on average Ecu24 (Pounds 18.28) at the beginning of 1993 and took almost five days, according to a study carried out by the Commission. This was unacceptable if the EU's single market for goods, money and people was to be meaningful, the Commission said in a statement. 'European consumers are right to complain about the current situation on cross-border payments. It is a field where the great market has got to benefit citizens,' the statement quoted Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the commissioner in charge on consumer policy, as saying. The Commission approved an action plan yesterday which could culminate in the adoption next summer of measures to force the banks to act if a study to be carried out early in 1994 showed that no concrete progress had been made. 'The Commission gives the banks a 'grace period' to allow for more transparency and efficiency when making cross-border payments,' the statement said. International transfers of money are expensive because they involve manual operations often involving more than two banks. This means that costs are charged not to the sender but also the beneficiary. There are more than 200m cross-border payments below Ecu2,500 in the EU each year but they account for only 1.3 per cent of total banking transactions, according to 1991 figures. However, the banking industry continues to contest the Commission's right to impose rules on its operations.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Tobacco slump hits American Brands American Tobacco, the US cigarette maker that BAT Industries of the UK is buying for Dollars 1bn from American Brands, was the parent company's worst-performing business in the first three months of this year, American Brands' quarterly results showed yesterday. The domestic tobacco business's operating profits slumped from Dollars 102.5m to Dollars 55.4m in the first quarter, on revenues down from Dollars 407.5m to Dollars 376.5m - mainly because of the price war that broke out in the US cigarette market in April last year. The downturn was a big factor in cutting American Brands' total net profits for the first quarter to Dollars 149.2m from Dollars 247.1m before last year's accounting changes. Turnover fell from Dollars 1.89bn to Dollars 1.33bn and fully-diluted earnings per share fell from Dollars 1.22 before accounting changes to 74 cents. However, the domestic tobacco business was not the only poor performer. Gallaher, the international tobacco business that is not included in the sale to BAT, suffered because of a shift in the timing of the UK budget from April to November. This caused the pre-budget sales bulge to disappear, taking operating profits down to Dollars 126.2m from Dollars 165.1m. The spirits business also showed a dip in operating profits, to Dollars 38.4m from Dollars 44.9m, in spite of last year's acquisition of Invergordon Distillers. American Brands said this was because of a planned, one-time reduction in inventory levels at Jim Beam. American Brands said the disposal of American Tobacco would leave it with profitable, strongly-positioned businesses that had performed well. It warned that unusual factors 'may well result in unfavourable profit comparisons' for 1994. But it lifted the quarterly dividend from 49.25 cents a share to 50 cents.</p>

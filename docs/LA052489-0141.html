			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AETNA RESUMES SELLING NEW POLICIES IN CALIF.;  </P> <P> AETNA AGAIN SELLS AUTO, HOME, LIABILITY POLICIES  </P> <P> Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, the ninth largest seller of property and casualty  insurance in California, announced today that it is resuming sales to new  customers of all auto, homeowners and commercial liability policies, ending a  two-week moratorium while it evaluated the state Supreme Court decision  upholding most of Proposition 103.  </P> <P> A company spokesman, Jason Wright, said Aetna had concluded from statements  made May 11 by state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie that the state  intends to allow the insurance industry a fair rate of return in California,  for each line of insurance, in accord with what he said was the tenor of the  high court's decision.  </P> <P> "Our halt in new sales was temporary, while we awaited a substantive statement  on how the state intended to operate," said Wright from Aetna headquarters in  Hartford, Conn. "We're more comfortable now."  </P> <P> He said the company is particularly pleased that California will allow a profit  on each line of insurance in deciding whether to exempt each company from the  20% rate rollbacks from 1987 levels called for in Proposition 103.  </P> <P> Aetna will file for an exemption and for continuation of "pretty much" the  rates it charges now, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> A number of insurance companies have expressed satisfaction at Gillespie's  decision to allow a profit for each line of insurance held, while a number of  consumer groups have criticized the decision on grounds that the industry had  traditionally been willing to sell some lines at a loss in a move to lead  customers to more profitable lines.  </P> <P> Aetna last year sold $103 million of private passenger auto insurance in  California.  </P></p>

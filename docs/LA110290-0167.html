			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 143;  </P> <P> BOND MEASURE CALLED ESSENTIAL TO THE FUTURE OF HIGHER EDUCATION  </P> <P> The rock musicians and the guy in a gorilla suit had a higher purpose Thursday:  to exhort the milling crowd of UC Irvine book-packers to safeguard the future  of higher education with a vote for Proposition 143 next week.  </P> <P> "What we need you to do is get out and vote, get your parents out to vote and  get your friends out to vote for it," Student Vice President Gary Miles said of  the $450-million bond measure for higher education on the Nov. 6 ballot.  </P> <P> "Your future and the future of California depends on it," added the 20-year-old  political science major from Brooklyn, speaking to a crowd of more than 150 UCI  students breezing through the student center on their lunch break.  </P> <P> The student-sponsored rally, the flyers handed out by an anonymous man in a  rented gorilla suit and the numerous mailers and articles appearing in student  newspapers across Orange County serve to underscore growing fears on the  state's public college and university campuses that Proposition 143 could fail.  </P> <P> If approved, the measure would provide nearly $87 million for construction and  renovation projects at UCI, Cal State Fullerton and eight community colleges in  Orange County. Cal State Long Beach, which is heavily attended by Orange County  students, is slated for another $9.4 million in campus projects.  </P> <P> The projects have been approved by the Legislature and the governor, but they  will not be completed if voters fail to pass a bond measure to fund them.  Proposition 143 is a companion to the $450-million ballot measure for higher  education that voters approved in June.  </P> <P> Educators across the state are increasingly worried that voters -- buffeted by  higher taxes, higher gas prices and a declining economy -- will reject any  money measure, even one that has no organized opposition. They also fear that  in its trailing position on a lengthy ballot, Proposition 143 will get lost in  the shuffle.  </P> <P> "We're quite apprehensive," said UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, who has sent  informational letters about the measure to campus faculty and staff and UCI  Medical Center employees. "There are so many measures on the ballot, and ours  is way down there at the bottom. We're afraid . . . people might not focus on  our needs."  </P> <P> He is not alone in his efforts.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton President Milton A. Gordon reminds virtually every group he  speaks to these days that the very quality of education offered at his  university hinges on passage of Proposition 143. "I am very concerned. . . . I  have been speaking out in a variety of ways so that everybody understands what  is at stake," he said.  </P> <P> What the measure means for Cal State Fullerton is about $9.8 million, the bulk  of it for renovation of its aging heating and cooling plant as well as  equipment for a planned science laboratory annex.  </P> <P> It would also provide $507,000 for architectural drawings and plans for a  long-awaited expansion of the campus library.  </P> <P> Without passage of the measure, Gordon said, the $22.4-million science  laboratory annex, which is expected to break ground in December and open in the  fall of 1993, could sit unfinished and empty. The measure would provide $3.1  million to install laboratory equipment.  </P> <P> "And we need the library expansion to make sure we keep the necessary supply of  books and periodicals that our faculty and students need," Gordon said.  </P> <P> UCI's stake in the ballot measure is far greater at $39.8 million. The single  biggest item is $27 million for a new engineering facility, plus $3.8 million  more to renovate and upgrade the existing overcrowded building.  </P> <P> Much emphasis has been placed on soaring population growth in California, which  is expected to send 57,000 more students to University of California campuses  by the year 2005. But the need for the capital projects covered by Proposition  143 is far more immediate than that, say academic leaders.  </P> <P> "Yes, it will be important for the future," Fullerton's Gordon said of the  ballot measure. "But the new science labs that will be under construction are  needed now for the students we currently have. The library expansion is needed  for the students we have now."  </P> <P> UCI's chancellor concurred.  </P> <P> "We have inadequate space to educate the students that are at our door now,"  Peltason said. "We can improvise classrooms, and we can improvise even with  private funding (to support programs). But to do major next-century  engineering, we need to do the kind of building that only the state can  afford."  </P> <P> Among community colleges, Orange Coast College has $31.5 million in capital  projects hinging on the bond measure's passage. About $12 million would go for  a new vocational technology center to help train the workers of the future.  Another $17.7 million would be for land acquisition at the burgeoning campus,  which claims to be the largest community college in the nation.  </P> <P> Voters regularly hear dueling commercials about several more controversial  ballot measures. But so far, the only opposition to Proposition 143 comes in  negative ballot arguments by three individuals who oppose all bond measures on  principle.  </P> <P> "There is no opposition to Proposition 143 that I'm aware of," Gordon said.  "But we have to get the message out. We have to really emphasize that this is  an educational bond and it is important to maintain the quality of education  that California has always been known for."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROP 143 FUNDS  </P> <P> The following is a list of how much money local colleges will receive if  Proposition 143 is approved Tuesday and what that money will fund:  </P> <P> CYPRESS COLLEGE $1.58 million  </P> <P> Maintenance facility  </P> <P> FULLERTON COLLEGE $1.48 million  </P> <P> Maintenance facility  </P> <P> GOLDEN WEST COLLEGE $488,000  </P> <P> Upgrade health-science building  </P> <P> IRVINE VALLEY COLLEGE $118,000  </P> <P> Facilities yard  </P> <P> ORANGE COAST COLLEGE $31.49 million  </P> <P> Vocational technology building  </P> <P> Centralized maintenance  </P> <P> Land acquisition  </P> <P> RANCHO SANTIAGO COLLEGE $918,000  </P> <P> Business/computer building  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK COLLEGE $568,000  </P> <P> Reclaimed irrigation system  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK COMMUNITY  </P> <P> COLLEGE DISTRICT OFFICE $279,000  </P> <P> Management/computer services center  </P> <P> Source: University of California  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON $9.79 million  </P> <P> Science building addition and renovation  </P> <P> Central plant, Phase V  </P> <P> Electrical infrastructure renovation  </P> <P> Library building addition  </P> <P> Science building addition  </P> <P> Physical-education building addition  </P> <P> Langsdorf Hall alteration  </P> <P> Auditorium  </P> <P> CAL STATE LONG BEACH $9.41 million  </P> <P> Electrical infrastructure renovation  </P> <P> Central plant addition  </P> <P> Utilities  </P> <P> Upgrade and add to arts and science facilities  </P> <P> Upgrade and add to fine arts facilities  </P> <P> Peterson Hall renovation  </P> <P> UC IRVINE $39.80 million  </P> <P> UCI Medical Center psychiatric inpatient facility  </P> <P> Steinhaus Hall renovation  </P> <P> Science library  </P> <P> Engineering Unit 2  </P> <P> Engineering Unit 1 renovation  </P> <P> Central-plant boiler modifications  </P> <P> Social Sciences Unit 2  </P></p>

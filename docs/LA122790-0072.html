			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV STILL LACKS PRECISE REFORM PLANS  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev amassed more legal power this week than any  previous Soviet leader, but such is the depth of his country's crisis that not  even he can be confident that this will be enough to pull it from its growing  political and economic chaos.  </P> <P> The problem is less one of power than of plain politics: Gorbachev has yet to  lay down a precise plan to reform the economy along market lines, to work out a  compact that will preserve the Soviet Union as a federal state and to build a  system of government that supports these changes.  </P> <P> He has ideas on all, to be sure, but the "paralysis of power" that has gripped  the country for more than a year and worsened its multiple crises lies, first  of all, in his own irresoluteness and consequent inability to win support for  the tough decisions required for the country's transformation.  </P> <P> The gravity of these crises is unmistakable, and Soviet politicians seriously  discuss the possibility of civil war if solutions are not found quickly.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is beset, above all, by the accelerating collapse of its  economy: The system of state ownership, central planning and government  management no longer functions as an organic whole, and growing barter trade  and an annual inflation rate of perhaps 80% are the only real signs of the  market economy that Gorbachev has promoted to replace it.  </P> <P> Rising nationalism, spurred by the country's economic problems, now threatens  the breakup of the Soviet Union as a federal state. The secession of the Baltic  republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania appears inevitable, and perhaps that  of Georgia and Moldova as well. Gorbachev wants a union treaty to establish a  new relationship between the central government and the republics, but passions  are so high that little progress has been made.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's new democratic institutions, still young and uncertain, have  so far proven incapable of resolving either the economic or the ethnic crisis,  and that failure has compounded both, led to extensive social unrest and  created a crisis of confidence in perestroika, Gorbachev's reform program.  Trust in Gorbachev himself, as measured by Soviet public opinion polls,  declines almost weekly, and Soviet commentators speculate on the  "post-Gorbachev era."  </P> <P> That Gorbachev would win approval for constitutional changes, however, was  never in doubt, although they required a two-thirds majority in the Congress of  People's Deputies, the national Parliament. What remains uncertain as the  Congress draws to a close is whether he won enough support for the political  consensus he needs.  </P> <P> "Mikhail Gorbachev is trying to rescue his leadership from collapse," a member  of the president's inner circle commented. "The stakes are very, very high. We  are talking about the fate of Gorbachev, the fate of perestroika, the fate of  the nation. He must act, and boldly, but in a law-based democracy, to act he  needs power."  </P> <P> Yet, even as they voted to amend the Soviet constitution and broaden the  president's authority, members of the Congress of People's Deputies asked this  week how Gorbachev would use these new powers, whether they were giving him the  authority he needed to resolve these fundamental problems -- or whether they  were creating a dictatorship.  </P> <P> "Power is a means, not an end," Pavel G. Bunich, a pro-market economist and  deputy, commented. "Gorbachev will get his new powers, but will we get any  progress? Doubtful, very doubtful.  </P> <P> "In the economy, for example, the problem is not getting enough power to push a  program through, but working out that program and getting support for it from  the people. With sufficient support, more power would be unnecessary, for the  market would pull us forward with even greater effectiveness."  </P> <P> Gorbachev argued, however, that "life itself" had shown the need for greater  presidential authority. Not even government officials were obeying his orders,  nor were they bound to do so under the constitution. The advent of democracy,  moreover, had convinced every region that it was sovereign. Every factory  manager, every farmer, the members of every local council felt that they knew  better than Moscow what needed to be done.  </P> <P> "When laying emphasis on dismantling the command system and breaking the chains  that fettered us, we did not make all the essential provisions for making  decisions and executing them," Gorbachev told journalists last week at the  Congress. "Democracy is already accompanied by such outbursts and sheer  exhaustion that we are on the brink of chaos."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, addressing the Congress, promised action and an end to vacillation.  "We shall act now, saving every day and drastically changing the system and the  nature of our way of doing things," he said. "This means we should have new  structures and new people to carry this weight and grapple in earnest with the  problems the nation faces."  </P> <P> But this declaration brought a quick retort from his critics. "We always say  that the president lacks powers," commented Vladimir K. Chernyak, a leading  economist from the Ukraine. "But maybe he lacks something else -- firm  positions, a consistent line and effective policies."  </P> <P> Four times this year, Gorbachev has sought additional powers, either from the  Congress of People's Deputies or from the Supreme Soviet, the country's  legislature, and each time promised firm action to deal with the deepening  political and economic crises.  </P> <P> Yet the "paralysis of power," now a political byword here, has only become more  evident. Promised decrees on economic reform, for example, were delayed for  months -- or never issued. Reorganization of the government, streamlining it  into a dozen key ministries, has been postponed repeatedly. Conflicts between  presidential decrees, ministerial orders, government regulations and  legislation -- all new -- remain unresolved.  </P> <P> "This is a man who does not know what to do," a former Gorbachev adviser  commented, asking not to be named. "In some cases, it is because he does not  understand the issues or appreciate their urgency. In some cases, he is pulled  every which way by his advisers, the ministers, the generals and dozens of  others. And often, quite often, he simply cannot decide for fear of making a  grievous error. He never forgets how close we are to real chaos."  </P> <P> Even within the Communist Party leadership, Gorbachev has come under attack for  his failure to act. "Of all the shortages we have today, the main shortage is  that of specific action -- at all levels," Ivan K. Polozkov, the conservative  first secretary of the Russian Communist Party, declared earlier this month.  "Even when we are convinced of the correctness of what has to be done, when the  aims and the tasks have been determined, the work stands still and nothing is  done."  </P> <P> But Gorbachev's approach to the crisis -- enhancing his authority to rule by  decree, to declare states of emergency and to take over administration of any  republic or region -- is worrisome to many, even to some of his closest  colleagues.  </P> <P> Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the foreign minister, resigned in an impassioned  warning to Gorbachev and the nation to beware of "reactionary forces" that were  already pressing the leadership hard and perhaps positioning themselves to  establish a dictatorship, using the president's additional powers.  </P> <P> The shift rightward is clear. Liberals are being forced from the government and  party leadership. Gorbachev's policy declarations lay greater stress on the  "socialist choice" and reflect little of the bold reforms approved at the  Communist Party congress six months ago. The military, security forces and  police have regained much of their past prominence. Declared conservatives  among deputies at the Congress outnumbered liberals by a margin of more than 2  to 1.  </P> <P> "Greater presidential powers, largely without the checks and balances that are  placed on an American president or the parliamentary restraints that a British  prime minister has, is very risky when the right is in resurgence," commented  Nikolai I. Travkin, a leader of the Democratic Party of Russia. "The  combination has great potential for explosion. Does Gorbachev realize what he  is creating?"  </P> <P> The first calls for a "strong hand" to run the government came, however, not  from the far right, but from radical reformers who, in mid-1989, urged  Gorbachev to use extraordinary powers to push through a bolder program for the  country's political and economic transformation over the resistance of old-line  bureaucrats.  </P> <P> Even now, Sergei B. Stankevich, the first deputy mayor in Moscow's radical-led  municipal government, supports what he calls "authoritarian rule" to halt the  spreading chaos and speed the resolution of the present crises.  </P> <P> "We need a president ready and able to act," Stankevich said. "And Gorbachev  will never be ready until he (has the power and) is able. The paralysis of  power is nationwide, and it has halted any meaningful reform. The place to  begin a recovery action is in the president's office."  </P> <P> Roy A. Medvedev, a leading Marxist historian, onetime dissident and now both a  deputy and a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee, also argued  that fears of a dictatorship are misplaced.  </P> <P> "These changes are important, for they give the presidency a vertical structure  that it lacked," Medvedev said. "The president could issue an ukaz (decree) in  the Kremlin and not be certain that it would even be published, let alone  obeyed. In the past, the party enforced decisions through its discipline, but  in some places the party is now not even in the government.  </P> <P> "By law, it is true, Gorbachev now has more power than any Soviet leader ever  had, but it is less power than he inherited when he became the party's general  secretary. When the party gave up its monopoly on power -- at Gorbachev's  insistence, remember -- he gave up enormous power. What he is doing is getting  back what he needs to operate and fulfill the people's expectations. This man  is a democrat, not a dictator."  </P></p>

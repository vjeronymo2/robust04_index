			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by M. Velikoselskiy; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg remains the Russian leader in the  illegal production of synthetic narcotics. Another underground  laboratory was eliminated here a few days ago. A promising  chemist and a capable manager combined their skills and prepared  for sale a very rare and extremely effective drug. Its value on  the narcotics market exceeds four billion rubles, and the number  of single portions produced may be over a million. The state  has confiscated from those arrested a large quantity of chemical  reagents, laboratory equipment, and notes describing an original  procedure for synthesizing narcotics, which the authors do not  want to patent for the time being.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Marcano from the "Sunday Wrap-Up" newscast] </F>   [Text] Within the framework of the pacification policy  being promoted by President Rafael Caldera, 34 Venezuelan  soldiers who had sought refuge in Peru returned to the country  on a Venezuelan Air Force Hercules aircraft today. Now, only 16  high-ranking military officers who are still finalizing the  details of an agreement on their surrender remain in Lima.    Meanwhile, in Caracas, Retired Lieutenant Colonel Hugo  Chavez  Frias, in his second day of freedom following 26 months in  prison, placed a wreath at the National Pantheon and later held  a news conference at the Caracas Athenaeum. Jose Marcano filed  this report.    [Begin recording] [Marcano] Commander Chavez greeted the  crowd gathered at the gate of the National Pantheon before  heading to the Caracas Athenaeum, where he answered all  questions posed by domestic and foreign reporters.    Chavez answered the simplest to the most complex questions  with poise and self-control. In terms of economics, he only  made a brief analysis and criticized the eight plans implemented  by the democratic administrations. According to Chavez, the  Sosa economic plan does not offer alternatives for employment  and investment. Politics is Chavez's priority at this time, but  he said he must first resurrect Bolivarian ideology and the  commitment to obtain power.    For the time being, Chavez said he will push for the  convening of a constituent assembly, taking advantage of the  fact the 4 February events are still fresh in people's minds.  This, he said, would be the best way to enter the political  scene.    Chavez explained he made no promises to Dr. Caldera's  Government in exchange for his presidential pardon. He admitted  there are differences among the members of the 200 Revolutionary  Bolivarian Movement, and he said he will work to unify it and  turn it into a political movement that defends the interests of  the people, without creating a [word indistinct] structure.    [Chavez] We are ready to assist the government as much as  possible. The only thing we can do is to make recommendations.  For example, when we stand up and call for a constituent  assembly, we are making a recommendation. I ask the government  of Dr. Caldera to heed this recommendation. Instead of giving  Congress constituent powers, as I believe some sectors and even  the president himself have suggested, we believe this would be a  mistake because those responsible for the national crisis have  become entrenched in Congress.    Are we going to give them more constituent powers so they  can  finish destroying what we have left of our fatherland? No. Let  us call the people to a constituent assembly. This is a  recommendation we are making to the government. We hope the  government heeds our call. If the government wants to talk to  us, we are ready to talk to the government. [end recording]    Commander Chavez today presided over various activities in  the western part of the capital. Tomorrow he will visit Sabana  Grande Boulevard and Chacaito, and in the evening he will leave  for his home state of Barinas, where he will meet with his  fellow citizens.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HANSEN THE FASTEST ON A SLOW NIGHT;  </P> <P> MOTOR SPORTS: SIMI VALLEY DRIVER SHINES IN A MAIN EVENT AT VENTURA RACEWAY AS  PROGRAM LAGS AN HOUR BEHIND SCHEDULE.  </P> <P> Scott Hansen of Simi Valley drove to his second consecutive U. S. Auto Club  Western States Series three-quarter midget win before a crowd of 3,180 to  highlight the first Ventura County Fair "West Coast Clash" on Saturday night.  </P> <P> Rick Hendrix of Canoga Park finished second and Cory Kruseman of Ventura was  third in the 20-lap main event at Ventura Raceway.  </P> <P> The program fell nearly an hour behind schedule because of numerous delays --  and the fact that more than 70 cars were scheduled to compete.  </P> <P> In an earlier race, George Ito of Oxnard was leading the three-quarter midget  10-lap semi-main event when his engine quit on Lap 6, allowing Jay Drake of  Valencia to take command. The victory sent Drake into the main event, where he  picked up enough points to hold off challenger Gary Schroeder of Burbank in the  season points standings.  </P> <P> Hank Butcher of San Leandro won the midget 12-lap semi-main, taking the lead  for good on Lap 2 when leader Gary Howard of Anaheim hit a deep rut and spun  out.  </P> <P> Howard came from the back of the pack after the spin-out to finish second and  gain a berth in the main event, as did Dennis Welsh of Glendale and Brian Smart  of Torrance.  </P> <P> Winners in the 10-lap midget heat races were Bob Davison of Santa Ana, Robby  Flock of the City of Industry, Sleepy Tripp of Costa Mesa and Kurt Steiner of  Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> Three-quarter midget eight-lap heat-race winners were Steve Kellick of Ventura,  Kara Hendrick of Upland, Jason Jonkman of Fountain Valley and Tom Morley of  Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Three-lap trophy dash winners were Frank Pedregon of Gardena (midget) and  Hansen (three-quarter midget).  </P> <P> The final action of the weekend begins tonight at 6 with the Ventura Raceway's  Street Stock and Mini Stock program.  </P></p>

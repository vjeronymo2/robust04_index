BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BOEING AIRLINERS FOR CHINA HELD UP  </P> <P> China's state airline is unable to take delivery of five Boeing Co. airliners  because the U.S. government has frozen licenses for technical exports to China,  banking sources said today.  </P> <P> Seattle-based Boeing was to have started delivering the aircraft to the China  Aviation Administration Corp. this week, a Hong Kong banking source said.  </P> <P> "One 757-400 should have been delivered this week but it is being held up  indefinitely because Boeing cannot get export licenses from the U.S.  government," the source said.  </P> <P> Washington stopped issuing export licenses for all technical exports to China  to protest the bloody June 4 crackdown in Tian An Men Square and the repression  of dissent.  </P></p>

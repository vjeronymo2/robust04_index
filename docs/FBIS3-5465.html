			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Mar. 8 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi  Hoe-chang asked Home Minister Choe Hyong-u on Tuesday to try to  terminate government subsidies to a couple of permanent public  campaign organizations. The two organizations the premier  singled out were the Central Council of Saemaul Undong (New  Community Movement) and the Council for the Promotion of Correct  Ways of Living (Barukye- Salki-Hyobuihoe). In an official  letter, Yi suggested that the Home Ministry do away with  government subsidies to the two organizations by switching them  into purely private organizations.    Explaining about the premier's instructions, Choe Kyu-hwak,  third administration coordinator of the office of the prime  minister, said that the two organizations have been receiving  government subsides under special laws. He said he understands  that at the prime minister's instructions, the Home Ministry  will work out detailed ways to make the two organizations stand  on their own feed. Choe said, however, that this does not apply  to the Federation for Freedom (Chayu-Chong-Yonmaeng) which he  said is an ideological organization. He thus hinted government  funds would continue to be funneled into the federation.    This year alone, 20 billion won in both central and local  government funds were set aside for the Saemaul Council and 11.3  billion won for the Correct Ways of Living Council.</p>

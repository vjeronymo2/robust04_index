			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SHUTTLE DISCOVERY TO LIFT OFF AFTER DARK  </P> <P> The space shuttle Discovery will lift off after dark on Nov. 20 on a secret  military mission, NASA officials announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> The space agency set the launching date after shuttle managers concluded a  two-day review that assessed the readiness of the orbiter, the payload, the  global tracking network and all other aspects of the mission.  </P> <P> National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said that liftoff will  occur during a four-hour period starting at 6:30 p.m., only the third night  launching in 32 shuttle flights. The precise time will not be made public until  nine minutes before liftoff to make it harder for Soviet reconnaissance ships  to track the shuttle.  </P> <P> In addition, Martin Marietta Corp. announced Tuesday that it will launch the  first commercial payloads on its Titan 3 rocket on the night of Dec. 8. They  will be communications satellites for Japan and Great Britain.  </P> <P> NASA earlier had announced the scheduled after-dark launching of the space  shuttle Columbia on Dec. 18 to deploy a communications satellite and to track  down and return to Earth a science satellite that has been in orbit for more  than five years.  </P> <P> The Discovery and Titan flights must be launched in the evening in order to  place the satellites in desired orbits. The Columbia liftoff is timed to put  the shuttle on course to intercept the satellite to be retrieved.  </P></p>

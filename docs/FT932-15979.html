			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Lloyd's shakes up export credit cover market INSURERS at Lloyd's of London are to increase their involvement in the export credit insurance market following the relaxation of restrictions imposed in the 1920s. Competition in the market, which has been dominated by insurance companies, is expected to increase as a result of the move. Lloyd's syndicates have been allowed to underwrite the risk of publicly owned companies failing to pay exporters for goods received, but had been excluded from the mainstream private-sector market. Hiscox syndicate 33 was given permission by a committee of the self-regulating Lloyd's market to set up an export credit insurance facility backed by other Lloyd's syndicates last month. Its underwriter Mr Geoffrey Lynch said: 'I was allowed to cover possible default by a South American state-owned oil company but not that of the likes of Exxon. It just didn't make sense for Lloyd's to turn its back on the market.' Mr Charles Berry, of brokers Berry Palmer &amp; Lyle, said that the restriction, imposed after heavy losses by a Lloyd's underwriter who insured financial guarantees, was outdated. He said: 'The outside world recognises that trade credit risks are lower than some of the risks that syndicates are allowed to underwrite.' The facility will be carefully controlled to limit the risk to Names - the individuals whose assets support Lloyd's - with no syndicate allowed to receive more than 2 per cent of its premium income from the facility. Mr Nigel Bovingdon, of Credit Insurance Association, a Hogg group subsidiary which brokers about 25 per cent of UK export credit risks, said that Lloyd's was 'breaking the mould' by opening the facility. He said Lloyd's would provide extra competition for Trade Indemnity and the Dutch-owned NCM, which dominate the market. Lloyd's could also benefit from increased demand for export credit cover in France and Germany, where Credit Insurance Association has recently opened offices. Meanwhile the Lloyd's leaders met yesterday to continue work on the business plan, which could be presented to the council, the market's ruling body, as early as next week. The plan will outline a number of reforms designed to restore prosperity to the market, where losses over the past five years are expected to exceed Pounds 5bn. The Society of Names, one of a number of groups representing lossmaking Names, wrote to its members last week detailing a number of the measures which it believes the plan will advocate. Among these are moves to transfer 'long-tail' liabilities - those on which claims emerge many years after the original inception of the policy to a new centralised 'run-off' company.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / France ready to veto farm deal: Parliamentary vote puts Paris on collision course with EC partners MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, told his parliament last night that Paris would use its veto 'at every stage' to block the draft farm deal with the US, which it judges unacceptably damaging to French farmers. This appeared to set France on a collision course with those of its European Community partners which hope the long-sought transatlantic farm accord will pave the way for a new world trade agreement. Mr Beregovoy seemed to accept the inevitability of this, when he told deputies that 'Europe has advanced through successive crises. If there has to be a crisis over this, there will be a crisis'. Mr Beregovoy said he would request an early meeting of EC foreign and agriculture ministers formally to record France's opposition. More than 50 French police were injured in clashes with riot police which broke out after thousands of farmers demonstrated near the National Assembly. Leaders of the French farm unions congratulated the government on its 'firmness' in the trade negotiations. The chief element in the farm deal between the US and EC which has drawn French anger is the proposed 21 per cent cut in subsidised EC farm exports over the next six years. Although France has expressed its opposition to the deal throughout the recent negotiations, it appeared to have hardened its position yesterday in the face of parliamentary and popular pressure. A French veto could provoke a crisis with Paris's partners, particularly Germany. Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday said he hoped France would accept the deal but also asked for understanding of 'our French friends' problems'. Paris won backing yesterday from the Belgian economy minister, Mr Melchior Wathelet, who called the EC-US agreement 'unacceptable'. The Belgian government, which is under pressure from its own farmers, is to decide its position tomorrow. Mr Beregovoy at first sought to give himself, and President Francois Mitterrand, who left Paris yesterday for a Middle East trip, some leeway on a possible French veto. But after being pushed hard by opposition deputies in a debate marked by its anti-Americanism, Mr Beregovoy said France would use 'its veto at all stages of the procedure, from the moment that it is presented with a legal text' enshrining the draft deal in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Beregovoy said the draft farm accord, which the European Commission last night pronounced as compatible with the Community's own recent farm reforms, had 'no legal significance'. A confidence motion based on a text threatening a French veto was passed late last night by 301 votes to 251, with the Communists backing the Socialist gov-ernment. The main centre-right opposition parties, which did not wish to appear to endorse the government with parliamentary elections only four months away, opposed the motion. Mr Alain Juppe, secretary general of the RPR gaullists, complained that Mr Beregovoy had refused to demand an immediate reopening of farm negotiations with Washington. The government was strongly criticised by the opposition for not extracting from France's EC partners promises of solidarity in the Gatt negotiations when it acquiesced in last May's reform of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy. In Brussels, the European Commission last night agreed that the EC-US compromise on farm subsidies in the Gatt world trade talks was compatible with reform of the CAP after reviewing a document produced by Mr Ray MacSharry, the commissioner for agriculture. Mr Jacques Delors, who clashed with Mr MacSharry, the EC's Gatt negotiator, in the run-up to last week's breakthrough, rallied commissioners behind the paper produced by Mr MacSharry.

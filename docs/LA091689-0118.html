			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS WILL ALLOW ORANGE COUNTY TO VOTE ON TAX TO BUILD JAILS  </P> <P> The state Legislature passed a hotly contested bill shortly before midnight  Friday which would allow Orange County residents to vote on a half-cent sales  tax increase for new jail and court facilities.  </P> <P> The measure passed by one vote in the Assembly on the third roll-call in the  waning hours of the 1989 session. The bill now goes to Gov. George Deukmejian  for his signature. If signed, the Orange County Board of Supervisors could put  the sales tax increase on the ballot as early as next June.  </P> <P> The Senate had voted earlier Friday, 23-11, for the same measure, which is  intended to help finance a $700-million jail in Gypsum Canyon near Anaheim  Hills, followed a round of emotional debate and bickering that pitted state  Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) against her Orange County rival, Sen.  John Seymour (R-Anaheim).  </P> <P> Both are seeking the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor next year,  and the fate of a new Orange County jail could be a factor in the race. Orange  County supervisors voted last month to spend the sales tax money on a new  6,720-bed jail in Gypsum Canyon -- in Seymour's district -- allaying fears that  it would be built in Santa Ana -- Bergeson's district.  </P> <P> For months, Bergeson and Sheriff Brad Gates have vigorously pursued the sales  tax measure because it would yield $126 million a year in crucial seed money  for the new jail and a courthouse in Santa Ana. Gates has said the average  Orange County family will end up paying about $25 a year, with the rest of the  tab being picked up by tourists.  </P> <P> Without the money, Gates says, his deputies will be forced to continue the  early release of more than 50,000 criminals a year because of overcrowded jail  facilities.  </P> <P> County voters also will be asked in November to consider a half-cent sales tax  increase for transportation projects.  </P> <P> The Orange County jail tax increase proposal that was passed Friday by the  Senate was part of an omnibus bill, created just this week, that also would  allow Los Angeles and four other financially strapped counties to ask voters  for similar half-cent sales tax increases to build more cells.  </P> <P> Critics of the measures have complained that the sales tax increases, which  require only a simple majority of voters in each county to approve, are efforts  to circumvent Proposition 13 restrictions that call for a two-thirds majority  vote on all tax increases. A similar sales tax increase, approved by San Diego  County voters in 1988, was held unconstitutional earlier this year by a  Riverside Superior Court judge.  </P> <P> During Assembly debate on the measure, Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange)  attacked the proposal, saying: "This bill is a frontal assault on Proposition  13. I urge a 'no' vote."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata), sponsor of the omnibus package, responded:  "This is the only game in town. A sales tax is the only option these counties  have. Nobody likes a sales tax, but this is one bill that will solve their  problems."  </P> <P> Some opponents also have lambasted the measures for not including provisions  against putting expanded jail facilities in Latino communities, such as Santa  Ana and East Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Those concerns about have bedeviled the Orange County measure since Bergeson  introduced it earlier this year. Three times the bill appeared to be dealt  fatal blows by opponents. But Bergeson was able to revive it and push it  through the legislative process, arguing that the sales tax increases were  needed to preserve "law and order."  </P> <P> "We cannot continue to enact laws with mandatory incarceration only to turn  people loose because we don't have a place to put them," Bergeson told her  Senate colleagues Friday.  </P> <P> Her comments came when debate over the concerns of ethnic neighborhoods --  particularly in Los Angeles -- flared once again and prompted state Sen. Art  Torres (D-Los Angeles) to plead with his colleagues to hold the measure for  study next year.  </P> <P> Torres contended that without a special prohibition, the measure would make it  easier for Los Angeles County to add 2,408 prison beds in heavily Chinese and  Latino neighborhoods of his district, where there are already jails.  </P> <P> "Where will they build these jails?" Torres asked. "Right in East L.A. Right in  downtown Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Ironically, while Torres hit the measure because of the threat of jails in the  Latino community, Seymour also criticized it because it would put prisoners in  a predominantly Anglo area of Anaheim Hills.  </P> <P> Seymour also accused Bergeson of having a hidden agenda for pushing the bill.  </P> <P> "The bill doesn't call for it there (but) Sen. Bergeson made a deal in which  she said, 'I won't move this bill until the supervisors decided that this jail  will be built in Gypsum Canyon,' " said Seymour, a former Anaheim mayor.  </P> <P> He added: "It's an area that is environmentally sensitive, sensitive to the  residential areas. . . . And I have always been opposed to that as a location."  </P> <P> Bergeson -- who has steadfastly maintained that any decision on where to put  the jail rests with the county supervisors, not state lawmakers -- bristled at  Seymour's remarks.  </P> <P> "No process has been violated, and I deeply resent that charge," she shot back.  </P> <P> While defending her motives in pushing the tax measure, Bergeson also came  under attack for the parliamentary tactics she used to allow the sales tax bill  to slip out of the Senate and go back to the Assembly for final approval.  </P> <P> On the first round of voting, Senators voted, 21-10, to pass the measure.  Bergeson had captured the requisite majority of the 40 Senators to move the  bill along.  </P> <P> But Torres, in a last-ditch effort to keep the sales tax package bottled up,  used the parliamentary procedure to put the measure on hold so he could try to  "work the bill" and change votes so it would fail.  </P> <P> Normally, such a hold -- known as a "call" -- is placed on a bill until it is  lifted by the senator who requested it. That is considered common courtesy in  the more sedate upper house.  </P> <P> Yet Bergeson shocked Torres and others opposed to the sales tax measure by  standing up a few minutes after debate and asking on her own that the Torres  call be lifted on the bill. Before Torres realized what she had done, a roll  call vote had begun and the Senators tallied 23-11 in favor of the bill.  </P> <P> When it was ruled that Bergeson's actions were within Senate rules, Torres  began shouting and pointing at the Newport Beach Republican.  </P> <P> "It may be the rules, but it is rude!" he said, glowering at Bergeson.  </P> <P> When the Senate reconvened after lunch, Bergeson apologized for the breech of  etiquette and offered to subject the bill to a third roll call. But Torres,  conceding he didn't have the votes to stop it, said he wasn't interested.  </P> <P> As a peace offering, Bergeson sent Torres a box of candy, legislative staff  members said.  </P></p>

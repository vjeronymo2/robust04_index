A source close to the republic's government has  told Interfax that the president must undergo an annual medical  examination.    The source said that on March 24, 1993, during his  unofficial  visit to the United States, Niyazov had been examined at  Washington's Walter Reed Medical Center. On October 6 of the  same year, the Turkmen press carried a letter by former U.S.  secretary of State Alexander Haig, in which he recommended that  Turkmenistan's president visit St. Luke's hospital in Houston,  where the world's best cardiologists work.    Unverified reports say that Houston is one of the cities to  be visited by Niyazov in the United States.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Property: Instant heritage - the new homes that look old / Rosalind Russell investigates the steadily-growing market for period houses that are designed and built carefully to appear what they aren't There are people who would sooner confess they beat their dogs than admit to living in a house built after the second world war. Georgian, Queen Anne or Victorian - even Edwardian is acceptable - trophy homes are as desirable as a Land Rover Classic (as a second car), or the best school for the children. Among the aspirant classes however, are many who baulk at paying the period home premium because they are wary of inheriting old house crankiness. Increasingly, the solution is to commission a new house which is designed and built to look old - a kind of off-the-peg heritage. In East Anglia, Stephen Mattick builds homes with traditional, vernacular pargetting that blend seamlessly into the neighbourhood. In Surrey, Paul Sweeney's new houses look so convincingly old that a local planning officer insisted they must be conversions. In Wiltshire, Andrew Pownall-Gray, financial planning consultant with Allied Dunbar, chose Peter Borchert to design and build a 'new' Georgian home. He and his wife, Judy, even sold a real Georgian house to do it. 'She was dubious because she has always lived in period properties,' says Pownall-Gray. 'But when she saw what Peter had done, she became an instant convert. 'It is not always easy to find the house you want in the Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 400,000 range. We wanted something which was cheap to heat, had well-proportioned rooms and didn't have too many skeletons in the cupboard.' Borchert, an aeronautical engineer and pilot - he owns part of a Tiger Moth and is helping to renovate a Walrus, a second world war seaplane - before turning to house design, employed brickwork, windows and roof slates as they would have been used in the late-Georgian period. 'There are few examples of large period country houses that haven't been got at,' he says. 'Where there is affluence over a period of time, people have had the money to change the house by ripping out many of the old features. To create a new one is an alternative.' Another attractive inducement, he points out, is that value added tax does not apply to new building although VAT must be paid on materials used in restoring an old house. This certainly was a consideration for the Pownall-Grays. The final bill for their five-bedroom house was Pounds 130,000, in addition to land costs of Pounds 140,000. When they sold it recently, they got Pounds 285,000 - which must be considered a modest success, considering the limp condition of the housing market. 'The advantage of having the house built was that we had a full bespoke service,' says Pownall-Gray, who is now renting while he looks for a site where Borchert can build him a large country house. With two children in situ, plus nanny, and twins due in November, more space has become a priority. Borchert's previous experience includes a courtyard of new, traditionally-designed buildings including a swimming pool, pavilion, orangery and cottage in the grounds of The Grange, a restored manor house near Salisbury. At present, he is working on five new cottages - including thatched, timber-framed, flint and brick, and rendered cobb - in the Dorset conservation village of Winterbourne Dauntsey. Borchert admits locals were apprehensive at first about his planning application, but adds that they have subsequently been reassured as to his honourable intentions. 'There is a place for modern architecture but not in housing,' says Borchert, whose views on the subject have much in common with those of Prince Charles. 'We can suffer it in a car park, or a civic building. The worst examples are in concrete and glass and there's a coldness about them. They have no living qualities.' It is an attitude that provokes fury in the modernist camp, a leading exponent of which is Czech-born Jan Kaplicky. He says repro houses are on a par with film sets. Future Systems, the company he runs with Amanda Levete, has recently designed a four-level house in Islington, north London, with two solid walls and roof and two glass walls. Sitting between two protected buildings in an area where even the trees are on the protection register, it has attracted six pages of breathless excitement in Vogue magazine. If Kaplicky had tried to build it in Edinburgh New Town or Stow-on-the-Wold, locals would have burned his effigy in the street, his 'thoughtful, dreamy lyricism' (according to Vogue) notwithstanding. But Kaplicky is defiant. 'Every other country in Europe builds thousands of modern houses,' he says. And he insists that the fact he was born in Prague, home to some of the most beautiful baroque architecture is 'irrelevant'. 'Only in (Britain) is there a mental block. I fully respect houses from any period, but you can't build copies. You don't have the craftsmen who can do it without an extraordinary financial premium. They can't build the quality like they used to when people worked for pennies. Kaplicky cites Poundbury, the model village being built in Dorset with the support of Prince Charles, as proof of his theory. He describes it as 'awful, from what I've seen on television. It's basically Hollywood'. He adds: 'I don't think it is the case that you should match existing houses in a village when you are building a new one. Time goes on. You can't tell the inhabitants they must drive only old cars or horses and carriages. It's nonsense.' Yet, nostalgia is getting younger. Sir Edwin Lutyens (who died in 1944) is being copied, too. Orchard House, a two-year-old, five-bedroom, red brick house near Henley-on-Thames, Berkshire, is designed in what estate agent Knight Frank and Rutley describes as 'traditional Lutyens style'. To assist its assumed identity, it was planted in a mature plot which includes river frontage to the Thames, large trees, and a lake fed by an ancient moat. Less traditionally, there is a garden lighting system with a programmable waterfall into the lake. The three-bay garage block, flanked by stone balustrades, is designed to match the house and offers of around Pounds 1.2m are being sought for the whole property. Savills, which is selling a genuine Lutyens house for Pounds 450,000 in rural Northamptonshire - admittedly, not as desirable as Berkshire - says the proof of the pudding is in the ingredients. Even a repro will command a good price if the materials used are of high quality and it is a top of the market house. This is especially so for overseas buyers who want to walk into a house without having to deal with expensive maintenance bills. John D. Wood is also selling a genuine Lutyens: the Dutch House, near Dorking, Surrey, for Pounds 400,000. That sounds like a snip - until you realise it stands on the busy A24 dual carriageway. Who would pay more than a million for a copy? 'A true Lutyens' fan would pay a premium for the real thing,' admitted Knight Frank and Rutley's Andrew Rome, when pressed. But he added: 'The beauty of a new house is its modern facilities. Placed in a very old setting, as is Orchard House, it is a perfect combination.'</p>

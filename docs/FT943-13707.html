			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (15): A delayed new start - Profile, KwaZulu Natal province It has become almost a cliche to refer to South Africa's remarkably peaceful transition to democracy as a 'miracle', writes Patti Waldmeir. Such hyperbole may not be appropriate for most of what happened but it is difficult to find a less emotive term to describe events in the province of KwaZulu Natal. 'Amazingly, the population in Natal just forgot about tension and violence on all the days of the election,' says Mr Jacob Zuma, African National Congress leader in the province. His party lost the election to the rival Inkatha Freedom Party - and conceded that loss despite widespread allegations of Inkatha electoral fraud. 'The people gave leadership to the leaders on that day: they showed us how much they wanted peace.' Since that day, KwaZulu Natal's politicians have largely failed to respond to that demand. The provincial legislature has met only once, to swear in its members, and has been prevented from sitting since by a dispute over the choice of a provincial capital. Bickering over the capital, and over the allocation of portfolios in the coalition 'government of provincial unity' required by the constitution, has prevented the new government from tackling any of the daunting problems of a province with nearly a quarter of South Africa's population and some of its worst poverty. While other provinces have forged ahead with plans for implementing the Reconstruction and Development Programme, KwaZulu Natal has projected an image of political conflict which jars with the overwhelming national emphasis on unity. Dr Frank Mdladlose, the premier, is from Inkatha which has six of the 10 cabinet seats and 41 of 80 seats in the legislature. He angrily denies that his party is blocking progress. But Inkatha insiders say that Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the party leader who is minister of home affairs in the national government, has forced Dr Mdladlose to take a rigid line on both capital and cabinet which has provoked conflict. Slowly, though, things seem to be coming right. The cabinet recently agreed that the capital will be chosen by referendum, and that the cabinet will alternate between the old capital of Pietermaritzburg and the former capital of the KwaZulu homeland, Ulundi - an IFP stronghold  - until its result is known. 'It's better to delay than to break down totally,' says Mr Zuma, drawing a parallel with national negotiations which took four years to complete but appear likely to yield a durable peace. Natal did not enjoy this long period of consensus-building; its people fought each other until the very day of the elections. More than 10,000 people were killed in the province in political violence in the past decade. 'Everything must be given time. If you rush people, they take emotional decisions,' he concludes. 'We know their power; they know our power. We have to treat each other with respect. In the end, we have a responsibility to govern Natal, not to fight about the province.'  ----------------------------------------------------- KWAZULU NATAL  ----------------------------------------------------- Area: 91,481 sq km Population: 8.5m Population growth: 2.8% Literacy: 65% Labour force employed: 45% Contribution to national gross domestic product: 14.7% Life expectancy: 63 years  ----------------------------------------------------- Source: Development Bank of Southern Africa  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'DEVELOPMENT PERILS WILDLIFE, STUDY SAYS'  </P> <P> In "Development Perils Wildlife, Study Says" (Oct. 7), Tony Moiso of the  Mission Viejo Co. says "this is not Yellowstone" to justify his opposition to a  500-foot setback from oak-studded Arroyo Trabuco.  </P> <P> However, deterioration in an urban forest within 500 feet of development can be  observed less than a year after a project is completed, says arborist Alden  Kelley of the Orange County Tree Society.  </P> <P> For a resource of Yellowstone's stature, setbacks are measured in miles, not  feet.  </P> <P> CONSTANCE SPENGER  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

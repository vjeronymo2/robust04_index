			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHAVEZ JOINS ANTI-SPRAYING PROTESTERS  </P> <P> The issue was malathion. The setting was Santa Monica. The magnet was Cesar  Chavez. And the result was a strikingly diverse protest -- a sort of  disharmonious conversion of fruit pickers, tree preservationists, politicians,  child advocates and futurists.  </P> <P> Members of Forests Forever were there, as were the Mothers From East Los  Angeles, Mothers and Others, Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane, Pesticide Watch,  Kids Cry Out (a group of Los Feliz schoolchildren) and Four Directions, an  American Indian organization.  </P> <P> Hucksters sold Chavez posters, said to have been commissioned by Jane Fonda, as  well as "Boycott Grapes" T-shirts and bumper stickers.  </P> <P> "Today marks a milestone," Chavez told the cheering crowd outside Loews Santa  Monica Beach Hotel, where California fruit growers and distributors were  holding a yearly convention.  </P> <P> "We're here to tell the pesticide traffickers we will no longer tolerate the  spraying in silence. They talk about acceptable levels of exposure --  acceptable to whom?" the United Farm Workers leader asked. "There is no  acceptable level of exposure to chemicals that may cause cancer, miscarriages,  stillbirths . . . and death."  </P> <P> The rally was organized by the Burbank-based group FOCUS, or Families Opposed  to Chemical Urban Spraying. Nearly 200 activists -- chanting, waving signs,  blocking traffic -- took part in what was described as a new alliance of farm  workers and wealthy urbanites opposed to malathion spraying.  </P> <P> "We've got Republicans and Democrats here, people from Santa Monica and East  L.A., urban people and rural people," actress Julie Carmen said.  </P> <P> Wearing a "PEACE" T-shirt, with his long hair trailing out of a faded fedora,  40-year-old Vic Forsythe of West Los Angeles stood with a bullhorn, leading the  chants for picket-carrying marchers.  </P> <P> "Stop the spraying! That's what we're saying!"  </P> <P> Forsythe, president of the Vegetarian Society of Southern California, said he  is upset that malathion is being used on private yards and patios, in stores  and even on public buses.  </P> <P> "It's getting to be too pervasive," he complained. "It's killing wildlife,  killing birds. Once the birds are killed, there will be more insects. The  insects will adapt (to the malathion). Then what?"  </P> <P> Fruit growers, who watched the demonstrators through the hotel windows, took  issue with the marchers. Michael Durando, president of the California Grape and  Tree Fruit League, which represents more than 90% of the state's fruit growers  and shippers, said he sympathized with the concerns of the protesters but still  strongly supports the spraying program.  </P> <P> "If we allow the Medfly to spread throughout California . . . we will see a  dramatic reduction in the production of fresh fruits and vegetables in this  state," he said. "You will have a situation where consumers will be be buying  fruit in the market and cut into them and find maggots in them."  </P> <P> Durando, who said the crop loss would reach several billion dollars in  California, predicted that even back yard gardening would come to an end.  </P> <P> "With the Medfly, there will be no real way for back yard folks to control the  infestation," he said. "You won't see fruit coming off the trees. The worms  will get it first -- the maggots."  </P> <P> The UFW members, who already are mounting a grape boycott to protest the use of  pesticides stronger than malathion, will join with anti-malathion forces in  another boycott to be announced next week, said FOCUS leader Adelaide Nimitz.  She declined to name the target of the boycott.  </P> <P> "They will never eradicate the Medfly -- never," she said. "The Mediterranean  fruit fly is established. It is sort of like the cockroach or the spider. To  talk about eradicating them is ludicrous."  </P> <P> Farm worker Gonzalo Ramirez, through an interpreter, told the crowd about the  alleged effects of pesticides in the fields on his child.  </P> <P> "My little girl was a victim of cancer," he said, requiring a kidney transplant  from her brother.  </P></p>

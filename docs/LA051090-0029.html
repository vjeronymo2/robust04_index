			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RENAISSANCE PLEASURE FAIRE CUISINE: GOOD QUEEN BESS MIGHT BE SURPRISED;  </P> <P> FOODS: THE ANNUAL SOUTHLAND EVENT OFFERS A MENU THAT REFLECTS MODERN, LOCAL  TASTES AS WELL.  </P> <P> In the beginning, the Renaissance Pleasure Faire was a money-raising event for  a radio station, and the Renaissance motif was just for fun. Authentic  recreation of the past was only one part of the idea.  </P> <P> Maybe not even the most important part. For a lot of faire-goers, the thrill  seemed to be dressing up in costume and behaving as rowdy, bawdy, haughty  "lordes and ladyes." A surprising number of people, it developed, were in love  with the biting tone of voice traditional to the Shakespearean stage. In fact,  Richard Harris would still seem to be a major role model in our town, to judge  from the Renaissance Pleasure Faire.  </P> <P> Elizabethanism did not even seem to be obligatory in the early days. It was the  '60s, and Hobbits and belly-dancers were entirely welcome; the 1967 faire  sometimes looked as if it would turn into a psychedelic "Be-In." Since those  days the faire has tried to clean up its motif. Booths have had to meet some  minimal standards of appropriateness to the Elizabethan period.  </P> <P> Early on, however, quite a few things had become perennial features. It  wouldn't be a Renaissance Pleasure Faire without them. Above all, this is true  of the food.  </P> <P> In the early days of the faire, the idea was obviously that Elizabethan food  must have been hearty and rowdy and crude, involving a lot of tossing of bones  over your shoulder for the wolfhounds to gnaw on. Turkey drumsticks are still a  big favorite for this reason.  </P> <P> The rest of the menu was filled out with folk foods and street foods, mostly  from England, on the theory that the common people of a country have always  eaten the same. It's not true, though. You can't have Shepherd's Pye until you  have potatoes, and the Elizabethans didn't. You can't have ice cream or banger  sausage until they've been invented. They had toads in Elizabeth I's England,  but not Toad in the Hole.  </P> <P> Non-British street foods were allowed at the Renaissance Faire too, on the  questionable theory that 16th-Century London was a cosmopolitan place where  piroshki and falafel could have been found, somewhere or other. In fact, there  is no evidence that anybody, anywhere, was making falafel in the 16th Century.  </P> <P> It seems strange that these decisions should have been made ad hoc. They didn't  have to be. We actually know a great deal about what the Elizabethans ate, from  several cookbooks written around their time.  </P> <P> We know, for instance, that they ate a lot of highly spiced dishes, heavy with  cinnamon and ginger in the mincemeat tradition. They ate lots of pies; the  Cornish pasty is the most authentic Elizabethan tradition at the faire, except  for the potatoes in it. They ate pease porridge (pea soup), and vegetables  suited to the English climate such as cabbage and parsnips. Bread and cheese  and ale were central to their diet.  </P> <P> More and more people are aware of this. Maybe the faire will start insisting on  more authenticity in the food booths. Maybe people will start looking forward  to the faire so they can visit the Maumenye Ryall stall, and nobody will look  for the Churros stall any more.  </P> <P> What am I saying? It wouldn't be a Renaissance Pleasure Faire without churros!  Forsooth, it wouldn't!  </P> <P>  The Renaissance Pleasure Faire runs through June 10 in San Bernadino.  </P> <P> SCONES  </P> <P> 3 cups flour  </P> <P> 3 1/4 teaspoons baking powder  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons cream of tartar  </P> <P> 1/2 cup butter  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> 1/2 cup milk  </P> <P> 1 cup golden raisins or currants  </P> <P> Sift flour, baking powder, sugar and cream of tartar into bowl.

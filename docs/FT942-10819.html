			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Biotechnology (3): Accessing the technology - Debate focuses on how best to develop drugs The conventional wisdom on biotechnology - at least the one propagated by the biotechnology industry - is that the technology will provide the next generation of blockbuster drugs. Not all pharmaceuticals groups' research directors are convinced. 'There is a bright future for biotechnology, but not as bright as you might think,' says Dr Pierre Simon, director of Elf Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals group. 'If you look at what the industry was promising 10 years ago, it's a long way behind.' Dr Simon, who says his company does not intend any more close links with biotech boutiques, says: 'It's clear that in the future some clear progress will be made in medicine through biotechnology. But biotechnology compounds are often too big and fragile. The drugs developed through biotechnology are so huge that they often have to be rejected - they won't cross the blood/brain barrier. They have to be developed to be injected. The most successful compounds are once a day oral drugs - with these drugs there's no chance of developing them for that.' In any case, argues Dr Simon, the pharmaceuticals industry is making rapid progress in the field of drug design and, using computers, can screen as many chemicals in a day as it used to be able to test in a year. 'Why produce drugs through biotechnology, when you can make the compounds through classical chemistry?' he asks. 'For the next few years we will try to mimic the products of biotechnology through classical chemistry. Through biotechnology you can identify a receptor, then the chemists can find cheaper, simpler alternatives to the biotech drug.' Although Dr Simon's non-conformist views are shared by many research chiefs in Japan, few in the western world subscribe to his views, at least in public. Many disagree. Dr William Scott, senior vice-president of exploratory drug discovery research at Bristol-Myers Squibb, explains: 'The opportunities for making better drugs are greater than ever before. In a short period of time most genes in the human body will be sequenced. Once we can identify the molecular basis of diseases, then we can begin to treat them.' X:'Biotechnology and a greater understanding of the life and death of the cell are opening up vast new scientific and medical horizons,' says Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group. 'The basic biology of cellular Mechanisms is becoming more and more understood. That biological understanding is coming mainly from outside the company, from university collaborations and small biotechnology start-ups.' However, he adds: 'Medicinal chemistry will still have an important role to play 10 years from now.' But in spite of the opportunities offered by biotechnology, considerable divergences remain among research directors and their chief executives over how best to access the new science. A few groups, such as Roche of Switzerland and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the Franco-American company, have acquired substantial stakes in biotechnology groups. Roche spent Dollars 2.1bn in 1990 on a majority stake in Genentech, while RPR acquired a 37 per cent per cent Dollars 113m stake last June in Applied Immune Systems, to gain access to its cell therapy technology. Most recently Corange signed two large deals, acquiring stakes in Protein Design Labs for Dollars 206m and CellPro for Dollars 220m. Meanwhile, Wellcome linked up with Centocor in an alliance potentially worth Dollars 100m, and SmithKline Beecham invested Dollars 125m in Human Genome Sciences. Others have set up a portfolio of small stakes or alliances in particular therapeutic areas, or even individual projects. The balance of bargaining between drugs groups and biotechnology companies has shifted markedly over the past 12 months. The collapse in the share prices of Synergen and Centocor after the US Food and Drug Administration turned down their products frightened many investors who had not realised the risks involved in biotechnology. The harshening healthcare environment has made initial public offerings more difficult for the biotechnology boutiques. In particular, the provision in President Bill Clinton's proposed healthcare reforms to control the price of new drugs has hit the biotechnology sector hard, says Bill Steere, chairman and chief executive of Pfizer of the US, and outgoing chairman of the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. 'Often a biotech company is based on the development of a single product. When it comes to the market, that product not only has to pay past research expenses but also generate enough income for the future. The biotech groups are risky enough anyway. If we end up with price controls, then private investors are naturally reluctant to make that investment,' says Mr Steere. Some pharmaceuticals groups believe they can create innovative biotechnology groups internally. Their research directors are clearly irked by the propaganda pushed by some biotechnology companies that the drugs companies are lumbering giants incapable of harnessing the revolution proffered by biotechnology. 'We've built one of the best biotech groups in the industry,' says Dr Scott at Bristol-Myers Squibb. This, he hastens to add, does not mean the company is not looking at forming alliances with biotech groups or even buying them out, but it does provide a level of expertise that allows him to make good calls when negotiating with the boutiques.</p>

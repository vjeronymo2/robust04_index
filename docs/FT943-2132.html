			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Northern Electric to shed 800 jobs Northern Electric, the power company based in Newcastle upon Tyne, is to shed 800 jobs, taking to 3,700 the planned cuts in the sector since the electricity regulator announced a review of distribution businesses last month. The losses, to be spread over three years, are part of a restructuring that will provide annual cost savings of Pounds 20m by 1997-98. The company also announ-ced a tariff cut averaging 5 per cent from December 1 and said it expected to hold prices at that level through 1995 at least. In addition the company said it expected cash flows to remain positive. It would be moving towards sharing out earnings more equally between dividend payment and company retention. The job cuts drew strong criticism from unions which said they were further evidence that electricity companies were putting the interests of shareholders above those of customers and staff. Mr Paul Gallagher, general secretary of the AEEU engineering union, said: 'It will inevitably mean that standards of service will decline. One supply company after another is laying off its workers to save money that can be passed on in dividends to its shareholders.' Northern is the fourth company to announce job losses since the regulatory review. It follows Midlands Electricity and Norweb, shedding 1,200 each, and Manweb, which is losing 500 staff. Northern reduced its core staff by about 1,000, to 4,700, between privatisation in December 1990 and the end of March this year. All job reductions would be achieved through voluntary means. Northern made no new financial provisions yesterday to fund the severances, although it did not rule out doing so in the future.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: GM to sell Allison division to German unit GENERAL Motors announced yesterday that it is to sell its Allison Transmission division to ZF Friedrichshafen, the large German manufacturer of transmission, steering and suspension products. GM announced last January that it was putting Indianapolis-based Allison up for sale as part of a plan to concentrate on its core car and truck manufacturing operations. No price was disclosed for the deal, but Allison had 1991 sales of around Dollars 850m. The subsidiary, employing around 5,000 people, makes automatic transmissions for trucks, buses, off-highway and military vehicles. GM said it would continue to rely on the company as a supplier of transmissions. Dr Klaus Bleyer, chief executive of ZF, said the deal promoted 'ZF's long-term strategy of providing world-class powertrain products to a global customer base'. The German company, which had 1991 revenues of about Dollars 3.8bn and already has a substantial manufacturing presence in the US, said it would maintain Allison's current management and workforce and would continue to manufacture in Indianapolis.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / PO heads accept idea of break-up The Post Office is ready to accept the possible break-up of the corporation by the government with the privatisation of its mail and parcels businesses, keeping counter services in the public sector. Post Office executives are also keen to see the counter services given greater commercial freedom so that they can operate more competitively. The option of breaking up the Post Office has not yet been discussed with the corporation's executives, but Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, may see it as a way out of the impasse on the Post Office's future. Keeping rural post offices in the public sector for the time being would allay fears among government backbenchers, and break-up would enable the Post Office to secure the commercial freedom it has been demanding for the mail and parcel businesses. The influential House of Commons trade and industry committee is expected to endorse today the Post Office's demand for commercial freedom to raise finance on the money markets and escape from tight Treasury financial control. MPs from all parties appear to have accepted the Post Office's argument that its activities are being hindered by its continuing lack of commercial freedom. It is more than 20 months since Mr Heseltine launched a review into the future ownership of the Post Office. Last month he told the committee that he was opposed to giving the Post Office commercial freedom in the public sector, and did not favour maintaining the corporation in its present form. The corporation told the committee there was 'a sense of approaching crisis' because the long delay over making a decision on its future had meant a cut in its investment programme. Mr Heseltine may not make an announcement about the Post Office until after the local government elections in May, or even the European elections in June, but it could come as early as just after Easter.</p>

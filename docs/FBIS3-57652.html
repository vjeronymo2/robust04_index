The president's staff is processing documents on the  creation  of yet another special service. Plans are in the works to  remove the military intelligence directorate from the Russian  Federation Federal Counterintelligence Service, and to create on  its basis a separate state security structure. This is being  done in order to place the military counterintelligence men in  control of the army directly under the president of Russia.</p>

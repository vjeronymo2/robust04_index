			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: A natural buyer - at first sight / RTZ's hunger for coal after its US deals The world's biggest mining company, RTZ Corporation, at first sight seems a natural candidate to buy some of the British Coal mines put up for sale by the government. After all, RTZ has made its strategic interest in this unfashionable fuel very clear. It spent Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 900m) on two coal businesses bought in rapid succession last year. These purchases were in the US, and making it that country's fifth largest coal producer. They were followed by a Dollars 233m deal for another US coal business, completed in April. To the uninitiated investor, the push into US coal did not look like perfect timing. It came just after President Bill Clinton had promised both new energy taxes and to clamp down more firmly on any activities which damaged the environment. But from RTZ's point of view there could not have been a better time to pounce. Coal was out of favour, and therefore cheap in relation to other minerals. And the cost was nowhere near as great as it first appeared. RTZ's biggest US acquisition was Nerco, the floundering natural resources company, previously 82 per cent-owned by PacifiCorp. RTZ quickly sold Nerco's oil and gas and gold mining interests. So its net outlay for Nerco and the second acquisition, Cordero Mining, bought from Sun Company, was in fact only Dollars 480m. And these assets then contributed Pounds 36m towards RTZ's total net profits of Pounds 287m last year, even though Nerco was included only from February onwards and Cordero did not contribute until the end of May. April's purchase of Colowyo Coal from the WR Grace group also involved some fast financial footwork. Although it was worth Dollars 233m to Grace, it cost RTZ only Dollars 13m cash. This was because RTZ did not buy some long-term coal contracts, but instead these were used for non-recourse financing to give Grace Dollars 220m before the deal was completed. So what makes US coal so attractive? According to Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, it is not only cheap, but also offers long-term, if modest, growth prospects. Before Mr Clinton's election the consensus was that electricity consumption in the US would grow by about 2 per cent a year, and that would provide 2 per cent growth for coal used by the utilities. Mr Wilson suggests there will also be important changes within coal demand as the US clean air legislation bites deeper during the rest of this decade. Coal with a high sulphur content from Illinois and the Appalachian Mountains is expected to be displaced by low-sulphur coal from the Powder River Basin which straddles Montana and Wyoming. 'So low-sulphur coal demand could grow at better than 2 per cent a year for a long time to come,' says Mr Wilson. Nerco gives RTZ two open pit, steam-coal mines in the Powder River Basin and a half share in a third. Cordero added another open pit mine nearby. More than 60 per cent of production from these mines is secured by long-term contracts, and 95 per cent of the contracts run into the next century. Mr Wilson says the mines 'are about the lowest-cost in the world', with coal typically costing only Dollars 4 a tonne to mine. This is because the deposits are thick and very little waste has to be removed before the coal can be extracted by cheap, open-pit methods. The snag is that Powder River coal has to be transported by high-cost railways up to 1,200 miles to reach customers. Also, Powder River coal might be 'clean' but it usually contains only a moderate amount of energy compared with Appalachian material. However, last month's acquisition, Colowyo, is a surface mine in north-west Colorado which adds a higher-energy coal to RTZ's US portfolio, enabling it to offer a broader range of products. RTZ's annual US coal output should rise from 37m tonnes last year to 42m tonnes in 1994. These acquisitions fit RTZ's declared philosophy of wanting a portfolio of wholly-owned, world-class, long-life, low-cost and internationally-competitive mining assets. RTZ executives privately point out that it seems unlikely anything British Coal has to offer will meet these criteria. Nevertheless, the group has gone through the pre-qualification process, paying for details of each of the five British Coal regions up for sale. The cost at Pounds 15,000 each is negligible and, as one RTZ executive said: 'How can we decide that we don't want to bid until we see the details?' Analysts suggest it is more likely that RTZ will bid for more coal in Latin America or South Africa. Mr Wilson said recently that the group would look for opportunities to buy into the internationally-traded coal business or add some value by putting some international coal trading companies together.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  told Japanese business leaders Tuesday [14 Jun] his government  is willing to allow self-service gas stations in Japan on  certain conditions, as part of deregulation, government  officials said.    Hata was responding to a proposal by Isao Nakauchi, vice  chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations  (Keidanren), that self-service gas stations be introduced in  Japan.    During the meeting at Hata's official residence, Nakauchi  also asked Hata for his leadership in implementing deregulation.    Keidanren executives handed a petition to Hata, asking him  to  cut the number of economic regulations in half over the next  five years, and map out a plan for scrapping and privatizing  government-backed corporations as well as consolidating  government departments.</p>

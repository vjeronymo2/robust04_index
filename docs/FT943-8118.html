			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Russia braced for big bankruptcies: Minister points way for tough action against indebted companies The Russian government has begun to brace the country for a painful round of big industrial bankruptcies in the state sector. Mr Oleg Soskovets, the deputy prime minister who chairs an emergency commission convened to deal with the mounting debt crisis, warned on television late on Wednesday night that 'we must not be afraid of bankruptcies.' The minister told Russians that his commission had prepared 24 draft laws to resolve the debt crisis which would be signed into law over the next few weeks. Mr Soskovets' tough but vague statements were the strongest signal yet that Russia's fragile economic reforms may weather the debt crisis largely intact. Growing inter-enterprise debt, which Mr Soskovets said amounted to Rbs90,000 billion (Pounds 27.7bn at the market rate), is the most serious test the Russian government has yet faced. If the Kremlin gives into the temptation to bail out indebted factories the country's tentative macro-economic stabilisation could be jeopardised, but allowing the factories to go bankrupt could cause widespread unemployment and trigger social unrest. 'The state must be very harsh with those companies which behave themselves badly in the transition to a market economy,' Mr Soskovets said. He referred specifically to the troubled Zil motor manufacturer, which is hoping the government will save it from looming financial ruin. But, if Mr Soskovets prevails, there will be no state salvation for the company which was once the flagship of the Russian car industry. 'There (at Zil) is an obvious lack of understanding of marketing and an inability to deal with creditors. So we cannot simply give them soft loans,' Mr Soskovets said. He warned viewers that some further contraction of Russia's already drastically reduced industrial production was inevitable in the transition to a market economy. He also rejected the notion, increasingly popular among cash-strapped factory managers, that foreign competition was the source of their travails. 'We must not be confused by some pseudo-patriotic idea about defending our markets,' said. 'The state cannot stem the inflow of foreign goods.' But while Mr Soskovets, like the Russian prime minister a former factory director, offered Russians a 25-minute flow of rhetoric which would warm the heart of even the most zealous market reformer, his address was short on details. Apart from urging Russians not to fear the term 'bankruptcy' he mentioned no specific measures the government would take to resolve the debt crisis. Moreover, neither the prime minister nor the president has yet spoken out on the issue and the most concrete step the government has taken in recent days has been to issue fresh soft loans.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the Bundestag </F> in Bonn -- live]    [Text] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; in about two  weeks, 225 million European Union [EU] citizens will be invited  to go to the polls. It must be the common aim of all democrats  and Europeans to achieve a high turnout, a clear yes in favor of  a strong European Parliament, a democratic Europe of  self-confident and coresponsible citizens. [applause] For this  reason, I would like to appeal to the voters urgently: Please  go to the polls on 12 June to help strengthen the new Europe in  those fields that are particularly important, that is, citizens'  rights and its parliament. [applause] Anyone wanting a Europe  of citizens, not a Europe of technocrats, will have to vote for  this at the voting booth, not in the pub. Anyone wanting peace  and prosperity for us Germans in a common European future, will  have to vote on 12 June and make it clear that for us there is  no return to an unfortunate, nationalist past. But above all,  and I do not hesitate to state this clearly here in the  Bundestag, right-wing extremism must not get a chance.  [applause] I am saying this as your foreign minister, because I  have to deal with the nasty picture these unfortunate happenings  in the right-wing extremist field here in Germany have generated  abroad. And I know what I am talking about. I was the one who  was standing at open graves in Turkey, experiencing the  reaction. We could take this as an example here.    Ladies and gentlemen, we should also state more clearly what  we owe the EU. Or does anyone believe that the explosion of our  prosperity, our international reputation, or our reunification  would have been possible as it has been, if we had not been a  member of this community of free European nations? Our exports  to the European Economic Area increased by double the amount of  those to the rest of the world. And there is no big industrial  country in the world that is so dependent on one single region  as Germany is on Europe. Most people are not aware of this.  [applause] We are not only the biggest net payers, but also  the biggest net exporters. And the EU welcomed our people in the  new laender immediately and with open arms, and it will support  them with more than 30 billion German marks [DM] until 1999.  This is an enormous sum from the structural funds destined for  the poorer countries in the EU. One cannot say, therefore, that  nothing comes back from this Europe, particularly to the new  laender. On the contrary. Let me also remind you that, due to  their cross-border connections, a lot of money is flowing to the  new laender from the program destined for the Central and East  European countries. I would also like to remind you that Delors  and other members of the European Commission have repeatedly  gone to the new laender to see the situation there and give  specific help with reconstruction. And please do not forget the  share that the European countries, our partners, have  contributed in terms of direct investment in the new laender.  This needs to be said as well. [applause] I have just come  back from the Baltic Sea Conference in Talinn. And I can only  tell you that the other Central and East European countries envy  us, and they are almost forcing their way into this community.  Things can, therefore, not be all that bad in this Union.    In the new European Parliament, Germany will no longer have  81, but 99 delegates. And for the first time -- this is all too  easily forgotten -- the citizens in the new laender will elect  their European Parliament members direct. And I would also like  to say, especially in my capacity as foreign minister, it befits  us Germans to return to this Europe that has shown us a lot of  solidarity, some things we have received from the EU and our  partners and friends since the end of the war. [applause]    This does not mean that we are supposed to play the  paymaster. Rather, it means that we should reject going a  special German way and bring all our weight to bear in the EU.  More than ever, it constitutes -- all the faultfinders must not  forget this -- the hope for the future for the peoples of the  whole of Central and East Europe. Looking at the international  unions, no matter whether it is the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation, NAFTA, ASEAN, or what else there is in this world  -- by the way, unions that were also established because the  others realized that one cannot manage any longer alone as a  nation -- looking at these unions and the picture of Europe, at  this EU, from the outside, we see that we are envied for this  European Community, its capacity, and what it has brought us. I  say it once again: This EU cannot be so bad! We should refrain  from criticizing this union all the time in an alarmist,  faultfinding, and defeatist way to the outside, and inside it  and -- which needs to be said -- before the election. [applause]    Of course, one can and may criticize this union. There are  undesirable developments everywhere, also in Brussels. I can  only say that many things, but not everything can be criticized  in this Europe. Indeed, I do so myself and I witness undesirable  developments every day. Some things that were overdone in the  European zeal of harmonization have to be cleared out. We  resolutely advocate that subsidiarity really results in more  free space for the citizens and the strengthening of the cities  and regions. In practice, however, this cannot be achieved  overnight.    However, it is quite a different matter if some blame one  while, in reality, mean the other. It is unfortunately true  that the rejection of European integration as a whole is  basically hidden behind some justified individual criticism. I  was also not very happy about the difficult course of the  negotiations for membership of the four countries of the  European Free Trade Association. Speaking frankly, I am  concerned when I think about the further course in taking the  Central and East European countries into this union. Sometimes  one plays with fire in this respect. We do not need to go to  Bosnia to understand this. One must be struck with blindness if  one does not realize that after its reunification, Germany needs  its neighbors' trust in its European way of thinking more than  ever before. [applause]    Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time this country is  only  surrounded by friends. We are the country in the EU with the  most neighbors. It has never been the case in our history to  surrounded only by friends. However, I also tell you that he  who wants friends has to cultivate friends. [applause]    Here our special relationship with France is very important.  It is not only the driving force behind the work of European  unification. It is, so to speak, the pledge of what Thomas Mann  called a European Germany. We do not want to exchange all that  again for a twisted course that some are propagating and that  would inevitably result again in alliances and counteralliances  in Europe. It is the priority foreign policy task of reunified  Germany to prevent this, because one can say one thing without  presumption: A joint European house, which we so much like to  talk about, can only be developed with vigorous German support.  If there is an outstanding German responsibility to history  after the fulfillment of our national dream, it is the  responsibility for this structure.    Mr. Scharping, your criticism that we do not consistently  advocate Delors' White Paper is simply wrong. Yes, you are, of  course, right that the creation of jobs is at issue. However,  because of my daily exertion, I can only tell you that we are  really making great efforts to help translate exactly Delors'  White Paper into reality. With the European action plan for  growth and development, we have set the course for the creation  of 17 million jobs in Europe by 2000 and it will be at the top  of our agenda for the European presidency. You know exactly  that what we need is Europe's new competitiveness in the world.  But what we do not need are the investment programs out of  yesterday's rag-bag because investments have to pay off and be  privately financed. We do not want a state economy. With a  view to what you have said, Mr. Scharping, I also ask you, of  course: Who continues to oppose the privatization of large  sectors of our economy? Who is calling all the time for state  spending programs? Who is inhibiting investments here and in  Europe? At any rate, it is not us. I think that this was  rightly pointed out before. The criticism that we do not feel  bound to the social market economy is wrong. For what other  reason did the FRG Government so massively advocate the social  protocol for the Maastricht Treaty? We do not accept these  reproaches! [applause]    Ladies and gentlemen; Germany will take over the EU  Presidency in over a month. France will succeed us. In more  than 20 working meetings of a special working group, French  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and I have prepared what we intend  to carry out jointly within a year of the troika. I think it is  a good opportunity for us to have a chance to work together for  a year. It is a good situation, and it is very important for  our presidency to prepare the course to be pursued until the  review conference in 1996.    Much of what is disputed among member states must be solved  in Franco-German cooperation, and it must be solved in a way  that is acceptable for all member states. It is a stroke of  luck for both nations and for the whole of Europe that we have  this close partnership. The France-German relationship must and  will be the driving force of European integration. [applause]    What will be the points on which our presidency will be  focused? First, 17 million unemployed in Europe are a problem  that overshadows everything else. So economic growth must be  achieved and new competitive jobs must be created. We will do  everything in our power to push things in Europe and in our  country. There is a ray of light and hope regarding economic  recovery not only in Germany, but also in a number of other  European countries.    The second point on which the German presidency will be  focused will be ensuring peace, prosperity, and stability on the  whole continent. With the European Parliament giving the  go-ahead for the accession of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and  Norway, the way has been paved for a larger core Europe, which  will be able to resolutely cope with the completion of European  integration. German and European interests cannot be divided in  this respect. [applause]    Neither we nor our West European partners can in the long  run  be well off, if our European neighbors in the East are badly  off. The EU's ostpolitik until the turn of the millennium must  be based on this realization. Germany will remain an advocate  of European, not West European, thought. This will be the  central task of German foreign policy in the coming years.  [applause]    Third, the strengthening of cooperation in internal and  justice policy will be a touchstone of whether our citizens see  the EU in connection with drugs and organized crime or as a gain  in personal and professional chances in life. It is  unacceptable that international drug traffickers and money  launderers should be more successful than the police.    We must combat international crime effectively, meaning  beyond the borders and within the European framework. If we do  not want to lose the people's support for our Europe policy, we  need to have concrete progress in the development of Europol and  a common asylum, refugee, and immigration policy.    But, ladies and gentlemen, speaking about internal security,  I must tell you that there is something that increasingly annoys  me. I am annoyed at the fact that the impression has been  created time and again that the problems we have in this area  could be solved through the easy way of new laws. This holds  true for the FRG and Europe. We must tell the people that this  is the wrong conclusion. I am also annoyed at the fact that the  impression has been created that the Federal Government, with  its ministers and the federal chancellor, are primarily  responsible for combating crime in this country.    I want to stress -- and I say so in view of my former  activities -- that it is primarily the laender that are  responsible for combating crime in this country, namely, the  minister-presidents and the interior and justice ministers.  [applause] It has relatively little to do with the legislative  work of the federal government, but it is a problem of practical  police work. [shouts] Yes, parliament is responsible for the  laws, but the land parliaments are also responsible, and not  just the Bundestag.    Ladies and gentlemen; in Europe today, German interests,  like  French, Italian, or British interests, are intertwined  interests. We will serve them best by bringing them in line with  those of our partners. We will be guided by this principle in  our presidency. I tell you, Germany will be closely watched as  to how it will carry out this first presidency for the old and  new federal laender on behalf of Germany.    We must work very hard, and I promise we will do everything  in our power to represent our country well to the outside world,  and we will work to advance Europe. [applause]</p>

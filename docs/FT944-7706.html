			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Titan Wheel buys into Italian companies Titan Wheel International, the Illinois-based company which is the world's largest producer of wheels for agricultural and construction equipment, has announced its first significant acquisition in Europe, writes Andrew Baxter in London. Titan, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange last year, paid L15bn (Dollars 9.4m) for 50 per cent of the Italian wheel companies Sima, Sirmac and AGM. Titan has an option to buy the remaining shares for at least another L15bn. Mr Maurice Taylor, Titan president and chief executive, said the deal was likely to be followed by further strategic acquisitions, which ultimately would create a specialist European wheel and tyre group with sales of about Dollars 300m. The Milan-based Sirmac/Sima group has been badly hit by the recession in European farm and construction equipment markets, and has been losing money, but according to Titan has one of the best wheel factories in the world. Mr Taylor says the deal would allow Titan to offer a better service to its international customers. The Italian companies would probably be combined initially with Titan's UK manufacturing and distribution centre, based in Merseyside. The deal comes four months after Titan bought the Pirelli Armstrong factory at Des Moines, Iowa, which claims 70 per cent of North American farm tyre sales.</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Another fudge from Tokyo The Japanese government looks as if it has failed to grasp the seriousness of what has become, by some measures, the country's worst recession since the second world war. After 32 months of economic slowdown or decline, the economy has failed to respond to record low interest rates and Y30,000bn (Dollars 272bn) of public spending packages. A credit squeeze is under way and several private sector economists fear a deflationary spiral. The latest batch of economic measures from Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's government, delivered just before Christmas, offers only a vague restatement of earlier promises to cut income tax and red tape. This reflects the prime minister's difficulties in keeping a fragile coalition together. Yet, the government will prolong the recession - and shorten its own life - unless it turns to more courageous solutions. Poor implementation is part of the reason why current policies are failing to work, but only a small part. The Bank of Japan has been too slow to cut interest rates, due to its wish to make sure that the bubble of the late 1980s has been fully deflated, while local government has dragged its heels in implementing infrastructure projects, not least because officials fear attracting the attention of public prosecutors by letting contracts to companies with which they have had previous contact. But the real problem is that government, along with the business establishment, has addressed only the symptom of Japan's economic malaise, weakness of demand. The underlying problems are a credit squeeze caused by the collapse in asset prices during the recession and the structural overcapacity built up in Japan's maturing industrial economy over the past decade or so. The car industry alone admits to overcapacity equivalent to the entire car market of Britain or France. Bad debts In the two years to the end of 1992, the Economic Planning Agency calculates that stock and land prices fell by a total of Y611,674bn (Dollars 5,560bn) - a collapse likened by one Tokyo economist to the effects of a war. This has saddled banks with mounting bad debts from dud property deals and weakened their own reserves, much of which are made up from unrealised equity profits. What Japan therefore needs is aggressive action to improve corporate profitability and the supply of credit. Unfortunately, many of the largest companies' markets are so mature that the only way to improve profits is to reduce break-even levels, which means wholesale job cuts. The job reductions and transfers so far have been small, and in many cases have had the effect of merely shifting costs from parent companies to subsidiaries. The state's guiding hand is still so strong in the private sector that companies are unlikely to do more without a government push. There are no signs of this. State assistance On credit, the banking industry has made great progress in writing off the bad loans exposed by the recession and in letting hopeless cases die naturally. But bad debts are still building up faster than write-offs. Here, the US experience in dealing with its savings and loans crisis shows the way. The weakest banks need state assistance, in the form of cheap credit at the official discount rate from the Bank of Japan. Encouragingly, this idea yesterday won the support of the Japan Renewal party, which sets the tone for the ruling coalition's economic policy. On top of this, the government should make it practical for banks to securitise bad loans. The Bank of Japan has dropped its former caution on securitisation and even the conservative finance ministry is now studying the idea. The government is also, sensibly, less keen than was the LDP on using public savings to support the stock market and hence banks' capital ratios. So there is hope for progress on credit. Politically, however, the signs are far from re-assuring. The coalition is limping into the new year in such a divided and fragile state that it looks incapable of delivering firm policy. Dithering over the economy has already cost Mr Hosokawa 10 percentage points in the public opinion ratings, but at 60 per cent, he still has a strong mandate. It would be a pity if it took a deeper crisis to provoke action.</p>

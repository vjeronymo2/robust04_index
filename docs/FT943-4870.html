			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Motorola to invest Pounds 250m Motorola, the US electronics group, is to invest Pounds 250m in expanding its semiconductor plant at East Kilbride, near Glasgow, to meet increasingly heavy demand for its products. The expansion will be the third, and by far the biggest the company has made at East Kilbride in the past three years. In 1992 it announced a Pounds 40m project and followed it last year with a Pounds 50m expansion, which was opened yesterday by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary. The new project involves building a further 35,000 sq ft of factory space in addition to the existing 400,000 sq ft, and adding 250 people to the plant's payroll of 2,300. The new building will begin manufacturing late next year and be in volume production in 1996. Motorola's expansion at East Kilbride is in response to growing demand for micro-controllers and digital signals products, semiconductors which are used in a wide range of products such as cellular telephones and fax machines, as well as engine controllers and smart cards. Part of the plant's increased output will go to other Motorola plants, such as its mobile telephone plant at Easter Inch in West Lothian, while the rest of the production will be sold to other manufacturers. The new facility, Motorola says, will enable the plant to produce the most powerful silicon wafers in Europe and among the most powerful in the world. It will add triple-layer metal semiconductors to the double-layer metal products it already makes at East Kilbride and increase the plant's potential to produce advanced 32 bit microprocessors. Mr Chris Galvin, Motorola's president and chief operating officer, who attended yesterday's opening of the earlier expansion, said: 'We are constantly in pursuit of excellence. 'The decision to spend this colossal sum of money in East Kilbride shows that the facility enjoys the highest reputation for quality and is a key player in the global market. Scotland is clearly an important part of the Motorola success story.'</p>

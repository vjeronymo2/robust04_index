			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter An Song-kyu] </F>   [Excerpts] A conference of cell secretaries of the North  Korean Workers Party will be held in Pyongyang late this month  for the first time since the party was founded.    According to Article No. 42 of the Workers Party regulation,  the party cell is the lowest organization composed of 5 to 30  party members from 3-million party members working throughout  plants, enterprises, cooperative farms, administrative  organizations, public organizations and military.    Article No. 41 of this regulation stipulates the mission of  the party cell as follows: The party cell is a combat unit of  the party which unites the masses with the party and which  directly executes the party's policy and lines among the masses.    The party cell secretaries are elected at a congress of the  party cells which is convened more than once every month, and  their tenure is one year. However, their total number has not  been revealed.    The National Unification Board [NUB] noted that since the  Workers Party was founded on 30 June 1949, the party congress  was held six times, the party Central Committee meeting was held  every six months, and party Political Bureau meetings, party  Standing Committee meetings and party secretaries' meetings were  held occasionally. However, the convocation of a conference of  cell secretaries of the party is the first of its kind in the  history of the Workers Party.    As this conference will be held for the first time, the  people's attention is focused on the background of holding the  conference. However, North Korea made public only the fact of  holding the conference and stereotypical agenda for discussion.  [passage omitted]    The NUB believes that this exceptional "conference of cell  secretaries of the party" has something to do with the current  situation strained surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue.  In other words, North Korea will take advantage of the situation  strained by the rupture of the North-South contact and by the  moves of the international community for sanctions against North  Korea for consolidating its system.    It is also likely that North Korea will stress the necessity  of ideological struggle during the conference of cell  secretaries of the party in a bid to prevent residents' wavering  to be caused by economic difficulties in the event that the  pressure is increasing on North Korea, thus attempting to  disseminate the necessity of struggle to the people through the  party's cell organizations.</p>

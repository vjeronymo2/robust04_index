			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with German Republikaner leader Franz Schoenhuber </F> by Andrea Tarquini; place and date not given: "The Wind From  the Right Will Blow Throughout Europe"]    [Text] Bonn -- Republikaner leader Franz Schoenhuber  is the only German political exponent to be satisfied with the  results in Rome. A former Nazi SS shock trooper, he currently  risks being brought to trial. The magistrature is considering  this possibility because, following the attack on the Luebeck  synagogue, he confirmed that, in his opinion, Jewish community  leader Ignatz Bubis was an instigator of ethnic hatred and  responsible for antisemitism.    [Tarquini] What do you think of the vote in Italy?    [Schoenhuber] It is the beginning of a Europewide turn to  the  Right, which will be particularly marked in East Europe.    [Tarquini] Why in the East particularly?    [Schoenhuber] Because, having traveled widely from Russia to  the Baltic, and Ukraine, I am convinced that a national ethos  will play an increasingly important role, especially in the  East. This will also be a reaction, on the part of national  consciousness, against communist internationalism; and I believe  that, in general, Europe as a whole is looking to the Right.    [Tarquini] Why?    [Schoenhuber] It seems to me that the Christian parties, in  particular, have lost all credibility. They have lied to the  people for decades, and they must now pay for the consequences,  as happened in Italy.    [Tarquini] Do you believe National Alliance will play a  leading role in government?    [Schoenhuber] I cannot tell from here, as a German. I can  only say that my fellow members of the European Parliament in  Strasbourg who are in the MSI [Italian Social Movement], are  democratic and reasonable, and they have all my respect.    [Tarquini] Are you hoping that there will be repercussions  in  Germany?    [Schoenhuber] The political situation in Germany will  become,  in a sense, italianized. In our country, the establishment  parties will also have to foot the bill, though it may not be as  steep as in Italy. They have received an ominous message from  the Italian elections.    [Tarquini] What sort of Italy and what sort of Germany do  you  expect to see two years from now?    [Schoenhuber] To begin with, a democratic Italy and a  democratic Germany, with a stronger national consciousness. The  way that Italians are trying to solve their political problems  is setting an example throughout Europe. Secondly, the  traditional and left-wing party alignments are now outdated in  the whole continent.    [Tarquini] Does the right turn involve the risk of social  tensions?    [Schoenhuber] Life is full of risks in itself. You cannot  live without risks, but they must be calculated risks.    [Tarquini] Do you believe that it is correct to reopen  territorial questions in Europe, including, say, Alto Adige and  former German territories in the East?    [Schoenhuber] The territorial question will be posed, though  democratically. There is no room in my party for advocates of an  Alto Adige annexation. I am demanding the right of every people  to self-determination, not annexations.</p>

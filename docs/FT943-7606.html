			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: New York As expected, the Federal Reserve moved aggressively against inflation last week by pushing short-term interest rates up  1/2 percentage point. This was just what the bond market wanted, because anything less would have been seen as insufficient to stifle the threat of inflation. Initially, bond prices rose. However, within a couple of trading sessions the gains were wiped out as the market became spooked by fresh inflation fears. The concerns stem partly from data in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's August Business Outlook Survey and partly from another pasting for the dollar. Consequently, the market is already fixated on the question of how long it will be before the next interest rate rise becomes due. Traders tend to the view that the Fed will hold back at least until November, which should help support the market for the time being. However, the risk remains that the least sign of inflationary pressures could batter prices. Will that happen this week? Probably not, for there is little economic data for investors to get their teeth into. Figures on Wednesday are expected to show that new orders for durable goods edged up 0.4 per cent in July, while Salomon Brothers believes revised GDP data could show a rise of 4.2 per cent in the second quarter, 0.5 percentage points higher than the provisional figure of 3.7 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Kuzmin] </F>   [Text] Tehran, 16 Jun -- Russia will provide assistance in  completing the construction of the nuclear power station near  the town of Bushehr in the south of the country. At present  Russian specialists are completing the technical research. It  is expected the power station, which is to produce one seventh  of Iran's demand in electricity, will be ready for operation in  five years' time.    The construction of the nuclear power station was started in  the seventies by two German companies, however it was stopped  before the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war. The Iranian  leadership wavered for a long time as to whether it would be  expedient to complete the construction, but when Tehran decided  in an affirmative way Germany abdicated its commitments because  of fears that the nuclear program might acquire a military  direction.    IAEA inspections to the Bushehr nuclear power station did  not  confirm the fears.    In addition to participating in the construction of the  nuclear power station, Russia will receive a contract to build a  gas-fired thermal power station in the same region. According  to political observers, new Iranian-Russian relations in the  field of power engineering will boost bilateral cooperation in  the political and economic spheres and will also bring to Russia  hard currency it so badly needs.</p>

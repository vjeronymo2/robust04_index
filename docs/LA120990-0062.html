			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER REPORT: HOW TO HANDLE THE SLIPPERY SLOPES OF CHOOSING THE RIGHT SKI  VACATION;  </P> <P> PACKAGES: THERE ARE MANY DEALS AVAILABLE AS RESORTS AND AIRLINES COMPETE FOR  BUSINESS. SKIERS SHOULD DEFINE THEIR NEEDS AND ASK PLENTY OF QUESTIONS.  </P> <P> For the uninformed, purchasing a ski vacation may be as complicated as  purchasing a vehicle. Many considerations cloud the dream.  </P> <P> With more than 25 major resorts in the West alone, and with a variety of  packagers competing for the skier's dollar, skiers should know which questions  to ask so they won't be disappointed when a resort doesn't turn out to be what  was expected.  </P> <P> "It's important to know what you want out of a ski vacation and articulate that  when purchasing a package in order to make an appropriate choice," says Holly  Rouillard of the Colorado Tourism Board.  </P> <P> Do you want a self-contained ski community designed for the skiing family,  where every expense can be charged to the room and where nursery and teen  centers help free parents to enjoy their vacation? Or is big name glitz and  night life as important as the skiing?  </P> <P> Do you want a taste of the Old West, perhaps a mining town-turned-resort with  Victorian relics tucked in the Rockies, remote from the fast lane and immune  from lift lines? Or do you want to station yourself in the center of several  ski areas where you can ski a different resort each day?  </P> <P> When you know your own needs, the next step is to learn the options. In the  fall, most metropolitan areas have consumer ski shows where ski areas and trip  packagers display their offerings. Ask them about the ambience of the town, the  vertical drop of the ski area, the ratio of beginner to intermediate and  advanced runs, the percentage of the mountain groomed nightly, the average  weekend lift line wait, child-care facilities, the months when good skiing is  expected -- and begin making comparisons of what you find.  </P> <P> Ski packages generally fall into three categories:  </P> <P>  -- Resort packages covering lodging, lift tickets and possibly lessons, sold  directly by the resort;  </P> <P>  -- Ground packages covering lodging, lift tickets and transfers to and from an  airport;  </P> <P>  -- Complete packages, including air fare.  </P> <P> The last two types are packaged by airlines or travel wholesalers and sold  directly at consumer ski shows, through travel agencies or by calling toll-free  numbers advertised in newspaper travel sections and ski magazines, sporting  goods stores and ski shows.  </P> <P> Although all full-service travel agencies can book ski packages, smaller ones  may book so few that they may not be too familiar with the variety offered.  More important, they may know very little about ski jargon -- for example,  whether a 1,500-foot vertical mountain would be challenging to an advanced  skier for a full week or would completely bore him or her by the second day.  </P> <P> Thus, it might be better for the skier unfamiliar with a resort to book through  a specialty packager and get information directly from the ski industry.  </P> <P> Ski packagers usually offer slightly reduced air fare and accommodations  because they deal in volume.  </P> <P> Colorado and Utah have marketing associations that disseminate a wealth of  information in their ski planning guides. The guide produced by the Ski Utah  group covers 14 resorts, while Colorado Ski Country describes 28. Information  listed includes location and distance from airport, terrain description, season  schedule, elevation and vertical drop, average snowfall, lift ticket and lesson  rates, special services such as nursery and children's ski school, and lodging  options. "The average savings of trip packages over individually priced items  is generally 5% to 10%, but that increases dramatically for trips booked far in  advance or at the last minute, when there is additional discounting," said  Marty Melcher, director of Advance Reservations, a Park City, Utah-based ski  trip packager.  </P> <P> For example, a three-night package at the Stein Eriksen Lodge in Deer Valley,  Utah, including lift tickets, air fare, ground transportation and lodging, is  priced at $649 until next Sunday. Priced separately, the same items total  $1,005.  </P> <P> According to Melcher, on a weeklong trip the average skier pays $170 per day on  individually priced items, compared to $140 per day for the average package.  </P> <P> "But more than price, the advantage of ski packages is in the simplicity," says  Andrew Mathieson, senior product planner for United Airlines, which packages a  number of ski trips primarily in the West, called "Instant Vacations Ski  Packages."  </P> <P> Skiers should make sure that they understand any packager's cancellation  policy. Although there is no industry standard for cancellations, here are some  things to remember:  </P> <P>  -- If the major portion of the resort is not operational due to lack of snow,  the resort usually refunds that part of the package covering lift tickets.  </P> <P>  -- As for the accommodations themselves, cancellations rarely occur without  charge. Policies generally depend on length of prior notice. Some may not offer  refunds; others may charge an administrative fee of $100 and refund the rest  only if they can re-book the room. Still others give a credit for future use, a  policy often followed by airlines, too.  </P> <P>  -- In order to eliminate potential difficulties, most trip packagers advise  taking out cancellation insurance. For a nominal fee ($20 for a typical $500  ground transportation package), the insurance carrier will grant full refunds  if the buyer shows proper cause -- usually a medical or business emergency, not  just poor snow conditions.  </P> <P>  -- If air fare is included in the package, a credit is usually given rather  than a full refund, even with insurance.  </P> <P> Skiers should be aware of the risks when booking the early or late season.  Unfortunately, it is precisely those high-risk times that are good buys. Many  resorts have four price ratings for accommodations, depending on time of  season.  </P> <P> It's important that skiers always ask these questions before booking a ski  package:  </P> <P>  -- What exactly is included? Lessons? Interchangeable lift tickets?  Airport-to-resort transportation? Lodging tax?  </P> <P>  -- Is there a refund for unused lift tickets? What non-ski activities are  available?  </P> <P>  -- How convenient are the lodgings? Is it a ski-in/ski-out facility where no  transportation is needed? If so, how far a walk is it? Uphill? Should one rent  a car? If so, is the car part of the package? Is it "winterized?" Is there a  free shuttle to the lifts? Does the lodging have free airport pickup service?  </P> <P>  -- What amenities are available at the lodgings? Ski lockers? Jacuzzi and  pool? Teen game room? Maid service? Laundry? Is there a grocery store and range  of restaurants within walking distance? Or is there only a lodge dining room?  In the mountains, especially without a vehicle, one must not assume anything.  </P> <P>  -- Is equipment rental included in the package or is a discount offered with  the package?  </P> <P>  -- For packages that include air transportation, if the plane must land  elsewhere due to storms, who pays the additional ground transportation costs?  Who pays for overnight lodging if any is needed? If a day's skiing is missed,  is there a refund of lodging and lift tickets?  </P> <P>  -- How reputable is the packager? It all adds up to this: The more you know,  not only before you go, but before you choose where to go, the better time  you'll have. Be aware that terms such as "deluxe," "close," "ski-in/ski-out,"  "some obstacles on the slopes" and "just cause for cancellation" have no  standard interpretation.  </P> <P> For more information:  </P> <P> Ski Utah, 307 W. 200 South, Suite 1003, Salt Lake City, Utah 84101, (801)  534-1779.  </P> <P> Colorado Ski Country, 1560 Broadway, Suite 1440, Denver, Colo. 80202, (303)  837-0793.

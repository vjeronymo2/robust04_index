			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORMONE UNBOUNDED  </P> <P> Rainer is so right about Hollywood's nonsensical misreading of Joseph  Campbell's book on mythical heroes.  </P> <P> This virus of the Lucas/Spielberg strain escaped from USC in the early '80s and  has been wreaking havoc since.  </P> <P> When I was a "development person" and traveled extensively in that crowd, I was  constantly amazed at the way my cohorts would justify the most worthless,  exploitative trash by a reference to that misunderstood book.  </P> <P> The problem with a lot of the people in the industry is that they know a lot  about "product" and "myth," but not much about life or art.  </P> <P> TOM SILVESTRI  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Sales rise points to slow recovery by US economy US ECONOMIC reports yesterday provided further evidence of a slow recovery from recession. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.9 per cent in cash terms last month, and by 4.4 per cent in the year to April. This was a stronger performance than expected, but figures for March were revised down substantially to show a fall of 1 per cent rather than 0.4 per cent. After seasonal adjustment, the April increase left sales slightly lower than in February. Consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 3.2 per cent in the year to April, indicating that resumed economic growth is not yet putting upward pressure on inflation. Figures for producer prices released this week were also subdued. Following the report on Friday of a bigger-than-expected rise in payroll employment last month, the sales figures appear to confirm a gradual improvement in the economy. Some analysts, however, remain worried that growth of personal incomes will be too weak to support continued sales growth at the April pace. The jump in sales was seen a reducing, but not eliminating, the chance of another small cut in interest rates. The Federal Reserve remains concerned by very sluggish growth of the money supply. The retail improvement was led by car sales, which rose 2.9 per cent last month and by more than 10 per cent relative to April last year. Excluding cars, retail sales rose 0.4 per cent in April. Sales of building materials and clothing were also strong last month. Excluding food and energy, which tend to be volatile, 'core' consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent last month, the lowest increase since January. Annualised core inflation is running at just under 4 per cent.</p>

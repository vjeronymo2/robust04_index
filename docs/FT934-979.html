			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / South Korean leader replaces 14 ministers South Korean President Kim Young-sam replaced his top economic planner and 13 other ministers yesterday in a reshuffle designed to restore his credibility after breaking campaign promises to keep the rice market closed, Reuter reports from Seoul. Transport minister Chung Jai-suk replaced Lee Kyung-shick as deputy premier and economic planning board chief. Mr Chung's promotion made room at transport for Mr Oh Myung, former communications minister and chief organiser of the 1993 Taejon world expo. A presidential spokesman said the moves were made in the light of the Gatt world trade pact, to 'concentrate national energies and strengthen the economy through full-fledged reforms now that a new world economic order is being shaped'. Under Gatt, South Korea agreed gradually to open its politically sensitive rice market from 1995, sparking widespread protests by farmers and students. The way for the reshuffle was cleared last Thursday when Mr Hwang In-sung resigned as prime minister, saying he took the blame for failure to prevent the market opening. He was replaced by Mr Lee Hoi-chang, who has spearheaded President Kim's anti-corruption drive. Contrary to expections, Mr Kim retained finance minister Hong Jae-hyong and trade minister Kim Chul-su, moves seen as a desire to maintain economic policies. The new unification minister is Lee Yung-dug, a professor at a Seoul university who once served as a chief negotiator in talks with North Korea. Mr Rhee Byoung-tae, a former general who previously headed the agency for patriots and veterans affairs, became the new defence minister in place of Kwon Young-hae. The defence ministry has recently been under fire for an alleged multi-million dollar arms procurement swindle. Mr Choi Hyung-woo, regarded as one of Kim's closest confidants, became the new interior minister, replacing Mr Lee Hae-koo.</p>

Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described in Section III.D.2.a and b of this preamble,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and trucks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (LDTs) represented significant fractions of the total VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission inventories in the three FIP areas in 1990. Light-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles have remained a major source of emissions even though  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards for light-duty vehicle exhaust hydrocarbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions have dropped more than 90 percent since 1970. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuing high emissions derive from increases in VMT, the long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life of vehicles in the temperate California climate and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure of many current in-use vehicles to meet the standards to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which they are certified when new.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California has adopted very stringent light-duty vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission certification standards known as the LEV program. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program will assure that new vehicles sold in California will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have very low emissions. This will be accomplished through use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of advanced emission controls and a new onboard diagnostic (OBD)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement which is intended by CARB to identify for the driver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the repair technician whenever an emission control system has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degraded sufficiently to increase emissions 50 percent above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA expects the California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program will substantially reduce emissions of cars and light-duty trucks, compared to the federal standards. However, despite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of advanced technologies and the OBD requirements, CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects LEVs will exceed their certification standards in-use,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although, for the reasons noted in Section III.D.1.a(2), by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much smaller margin than has occurred in the past. Emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above the certification standards, referred to as excess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions, will occur because some models may experience more in-use deterioration than expected, or because individual vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience component failure or improper maintenance which is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately corrected by the various existing in-use compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, including enhanced I/M. Because the magnitude of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reductions needed for attainment is so great, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adoption of further measures to reduce these remaining excess in-use emissions will help reach attainment of the ozone standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is therefore seeking comments on the need for and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits of adopting an enhanced in-use compliance program which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would provide extra emission reductions above and beyond the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial reduction provided by the California LEV program, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause in-use emissions to approach the certification standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that much of the responsibility to ensure low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use emissions must rest with vehicle manufacturers, since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners, although they have a significant part to play cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure performance that is not available from the hardware.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Traditionally, the incentive for manufacturers to build emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> durability into their vehicles has been limited. Owners do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the ability, nor often the interest, to ensure their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions control equipment is performing properly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section presents EPA's proposed enhanced in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance program for LDVs, LDTs and certain medium-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles (MDVs). MDVs, as defined by CARB, have a gross vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight rating (GVWR) between 6000 and 14,000 pounds. For those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MDVs above 8500 pounds GVWR, CARB gives manufacturers the option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of certifying as a specific and complete vehicle, or as a heavy-duty engine which can be placed in any heavy-duty vehicle. Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MDVs certified as complete vehicles are much more analogous to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LDVs and LDTs than heavy-duty engines, chassis-certified MDVs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being included here in the enhanced in-use compliance program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light-duty vehicles and trucks. The enhanced in-use compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs for heavy-duty engines and nonroad engines are similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in purpose and are presented in Sections B. and C. of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The light-duty enhanced in-use compliance program attempts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to encourage manufacturers to build additional durability into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their emission control equipment by increasing the manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for repairing problem vehicles identified by the inspection and maintenance (I/M) and recall programs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I/M program is revised by shifting responsibility for repair to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers if a significant percentage of vehicles are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing close to certification levels in use. The potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility shift should encourage manufacturers to build  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional durability and improved repairability into their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles. The lower allowable I/M emission levels will ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that vehicles are repaired if not performing satisfactorily.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the recall program is extended for the full useful life and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all vehicles are tested and included provided they have not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obviously tampered or abused. Additionally, MDV emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are reduced as significantly as light-duty standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have already been reduced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. New Vehicle Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New vehicle certification, and particularly the associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards, play an important role in defining the types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of emission control hardware placed on vehicles. These standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also essentially define the best level of emission control that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be expected from in-use vehicles. The majority of current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use emissions come not from vehicles meeting their emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, but from vehicles which exceed their standards. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the CARB LEV program with enhanced I/M will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially reduce the occurrence of vehicles which exceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their standards by a substantial margin. However, emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predictions indicate that on average vehicles will not meet their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards in use. Therefore, the focus of EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed enhanced in-use compliance program is on two programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recall and I/M, which can provide additional incentives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle manufacturers to build the lowest emitting vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible. However, no changes to CARB's motor vehicle control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program are necessary to implement these two approaches to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced in-use compliance program for new LDVs, LDTs and MDVs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing that the enhanced in-use compliance program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be applied to all new vehicles that are defined under California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations as passenger cars, light-duty trucks, or medium-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles, beginning in model year 1999. This would include all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-highway vehicles up to 14,000 pounds GVWR, with the exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of those MDVs which are certified as engines under both CARB's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program and EPA's enhanced in-use compliance program described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section B. Any of these vehicles offered for sale or first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered in California would need to comply with the enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use standards described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

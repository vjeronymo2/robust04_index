			<p>BFN     [Text] Chairman of the Moldovan parliament Pyotr Luchinsky  said that his republic is not considering entry in the EURASIAN  Union. In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX, he said that the  Republic is now considering other issues, such as the creation  of parliamentary structures, the formation of a new government  and the structure of executive power.    As for the proposal of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev  to create a EURASIAN Union, in Luchinsky's opinion, the  implementation of this idea is unlikely under present conditions.    Luchinsky believes that it infringes upon the independence  of  the new independent states.    "Moldova stands for economic cooperation with all countries  and intends to ratify the agreements within the framework of the  CIS and the economic union, but we will not create joint  political and military structures," Luchinsky said.</p>

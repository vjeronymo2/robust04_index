			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil's Hill of Gold digs deeper for a secure future A BATTLE is on to lengthen the life of Brazil's biggest primary gold mine, Morro do Ouro, or the Hill of Gold, which is also one of the lowest grade gold mines in the world - two tonnes of ore has to be processed to liberate one gram of the precious metal. Even so, it has been a profitable venture since it was brought into operation at the cost of USDollars 65m in 1988 because the rock is very soft and the gold comes out easily. Last year MdO contributed more than Pounds 8m to the net profits of RTZ, the UK group which owns 51 per cent and operates the mine, up from Pounds 6m in 1991. A Brazilian company, Autram, owns the rest of MdO. The mine produced 166,600 troy ounces of gold in 1992, slightly up from the 165,900 ounces the previous year. But, as MdO goes deeper, the rock is getting harder; last year Dollars 13m of plant modifications were completed to treat harder ore. These modifications should enable the mine to maintain a production rate only slightly below that of 1992. The target for this year is 162,750 ounces of gold. Now the mine management, working with RTZ Mineracao, the UK group's Brazilian holding company, is looking for ways to extend the life of the mine beyond 2001. At stake are the 445 jobs directly provided by the mine and another 448 provided by the mining contractor. Mr Ludovico Costa, general manager, is sure costs can be reduced further, even though the mine's cash operating costs have already come down from Dollars 258 an ounce in 1988 to Dollars 170. Last year costs were reduced partly by negotiating a new contract with the mining contracting company - which agreed to cut charges by 30 per cent to retain the work - and by the introduction of new mining methods. These do away with all blasting of ore, which is now simply scrapped up by conventional bulldozers. This change also eliminates one source of friction with residents of Paracatu, only a mile from the mine, some of whom complained the blasting was damaging their property. Lower costs would enable rock with even less gold in it to be processed economically, so that perhaps three tonnes would be treated to produce one gram of gold. There is also gold in sulphide rock which, if it could be economically treated, would extend the mine's life to 2014. A pilot plant at the mine has shown the ore can be treated to give up its gold but MdO still has to find an economic way of dealing with the sulphuric acid that would be generated. Another possibility is for ore from satellite deposits, with similar ore from nearby, to be processed into a concentrate, an intermediate material, that could be trucked to the nearby mine for further upgrading. Malaysian tin miners, in a desperate bid to bolster record low prices, want export curbs on major producers to be scrapped, a move that is likely to win government backing, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.</p>

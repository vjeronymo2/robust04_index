			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Housing recovery aids NHS funds The recovery in the housing market has enabled health authorities to raise additional funds by selling unwanted hospital sites to builders. Barratt, Britain's third-largest housebuilder, and Watford-based Country &amp; Metropolitan Homes yesterday announced a joint Pounds 100m development plan at Highlands Hospital at Enfield, north London, which is to close. The hospital services will be transferred over the next three years to the nearby Chase Farm hospital. The land has been bought by the developers from the New River Health Authority. Country &amp; Metropolitan said that outline planning permission to construct about 1,000 homes and community facilities had been 'granted in principle' by Enfield Borough Council. As part of the agreement with the council the company has been asked to pay Pounds 1.8m towards a new junior and infants school. There are plans to refurbish some of the older Victorian hospital buildings as private-sector flats and social housing for the Metropolitan Housing Trust. A rise in new-house sales last year prompted builders, which had run down their stock of land during the recession, to resume buying development sites. Hospitals which have large tracts of unwanted land, due to a switch in emphasis in the health service away from hospitals to community-based care, have been natural targets for house-builders. Commercial property developers are also expected to show interest in some of the large city-centre hospitals earmarked for closure in London and elsewhere. Housing land prices in southern England, where a number of hospitals are threatened with closure, have risen by up to a quarter since the beginning of last year.</p>

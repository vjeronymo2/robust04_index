			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Yugoslav foes become brothers in arms sales THE Serb-controlled Yugoslav army and the republic of Croatia, until recently at each other's throats, have joined forces to produce weapons for export. Serbian and Croatian media this week confirmed that Djuro Djakovic, a weapons factory in Croatia, will honour a Dollars 300m two-year contract for the delivery of 200 M-84 tanks to Kuwait. The Yugoslav federal office which oversees arms sales said the outbreak of war had prevented Yugoslavia from fulfilling the contract, Borba, a Belgrade daily, reported yesterday. Vjesnik, the Zagreb daily, said Croatia would receive Dollars 300,000 of the Dollars 1.5m price of each tank. The tanks are assembled in Djuro Djakovic, in Slavonski Brod town midway between the Croatian capital Zagreb and the Serbian capital Belgrade. The newspaper said 1,000 factories from all the republics of the former Yugoslav federation contribute parts for the M-84s. Vjesnik cited 'numerous problems' in deliveries from Bosnia-Hercegovina, where road blocks have become routine. It said Serbia 'irregularly' delivers parts due to a government embargo and suspicions that the tanks may used by the Croat army rather than exported to Kuwait. General Antun Tus, the chief of staff of the Croat forces, admitted it may 'sound paradoxical that warring countries are in this joint business of production and export of weapons to a third country'. But he insisted there was no danger because the tanks were entirely under Croatian control.</p>

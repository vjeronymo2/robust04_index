			<p>BFN     [Text] On 11 May in Poptun, Peten, Defense Minister  Division General Mario Rene Enriquez Morales said the Guatemalan  Army anticipates major problems after the government and the  Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] sign peace  agreements, probably next December.    "Peace might be around the corner, but we are living one of  the most decisive and pivotal moments in Guatemalan history;  consequently, political and military efforts are necessary in  order to consolidate a long-desired peace in this nation,"  Enriquez Morales stated during the commencement of the 42d class  of Kaibiles [Guatemalan counterinsurgency troops] in Poptun,  Peten. Over 40 Guatemalan, Mexican, and Salvadoran soldiers  received the Kaibil rank under the motto: "If I go forward,  follow me. If I stop, hurry me up. If I go back, kill me."    Enriquez Morales believes the end of the internal armed  confrontation will cause serious problems. These problems, he  asserted, will go beyond mere political bounds because a high  level of misinformation exists and will prevail. He stressed  that, as a result, the URNG will want to come out the front door  [salir en caballo blanco], which will hinder national unity.    Regarding the coming meeting between the government and the  URNG in Oslo, Norway, scheduled for late May, Enriquez Morales  said: "Let us hope there is political will on the part of the  URNG to be able to sign, once and for all, a peace agreement by  the end of 1994."    Enriquez Morales, accompanied by the other members of the  Army's high command, decorated over 40 Guatemalan, Mexican, and  Salvadoran soldiers during the ceremony. These soldiers spent  two months in Peten's jungle and earned the Kaibil rank. The  commencement was held at the Kaibil Special Operations Center,  located in the Zaculeu Plaza, known as Poptun's Hell [Infierno  de Poptun]. Enriquez Morales added that the Army will reject a  reduction of its troops so long as they are prepared to join the  UN-led international peace security forces or blue helmets.</p>

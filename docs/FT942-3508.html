			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Klockner to buy 'just over 50%' of group Klockner &amp; Co, the German trading company, plans to buy 'just over 50 per cent' of Computer 2000, a fast-growing German software and hardware distributor. The company it had not bought any Computer 2000 shares in the open market and had no plans to do so, according to a statement yesterday. The statement followed an announcement of the barest details of the plan late on Friday after the Computer 2000 share price had risen sharply during the day. Klockner said the controlling holding would be purchased from the Colonia insurance group and a private shareholder, Mr Arend Oetker. The parties to the deal had agreed not to release any financial details, although Computer 2000 is worth an estimated DM400m (Dollars 240m) at current share prices. Klockner, a trading subsidiary of the Viag conglomerate, said the purchase marked its entry into a new business sector, although its new subsidiary, one of the biggest distributors in the European computer industry, would continue to operate as a free-standing enterprise. This suggests that Computer 2000 is likely to continue the aggressive expansion programme which has characterised its progress since it was founded in 1983. Computer 2000's long-declared aim has been to generate sales of DM10bn by the year 2000. Turnover grew 54 per cent last year to DM2.8bn, and rose 40 per cent to DM1.94bn in the first six months of the current year. The deal is expected to be rubber-stamped at a meeting of the supervisory board next month and although it has yet to be approved by the federal cartel office, no objections are expected.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Recruitment: Nursing time for boardroom babes - Companies are exploring new ways of using non-executive directorships to develop talent One of the most visible consequences of the Cadbury report on corporate governance has been the impact on the recruitment of non-executive directors. The number of UK directorships within UK listed companies has grown markedly in the last year. Some estimates put the total at between 7,000 and 8,000. I have been unable to obtain a breakdown that shows how many individuals are sharing those posts but the ratio of jobs to people appears to be decreasing as it becomes less and less acceptable to collect them like scout badges. Cadbury has opened a seam of lucrative business that the recruitment industry has not been slow to exploit. But the fees have to be earned and the Cadbury recommendations suggest there is room for new players to extend the range of suitable candidates. If Cadbury's insistence that a non-executive director should add value to a company is to be taken seriously, it should spell the end for traditional methods of recruitment. The telephone call to a chum and a measure of gin and geniality over lunch at the club are becoming the exception rather than the rule. 'It is no longer acceptable for a company to approach its merchant bank for a recommendation. This is a serious appointment and should be treated seriously,' says Sir Adrian Cadbury. 'What companies need to to do is to look at the board they have, set out the kind of background, experience and age of the person required, and ask themselves what is going to add value to the board. That focuses the search so they are looking for a particular kind of candidate.' The unfocused approach whereby a non-executive chairman might be recruited in the image of the chief executive can prove a dangerously comforting accompaniment to potentially disastrous decisions. How many times have non-executive directors failed to spot the danger signals? Delay or inaction was apparent in cases such as BCCI, Maxwell, Polly Peck, Tiphook, Queens Moat and Spring Ram. A more questioning approach in these cases may have stopped the rot at an earlier stage. The job can no longer be a free lunch in the diary taken in the spirit of acquiescence. In the US, the non-executive is termed an independent, and deservedly so, as he or she has helped to influence a series of celebrated boardroom oustings. What makes a good non-executive director? Sir Adrian says: 'You want people committed to the company but you want them to be questioning. It is knowing what question to ask and knowing how to engineer the answer that is important.' Where you should look may depend on how much you want to pay. Sir Adrian, chairman of ProNed, the former Bank of England non-executive selection operation now joined with Egon Zender, the international headhunting firm, says that typically ProNed would supply five or six names that fitted the specification. Since they are drawn from a list of people willing to serve on boards, the company can make an initial choice without causing embarrassment. Avoiding embarrassment, a peculiarly British disease, is still an important selling point for services such as ProNed. Headhunting companies are also aware of the pitfalls, but the desire for complete discretion, like the old boys' network, may be fading. The Institute of Directors maintains a register of 3,000 names, mainly of people in executive or executive chairman posts. Guided by the client's specifications, names are sifted from a database. 'This method means that most of these people will have no connection with the company,' says Alex Lamb, head of board development at IoD. True independence, prized by Sir Adrian, is an ideal that still has some way to go to overtake reality but changes appear to be accelerating. Colin St Johnston, the managing director of ProNed, says that 93 per cent of all listed companies had non-executive directors at his count last June and he believes that proportion may have increased. While 12 years ago, when ProNed was formed, some 80 per cent of non-executives would have had some previous connection with the company, the figure is now nearer 20 per cent. 'There is still a long way to go to ensure the selection process is thorough and professional and does not use various networks,' says St Johnston. 'But the biggest companies are now being much more thorough and it is no longer good enough for the board to write down names of people considered appropriate.' Inevitably, many lists begin to look familiar, but there are new initiatives that may help break up the non-executive merry-go-round by applying more imagination to the selection process. Hanson Green, a headhunter specialising in the non-executive market, has set up the Annexe Scheme; a sort of kindergarten for independent directors, drawing promising young executives from leading companies and placing them in non-executive boardroom positions. The client in this case is not the company that receives the appointment, but the provider company which pays a Pounds 10,000 fee. 'For this and the sacrifice of perhaps 12 days a year, they are able to provide the sort of practical boardroom experience for their most promising people in a completely different corporate culture,' says John Brill, of Hanson Green. While the hiring company will not have the experience of an old head, it will gain enthusiasm and a fresh approach from a talented individual who will typically be a managing director of a subsidiary. The Annexe scheme is breaking the mould, claims Brill, providing access to relatively unknown people who are not quite ready to move up from subsidiaries but who have sufficient experience to attract attention within a large group. The suppliers can be enthusiastic recruiters too. Shortly after Hanson Green placed Harry Richardson, a director of EDS Scicon, part of Electronic Data Systems the information technology company, at Fletcher King, the publicly quoted firm of chartered surveyors, Mark Sketchley - the corporate fiance director at Robert Fleming - was given a non-executive directorship at EDS Scicon. Annexe has about 50 candidates on its books and has placed about 20. If Annexe is a nursery, then an even newer organisation called Prowess is perhaps offering something nearer a baby- walking service in terms of status and youth (some of its candidates are barely 30), although that fails to reflect the quality of learning experience it provides. Prowess works on a subscription basis. For about Pounds 10,000 a year, companies join something like a club which enables them to farm out those with fast track management potential to non-executive positions in other companies or in the public sector. National Health Service Trusts are an enthusiastic supporter of the service. Organisations such as British Airways, Cable and Wireless, Kingfisher, Ernst and Young, the NHS and the Department of Employment are sponsoring the scheme and others have expressed interest. Mark Scott, financial director of Prowess, sees the organisation as helping to extend the pool of potential non-executives of the future while broadening the experience of young executives. It has also specifically looked at women and ethnic minorities which Scott believes are pools of under-utilised talent. Prowess emphasises that, unlike Annexe, it does not place individuals, but handles the recruitment requirements of sponsors by tapping the talent of other sponsors. If specifications cannot be met by that method, it employs executive search. The importing company then pays a recruiting fee of 20 per cent of the intended director's salary. Prowess is in a different market from the top search companies who might charge Pounds 30,000 for placing a non-executive director - a very large proportion of salary. ProNed's service is cheaper, about Pounds 15,000 for each non-executive.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Chinese stock exchanges consider computer links THE Shanghai Stock Exchange may attempt to unify with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong. China's official Xinhua news agency quoted the Shanghai exchange president, Mr Wei Wenyuan, as saying he would 'enhance links' with the Shenzhen stock market. He suggested that a joint computer system would expand the business of both markets and erase some problems for investors. Currently, the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets operate independently and under different rules. Shanghai operators have previously indicated an interest in bridging co-operation with Shanghai. Shanghai's transaction volume hit a record Yn23.95bn (Dollars 3.99bn) in January and was 18 times above January 1991's level. Last year, turnover in Shanghai was Yn64.8bn, seven times higher than the year earlier. The first initial public offer this year of a company on the Shenzhen bourse has been planned for listing this month. The simultaneous launch for both the domestic and foreign markets of Chiwan Harbour shares will be internationally lead-managed by Standard Chartered Asia and domestically by China Merchant Bank Securities. The issue will raise a total of between Yn200m and Yn250m. Standard Chartered and China Development Finance will underwrite the offer.</p>

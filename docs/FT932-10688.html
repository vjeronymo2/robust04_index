			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: LWT So now we know what LWT really stands for: Lottery Winners' Ticket. The huge share option bonuses LWT's top 44 managers can soon cash in represent a new benchmark of some kind. No-one can dispute the contribution LWT's management has made in hanging tough and bidding low in the farce that was the television franchise auction. But other successful directors like those of Scottish and Central have not been recompensed on anything like the same scale. LWT's managers' rewards are out of all proportion to the risks they ran or the effort they expended.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Queens Moat banks launch inquiry GRANT Thornton, the accountants, were appointed yesterday by Queens Moat Houses' banks to investigate why the hotel group has run into financial difficulties. The banks have asked for a report in seven days from Grant Thornton's investigators, who went into Queens Moat's offices at 8.30am yesterday. A full meeting of the hotel group's 45 banks, led by National Westminster and Barclays, will be held as soon as the initial report is completed, probably at the end of next week. A banker said one of the main issues for the banks was whether Queens Moat's senior management should be changed. 'I have never known a corporate crisis erupt so quickly,' he said. Another banker said he had no inkling that the group was in difficulties until Queens Moat suspended its shares on Wednesday. 'The group has given no cogent explanation for why its finances have deteriorated so rapidly,' the banker said. Queens Moat has debt of more than Pounds 1bn, including an off-balance sheet exposure which at the end of 1991 was Pounds 133m. Banks are uncertain whether Queens Moat's financial difficulties are purely the result of a change in its accounting policies or whether there has also been a sharp deterioration in trading. 'We are not even certain whether the group made a profit or loss last year,' one banker said. 'We will have to wait to see what Grant Thornton says.' The group's competitors believed that Queens Moat had been trading well in the UK and that its market share had been holding up. At the end of 1991, Queens Moat had 103 hotels in the UK and 86 hotels in Germany, the Netherlands and other parts of continental Europe. The group has to repay Pounds 658m of its debt within the next year. Until the shares were suspended, the banks had been working with the group on a plan to roll-over the debt. That plan will now be reviewed. Bankers said they would probably insist that Queens Moat comes up with a plan to reduce debt by selling assets. Barclays and National Westminster have the biggest loans to Queens Moat, of more than Pounds 80m each. Holders of the company's Pounds 215m 10 1/4 per cent debenture stock, due an interest payment totalling Pounds 11m yesterday, were relieved to receive their cheques. Bass, the UK brewing group which owns the Holiday Inn chain, yesterday dismissed the possibility that it could emerge as a buyer of a large number of Queens Moat hotels, but said it might be interested in buying selected hotels to aid growth in specific markets.</p>

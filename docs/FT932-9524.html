			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: LWT drops restriction on stake LONDON Weekend Television yesterday removed restrictions preventing anyone owning more than 10 per cent of the company. The restriction, insisted on by the old Independent Broadcasting Authority to prevent takeovers of ITV companies in mid-franchise, has not been a requirement since the beginning of this year. Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT Holdings, said after yesterday's annual meeting that the board took the view that it could no longer hide behind the restriction and that it was an anachronism. ' This should not be seen as an exhortation or inducement to bid,' Sir Christoper said. LWT's largest shareholder, Mercury Asset Management, holds about 18 per cent of the ITV company. The shareholding was not caught by the 10 per cent restriction because it is spread across several funds. LWT is believed to be the first of the ITV companies to vote to remove the 10 per cent restriction. From next January ITV companies can be taken over on the Stock Exchange, subject to the approval of the Independent Television Commission. The annual meeting also approved a special payment of Pounds 375,000 to Mr Marcus Plantin, former LWT director of programmes who is director of the central ITV network. The LWT money was half of what Sir Christopher described as 'the cost of his departure.' The other half of the Pounds 750,000 payment, which was intended to compensate Mr Plantin for his loss of LWT share options, was paid by the ITV system. There was no sign of a shareholder revolt against the management share scheme that should net more than Pounds 55m gross for 44 managers and create 15 LWT millionaires.</p>

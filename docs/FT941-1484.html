			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / French protesters defy warning Thousands of demonstrators defied government warnings of heavy punishment and took to the streets in France again yesterday to protest against legislation reducing youth wages. Demonstrations in Calais, Saint Etienne, Valence, Lyons, Grenoble, Annecy, Chambery and Nantes took place in spite of warnings that individuals could be jailed for up to seven years and fined up to FFr700,000 (Pounds 80,000) each if the marches led to disorder. The demonstrators want the government to repeal a law that allows employers to pay people under 25 between 30 and 80 per cent of the legal minimum wage provided they receive on-the-job training.</p>

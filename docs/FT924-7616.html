			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Zero growth for western Germany expected in 1993: Forecast by 'five wise men' gloomiest yet over economic prospects THE 'five wise men' who give independent economic advice to the German government will today forecast a zero real growth rate for the western economy in 1993, the most pessimistic assessment of German economic prospects to date. Although they expect a slight recovery in the economy in the second half of the year, this will not be enough to outweigh the downturn of the next six months, they say. Unemployment in west Germany next year will rise by about 340,000 from its present level of 1.83m. In east Germany it will be up by another 150,000 from the current 1.09m in spite of great efforts to soak up eastern job losses in job creation, short-time working, and retraining schemes. The first details of the report of the five wise men - leading economics professors hired to give the government independent advice - were circulating in Bonn yesterday and provide significantly more pessimistic forecasts than the five leading economic institutes, which reported earlier this month. The institutes predicted a 0.5 per cent growth rate for both gross national product and gross domestic product in 1993, but stressed that even that would require a clear relaxation in the Bundesbank's strict monetary policy, including lower interest rates. Both reports are much more pessimistic than the government's own economics ministry, which is still looking for western German growth of between 1.0 and 1.5 per cent next year, although that is already a reduction from the forecast of 2.5 per cent it made last June. Gloom over Germany's economic prospects has grown rapidly in the past three months, as it has become evident that industrial orders were sharply down, including investment in plant and equipment, and that there was no prospect of early relief from the export market. As far as east Germany is concerned, the five wise men expect a 6.5 per cent growth rate, compared with the 7.5 per cent forecast by the economic institutes. They are believed to forecast an inflation rate of 3.5 per cent in the west, and 8.5-9.0 per cent in the east (particularly reflecting higher rents). The wise men are expected to focus on the failure of the 16 federal states (Lander) to curb spending to the same extent as central government. Instead of keeping to a maximum budget spending increase of 3 per cent next year, as Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has urged, his own state of Bavaria plans a 5.9 per cent rise, Hesse 5.8 per cent and Baden-Wurttemberg 5.6 per cent. Because of the economic downturn, overall public sector tax revenues will drop by a net DM10bn (Pounds 4.1bn), according to the finance ministry. Mr Waigel has imposed a ceiling on spending growth of 2.5 per cent on his own central budget, although he has proposed that net borrowing increase from DM40.5bn this year to DM44bn next year, to make up for the loss of tax revenues. The Lander argue that with 40 per cent of their costs going on personnel, they cannot curb spending to the same extent. Cracks behind the unity, Page 12</p>

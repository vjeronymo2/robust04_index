			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASTRONAUTS SEE BRILLIANT SOUTHERN LIGHTS;  </P> <P> SPACE: THE DISPLAY IS CAUSED BY RADIATION FROM A SOLAR STORM. THE SHUTTLE CREW  IS NOT IMPERILED.  </P> <P> The fickle Earth, which shook Northern California to its knees Tuesday, put on  one of its prettiest faces Friday for five astronauts orbiting the planet.  </P> <P> A brilliant display of the southern lights blazed across the sky as the space  shuttle Atlantis sped over Australia.  </P> <P> "This is really spectacular," Atlantis commander Donald E. Williams told  Mission Control at the Johnson Space Center here.  </P> <P> The lights exploded across the entire horizon, dancing and flashing in an  exhibition of nature as the ultimate artist.  </P> <P> "It started out mostly green . . . and now it has some oranges and reds and  violets," Williams said. "It almost looks like rain coming down from the  universe onto the atmosphere."  </P> <P> The lights are of more than aesthetic interest to the astronauts. They are  caused by high energy particles from the sun striking molecules in Earth's  upper atmosphere, and they are most dramatic when the sun erupts in enormous  storms, as it has been for the last few days.  </P> <P> Those solar storms can also knock out communications and affect satellites and  spacecraft. But officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  said Thursday that they had evaluated the burst of energy and determined that  the astronauts aboard Atlantis are not in danger.  </P> <P> Solar storms can cause unstable satellites to tumble from the sky. The shuttle  is in a stable orbit, 184 miles above Earth, and the dramatic show posed no  threat to the Atlantis or its crew.  </P> <P> NASA officials closely monitor all solar storms to be sure they do not cause  any problems for the shuttle. An unusually intense storm, for example, could  expose the crew to potentially harmful levels of radiation.  </P> <P> Some recent solar storms have reduced NASA's chances of rescuing a research  satellite the size of a school bus that is threatening to tumble from orbit and  crash on Earth. The Long Duration Exposure Facility, as the satellite is known,  was to have been retrieved from orbit several years ago, but the explosion of  the shuttle Challenger delayed the rescue.  </P> <P> NASA plans to retrieve the satellite by the end of the year, but time is  running out, and solar storms reduce the time even further. The storms cause  Earth's lower atmosphere to expand, pushing air molecules to higher elevations,  causing a slight drag on the satellite.  </P> <P> By February, NASA scientists believe, the orbit of the Long Duration Exposure  Facility will have degraded to the point that it will no longer be safe for the  shuttle to come up beneath the satellite, as required for the rescue.  </P> <P> The shuttle is scheduled to land Monday at 12:38 p.m. at Edwards Air Force  Base, but several options are being considered because marginal weather  conditions have been forecast for the Southern California facility. The winds  could be a little higher than NASA prefers, so officials are considering  extending the flight a day or two if the weather could be expected to improve.  </P> <P> Alternative landing fields also are being considered.  </P> <P> In addition to Williams, the shuttle's crew includes Michael J. McCulley, the  pilot, Shannon W. Lucid, Franklin R. Chang-Diaz and Ellen S. Baker.  </P></p>

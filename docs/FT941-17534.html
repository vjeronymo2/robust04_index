			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / BP oil finds may yield 1bn barrels British Petroleum is involved in two new discoveries in Colombia and the North Sea which could produce up to 1bn barrels of oil between them. The company has just acquired a 54 per cent stake in the Recetor acreage, in Colombia's eastern Andes, from Maxus, a US company that discovered gas and gas condensate when it drilled a well there late last year. The gas find suggests the presence of oil and, according to estimates in Colombia, the Volcanero well may contain up to 500m barrels of oil. BP carried out the initial seismic survey of the acreage for Maxus and started with a 10 per cent stake. The Recetor field lies just south of Piedemonte, a 5,000 sq km block owned by BP. The Volcanero find is believed to extend into Piedemonte, although limited early drilling elsewhere in the block has as yet found nothing. In the second of the two discoveries, BP's explorations between the Orkney and Shetland islands have produced a second find which could equal the 250m to 500m barrels estimated for its first discovery last March. The two wells are in blocks acquired with the purchase of Britoil in 1988. The area has been described by the government as a possible 'new province' of the North Sea. BP has an 80 per cent share in the first discovery and Shell 20 per cent, while the two groups have 50 per cent each of the latest find. The two also have 50 per cent each of five blocks awarded by the government last summer to encourage exploration in the area.</p>

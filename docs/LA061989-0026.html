			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON YOUR OWN: READERS ADVISE THE DISILLUSIONED CAREERIST  </P> <P> The mail keeps coming in, responding to the letter from a 40-year-old single  woman who is highly successful in her career but who sadly wonders, "What have  I really accomplished? Would the world really come to an end if I disappeared  tomorrow?"  </P> <P> Several readers expressed similar disillusionment:  </P> <P> "I teach special education, and I also wonder what I have really accomplished.  My students move on, and I rarely see or hear from them again. Many drop out;  some end up in jail. Parents and administrators usually praise me for my  patience but will unhesitatingly put my head on the chopping block if anything  goes wrong. Most days I go home to an empty apartment too tired to do much  other than take a brief walk, eat dinner and watch TV before hitting the bed  early.  </P> <P> "I am looking for a career that will enable me to take care of myself better.  That career will include a better social life which may enable me to find a  male companion."  </P> <P> Another woman wrote:  </P> <P> "I was a physicist for the government until I was 30. Then I married and began  a family. I am now 35 with two children, and I intend to play housewife for a  few more years before returning to work.  </P> <P> "Having a family is definitely rewarding, and I feel that my accomplishments  are real when I look at my children. Another option for this woman is to  explore how she could serve her community. I think she needs the personal  contact that comes from helping others."  </P> <P> Other readers praised her pursuit of her career:  </P> <P> "She is extremely fortunate to have a career. The only person you can ever  really count on is yourself. If she had married, she may have found herself the  sole support of the family as the result of a divorce, an illness or an  accident. Her husband could have become a drunk, a gambler or a womanizer. Or  she may have become bored staying at home and needed more fulfillment."  </P> <P> Another woman spoke of her own frustrations in choosing the family path:  </P> <P> "I am a married woman of 55 who raised three children. Like most women my age,  a career was not even on my list of priorities. Child rearing was a woman's  career.  </P> <P> "The woman who wrote this letter is the beneficiary of the social progress that  women my age never dared to dream about. I was the classic good wife and good  mother. We have two lovely homes, luxury cars, college-educated children and  lovely grandchildren. But I, too, ask myself: 'What have I really accomplished?  What did I do with my life that was so important? Would the world come to an  end tomorrow if I were to die this minute?'  </P> <P> "This woman has to be applauded. She has worked her way through the male  business hierarchy and has made it. She should rest on her laurels, start  building relationships unrelated to work, possibly change jobs and, most of  all, take time to smell the roses. She can still have it all."  </P> <P> Two women gave their solutions to achieving a balance between their careers and  other needs. One wrote:  </P> <P> "I also lived in an elegant condo, wore expensive clothes and took wonderful  vacations. I became a vice president of my company when I was 40 years old and  called my friends to go out and celebrate. Everyone was busy. So I went home to  an empty condo and never felt more alone in my life. The success was  bittersweet.  </P> <P> "When I was 42, I met the man who is now my husband. At the time I thought he  was totally unsuitable. He is a blue-collar worker and I, as a professional,  thought I had to marry a professional man. But the professional men I knew  weren't interested in marrying professional women.  </P> <P> "My husband was always there when I needed him, unlike my professional friends  who were too busy with work or with ex-wives and children. I discovered that he  was my type! He is kind, thoughtful, nurturing and supportive of my career."  </P> <P> And from another woman:  </P> <P> "I joined a support group of people interested in self-actualization, and they  helped me to choose an area of study totally in contrast to my career. I now  study philosophy: The study of meaningful questions. What I learn at school I  bring back to my friends in the support group. My life, once dull, lonely and  despairing, is now full of wonderful friends whom I really care about --  including, especially, myself. Incidentally, my next best friend (besides me)  is a man I met in the group. We were married just over two years ago."  </P></p>

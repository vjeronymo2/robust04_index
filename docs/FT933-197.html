			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Morris demands early clarification of diverging votes UNION LEADERS were divided last night in their immediate reaction to the outcome of the crucial votes. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said that the party conference was 'facing three ways' after his union's anti-one-member-one-vote motion was carried and he said he wanted the national executive committee to clarify the position today. He was delighted that his union's anti-one-member-one-vote composite motion had been passed. 'I believe we have won the argument', said Mr Morris. 'The vote for our composite is the clearest possible demonstration of support for the trade union link.' He called on the party's national executive committee to bring forward rule changes this week that will 'embody the principles in the composite, including continued trade union involvement in candidate selection'. 'The NEC has a responsibility to respond to the wishes of conference', said Mr Morris. 'The various positions approved by conference today are clearly contradictory. It is now the responsibility of the NEC to bring forward proposals as to how the conference should proceed'. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said he would not challenge one-member-one-vote. 'Democracy has expressed its vote. One-member-one-vote will be introduced. I trust there will be no more constitutional adventures. It was a great mistake to make the issue into a constitutional battle. Its importance was misjudged.' But Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AUEW engineering and electrical union, said that he was delighted at the result. 'Mr Smith has won. Nothing else matters', he said. 'He took on the might of the old left in the unions and he beat them.' A delegate from the MSF technical union, which made the crucial difference to the outcome, said: 'All that counts is that the rule change was accepted. The TGWU motion falls by the way'. Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union said: 'It is great news for the leadership and the movement.' In the long, cumbersome debate, lasting most of the day, the union leaders took up their predictable positions, knowing that the outcome was always on a knife-edge. Mr Edmonds told delegates the whole debate about one-member-one-vote had been 'divisive and destructive'. He warned that 'it has been like an iceberg. The little bit you see above the surface looks benign enough and even flashes in the sunshine. But it is the nasty bit below the surface which will do the damage. It will tear great chunks out of this party', adding that 'this unwanted dispute has done great damage'. The strongest trade union support for Mr Smith in the debate came from Mr Jordan. 'The block vote is now this party's weakest link,' he told delegates. 'We cannot attack privilege in society and let it hold power in our own party.' Strong opposition to one-member-one-vote came from Mr Tony Dubbins, general secretary of the GPMU print union. He suggested it was 'arrogant rubbish'.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A Superior Court jury awarded $969,757 to an Ocean Beach man after finding that  the San Diego Transit Corp. was partly responsible for injuries he suffered in  an April, 1986, accident as he attempted to cross the street behind a city bus.  </P> <P> The jury ruled Wednesday in favor of Anthony Brown, 53, even though it found  that he, the transit company and the motorist who hit him were equally liable  for the accident. Brown is to receive two-thirds of the $1.4-million award  after the jury found he was one-third responsible.  </P> <P> Brown was hospitalized two months and had to have part of the temporal lobe of  his brain removed. He suffered a severe memory loss, does not speak clearly and  cannot organize his thoughts well, said Craig Higgs, one of Brown's attorneys.  </P></p>

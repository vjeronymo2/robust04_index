			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TESTS SHOW ALAR TRACES ON APPLES IN 2 COUNTY STORES  </P> <P> Apples in two Los Angeles County supermarkets were found in independent tests  to contain residues of Alar, a potentially hazardous chemical that the stores'  suppliers had claimed was no longer used.  </P> <P> The tests, conducted for The Times by a private San Francisco laboratory, found  traces of Alar on apples sold at a Hughes market in Monterey Park and a Lucky  store in Bell. Officers of both stores said their growers had pledged in  letters not to use the chemical. Lucky was apparently confident enough of the  claim to post it on signs on produce shelves.  </P> <P> The test results demonstrate that supermarkets, increasingly sensitive to  consumer concerns about pesticides and chemicals, may not be able to guarantee  the purity of their produce without independent laboratory verification. Some  environmentalists are demanding an immediate ban on Alar.  </P> <P> In response to the results, a spokeswoman for Lucky said the chain pulled the  apples from the market where The Times purchased them last week and will test  them to verify The Times' findings. In the meantime, she said, Lucky's no-Alar  signs will probably be revised.  </P> <P> Hughes, concerned by the findings, began testing apples in its warehouse  Wednesday and found Alar residues on three different brands of red apples. A  Hughes vice president ordered its stores to pull those brands from the shelves  late Wednesday afternoon and announced that the chain will now test apples in  its warehouse on a regular basis.  </P> <P> No Alar residue was detected in samples from two other stores, a Vons in La  Canada and a Ralphs in South Pasadena. These two supermarket chains verify  their growers' claims of Alar-free fruit with independent laboratory testing.  </P> <P> The amounts detected in The Times' tests were substantially below the allowable  limit set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An EPA official said  Alar residues at or below the allowable amount -- set before the chemical was  linked to cancer -- could cause health problems over a lifetime of consumption  but not in the short run. The agency next year is expected to ban the chemical,  which is used to improve the appearance and extend the shelf life mainly of red  apples.  </P> <P> "The finding of Alar in so-called Alar-free apples demonstrates why we need the  EPA to take this chemical off the market once and for all," said Lawrie Mott, a  senior scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental  group that released a controversial study earlier this month about the  chemical's effects on children.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Private Lab Hired  </P> <P> The Times last week purchased eight to 10 apples of each red and yellow variety  at the four stores and hired Anresco Inc., a private San Francisco laboratory,  to test them for residues of Alar, the trade name for the chemical daminozide.  The laboratory used a testing method recognized by the EPA and the Food and  Drug Administration.  </P> <P> Of 23 samples tested, five had detectable levels. The EPA's allowable limit for  the residue is 20 parts per million. The EPA does not, however, say that apples  containing that amount or less are safe.  </P> <P> "We aren't saying there is any level that is absolutely without risk," said EPA  spokesman Alber Heier. "However, we think the risk is small."  </P> <P> Agency officials say the average Alar residue detected on apples is one part  per million -- 1/20th of the limit. For every 100,000 people who eat apples  containing that average amount, there will be about 4.5 additional cancer cases  over the lifetime of those people, according to the EPA's calculations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Range of Findings  </P> <P> The amounts found in The Times' tests ranged from .97 ppm to 9 ppm. Anne  Lindsay, director of pesticide registration for the EPA, said any residue above  1 ppm probably results from current use of Alar. Smaller amounts may be found  on apples one or more years after the grower has stopped using the chemical  because it persists in the soil and root system of the tree.  </P> <P> At Hughes, a sample of McIntoshes was found to have residue of 9 ppm. A sample  of large red Delicious apples had a detectable level of .97 ppm and "fancy" red  Delicious had a level of 3.7 ppm.  </P> <P> At Lucky, a large red Delicious sample showed 1.8 ppm and a regular red  Delicious sample had 4.1 ppm.  </P> <P> Judy Decker, a spokeswoman for Lucky Stores, said the chain will decide whether  to make changes in its produce policies after receiving the results of its own  laboratory analysis. She noted that Lucky produce signs say the chain has been  asking growers for three years to certify that they do not use Alar.  </P> <P> "The sign is still correct as far as I am concerned," Decker said. "The grower  has certified to us that he has not used Alar."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Variance of Claims  </P> <P> But claims of certification vary, said Tom Hale, president of the Washington  Apple Commission, which represents 5,000 apple growers in the state. Some  growers certify that no Alar was used to the best of their knowledge. Others  certify that actual testing was done at harvest time.  </P> <P> "I believe the certifications that are occurring are honest," Hale said. "But  I'm not saying it's foolproof and something couldn't slip through."  </P> <P> Harland Polk, vice president of sales and marketing at Hughes, acknowledged  that levels of certification from growers vary.  </P> <P> Hughes will now post signs in stores informing customers that samples of their  apple shipments are tested for the chemical, Polk said. Of seven apple samples  tested by the store Wednesday, four had no traces of Alar. But some red  Delicious apples had 1.2 ppm; others had 2.5 ppm and still others showed 3.6  ppm, Polk said.  </P> <P> Hughes used the same method of testing as Anresco, but the apples tested by  Hughes may have come from different growers.  </P> <P> Polk said Hughes had letters from each of those suppliers saying that Alar was  not used on their apples to the best of their knowledge. "Those (apples) will  be pulled from sale and returned to the supplier, and if it is appropriate we  will take legal action against those suppliers," Polk said.  </P> <P> Stores say that once apples are on the shelves, it is difficult to determine  who the growers were.  </P> <P> The EPA estimates that 5% of fresh apples are now treated with Alar. Lindsay,  director of the agency's pesticide registration division, said that estimate is  based on reports from county and state agricultural officials who work with  growers, the amount of Alar production reported by its manufacturer and private  services that collect such information.  </P> <P> Lindsay conceded, however, that the agency must rely in part on what growers  say they are doing because "there is no official national reporting system of  what people use."  </P> <P> Consumers Union, the New York-based publisher of Consumer Reports, challenged  that estimate in a report showing that 55% of raw apples purchased in the New  York region contained Alar. The organization's test showed residues ranging  from .4 to 2.3 ppm on 11 of 20 samples of red apples tested.  </P> <P> Consumer Union called on the EPA to ban Alar "as soon as possible." In the  meantime, consumers should not stop eating raw apples "because the health  benefits of apples outweigh the very low risks" associated with Alar, said  Consumers Union spokeswoman Marnie Goodman.  </P> <P> Times researcher Angela Justin contributed to this article.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TESTING FOR ALAR  </P> <P>  Apples from four stores -- Vons, Ralphs, Hughes and Lucky -- were tested for  daminozide, a growth-regulator marketed under the brand name Alar, which is  suspected of causing cancer. Twenty-three samples of eight to 10 apples each  were tested. No Alar was found in the Vons or Ralphs samples. Five samples --  three from Hughes and two from Lucky -- showed traces of the chemical. The  legal limit for Alar on apples is 20 parts per million. Anresco Inc., a San  Francisco firm, did the testing for The Times.  </P> <P>  The laboratory, established in 1943, tests for pesticides, preservatives,  nutrients and other compounds in food, usually for private companies. The  laboratory used the government-approved PAM II testing method in which apples  are put in a blender, mixed with sodium hydroxide, titanium trichloride, an  antifoam agent and zinc granules. The mixture is heated and decomposed into  unsymmetrical dymethyl hydrazine (UDMH), a breakdown product of Alar. Results  are read in a spectrometer, with color intensities proportional to the amount  of Alar in the sample. The test has a margin of error of plus or minus 4%.

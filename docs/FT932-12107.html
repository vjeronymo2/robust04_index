			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Spirits industry hopes for more of a future sparkle - Long-term trends in the sector International spirits companies have lost their investor appeal in the past year as profits growth has slowed in the worldwide recession. In London, shares in Guinness, Grand Metropolitan and Allied-Lyons lag behind the FT-Actuaries All-Share index; in Toronto, Seagram barely keeps pace with the market; in Paris, LVMH trails the field while Remy Cointreau and Pernod-Ricard run marginally ahead. Short-term performance is likely to remain pedestrian compared with the sprightly progress of the late 1980s. Market conditions continue to be difficult in Japan, and are deteriorating in continental Europe. Recovery in the UK is still fragile, and in the US it is threatened by increases in federal excise tax. Though the international spirits companies have shown some stout resistance to recession - GrandMet's IDV increased trading profits by 12 per cent last year, and Guinness's United Distillers achieved organic growth of 6 per cent  -investors cannot expect significant market outperformance before 1994. The difficulties of the past year have led some observers to question whether the industry can regain any of its past sparkle. There is little prospect of further market growth, they argue. The profitable process of building brand portfolios and global distribution networks is nearing its end. Increased prices and profit margins will be more difficult to achieve as worldwide inflation rates fall. A rudimentary analysis of the market should be enough to dispel such gloom about the industry's long-term prospects. 'The real bull case for international spirits stems from the fact that their share of the overall world market is just 7 per cent,' says Mr John Spicer, analyst at SG Warburg, the London securities house. There is clearly considerable scope for international brands to increase their share of markets dominated by local, unbranded products. The process is well under way in the Far East - Thailand, in which United Distillers sold virtually nothing 10 years ago, is now among its top 10 profit centres  -and in central and south America. Further ahead, eastern Europe promises substantial opportunities; and beyond lie the as yet protected markets of India and China where a thirst for scotch whisky and cognac waits to be assuaged. Mr Colin Davies, analyst at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, believes that continued brand concentration will also lead to further profits growth for the leading companies, even in mature markets. 'There is still an opportunity to take over smaller brands and distributors and so leverage up profitability by lower cost production and distribution, improved marketing and increased sales,' he says. On this longer term view, the industry's top four companies - GrandMet, Guinness, Allied-Lyons and Seagram - offer good fundamental value at present levels. They command the biggest brand portfolios, the widest distribution networks, and the resources to build on those strengths. GrandMet will be the first of the UK-based companies to benefit from sterling devaluation and recovery in the US, and its IDV spirits operations are expected to increase profits by 16 per cent this year. Devaluation benefits will come later for Guinness and Allied-Lyons. With conditions in some key markets remaining difficult, Guinness's spirits trading profits are unlikely to be more than 3 per cent ahead this year - but growth should begin to accelerate in 1994. It may take longer for its French ally, LVMH, to recover. The decline in Japanese demand for cognac may continue. There are risks of the slowdown spreading to the south-east Asia duty-free market and of pressure on prices. Allied-Lyons' links with Suntory may enable it to buck the trend in Japan but only a modest increase in profits is expected this year from its spirits business. Longer term prospects look sound: the partnership with Pedro Domecq could be as successful in central America as it has been in Spain. Seagram, now tightly focused on core brands, is positioned to share in growth markets in south-east Asia and south America. It has also been investing for the more distant future in eastern Europe and China. The fortunes of Pernod-Ricard and Bols-Wessanen are largely tied to Europe, but Remy has the brands and distribution network to play a larger role on the global stage.</p>

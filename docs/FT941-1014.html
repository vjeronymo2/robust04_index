			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Bonds fall further on rate fears UK government bonds continued their steep decline yesterday as fears of rising interest rates intensified. Mr George Magnus, chief international economist at SG Warburg, said the gilt market was discounting base rates of 6 per cent by the end of 1994 and 7 1/2 per cent by the end of 1995. The rate is now 5 1/4 per cent. In New York, blue-chip share prices plunged for a second consecutive day as the yield on the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond topped 7.0 per cent at 7.009 for the first time in 10 months. Traders could not identify a single cause for the continuing sell-off in bonds, but cited domestic and international political concerns and the upward movement in interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 46.36 down at 3,774.73 after closing 48 points lower in the previous session. In UK gilts, most of the activity was in the futures market where the June contract of the long gilt future fell as low as 105 1/8 , but later recovered to just under 1 point down at 106 1/16 . The yield on long-dated giltscame close to 8 per cent at one point yesterday. The FT-SE 100 index, meanwhile, recouped an early loss of 33 points to close 7.3 points higher at 3,129. Continental bourses also recovered part of their early losses. The dollar and sterling came under heavy selling pressure in London, but finished above their worst. The US currency closed at DM1.668, off a low of DM1.6595, but down from Thursday's close of DM1.6726. The pound recov ered from a low of DM2.4880 to finish the day at DM2.4978, slightly above Thursday's close of DM2.4971.

			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> STRAWBERRY HOME RUN STIRS METS AGAIN  </P> <P> A month ago, when Darryl Strawberry said he wanted a contract comparable to  Jose Canseco's, the New York Mets' executives could have laughed.  </P> <P> They aren't laughing now. They realize that to keep their slugging outfielder,  there might have to come up with something close to the $23.5 million Canseco  will get over five years from Oakland.  </P> <P> Strawberry is on a spree, and he is pulling the Mets along with him.  </P> <P> Strawberry hit another three-run home run Wednesday night at New York and Mike  Marshall broke an eighth-inning tie with a sacrifice fly as the streaking Mets  beat Houston, 7-4.  </P> <P> Howard Johnson, who went four for five, hit a two-run home run after Marshall  put the Mets ahead.  </P> <P> The Mets have won 21 of their last 24 games, and the Astros, who fought back  from a 4-0 deficit to tie the game, have lost 16 of their last 17 road games.  </P> <P> "If the Mets want to keep me, they can prove it with a major offer," Strawberry  said soon after he began his streak, which includes 12 home runs in the last 22  games.  </P> <P> Although Dwight Gooden (8-5) was bothered by a blister on his pitching hand, he  went eight innings, giving up four runs.  </P> <P> Montreal 5, Cincinnati 3 -- Dennis Martinez limited the Reds to five hits in  eight innings at Montreal and his teammates got to Scott Scudder, recently  recalled from the minors, quickly.  </P> <P> The Expos, who had lost six of their previous seven games, knocked Scudder out  in a five-run first that featured a two-run single by Mike Aldrete and a  two-run double by Andres Galarraga.  </P> <P> The Reds were without second baseman Mariano Duncan, who had a minor neck  sprain after being involved in an auto accident on the way to the park.  </P> <P> San Francisco 9, St. Louis 2 -- Forced to find replacements for his injured  starters, Manager Roger Craig has found two gems.  </P> <P> One of them, Trevor Wilson, improved to 5-0 with a shutout Tuesday night, and  John Burkett (8-2) was the winner in this game at San Francisco.  </P> <P> Burkett held the Cardinals to four hits in seven innings and became a winner  when the Giants scored four runs in the seventh and four more in the eighth.  </P> <P> San Diego 5, Pittsburgh 4 -- Despite anxious moments in the ninth inning at San  Diego, the Padres ended their seven-game losing streak.  </P> <P> The Pirates, whose lead in the East was cut to half a game over the surging  Mets, scored once in the ninth, had the tying run on second with one out and  hot-hitting Barry Bonds at the plate.  </P> <P> Bonds hit a line drive, but shortstop Garry Templeton caught the smash and  turned it into a game-ending double play.  </P> <P> Atlanta 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Dale Murphy hit a home run and drove in two runs  at Philadelphia as the Braves again beat the Phillies.  </P> <P> Tom Glavine (5-5) was the winner, going 6 2/3 innings.

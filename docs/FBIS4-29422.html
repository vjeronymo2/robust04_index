			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Political Lounge" column] </F>   [Text] Yi Ki-taek, leader of the opposition Democratic  Party, positively assessed [kungjongjoguro pyongga] on 17 June  the talks between former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and North  Korean President Kim Il-song by saying that the talks "have  brought about a great result [sangdanghan songgwa]."    Prior to this, Yi Ki-taek recently conveyed to the U.S.  Embassy in the ROK, his desire to meet the former President  Carter as soon as he returns to Seoul, saying that he, as the  opposition party leader, would like to be told of the results of  former U.S. President Carter's visit to North Korea.    Regarding this, the U.S. Embassy said that it would convey  his desire to meet with former President Carter, and asked if Yi  thinks that Kim Tae-chung, president of the Peace Foundation for  the Asia-Pacific Region [and former head of the Democratic  Party], would agree on their meeting. At any rate, it seems  that news of whether the meeting will or will not be held, will  be revealed around 18 June.</p>

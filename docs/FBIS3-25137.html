			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Pedro Manuel] </F>   [Text] Good evening. The talks are virtually at a  standstill while the main body of the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiating team is awaited.    Meanwhile, the mediators and the government delegation are  busy with something else. There are reports that the government  team has already reacted to the proposal from the mediators and  observers on the question of national reconciliation and the  UNAVEM [UN Angola Verification Mission] mandate. Analysts  believe the mediators today dealt with the government  delegation's views on UNAVEM. In the case of national  reconciliation the government team introduced no major changes,  though the same cannot be said of the UNAVEM mandate. The  government has proposed changes because, according to a source,  it is necessary for the government and the United Nations to  define juridical aspects so that the government's legal rights  are upheld.    Right now, the talks are dealing with national  reconciliation  and the UNAVEM mandate. The talks will only get off the ground  when the main body of the UNITA delegation returns to Lusaka,  probably tomorrow.</p>

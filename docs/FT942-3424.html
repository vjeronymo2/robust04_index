			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Australia investment rules probed - Nikki Tait on a quest to take the whim factor out of foreign venture approval When an Australian parliamentary inquiry revealed last week that prime minister Paul Keating had suggested three years ago that Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon, was more likely to be allowed to take control of Australia's Fairfax newspaper group if it laid off 'barracking for' his opponents, the prickly issue of foreign investment was placed firmly on the political agenda. For one thing, the idea that editorial parameters were tradable for an investment position did not go down well. Even more serious was the question of whether it was desirable that foreign investment decision-making should be allowed to be subject to such political whim. Foreign investment is a tricky enough issue for any relatively small economy. And while there has been some unhappiness over the country's relatively permissive investment rules, the main concerns centre - Mr Keating's 'offer' aside - on the discretionary and often unaccountable way in which the policies seem to be applied. Under the spotlight is the Foreign Investment Review Board, a non-statutory body, which has no published constitution or rules of procedure. In theory, the Firb's job is to advise the Australian Treasurer (finance minister) on the 3,000-4,000 foreign investment deals that arise each year, allowing the latter to make the decision, at least in significant cases. (Firb itself consists of four individuals, backed up by a number of officials operating as a branch within the treasury). But in reality, say investment bankers, big decisions are simply announced, with a paucity of reasoning provided, and no indication of whether the Treasurer has taken the advice of Firb officials, or acted for some separate, perhaps politically-inspired, reason. 'It's excessively secretive,' says Mr Paul Binstead, former joint head of Schroders' investment banking arm in Australia and currently moving to County Natwest. 'Personally, I'd like to see decisions removed from the political arena.' Part of the problem is that the Firb operates in the context of a permissive, but imprecise, regime. The country first introduced rules on foreign investment in the mid-1970s, but then relaxed them significantly at the end of the 1980s. In essence, the stance today is that foreign investment is welcomed unless it is shown to be contrary to the national interest - some would say a sensible, but discretionary standard. In certain sensitive areas, such as the media, more precise rules apply. But even these can shift. As the Senate committee's report on Fairfax noted with regard to newspaper ownership: 'From a position of absolute restriction in the early-1980s, the policy flirted with total liberalisation in the late-1980s, before moving on to the compromise positions of foreign shareholdings of 20 per cent in 1991 and 30 per cent in 1993.' The Firb's formal scope, meanwhile, allows it to examine the acquisition of any shareholding above 15 per cent in any company with assets of more than ADollars 5m (Pounds 2.4m). While agreeing that the current arrangements are not ideal, the multi-party senate committee is split over what should be done. The opposition senators are calling for a new, single foreign investment statute that brings together the different exemptions or limitations applying to different sectors (such as banking, media and so on). They fall short of demanding a precise definition of 'national interest', but suggest that a set of criteria to be used in determining applications by foreign investors be delineated. They would also like the Firb to become a statutory body, allowed to make binding decisions for certain classes of applications which, in turn, would be subject to administrative law review. The remaining, 'more significant' applications would be handled by the the Treasurer, who would be obliged to provide an accompanying statement of reasons in each case. The Labor party senators, who made up a minority on the committee, are content to recommend a 'more open and consultative process' and 'a comprehensive system of notification, involving publication of significant decisions, reasons for them and any special conditions'. Either way, it seems likely that some changes will emerge. Mr Ralph Willis, the Treasurer, has already conceded that 'for important issues . . . it's not unreasonable that we should give some reasons'. And that, say the system's critics, would at least be a step in the right direction.</p>

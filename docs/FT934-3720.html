			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / GM nears final deal on joint venture in Poland General Motors Europe is expected to reach final agreement next week to begin assembling cars in Poland. GM is planning to form a joint venture with FSO, the Polish state-owned carmaker, to assemble the Opel Astra small family car in part of the FSO plant in Warsaw. In the first stage of the project GM is aiming to assemble annually up to 10,000 four-door Opel Astras from SKD (semi knocked-down) kits supplied from its plants in west Europe. GM will send painted car bodies from its assembly plant in Antwerp, Belgium, for final trim and assembly in Warsaw. Main components such as engines and transmissions will be supplied from its plant in Bochum, Germany. Production is expected to start in the autumn of next year. In this initial stage of the venture GM is expected to invest about Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.7m). It will take a stake of around 70 per cent in the venture, which is likely to have a workforce of around 250. Under its terms, which have been under negotiation for more than two years, GM envisages moving later to a more ambitious second stage in which cars would be assembled from CKD (completely knocked down) kits, which would require body welding and painting to be carried out in Poland. Output for the second stage could be increased to 35,000 cars a year on three shifts with a workforce of around 1,000. The second stage would increase total investment in the project to around Dollars 60m. As part of the planned co-operation GM would aim to take part in developing the automotive components supply industry in Poland. The company announced yesterday that ACG, the GM group's automotive components subsidiary, had signed a memorandum of understanding with FSO and its affiliate ZEM-ELK to set up a feasibility study into the establishment of ventures in such component areas such as wiring harnesses, lighting, metal and plastic components.</p>

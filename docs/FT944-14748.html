			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Personal View: A partial cure for Italy's deficit In its triennial economic and financial plan, published at the end of September, the Berlusconi government ac-knowledged Italy's continuing fiscal problems and announced the broad outlines of a cure. In the absence of any corrective action, the budget deficit, it was estimated, would increase from L160,000bn in 1994 (or some Dollars 100bn) - resulting in a mammoth ratio of debt to gross domestic product of 123 per cent - to L200,000bn, and 134 per cent of GDP, in 1997. The plan called for new measures to bring the deficit down to L100,000bn by 1997, the target set by the previous Ciampi government. The reduction of L100,000bn was to be accomplished by a cut of L45,000bn in 1995, with further cuts of L55,000bn over the following two years. The details of the first year's programme were revealed when the government submitted the long-awaited 1995 budget to parliament at the end of September. So far, it has been fairly favourably received by Italian and foreign commentators. The main reason seems to be that the programme is more austere than was expected from the electoral programme and earlier utterances of the parties in government. It also satisfies the targets set out in the three-year plan to reduce the deficit by L50,000bn. And L28,000bn, or more than half, of that reduction is supposed to come from expenditure cuts. Another feature that contributed to the favourable judgment is that the budget was accompanied by wise and courageous proposals to reform the pension system. Existing laws passed before 1991 by governments in search of votes had given irresponsibly favourable treatment to the retired. This, together with the large share of the expensive National Medical Insurance System borne by the government, threatened to absorb an unsupportable portion of national income. The proposals gradually shift the Italian pension system towards those of other countries in the European Union. The rest of the budget, however, suffers from several significant shortcomings. To begin with, the assertion that the deficit reduction will come primarily from pruning expenditure rests on an arbitrary and unacceptable classification of individual items, including some questionable ones. Far more serious is that L19,000bn, or some 40 per cent of the deficit reduction, will come from payments made in exchange for an amnesty for a variety of transgressions of laws and regulations. These include tax evasion and the violation of building codes. Such sources of revenue are not new to Italy, but they have never been used to such a degree. They are immoral in that they reward illegal behaviour; in the long run, they are self-defeating, since they encourage such behaviour. Furthermore they cannot be regarded as ordinary income, since they represent the liquidation of an asset - the claims against the violators. They are therefore transitory and will have to be replaced by more permanent measures next year (though the government estimates that some of the proposed measures may reduce tax evasion in future). Other measures are similarly transitory, such as the postponement of the inflation adjustment on pensions. Finally, there is some concern about the reliability of the estimate of savings of L50,000bn. The estimate of interest costs is likely to be too optimistic and the revenue from amnesties is uncertain and easily overestimated. The deficit reduction is thus unlikely to be as effective as planned, largely because it will be achieved by questionable and transitory means. The actual, permanent reduction will probably be less than L30,000bn, requiring savings of another L70,000bn in the next two years, an annual average higher than that of 1994. This is a tall order but not impossible. The economy is strong and growing rapidly. Achieving the cuts, however, requires prompt and intensive attention. The government must devote itself to re-establishing its credibility. It must use its continuing popularity to prepare Italians for the painful sacrifices and unpopular measures that await them. Only by such actions can it convince financial markets of the seriousness of its commitment to carry out its obligations. Only thus can it begin to reduce the huge premium of Italian interest rates over world interest rates, which threatens to suffocate the economic recovery.

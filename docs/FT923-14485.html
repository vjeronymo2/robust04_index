			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: RJR offshoot in link with Tabacalera R. J. REYNOLDS Tobacco, part of the RJR Nabisco group, has formed a joint venture company with Tabacalera, the Spanish government-owned cigarette manufacturing company, to produce and market RJR's Camel and Winston brands in Spain. The two brands have been produced under licence by Tabacalera since the early-1980s. However, RJR said that the joint venture company structure  - which will be owned 50:50 by the two manufacturers - will aid co-operation and help further growth. RJR is contributing its manufacturing facility in La Palma in the Canary Islands, to the joint venture, and Tabacalera is understood to be putting in an unspecified cash element.</p>

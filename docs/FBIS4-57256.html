			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Biaggio Talento, including interview with Cuban </F> President Fidel Castro, in Salvador, Bahia State on 12 May]    [Text] Salvador -- Cuban President Fidel Castro made a  12-hour stopover in the capital of Bahia upon his return from  South Africa after participating in Nelson Mandela's  inauguration. Castro granted an interview to ESTADO in which he  spoke about the economic blockade imposed on Cuba, Luis Inacio  Lula da Silva's position on the blockade, and Cuban policies.  He was rather confused about the situation of former Bahia  Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, who is now running for a seat  in the Senate. "Here in Brazil officials must resign their  posts six months before the elections if they want to compete in  them," Magalhaes explained. "You are addicted to holding  elections every month," Castro joked, provoking laughs among the  guests of a banquet in his honor offered by Governor Antonio  Imbassahy at Ondina Palace. He provoked even louder laughs when  he said he was surprised to find so few presidential candidates  in Brazil this year: "Brazilians could even reach the  conclusion that a single candidate policy might be best."    [Talento] What is Cuba doing to break the economic embargo?    [Castro] We are doing everything possible. There is a  movement against the blockade that is gaining momentum in the  United States. Only two or three nations support the blockade in  the United Nations. Cuba resisted, is resisting, and will  continue to resist.    [Talento] PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis  Inacio Lula da Silva called for an end to the blockade against  Cuba during his visit to the United States. What is your  opinion on his position?    [Castro] I appreciate it a lot. He always held that  position. Many politicians and, in general, many members of  progressive and democratic groups in the world are also opposed  to the blockade.    [Talento] What are your expectations regarding the economic  plan now under implementation in Cuba?    [Castro] It is not a new economic plan. We are implementing  a series of measures. We are developing an opening adjusted to  the special conditions we are living under today, without  renouncing our social victories. The National Assembly adopted  a series of measures seeking to straighten out our internal  financial situation.    [Talento] What do these new measures change?    [Castro] They seek to reduce the excessive volume of money  in  circulation. Despite our current difficulties we did not throw  anyone into the streets, or sacrifice our social and educational  programs.    [Talento] Are there any changes in public utility rates?    [Castro] Yes. We changed some utility rates. We adjusted  electricity and fuel prices. We also increased taxes on  superfluous items, such as cigarettes and cigars. We will try  to maintain basic items' current prices.    [Talento] The world is splitting into markets. What prevents  Latin America from having its own market?    [Castro] The U.S. economy is in crisis as a result of the  strong competition from other blocs (Europe, Asia), and wants to  control the Latin American market completely. But many Latin  American countries have stronger trade relations with Europe  than with the United States. These countries have the  obligation to defend regional mechanisms such as Mercosur  [Common Market of the South], the Andean Pact, or the Central  American market in order to prevent the United States from  completely absorbing them.    [Talento] There is a lot of talk about Cuba's need to  implement political reform. Is there any trend pointing in that  direction?    [Castro] There is a tendency to ignore all the reforms  introduced by Cuba in the past few years. These reforms have  just as much quality and democratic spirit than the reforms made  by many other countries. But we do not have access to the  multinationals that control the information, and our reforms are  little known.    [Talento] Do you still have another meeting after you leave  here today (it was after 0100)?    [Castro] I have a meeting with Morpheus [one of the gods of  dreams in Greek mythology]. (laughs)    [Talento] Will you visit the city?    [Castro] I am in a hurry to return. I have been away from  Cuba for over a week.    [Talento] At what time are you leaving?    [Castro] It is a military secret. (laughs)</p>

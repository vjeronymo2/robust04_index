			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> THE PUNCH LINE IS HER MOTHER  </P> <P> Comedian Francesca Hilton, daughter of hotel magnate Conrad Hilton and Zsa Zsa  Gabor, doesn't worry about running out of material.  </P> <P> "Every time I need material I ask my mother to go out there and do something,"  Hilton said Thursday.  </P> <P> She begins a two-week Vegas World casino stand on Sept. 12, opening for Tony  Martin in what she calls "the biggest break of my career." She has been playing  the comedy club circuit for years.  </P> <P> "Comedy is OK," Hilton said. "I felt it was cheaper than shock treatment. If I  survived the Gabors all these years, I figure comedy should be easy."  </P> <P> Hilton opens her routine by getting family matters out of the way.  </P> <P> "I tell them who I am right away. I say my mother is the queen of outer space,"  said Hilton, referring to one of Gabor's campy movies, "Queen of Outer Space."  </P></p>

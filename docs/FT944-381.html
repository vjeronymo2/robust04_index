			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Germany 'ahead of UK on labour costs' Britain's labour competitiveness is in danger of falling rapidly behind that of Germany as both countries pull out of recession, the Confederation of British Industry warned yesterday. In its latest pay trends survey the CBI said average UK settlements showed an increase of 3.4 per cent in the three months to November among manufacturing companies and of 4.3 per cent in the services sector. It added that higher manufacturing productivity was masking the impact of high wage increases on the country's competitiveness. Official earnings figures, which include overtime and bonuses, are showing a 4 per cent annual rise. While manufacturing productivity grew by 3.7 per cent according to provisional figures for the second half of the year, UK unit labour costs dropped by 2 per cent in 1994. A few years ago that would have given UK competitiveness an 'exceptional boost' as Germany struggled with the problems of reunification, Mr Robbie Gilbert, the CBI's employment affairs director said. But the Germans had cut unit labour costs in the western part of the country by 6 per cent in the past year. 'We are falling behind again,' warned Mr Gilbert. 'With price rises low, British workers are receiving bigger real rises than the employees of our major competitors - many of whom are now accepting real cuts in pay.' German labour market statistics show 7.5 per cent growth in industrial productivity to August year on year, average hourly earnings increases of only 1.9 per cent and a drop in unit industrial labour costs of 5.8 per cent. The latest forecasts for Germany published last week in the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's economic outlook suggest its unit labour costs will grow by only 0.1 per cent next year and 1 per cent in 1996. By contrast the OECD expects the UK's unit labour costs to grow by 1.6 per cent in 1995 and 3 per cent in 1996 although the report said productivity performance had been strong this year in the UK and real wage growth had remained moderate. The CBI survey came too late to be considered in yesterday's monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. They are thought to have decided against an early further rise in interest rates. A Treasury spokesman noted that recent developments on pay and unit labour costs in British industry had been 'very good' and had helped underpin UK successes in export markets. The Engineering Employers Federation said it had found no evidence of any upward trend in the level of pay settlements. The average rise from September to November was 3.0 per cent, excluding 15 companies which reported pay freezes. Monetary policy review, Page 4 Bad feeling about good recovery, Page 8</p>

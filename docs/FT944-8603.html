			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Where the Dickins is Mrs Jones? - Major department stores have lost many of their traditional customers. In an attempt to boost business, they are now spending large sums on image, service and fashion.  Will it work? Britain's large department stores have a problem. There they are, purveying a vast array of goods, floors upon floors of food halls and labels, treatment rooms and restaurants, pianos and clothes, clothes, clothes, but where does Mrs Jones prefer to shop? The small specialist store. Brand identity, personality, call it what you will, is what department stores seem to lack. Ask Mrs Jones to describe what sort of a personality the average store has and the answer is bland, anodyne, faceless. The few perceived as vivid characters are the ones that are doing well. In a casual survey polled for this article, the most robust personalities on our high streets turned out to be Marks &amp; Spencer, which came first, with the Gap, Jigsaw (although a slight weakening was detected in the past year), Joseph, French Connection (going from strength to strength), Harvey Nichols (still up there but looking shaky) and Liberty as strong contenders. First to establish a powerful personality in the high street was Next, under the guidance of George Davies. So strong was its brand identity that shoppers, even if led blindfold into one of its branches, were able to recognise it as a Next store. The Next initiative marked a big change in retailing. Until then most retailers had paid only lip service to the notion of display and shop fittings as effective selling tools. 'Next got everybody off the fence,' says Stephen Marks, chief shareholder and founder of the French Connection and Nicole Farhi labels. 'It imprinted design across the high street and re-educated the public.' Bigger retailers were soon spurred into action, and many industry observers believe that it was the Next example that provoked Marks &amp; Spencer to update its image and achieve the excellent results we see today. The department stores were slower on the uptake. Until relatively recently, according to Meg Gilmore, marketing director for House of Fraser, they did not see the smaller chains and specialists as competition. 'The stores were terribly complacent; they thought that selling everything under one roof was enough.' But by failing to establish distinctive personalities they were in danger of becoming the faceless giants of the high street or, even worse, of not surviving into the next century. By the end of the 1980s the figures, certainly, seemed to throw doubt on their ability to pull through. There had been a decline in the number of department store outlets, a fall in their share of total retail sales and a below-average growth in turnover. Research carried out by House of Fraser at the turn of this decade must have made depressing reading for executives at all the major store groups, not just House of Fraser. It revealed that most women could not tell one department store from another and believed that 'they all sell the same thing'. The effects of the recession have been felt by department store retailers in several ways, the most critical of which was the softening of the housing market and a consequent decline in the sales of household goods. This, combined with the upsurge in discount specialists such as factory outlets and warehouse clubs, has spurred many of them to concentrate on other areas. The most obvious solution was to expand their sales of fashion. Fashion has not, in the past 30 years anyway, been a marked characteristic of the department store personality. The youth quake of the 1960s encouraged the rise of the small specialist boutique, while department stores were traditionally seen as the preserve of the mature customer. The last thing that radical youth wanted was to shop where their mothers did. In a sense, not much has changed. House of Fraser's main target group is women over the age of 35, and statistics show that the number of people in the 33-54 age band will grow by 1.5 million in the next five years. What has changed are the aspirations and attitudes of that shopper. The mature shopper of today is the radical of yesterday. Fashion, rather than clothing, is important to them. As Stephen Marks points out: 'The consumer is far more sophisticated and aware now than at any time in the past 30 years. The Clothes Show has huge audiences. Why? Because everybody's interested in fashion. When even Marks &amp; Spencer does windows that are fashionable, you have to realise that attitudes have changed.' That change has forced department stores to take a long, hard look, perhaps for the first time, at the competition from the smaller specialist shops. It is that group which, in the UK anyway, has pioneered the most sophisticated aspects of modern retailing, such as creating a pleasant environment for shoppers, improving display and shop fittings. Display is now seen as so important, particularly by the store groups, that it is dignified by the title of 'visual merchandising'. Harrods now has an artistic design director. Joseph Ettedgui, owner of the Joseph shops and Joseph Tricot label, and considered by his peers to be the most prescient retailer in Britain, has long understood the commercial wisdom of display. He believes that the recession has finally brought home its importance to the stores. 'The big retailers are becoming much more aggressive and are now looking at areas which they once thought were absolutely unnecessary, like shop fittings, display and style in general. When business is good, people sit back but when it's bad, it forces them to decide on a firm policy.' Certainly, if financial outlay is anything to go by, then the department stores are taking a very firm line indeed. Selfridges has earmarked an investment of pounds 50 million over the next four years in an effort to become what the parent company, Sears, describes as 'the best and most exciting department store in Europe'. As work has only just begun, that remains to be seen but the expense wtll include structural changes to improve both the look and the layout of the store, to make it easier for customers to find their way around. Plans include the creation of 'worlds', or specialist shops within a shop. These are described as areas in which particular merchandise, such as sports goods or children's clothing and toys, will be grouped. The result should be better laid-out stores with a wider choice of well-priced merchandise. As a further inducement to their customers, the stores are also offering several competitive services: monogramming linen (at Harrods), for example, free delivery, offpeak concession parking and, most importantly, fashion consultancy. This is a free service for women, no matter what their income, who do not have the time to shop. They simply telephone the store and ask for some outfits to be assembled by an expert, or 'personal shopper', for them to choose from. It is an idea imported from the US, but one that has, according to one international executive, lost vigour in translation. She says that most of the personal shopping facilities in the UK are 'pretty pathetic', perhaps because the British woman is more tentative in demanding service than her confident American counterpart. 'The most important service the department store can offer in the 1990s is to make shopping easier,' says Meg Gilmore. Account-holding customers at House of Fraser who spend more than a certain sum a year now get a gold card. This entitles them to use an exclusive lounge where they are served free tea and coffee by special 'hostesses' and can read newspapers and watch cable television. But what about attracting new customers? During the past seven years, House of Fraser has invested pounds 50 million refurbishing existing stores and pounds 30 million on new units. Another pounds 23 million is allocated for refurbishing 16 more stores over the next few years. The group has recently spent pounds 3.5 million on its London flagship, Dickins &amp; Jones. Mindful of the importance personality plays in the retail market of the 1990s, it decided to restore the Regent Street fascia and halls to the look and atmosphere of the original 1928 building. This meant getting rid of all the modernising changes since then Understandably, the group is vague about the amount of money it spent on the store in the 1960s. 'The money that has been poured into that place in the past 10 years to get nowhere is frightening,' says one industry observer. The press release, issued when the new plans were announced, quotes from some literature of 1928: 'Only the best of merchandise demanded by Dame Fashion finds its way into the salons of Dickins &amp; Jones.' The release says, with commendable honesty, that 'the store had almost lost this original spirit and clarity of vision'. Andrew Jennings, managing director of House of Fraser, describes the two types of customers he hopes will be attracted to the new store: 'Ms Dickins and Mrs Jones'. Neat as the phrase is, it hardly excites the imagination. Dame Fashion, outmoded as she may be, sounds a great deal more compelling. And so, alas, does the original shop. The new, improved Dickins &amp; Jones looks lovely; it is undoubtedly a more efficient place in which to shop, but it is soulless. No amount of marble or signs or smart light fittings can give a place atmosphere, and although, as Meg Gilmore quite sensibly points out, you cannot sell atmosphere, it is nonetheless atmosphere that sells. Conversely, Liberty has achieved an upsurge in popularity of late and is regarded, by those people who are seriously interested in buying fashion, as the most exciting department store in town. It is perhaps an unfair comparison because neither Ms Dickins nor Mrs Jones would necessarily enjoy the more outrageous brand of merchandise that Liberty now stocks, but the store shows a strong and distinctive personality behind the buying policy. It has not been glossed up for the 1990s; some of the stairway carpets are distinctly shabby, but what it lacks in razzmatazz, it makes up for with sheer shopping excitement. What was once an acreage of Tana lawn blouses and shirt-waisters has been handed over to the likes of Issey Miyake, Workers For Freedom, Betty Jackson, Flyte Ostell and Vivienne Westwood. These are labels that are bought by other stores, too, but the difference in Liberty is the manner in which the collections have been edited; there is a sense that the senior ladies' fashion buyer, Angela Quaintrell, has taken what is considered by most to be a commercial risk, to buy those parts of designer collections that best describe the designer's own vision. Many store buyers, particularly if they are tied to a policy of central buying for a group, tend to edit a collection down to the most commercial and saleable items, thereby giving a designer floor in a store a blander, homogeneous feel. In the end, it is not fixtures and fittings that give a shop personality (although they undoubtedly act as beacons of introduction) but the products on sale. The decline in Next's popularity is an obvious example. When George Davies was removed as chief executive in the late 1980s, the emphasis on style and quality went with him. This was a commercial decision and one, from the figures, that appeared to make sense at the time. However, the short-term advantage is not always of long-term benefit. Next was soon reduced to a shadow of its formerly robust character. The fixtures and fittings remained the same but its product became insipid. A somewhat different cause is having a similar effect at Harvey Nichols. The problem there is a legacy, inherited from the 1980s, of viewing designer labels as rich currency. They are, but only if well invested. An aggressive campaign to attract the best designers to sell in that store has meant that much of the selling space within the store is devoted to concessions, or shops within shops. It is a set-up that designers and manufacturers particularly enjoy and, during the 1980s boom, when international designers could call the shots, was one of the few ways in which to guarantee the store an exclusive deal. Joseph Ettedgui, who has shops within shops in both Harvey Nichols and Liberty, explains the attraction of this sort of retailing.' Before we had our own shops within shops, the store buyer might place an order of about pounds 20,000. Now that we have been able to create our own Joseph environment, with our own sales people in place, we take something like pounds 15,000 a week, or pounds 780,000 a year.' The store also benefits, partly by association with the prestige of the label, but also because they take a guaranteed percentage of profits and act as a landlord taking rent. The longer-term disadvantage - and many in the industry privately consider it to be a crippling one - is that by allowing too many concessions, a store loses its personality. A research document from House of Fraser, outlining the manner in which the group should move forward into the 1990s, is acerbic on this point:'If the department store fills itself with concessions it is no longer in the business of retailing.' As an interested observer points out: 'When a store becomes too dominated by concessions you are no longer buying the handwriting of the store; you are buying the hand-writing of the label. You are losing in essence, the strength and personality of the chief buyer; you are losing the authority of the store.' Consumers now take for granted what were once considered luxuries: a pleasant environment, sophisticated display and flashy fittings. Stephen Marks, who has recently opened expensive new flagship stores for French Connection in Regent Street and Nicole Farhi in Bond Street, is blunt in his assessment of what makes for successful retailing in the 1990s: 'The bottom line is that if you have a good product and it is good value, then the public will find you. If you then make it easy for them to buy it by presenting it well in a nice environment, you will do good business.'</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Small shift in voting could change control in Edinburgh THE DISTRICT council elections in Scotland will take place in a political landscape transformed by the general election. For the first time since the early 1980s, the Scottish Conservatives are going into elections in high spirits and the other parties with apprehension. The big prize is Edinburgh, where a vigorous campaign against Labour was launched last week. Although the Tories hold 22 wards to Labour's 32, a relatively small number of votes need to move from Labour to Conservative to ensure a Tory victory. Unless pressure for a referendum on devolution gathers, the district council elections seem likely to be fought on the usual local-government issues, which in 1988 produced a turnout of about 45 per cent. Of the 53 Scottish district councils, Labour starts with outright control of 27, the Tories and Liberal Democrats three each and the Scottish National party one. The rest are controlled either by independents or by coalitions of the non-Tory parties. The Scottish Conservatives will continue to hold Berwickshire, where seven of their 12 councillors are unopposed, and should keep Eastwood, and Bearsden &amp; Milngavie, near Glasgow. They expect to win Stirling, where Mr Michael Forsyth was returned as MP on April 9 and where control in the council went to Labour last time on the spin of a coin. They also hope to end rule by an SNP/Liberal Democrat coalition in Perth &amp; Kinross, where Sir Nicholas Fairbairn held his parliamentary seat. Although the Conservatives did better in north-east Scotland in the general election they would be doing very well to win Gordon (where they currently have no councillors at all) from the Liberal Democrats, and to take Kincardine &amp; Deeside where they have only two from independents. Labour, demoralised after the general election, will be fighting off a challenge from the SNP, which is fielding more candidates than any other party. Labour hopes to fight off the nationalists in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, where it won control only on the spin of a coin in 1988. It expects to hold Edinburgh. Although the SNP will hope to do well across Scotland by fighting the local elections on the referendum promise, it already has good chances of adding to Angus, the one council it holds, if its vote goes up as it did the general election. They could win Banff &amp; Buchan in the north-east, and in the central belt take Clackmannan, West Lothian and Motherwell. The Liberal Democrats should hold their councils in Gordon, north-east Fife and Annandale and Eskdale in the south-west.</p>

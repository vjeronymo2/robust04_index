			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> S.D. WILTS ON A SIZZLING CINCO DE MAYO  </P> <P> The high temperature at Lindbergh Field was 81 degrees on Saturday, far below  the record 96 set in 1953, but elsewhere in San Diego County, Cinco de Mayo  sizzled.  </P> <P> Santee reported a wilting 105 at 2 p.m., and Camp Pendleton reported a high of  102. Other highs reported on Saturday included 87 in Vista, 94 in Escondido and  93 in Alpine.  </P> <P> Downtown San Diego and parts of the coast escaped the heat wave because they  "probably had a little bit stronger breeze today," said a spokesman for the  National Weather Service in San Diego.  </P> <P> It was also unseasonably hot elsewhere in Southern California. Los Angeles  reported in at 101 degrees, which easily broke a previous record high of 93  degrees for the day in 1953.  </P> <P> But an absence of off-shore breezes and a high-pressure system that hung  immobile over much of California throughout the day also helped temperatures  rise to 104 in Monrovia, 102 in Woodland Hills, Long Beach, Montebello and  Riverside, and 101 in Pasadena and San Bernardino.  </P> <P> Coastal freeways and roads turned into blocked arteries, clogged with carloads  of sunstruck beach-goers.  </P> <P> San Diego City lifeguards performed 28 rescues, an unusually high number for a  Saturday early in May. An estimated 95,000 San Diegans sought cooler  temperatures at city beaches, while thousands more gathered at Embarcadero Park  for an evening fireworks display celebrating Cinco de Mayo.  </P> <P> San Diegans can look for more of the same hot weather this morning and  afternoon. The forecast calls for highs of between 76 and 84 along the coast,  92 to 100 inland, 70 to 78 in the mountains and 97 to 105 in the desert. The  high pressure system causing the heat wave is expected to move back into the  desert tonight and bring cooler temperatures on Monday.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County lifeguards said crowds ranged from 100,000 at Long Beach and  Hermosa Beach to 90,000 at Zuma. In Orange County, estimates ranged from almost  90,000 visitors in Newport Beach to 5,000 in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> In Santa Monica, where an estimated 150,000 shoreline visitors lounged on the  sand, even the lifeguards were not immune to traffic woes.  </P> <P> "Our guys have been up to 30 minutes late just trying to find places to park,"  said lifeguard Dan Atkins, 34.  </P> <P> Atkins said the peaceful crowds and mild upper-70s temperatures provided for a  "perfect beach day" -- marred only by a few minor encounters between lifeguards  and rowdy visitors over excessive beer drinking.  </P> <P> "So far we haven't had to arrest anybody," Atkins said. "Our concern is that  they'll go into the water drunk."  </P> <P> Campers took to the roads leading north to mountain resorts. At Crystal Lake in  the Angeles National Forest, where cars and four-wheel-drive vehicles equipped  with tents filed in all day long, park naturalist Sharon Seales said the heat  had provided "the biggest warm weather draw of the year."  </P> <P> San Diego's mountain communities also reported delightful weather: It was sunny  and 75 at Mount Laguna, 78 at Cuyamaca Park.  </P> <P> At the Mariachi Festival in downtown Santa Ana, Louise Diaz, wearing a  full-length, long-sleeved ruffled dress, tried to find relief by eating a  Popsicle while she waited to take the stage with the Folklorico La Fonda dance  troupe.  </P> <P> "It's hot!" she said, belaboring the obvious.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County fire officials declared a "red flag warning" -- one stage  below the red flag "alerts" issued when fire danger is most extreme.  </P> <P> "It's kind of rare for this time of year" to issue the warning, Fire Capt. Jim  Jordan said.  </P> <P> Weather forecasters said the 100-degree temperatures were not expected to  return today to the Los Angeles area. Steve Burback, a meteorologist with  WeatherData Inc., which supplies forecasts to The Times, said the high-pressure  system that spanned from San Francisco to Nevada's Great Basin would move  eastward, leaving a few clouds and highs in the upper 80s and low 90s today.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Phillip Gollner in Chatsworth and Dan Weikel in Costa Mesa  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Citroen drops plan for Namibia car plant CITROEN has shelved plans for a Rand 200m (Pounds 40m) car plant in Namibia after failing to agree with the government the amount of components it must buy locally. The setback, four years after feasibility studies started, reflects a perennial problem in negotiating terms for car production in third world countries, said the French car maker, part of the Peugeot group. Namibia is part of the Southern African Customs Union (Sacu), which sets strict rules on local content. At least 75 per cent of components must originate from Sacu, which embraces South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. Citroen says this is too high and that it needs the freedom to import more components. Mr Anton Von Wietersheim, Namibia's trade and industry minister, said South Africa's 110 per cent import duty on cars also weighed on Citroen's decision. 'The influence of Sacu on industrialisation in smaller countries is a negative one because many of the regulations are protective of the South African existing industries,' he said. Citroen is still in contact with the Namibian government. This was not the first time the group had encountered a developing country which had an unrealistic idea of its capacity to supply a western car company, said an official. Local content formed a central part of separate talks with the Chinese government on a car assembly plant in central China, where Citroen is due to sigh a final agreement shortly. To increase the level of local content there, 26 mainly French components suppliers have agreed to set up joint ventures with local partners. This strategy, however, appears less appropriate in Namibia, where Citroen has focused its negotiations on trying to reduce the level of local content required.</p>

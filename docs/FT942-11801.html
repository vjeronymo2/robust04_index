			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Observer: Master builder Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester may have caught analysts on the hop, but can it really have come as such a surprise to staff at the Building Societies Association? Back in December, its director-general Adrian Coles presciently chose Brian Pitman to deliver his 'distinctive view of current and future developments in the banking world' to the BSA's conference later this month. Sadly, Coles's crystal ball contains a minor flaw. Lloyds Bank's boss will be speaking shortly before the legality of the deal is tested in the High Court. Had the conference been scheduled for just a little later in May, Pitman might have been able to say rather more.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;89&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain de Havilland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and &hyph;300 series airplanes. Transport Canada Aviation advises that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there have been reports of corrosion forming on areas of the airplane structure where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> black Orcon film covers the thermal insulation blankets. Investigation revealed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> black Orcon film used to insulate the forward fuselage, passenger compartment, flight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compartment, and ventilation ducts contains carbon. The cause of this corrosion has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributed to the formation of condensation on any aluminum airplane structure when it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in contact with the carbon in the black Orcon film. Such corrosion, if not detected and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrected in a timely manner, could result in degradation of the strength of the airplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuselage structure and could lead to sudden loss of cabin pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bombardier, Inc. (formerly de Havilland) has issued Service Bulletins  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> S.B. 8&hyph;25&hyph;89, Revision D; S.B. 8&hyph;25&hyph;90, Revision B; S.B. 8&hyph;25&hyph;91, Revision C; S.B. 8&hyph;25&hyph;92, Revision D; and S. B. 8&hyph;25&hyph;93, Revision B; all dated January 19, 1994. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service bulletins describe procedures for one-time visual inspection to detect corrosion on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas of the airplane structure where black film thermal insulation is used, and repaired, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary. The service bulletins also describe procedures for replacement of black Orcon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> film insulation blankets with AN4C aluminized (silver) film thermal insulation blankets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in various areas of the airplane structure. Transport Canada Aviation classified these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service bulletins as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;94&hyph;08,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dated April 26, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require a one-time visual inspection to detect corrosion on areas of the airplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure where black film thermal insulation is used, and repaired, if necessary. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD also would require replacement of black Orcon film thermal insulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blankets with AN4C aluminized (silver) film insulation blankets. The actions would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 125 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD, that it would require approximately 650 work hours to accomplish the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. The FAA has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advised that the manufacturer plans to provide required parts and to accomplish the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required modification at no expense to operators. Therefore, there is no cost impact on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. operators that is associated with this proposed rule with regard to labor charges or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does recognize, however, that while operators may incur administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs associated with compliance to this proposed rule, the one-year compliance time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in paragraph (a) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

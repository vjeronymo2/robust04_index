			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / As They Say In Europe: Sophisticated louts 'WELL, IF you look carefully at what I said at the time, it was a fairly sophisticated way of trying to increase the pressure, in a variety of different ways . . .' Thus Lord Owen explained to a news conference in London how his earlier demand that Serbia be bombed could be reconciled with his new post as a neutral chairman of the Yugoslav peace conference. We have clearly seen events in eastern Germany in a false light - as a story of unpleasant louts setting fire to refugee hostels when it was really a tale of sophisticated attempts to put pressure on foreigners. Fortunately the paper of the old Solidarity trade union in Warsaw, Gazeta Wyborcza, got near the truth. Its correspondent, Andrzej Kaniewski, wrote, 'The skill which the neo-Nazi mobs showed during the week in carrying out their actions and their apparent readiness to take further action against asylum-seekers, prove that they are anything but a band of street adventurers. In actual fact they are well-prepared and trained for street-fighting.' Kaniewski concluded that the reasons for the pogrom were not economic, but natural taste for dictatorship among the citizens of the former GDR, so long as 'order' was kept. The Poles have a special distaste for the citizens of the former German Democratic Republic after 40 odd years of 'fraternal socialist friendship.' Now the Austrians are supposed to exhibit Germanic xenophobia only more so, so the Vienna press has done all it can do distance itself from German events and avoid being tarred by the Rostock brush. Kurier wrote, 'The mob rages on the street. The state finances are threatened, business is worried. Nazi thugs receive bourgeois applause. The news from Germany. It recalls bad times. And arouses the fear that such times might return.' But Kurier concluded that democracy in Germany was strong, 'but more in the west than the east.' For the French the events in Germany have become merely an adjunct to the Maastricht argument. Nobody in the 'Yes' camp pretends that the proposed treaty on economic and monetary union is a good thing; argument consists of listing the dire consequences of voting 'No'. Liberation thinks both sides are playing the same game: 'For one group, the proposed European Union consecrates German domination, for the other, it is exactly the opposite: a 'No' would provoke a fatal divorce between France and Germany putting the latter in the dominant position on the European continent.' But the paper came down on the 'Yes' side, 'because a 'No' victory would would end up by convincing Germany that the French have an opportunistic, egoistic conception of Europe, that Germany must sacrifice itself still more so that France can maintain the vain illusion that it governs the world.' There are few papers that espouse the opposite cause. Those that do originate from an odd or unsavoury point in the French political spectrum. Thus the communist Humanite accuses the 'Yes' camp of outdoing itself in its 'chaos blackmail.' But it turns one of the arguments of its opponents on its head - 'The idea that Europe cannot be made without France . . . UNIMAGINABLE] they shout in unison. And that is right.' In other words there will be no 'Europe' without France so vote 'No' because otherwise there will be a 'Europe of the great money powers dominated by Germany.' The French will vote no, perhaps, because it is their last chance to play a decisive role in Europe. It was all summed up in a glorious welter of metaphors in Die Welt: 'In the struggle for the Maastricht vote, the house is set ablaze to grill a schnitzel. Both sides say they see demons at work in Germany; one group would tie it down, the others say one should not get under its claws. The political class is divided but a 'No' would be its Waterloo . . .' James Morgan is diplomatic correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

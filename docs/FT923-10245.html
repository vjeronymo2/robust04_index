			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (8): They're cutting big holes in the floor - Andrew Baxter visits GE's plant at Greenville, S. Carolina THE rapid growth in the global gas turbine market over the past five years has prompted heavy investment by producers to raise manufacturing capacity, taking advantage of modern production technology and reorganising to maximise efficiency. The trend is particularly well illustrated at General Electric's gas turbine factory at Greenville, South Carolina, where a three-year, Dollars 150m plant expansion and reorganisation is nearly complete. Construction workers are still cutting some very large holes in the floor to accommodate the foundations for new machine tools or provide spin wells for the turbines. When the expansion is completed, says Mr Edward Darien, advanced programmes and customer relations manager at the plant, floorspace will have increased 30 per cent to 1m square feet - at what is already the world's largest gas turbine factory. GE opened the Greenville plant in 1968, but the seeds of the current manufacturing strategy were sown in the mid-1980s when the dearth of power generation orders worldwide prompted the company to end gas turbine manufacture at Schenectady, New York state, and consolidate production at Greenville. But GE also had to think carefully, says Mr Darien, about precisely what it wanted to produce. This led to a Dollars 55m consolidation and modernisation programme from 1987-1989, with a clear focus on the core technologies of gas turbine manufacture - blades, buckets, combustion hardware and nozzles. It also led to a worldwide sourcing policy for the basic, unmachined, castings, forgings and casings. Some of the biggest forgings come from Japan  -no one in the US can make them - while GE's worldwide business associates supply many turbine parts. The current programme is intended to strengthen the focus on core technology, increase throughput by more than 40 per cent, and support new models. Apart from a heavy dose of reorganisation, the expansion includes a materials distribution centre to free space for manufacturing, a new combustion and coating manufacturing building and an additional test facility for GE's 'F' series of advanced gas turbines. New processes and equipment are in evidence throughout the production flow. The crucial interlocking points of the turbine buckets are being protected from wear with powder applied by laser, while additional ultra-modern vacuum plasma spray facilities with an automated co-ordinate measuring centre have been introduced for coating the buckets. Further along the production line, a new Lapointe Champion broaching machine is making the dovetail slots on the rotor wheels quicker and more accurately than its predecessors, while a nozzle machining cell, based around five Cincinnati Milacron machining centres, is reducing cycle times by servicing several nozzle configurations simultaneously. Shorter cycle times is one of the priorities of modern turbine manufacture, and Mr Darien said the first half of this year had produced some 'significant hits' in reducing both cycle times and inventories (stocks). Further gains will be made as the expansion is completed, he says. However, GE is keenly aware that reducing cycle times cannot be left to new technology alone. The cycle time for turbine blades - from the issuing of the paper work to the finished blade - was very quickly halved from 26 to 13 weeks with new machine tools, but it has taken considerable efforts on organisation, training and teamwork to bring it very close to a target of just two weeks. It sounds, perhaps, like an old cliche, but Mr Darien stresses Greenville's biggest asset, its people and their very positive - non-union - work ethic. Employment will be close to 1,900 by the end of this year, compared with 752 in 1986, and over the past five years there has been much greater emphasis on employee participation. Hourly-paid workers, for example, have been sent to machine tool suppliers to accept equipment for delivery. The next target for Greenville, apart from filling the remaining holes in its factory floor, is to win certification to the ISO-9000 quality standard. Mr Darien hopes that will be achieved by the end of this year.</p>

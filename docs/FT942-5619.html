			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hambros Insurance falls 15% Hambros Insurance Services yesterday blamed a poor performance by its loss adjusting business for a 15 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.3m for the year to March 31. The decline in profits was foreshadowed at the interim stage. The results covered the group's first complete year of trading and compared with Pounds 9.8m on a pro forma basis. The group said that loss adjusting had 'suffered from the exceptionally low level of claims experienced by the insurance industry'. Turnover for the division declined to Pounds 38.6m (Pounds 41.6m), but profits fell by more than 50 per cent to Pounds 2m (Pounds 5m). Hambros said it was reviewing the structure and cost base of its loss adjusting operation in order to identify areas where its services could be improved and broadened. By contrast, Hambros' other businesses all performed well. Hambro Legal Protection - which sells legal expenses insurance and telephone helplines services - increased profits by 34 per cent to Pounds 4.5m, with turnover rising to Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 9.9m). Beale Dobie, which trades second hand endowment policies, increased profits by 17 per cent to Pounds 1.4m with turnover ahead to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 14.9m). Earnings fell to 7.8p (11.2p). A proposed final dividend of 3.7p makes a 5.55p total.</p>

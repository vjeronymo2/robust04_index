			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Disease provisions put Geest Pounds 3.8m in the red Political uncertainty over bananas, coupled with disease on its Costa Rican plantations, pushed Geest Pounds 3.8m into into the red for the year ended January 1. 'Our problem is all about bananas,' said Mr David Sugden, chief executive of the fresh produce and prepared food group, describing the year as 'a bit of an aberration'. The pre-tax loss, compared with profits of Pounds 3.1m, was struck on turnover of Pounds 636m, against Pounds 658.9m, which included Pounds 53.1m from discontinued operations. Geest warned in January that it would incur an exceptional charge of Pounds 8.9m to cover the cost of an attack of fungal disease on its banana plantations in Costa Rica. It also incurred an exceptional charge of Pounds 4.6m on restructuring its produce sector. Profits before tax and exceptional items were Pounds 8.2m, down from Pounds 22.2m. Mr Sugden said the group had suffered great difficulties with the transition of the European banana regime. Latin American countries were yesterday in Brussels for further negotiations on the dollar-banana quota. Geest remained concerned that the regulations were still subject to political changes. However, the first quarter this year had seen a substantial improvement in the European banana market. The food preparation division, which supplies chilled salads and other products, reported operating profits of Pounds 5.2m on turnover of Pounds 107.3m. Profits were similar to 1992 in spite of start-up losses of Pounds 1.2m from a new pasta facility. Mr Sugden expects the division's profits to double next year. Capital expenditure for the year totalled Pounds 39m, including Pounds 17.4m on the food preparation division, which is expected to account for most of the Pounds 20m to be spent this year. Net debt rose from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 43.5m, giving gearing of 60 per cent. This is expected to fall below 40 per cent this year. Losses per share were 7.6p, (3.8p). An unchanged final dividend of 4.4p is proposed, making a maintained total for the year of 8.1p. COMMENT In spite of the diversification into food preparation, the swing factor for Geest remains bananas. The market has started well this year, but political crosswinds could easily blow it off course again. While the world supply and demand equation is improving, it is well to remember that only four years ago profits were Pounds 20m when the group was importing bananas for the UK alone. So the foray into Costa Rica could be seen as an expensive detour, although Geest would argue that it now has 12 per cent of the European market. Forecasts for this year range from Pounds 18m to as high as Pounds 25m, giving prospective multiples of 10 and 15 respectively. Those who view it as a recovery stock should be prepared for a bumpy ride.</p>

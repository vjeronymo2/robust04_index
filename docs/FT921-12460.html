			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Appointments: Strategic questions for the Pru Mick Newmarch, chief executive of the PRUDENTIAL, has named Laurel Powers-Freeling, an American who detested her very first job peddling policies for Prudential of America, as the new head of corporate strategy at Britain's biggest insurance company. Powers-Freeling, at 34 probably the most senior woman at the Pru, will head a team of some 15 strategists. She joined last April at manager level, and has now been made a director reporting directly to Newmarch. She came from Morgan Stanley International - where 'I discovered deal-making was not my forte' - following spells specialising in insurance at McKinsey and Price Waterhouse. The Pru had had a nominal head of strategy before, she says, but her considerably more senior appointment reflects Newmarch's desire to 'be much more aggressive with strategy. Mick is committed to a complete re-examination of how we do our business.' The energetic Powers-Freeling, whose promotion coincides with the arrival of her first baby, is shortly returning, after just six weeks' leave, to embark on a four-month review of global strategy. Newmarch himself, who made his mark on the investment management side, has yet to prove he can make a real success at the helm of the giant retail financial services concern. The big question - and one which is hardly likely to be dealt with in 16 weeks - is how the organisation brings its distribution techniques into the 1990s. Perhaps the woman from the Pru will tell him.</p>

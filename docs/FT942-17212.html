			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Clearing the tunnel The merchant bankers busy glueing Eurotunnel's rights issue prospectus together will be mightily relieved at the settlement of the dispute with Transmanche Link. The outbreak of peace removes the last big obstacle blocking Eurotunnel's fund-raising. All outstanding legal claims are at least being made by Eurotunnel rather than being pursued against it, which will simplify the contingent liabilities clause. To that extent, it was fair enough for Eurotunnel to claim a victory. The unanswered question is whether substantially the same deal could have been struck many months ago. The contractors always appeared ready to settle for far less than their inflated headline claim. For their part, they must be delighted they are being paid in hard cash rather than the paper that was previously mooted. Swiss Bank Corporation will limit their underwriting exposure. It is a fair bet that many will eventually be able to release some of their accumulated provisions. Despite the settlement, Eurotunnel shareholders are fretting about the slippage in the opening programme and the consequent rise in the funding requirement. Eurotunnel's units fell 2 per cent in London as it became apparent that significantly more than the originally-planned Pounds 500m of new equity will be needed - although the proposed increase in authorised shares is largely a technicality, which is not as worrying as it might appear. There seems little doubt that Eurotunnel will eventually make a lot of money for someone. Shareholders face hefty demands for money first.</p>

AeroPeru President Rodolfo Elmore said that Pan Am,  American Airlines and the Spanish carrier Iberia, among others, had shown  interest in buying part of AeroPeru.  </P> <P> The firm, Peru's main domestic and international carrier, has been operating at  a loss for years. Elmore said in the television interview that its finances  were in "deplorable condition." Total or partial privatization of AeroPeru  would first have to be approved by President Alberto Fujimori, who won June  elections on a promise not to sell off state firms, including AeroPeru.  </P></p>

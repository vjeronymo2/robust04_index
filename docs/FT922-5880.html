			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (3): Only mild grumbles - Germany THERE HAS been no lack of complaints from German industry over the flood of regulations on packaging and recycling from Mr Klaus Topfer's environment ministry. But, considering the business community's normally rigid resistance to interventionist policies from Bonn, the grumbling has been mild. It has been concerned more with timetables and technology than with the guiding principle, widely embraced by the population, that the throw-away society has had its day. ing those who resisted his proposals, has there been any fuss from the competition authorities in Brussels: no summons to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. Although the European Commission's own proposals on packaging and recycling are less rigorous than those already implanted in Germany, the minister is encouraged. 'We can see the same building blocks we used in our regulations,' he said in a recent interview. 'Therefore, others have been convinced.' But not everyone. Britain's Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment (Incpen), has formally complained that the latest round of rules 'restricts the free movement of goods into Germany.' It also claims, as do German environmentalist groups, that, because the German recycling industry will not be able to cope with the flood of returned packaging, it will be shipped in other countries, such as Poland which is hungry for foreign exchange, overloading their waste disposal systems and adding to their already hefty environmental burdens. There are already signs of strain. The plastics industry association, faced with taking back an estimated 1m tonnes of packing each year, recently appealed directly to chancellor Helmut Kohl for a stay of execution of the legal requirement that, from July 1995, they must recycle at least 64 per cent of the packaging output. The industry claimed that, in the time before the deadline, it would be able to install only enough capacity to deal with 20 per cent, and it would be 1999 before it could cope properly. The same conditions have been set for paper, glass and metal waste. Mr Topfer immediately rejected the appeal, and his officials claimed that the problem would tend to resolve itself. Confronted with specific deadlines and quotas, industry would reduce its output and use of plastic packing, and therefore reduce the need for reprocessing plant. Meanwhile, some sectors are getting on with the job. According to the BASF chemicals group, more than 35 per cent of the 30,000 tonnes of polystyrene foam used each year for packaging in Germany is already being re-used. It is typically either milled and re-used in its ground-up state in packing, potting composts or lightweight cement and concrete products, or melted down and recycled entirely. The Storopack-Reichenecker Group, a leading manufacturer with five recycling plants already in operation, calculates this year on using recycled product in up to 50 per cent of its annual output. Its plant in Langenau, Baden-Wurttemberg, can handle 600kg an hour, and is claimed to be the biggest in Europe. Despite the continued griping, the commercial as well as the environmental benefits of Mr Topfer's grand design are beginning to emerge. German companies, forced to adapt, are rapidly developing new recycling technologies and building a competitive position for when similar legislation is introduced elsewhere. Virtually every major engineering concern in the country now has a division dedicated to environmental technology. Car manufacturers and domestic appliance makers are well along the road to meeting the minister's next requirements: that they should be responsible for taking back and recycling their products when they finally leave the road or run through their last cycle. Meanwhile, the country's whole waste handling and disposal system is in the throes of a revolution: again a possible model for others of public and private services working in parallel. Duales System Deutschland (DSD), an independent collection and recycling company set up last year by retailers and manufacturers to help cope with the new rules, is making rapid progress. The 400 companies which launched it had grown to around 3,000 at the last count. Its income from licensing members to mark their products with Der Grune Punkt (the Green Spot) is already around DM2bn (Pounds 683m) a year. The Green Spot is a guarantee that the maker has undertaken to take the package back and re-use or recycle it. Loudly denounced by environmentalists as a confidence trick and nothing more than a way of artificially increasing prices (the cost of the mark, depending on the size of the package, ranges from 1 pfennig to 20 pfennigs a pack). They claim manufacturers have signed up with DSD and increased their prices while its disposal and recycling functions are still in their infancy. A grand project to equip every household in the country with a special yellow dustbin to hold Green Spot packs is still on trial in only three areas, including Bonn. Collected by the public authorities, their contents are sorted and shipped off for recycling by private companies. Germany's tidy-minded citizens, among the most environmentally-concerned in the world, are well-accustomed to playing their part in environmental protection. However, there are some signs of fatigue among the population. Bins installed in shops since April to collect outer packaging are relatively under-used. Shoppers complain they have no time, or that the bins are inconveniently placed. What is already obvious, however, is that the manufacturing, retailing and packaging industries are adapting. Karstadt, a leading department chain, reported in April that it had asked suppliers to dispense with outer packaging on more than 5,000 products. According to the environment ministry, one of the country's biggest food retailers has calculated that outer wrappers are unnecessary on 98 per cent of its grocery lines.</p>

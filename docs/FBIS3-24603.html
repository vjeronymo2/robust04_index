			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. F. Trotskiy and V. I. Yamkovoy; Novosibirsk </F> State University, 630090; UDC 577.113.6]    [Abstract] In order to improve solid phase enzymatic  synthesis of extended oligoribonucleotides, the authors used  biogel P-300, sepharose 4B, and cellulose hydrazides as  substrates to immobilize tetraribonucleotides that had been  oxidized with sodium periodate. The reactivity of  (pU)[.sup]3[/]pU[.sub]ox[/] and  (Ap)[.sup]3[/]A[.sub]ox[/] tetraribonucleotides  immobilized on the above substrates was studied in solid phase  ligation and phosphorylation reactions. The subscript ``ox''  indicates a sodium periodate-oxidized nucleoside residue with  cleavage of the 2'-3'-C-C-bond. In this case, it was discovered  that the greatest yield in both reactions was achieved with the  use of biogel P-300 and sepharose 4B. An advantage of sepharose  4B over biogel P-300 was that it had superior hydrodynamic  qualities. References 7: 6 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Travel: Sicily's spring eruption - Beauty on the surface disguises underworld violence VULCANO is extinct. Yet puffs of smoke still drift about its summit like the last wisps from a dying bonfire. The smell of sulphur wafts across the water long before the ferry from Milazzo can tie up at the island jetty. Porto Levante, at Vulcano's base, in the Aeolian islands, off Sicily, is an ill-favoured place. Even as the season begins, its straggle of holiday villas, newly dilapidated, have a desperate, end-of-season look about them. Further on is the health spa, a chain of noisome sulphur pools filled with milky-white water. Beyond them again is the coal-black beach, decorated with squashed plastic bottles and other detritus. But even in this dead place the Sicilian springtime has covered the ground, erupting in vivid rashes of red and yellow wildflowers. The whole of Sicily is carpeted with them: they spill on to motorways, spread across rubbish dumps, crawl up ruins and sprinkle the valleys of the island's interior like a pointilliste painting. A botanist could have a field day. For the non-botanical it is still a revelation. From the edge of Porto Levante a path winds up the side of the old volcano through yellow broom and pale blue thistles. About two-thirds of the way up the vegetation gives out. The path traverses dangerous screes of strange-coloured rock, the twisted remains of the last eruption. As it nears the bare summit it passes a row of smoking vents, their lips smeared greenish-yellow with sulphur; you can lean down and inhale the acrid breath of the dragon. To gaze into the mouth of Hades itself, you must climb on up to the rim of the crater. Sicily's volcanoes, living and dead, are the most extreme features of a harsh landscape. They are also an irresistible metaphor for the underground violence for which the island is notorious. The mafiosi no longer operate as village Robin Hoods, filling the vacuum left by absentee, foreign landlords. Driven underground by Mussolini and re-emerging to ingratiate themselves with the allied army at the end of the Second World War, they have grown up into real city hoods, engaged in local politics, property speculation and building contracts as well as the heroin trade. Most have reportedly left Palermo for a more lucrative life in the eastern cities of Catania and Gela. Ask a restaurateur in a small town whether the Mafia are active there and he will agree vigorously: but by 'mafia' he means political patronage and municipal corruption generally, a way of life that is endemic not just to Sicily but to Italy as a whole. So, stumbling one day into a plenary meeting of the Sicilian Rotary Club - squat, black-suited men dwarfed by their leggy, mink-coated wives - it was hard not to see a re-enactment of a scene from Godfather II. For much of its complicated history the island was culturally divided: Carthaginian and Arab in the west, Greek and Byzantine in the east. The tourist can slice Sicily in other ways, too. The coast with its rampant development, ancient monuments, beaches and bars is one kind of holiday. Those who like to feel they have missed nothing can even take a week-long guided tour round the perimeter. (According to one grey-faced customer descending from a coach, it is no picnic). The interior is quite another experience. Its scenery is magnificent rather than beautiful. Although the land is still cultivated, post-war migration to the towns has left it denuded of people. You can see it the easy way, sailing along the empty Catania-Palermo motorway. More interesting is to branch off at Enna, the first of a chain of spectacular hill-towns that stand like sentries around the base of Mount Etna. The road south from Enna leads to Piazza Armerina, site of a large Roman villa with well-preserved mosaic floors, and eventually to Agrigento, where the Greek temples stand on their ridge below the city. (They can be seen best in the evening). In the wild country to the north lie the hill towns of Leonforte, Nicosia, Troina and Randazzo. Some were Norman garrisons, and a medieval atmosphere still clings to them. Here the foreigner can still feel that uncomfortable shiver between the shoulder-blades as he crosses the piazza eyed by hostile stares. Urban Sicilians, with their yuppie phones and fat EC grants, disown the antique life of the hills. Out here, they claim, the shepherds still carry guns and regularly murder one another. Sicily's spring is not all sunshine. When the clouds roll down from Etna's snowcapped summit, the world goes black. On Etna's northern side, where the best grapes are said to grow, the road cuts through rivers of lava, grey-black boulders left frozen on the hillside like herds of slaughtered elephants. The streets and houses of Linguaglossa (some of them left abandoned after the last eruption) are coated in greasy black and the air smells as thickly of burning coal as any mining town. Because springtime is too early for most sunseekers, popular resorts like the cliff-top town of Taormina are at their best. Last year was exceptionally quiet. The manager of the San Domenico Palace, a hotel of old-fashioned splendour and luxury built out of a Dominican monastery, blamed the unseasonal weather. A waiter had another explanation: the Americans had been frightened off by the Gulf war, he said, and the rich Italians had spent all their savings in the supermarkets stocking up in the event of a Libyan counter-attack. Apart from the chattering gangs of local teenagers, the night-cries of car burglar alarms and the buzz of Sicilian Vespas, the town was only just beginning to wake. Few restaurants were open and the river of humanity that floods the Corso Umberto in high season was still a trickle. The dining room of the San Domenico was empty on most nights but for the occasional honeymooners or middle-aged couples from Japan, Germany or Britain. The 80-year-old hotel pianist, a marathon walker and winemaker, played to an empty saloon. The sea was just audible, hundreds of feet below. From the hotel's superb terraced garden, Etna was occasionally visible above the clouds, smoking incessantly: alive, beautiful and dangerous.

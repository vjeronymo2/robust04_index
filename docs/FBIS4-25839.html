			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhang Hongfan (6774 2347 5400): "`The </F> Pearl of Taihang' Has Become Even More Splendid--Linzhou People  Have Completed Another `Red Flag Canal' Project"]    [Text] Henan Province's Linzhou City (formerly Linxian),  is located on the eastern slopes of Mount Taihang, at the  conjunction of three provinces, namely, Henan, Shanxi and Hebei.  Its terrain is mountainous and covered with thousands of steep  ridges and peaks.    The area was formerly an impoverished county, severed from  the rest of the country by its poor transportation conditions,  lack of resources, thin layer of soil over its rocky fields, and  with water as costly as oil. In the wake of reform and opening  up, Linzhou people have brought forth their past "Red Flag  Canal" spirit, and scored new accomplishments under the  leadership of party organizations at various levels. At the end  of 1993, the city's gross output value was 4.89 billion yuan and  its financial revenue ranked among the advanced in Henan; a  favorable balance in savings deposits of urban and rural  residents was 2.77 billion yuan, topped the whole province. The  city's comprehensive purchasing power jumped from 44th place in  1990 to 12th in the province.    In their march to mount a new economic plane and achieve  comparatively well-to-do living standards, Linzhou City has  persisted in "doing two types of work simultaneously, attaching  equal importance to both," reaping a bumper harvest in building  both material and spiritual civilizations. The running water in  the Red Flag Canal clearly reflects the new image of the Linzhou  people devoting themselves without reservation to accomplishing  the task, making efforts to progress, and being prosperous and  civilized in the 1990's.  <H5>  Never Give Up the Soul of the Nation </H5>   Talking about Linzhou people, we naturally associate them  with the Red Flag Canal, which is their pride and joy and an  immortal monument.    It was in the three years of natural disasters during the  1960's, under the circumstances whereby the 200,000 residents of  the locality were allowed a daily ration of only 300 grams of  grain, using the strength of carrying poles and their own bare  hands, they leveled out 1,250 hills, built 157 aqueducts, dug 21  tunnels, and completed an artificial canal, the Red Flag Canal,  which was 1,500 km long. This tied a silvery ribbon around the  waist of Mount Taihang, bringing in the waters of the Zhang He.    Linzhou people in the 1990's have become well-off and their  concepts have been rethought. Confronted with the current of  reform and opening up and the pounding from the commodity  economy, does the past pioneering spirit of hard work with  perseverance continue to shine along the Red Flag Canal? Mao  Wanchun, Linzhou City CPC Committee secretary told this  reporter: "The Red Flag Canal spirit is a tremendous source of  wealth for us. We must bring forth the pioneering spirit of  hard work with perseverance to strive for a new `Red Flag Canal'  project for construction, reform, opening up, and economic  development."    Anyang Dafang Ceramic Company Ltd., was the first  joint-venture with Chinese and foreign investment in this small  city and there was a very heartwarming story in the course of  its development.    On 18 June 1993, a team of Italian experts involved in the  joint-venture arrived in Linzhou to install equipment, making  slight of the long journey. When they saw that two presses,  each weighing 50 tonne and 6m in height were still to be  positioned, they asked the factory to order the services of a  70-tonne crane.    There were no 70-tonne cranes in Linzhou, not even in the  Anyang areas. When the factory director Hou Yonghe told the  Italian team that he had decided to position the machines using  manpower, an Italian expert said bluntly: "The conditions for  installing the machines basically do not exist in this place;  the positioning will take a very long time. We will return to  Italy first and come back again in six months time to install  them." With these words, they went straight back to the guest  house.    To win time, Hou Yonghe followed them to the guest house,  and  explained to them the possibility of positioning the equipment  by manpower; however, the foreign experts shook their heads,  because never in their lives had they witnessed such an action  and they had been to every part of the world. At last, Hou  Yonghe entreated; "Please give me three days; if we fail to  position the presses by the end of three days, I will personally  see you off at the Zhengzhou Airport!"    The foreign experts laughed at this, and the team leader  said: "Three days, Mr. Hou? I don't think it possible even if  you have 10 days! If you succeed in positioning them in three  days, I will give you a $1,000 reward to show my appreciation!"    Although time was won, the director's heart was heavy.    There was no retreat, they had to cross the Rubicon; it was  time to test the Chinese will. A crack team comprising more  than 20 workers was formed. They borrowed six 50-tonne screw  jacks, four 20-tonne pulleys, and 200 railway sleepers from  another factory. Thus, the 50-tonne equipment was moved upward  inch by inch, and forward millimeter by millimeter. It took  them 38 hours to fulfill the task; none of the workers left the  work site, and the factory director did not shut his eyes for a  wink of sleep; consequently, the two mammoths were positioned,  the whole process was likened to "ants gnawing at a bone."    At the guest house, the interpreter repeated the message  twice, but the Italian experts remained doubtful. It was not  until they arrived at the work site in the workshop, when Mr.  Piarener, the technological executive witnessed the result with  his own eyes, that he suddenly hugged Hou Yonghe, and said with  admiration: "That is unbelievable, really unbelievable!  Linzhou people are swell!" The Italian experts were totally  convinced and promptly contacted their general executive and the  decision was made to invest more in Linzhou to build a second  and third production line.    Today, the pioneering spirit of hard work is often thought  and talked about among Linzhou's cadres and masses; furthermore,  new essences of the spirit are found through constantly talking  about it. Hou Yonghe said: "Through practice in running a  joint-venture with Italian investment, we have come to a  profound understanding that the pioneering spirit of hard work  hard with perseverance is also in the investment climate." Wang  Fasui, party branch secretary of Yaochun Town's Shijiahe  village, said: "The pioneering spirit of hard work with  perseverance we refer to today is not confined to living a  frugal life and being willing to contribute one's greatest  efforts to work; the more important point is a spirit of  "dauntless persistency," being bold in blazing new trail,  developing an undertaking, working with perseverance, and making  progress in a scientific way." On five occasions, Henan  Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Li Changchun has been to  Linzhou to conduct surveys and summarize experiences. He said:  "The pioneering spirit Linzhou people shaped in the course of  building the Red Flag Canal, being continuously enriched in the  period of reform and opening up, embodies the combination of our  fine national spirit and the modern idea of reform and opening  up and making concrete the great pioneering spirit of the new  period advocated by General Secretary Jiang Zemin; it is the  crystallization of the national soul of the Chinese nation."  <H5>  Use the Best "Steel" To Make the Knife's Edge </H5>   In the past, Linxian was synonymous of poverty and  backwardness but, with today's economic development, Linzhou's  financial "cake" has become ever larger; consequently, the  purses of ordinary people have become fatter with each passing  day. When they briefed visitors in tunr on the splendid  accomplishments of the Red Flag Canal, they were proud of the  fact that the favorable balance in savings deposits of Linzhou  residents topped the province.    It is true that poverty does not spell socialism. The more  precious is the fact that as Linzhou people advance on the path  to becoming comparatively well-off and prosperous, their fine  tradition of being diligent and thrifty and working hard with  perseverance has been sustained; they are spending the precious  wealth they have created through their own diligence on those  projects whereby a whole generation or several generations will  benefit.    Members of Linzhou City's leading bodies at various levels  took the lead in sharing and paying for their meals with the  masses in their homes.    People from Shijiahe village who became well-off have all  moved into rows of country-villa-style two-story houses. They  have digital telephones and closed-circuit television installed  in addition to a central water supply and their children are  entitled to free nine-year compulsory education. It is a  billion-yuan village and is famous far and wide. However, in  this very same billion-yuan village, there are only four cars,  all public owned and used exclusively to receive or send off  experts and professors or other guests invited to the village.  When village-run factory directors are on an errand, they take  the bus to Anyang and then take a train. When they were out of  town on errands, almost every one would take pancakes and  noodles for meals, and book the cheapest hotel rooms which  charge under 20 yuan.    Dingjiao Village ranks sixth in Henan's economic  construction  at village level and is one of Linzhou's richest villages.  Here, when young people get married, the popular way of  celebration is "eating from the same big pot." On a wedding  day, one huge pot is used to prepare steamed rolls and rice,  with another huge pot used to cook vermicelli, meat, bean curd,  and vegetables. Together with the guests, mostly neighbors, the  bridegroom and bride of the day will be given a bowl of rice or  steamed rolls along with a bowl of the hotchpotch, it is simple  but lively and exciting. Li Chunsheng, the village party  branch deputy secretary said: "It isn't that we cannot afford  it but we just do not go in for ostentation and extravagance.  It is not our way. Now that we are well-off, we have not  become extravagant in our weddings or funerals."    Linzhou people who take the long-term view, think not only  of  themselves but of others since they became well-off. Their  focus of attention is placed not only on the present but more on  the future. Regarding some social welfare undertakings and  matters involving long-range interests, people in the hometown  of the Red Flag Canal have always shown an easy generosity.    In Linzhou, there are far too many examples of ordinary  people and incidents of donating funds or making investment in  running educational undertakings. Perhaps the statement by Li  Guangyuan, Dingjiao Village CPC Committee branch secretary  summarizes the idea they share: "Should we farmers, who cannot  possibly clear all the mud from ourselves, want to become rich  and be so forever, we must rely on talented people."    Elderly Song Qisheng of Chengguan Town's Beiguan village,  donated the bulk of his 300,000-yuan lifetime savings, as his  old age actually approached, to build a three-story school  building with a floor space of 1,400 square m, which he  personally designed and oversaw its construction. He left it to  the small mountain village which had nurtured him before he  passed away. This "Qisheng School Building" now has some 650  county children in 10 classes.    At Linzhou City Educational Commission, this reporter  learned  that, by the end of 1993, the city had collected 220 million  yuan in educational funds, of which 150 million yuan came from  voluntary donations from society and the masses; 718 persons  made donations ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 yuan, 82 persons  donated over 10,000 yuan, and the highest donation was 490,000  yuan.    Covering the various villages in Linzhou, this reporter  found  that the best buildings were the schools. According to a  briefing, some 440 brand-new schools have built here;  consequently, entrance examinations for high school enrollment  were abolished. The school building in Hejian Town's  Beixiaozhuang enjoys a reputation as "the Presidential House"  because of its most up to date design. Some 96 pupils from  Linzhou First Primary School were awarded with national prizes  in the "National Olympic in Mathematics for Primary School  Pupils." Su Qishu told this reporter: "Presently our city is  building a school for the deaf and dumb, so that the handicapped  can receive a regular education. Although the city finances are  not sufficiently ample, the city would rather be thrifty in  other areas than spare money on education; we want to use the  best steel to make the knife's edge."    Writing a New Chapter on Common Prosperity    In front of the Dingjiao Industrial General Company's office  building in Dingjiao village, Yaochun Town, Linzhou City stands  a quasi-bronze statue of an ox willingly serving the masses; it  is bending its back as it forges ahead and is a magnificent  piece. Li Guangyuan, Dingjiao Village general party branch  secretary, concurrently Dingjiao Industrial Group General  Company manager said: "There is some foundation to our economic  development but we must continue to work hard. We communists  just follow the example of the ox in guiding the masses to  advance toward common prosperity.    Because a number of such willing and had-working people have  persisted in a correct orientation, Linzhou is taking a broad  avenue toward common prosperity in building a new order for the  socialist market economy today. In the vanguard marching along  this avenue, communists have composed a symphony about working  hard with perseverance, always being ready to devote themselves,  and cherishing and working for the people through their actions.    Shibanyan used to be the remotest and most backward  township,  located at the highest altitude above sea level in Linzhou. A  folk song has it: "Rocks on the road are as large as oxen;  mountain floods have left gullies everywhere; people worry while  riding bicycles or traveling on foot; and the most dreadful  thing is the meeting of two cars going in opposite directions."  Because of its natural conditions, when 10,000-yuan households,  billion-yuan villages, and star towns surfaced among people in  other localities down the mountain, the masses here could only  just manage to have sufficient food and clothing.    Yhe Linzhou party organization did not put Shibanyan  Township  out of its mind. In 1992, the city party committee organized an  effective leading body for the township; again, in 1993, the  township was opened up as the city's special experimental zone  for economic development, while allowing it various preferential  policies and giving the green light to Shibanyan's economic  development. When this reporter arrived in the township on a  rainy day, he saw the roads here had been widened, with electric  wires and telephone lines installed; enterprises in townships  and towns along with the tourist industry were on the rise; 16  enterprises from Hong Kong, Zhengzhou, and Anyang came to this  "most exciting place" and to date 15 million yuan in investment  funds have been received. Today, Shibanyan is gradually being  reinvigorated in its takeoff.    In Linzhou's villages, which have became prosperous one  after  another, the communists there always have the masses and  collectives in mind and they are doing their best to fulfill  their communist duties, portraying a new generation of Linzhou  heroes.    Wang Fasui, Shijiahe village party branch general secretary,  concurrently general manager of Shijiahe Enterprise Group  General Company, together th his partners was entitled to  receive a percentage of the profits of 1.27 million yuan when  the first round of contracted projects was completed. Should  they keep the money to themselves or invest it as a collective  accumulation in reproduction? Wang said: "It would be telling  a lie to say that the huge sum did not move us. However, we  communists should have loftier ideals. The enterprises in the  village have only just started and we communists should not  think only of our own personal gain. The more important point  is to lead the masses to work hard to make progress and realize  common prosperity." In the end, Wang Fasui convinced his  partners and resolutely donated the whole sum to the village.    In his briefing, Di Jianzhou, Yaochun Township party  committee secretary said that Li Jingyuan, a party member from  Lijiagang Village started building a casting workshop after his  demobilization from active service and was capable of making a  profit of 100,000 yuan each year. In 1991, the villagers  unanimously elected him village party branch secretary, with an  annual wage of only 6,000 yuan. Put to the test of money and  interest, Li Jingyuan said: "Despite the fact that I personally  have become well-off, the villagers have not. The masses have  faith in us communists. Under such circumstances, we must guide  the masses to eradicate poverty and forge ahead to become  comparatively well-off." Today, 80 percent of peasants in  Lijiagang are living in two-story houses, every villager is  exempted from various charges, and Lijiagang has become the  third "wealthy household" among the town's some 50  administrative villages.    It is precisely because there are hundreds of fine elements  like Wang Fasui and Li Jingyuan that Linzhou, the brilliant star  of building the material and spiritual civilizations, has risen  over the Central China Plain. The responsible persons from the  province's 17 prefectures and cities, county party committee  secretaries from its 118 counties, and 2,500 party branch  secretaries from impoverished villages have all visited Linzhou.  Since the second half of 1993, they have arrived in Linzhou in  turn to be baptized by the Red Flag Canal spirit. The  reinvigoration of a city and an area is not all the Linzhou  people are after and it is their wish that everyone will become  well-off.    Mount Taihang has endowed Linzhou people with the boldness  of  vision and the courage to overcome difficulties and the Red Flag  Canal water has nurtured their pioneering spirit of working hard  with perseverance. Linzhou, the pearl of Taihang, will become  even more splendid in the future.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals help Unidare hold profit Unidare, the Irish maker of welding consumables and equipment, conductor cables and wire products, maintained its profit in 1991 with the help of exceptional credits. Pre-tax profit came to IPounds 5.09m, or Pounds 4.72m, compared with Pounds 5.07m previously. There were IPounds 231,000 credits, being surplus on sale of land less rationalisation costs. Turnover rose to IPounds 101.4m (IPounds 99.7m) with the UK accounting for two thirds. The wire division suffered a significant setback; the welding side was hit by the slump in demand for capital equipment but buoyancy in construction of offshore oil production platforms and in pipe fabrication underpinned the performance of the division. Unidare Environmental, involved in electric space heating products, swung from losses to a small profit. Earnings per share were 28.33p (26.23p). The final dividend is 10.9p for a total of 15p (14.2p).</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Fujitsu Develops System for Parallel  Transmission of 20 Types of Data Via Six Optical Fiber Cables    Fujitsu Research Center, located in Kawasaki city and headed  by President Mikio Otsuki, has developed a device for parallel  transmission of 20 different kinds of data via six optical fiber  cables. Phase shifts (subtle differences in arrival times) occur  at the receiving terminal when multiple types of data are  transmitted via differing sets of optical fiber cables, but a  feature of the new device is that it automatically corrects such  conditions. Fujitsu claims the new device can be used on basic  transmission modules of large-scale computers and in animated  image transmission devices for multimedia systems.    The newly developed device converts 20 different types of  data from electrical to optial signals and transmits the data at  speeds of 156 megabits (1 megabit equals 1 million bits) per  second via optical fiber cable. Maximum capacity of the device  is the combined processing of large volumes of data at the rate  of 3.12 gigabits (1 giga equals 1 billion bits) per second.  Further, the receiving terminal can convert all signals to  electrical signals that are uniformly timed.    One optical fiber cable will be fed with clock signals  reflecting the timing for each piece of data and the remaining  five optical fiber cables will be used to transmit 20 types of  data including 19 different types of data and a standard signal  to be used for synchronization. Each optical fiber cable will be  used to transmit four types of data in the form of a packet  (data sorted into a fixed unit) and a standard signal will be  inserted between packets. All signals can be synchronized by  applying the standard signal at the receiving terminal.    Further, the system was set up so that optical signal lasers  were efficiently input into the optical fiber cables and a test  was performed which demonstrated the capability to transmit the  data for 400 meters without in-transmit amplification.  Reportedly, the system is capable of transmitting a distance of  one kilometer. Past methods using coaxial cables and electrical  signals resulted in disintegration of wave shapes and signal  erosion rendering transmission beyond 100 meters impossible.    Transmission speeds of 156 megabits per second equal  animated  image transmission capacities of broad-band integrated digital  transmission networks (B-ISDN). Fujitsu intends to commercialize  the new device for use in data transmission between large-scale  computers and image transmission systems for cable television  stations.</p>

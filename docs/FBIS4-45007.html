			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with `Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah by </F> Salah-al-Din al-Jarushi in Beirut; time not given--first two  paragraphs are AL-MAJALLAH introduction]    [Text] He was calm, and gave answers readily, giving you  the feeling from the first moment that his bulk is bigger than  Lebanon. He reminds you of the kind of man that scorns his own  life to mobilize others. The young men around him are bound to  him by emotional ties, and seize with a great deal of  admiration, awe, and unquestioning approval upon the words that  flow from him. Many political forces see him as an intelligent  and international figure, and a major variable on the Lebanese  scene.    He is `Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, a figure who  raises  many questions. We started our interview with him by talking  politics, and quickly moved on to political thought, which is  one perspective of the Arab Islamic movement. We tried to  provoke him, to differentiate between tactics and strategy,  between what is fixed and what is changeable. He concluded by  saying that the originator of a thought cannot abandon his  strategy. His point of view is respected, even though the  history of philosophy and politics offers innumerable examples  to the contrary.    [Al-Jarushi] Don't you think the outcome of the  Palestinian-Israeli talks, and the expected outcome of the  multiparty talks, will mean the end of an era, and move the  whole region into a new era necessitating a change in cultural  and political discourse, as well as in methods of action?    [Fadlallah] I imagine that in this region, as in any other  region, there are two lines, the official line and the popular  line. It is natural for action to occur at a distance from the  Arab world so as not to affect the political situation  seriously; thus we have this attempt to substitute the Middle  East address. Official political discourse did not wait for the  end of the negotiations to change. It started the process of  change, with some differences in vocabulary. The current  atmosphere is one of acceptance of Israel as a natural state in  the region. We may read in some Arab rhetoric that Israel is the  country whose friendship all or most people are seeking to  obtain, and this rhetoric will change even more with the policy  of the status quo.    And yet popular discourse is still experiencing many  complications in this regard. We do not see any Arab or Islamic  circumstances that accept Israel's existence in terms of  people's emotions, of any feeling of comfort or reassurance. I  believe that popular Arab reality, in its inner Islamic  vocabulary, still rejects peace with Israel. This is aside from  methods of political pressure being applied to them in this  regard.    For this reason, I imagine that the coming phase will not  have the capabilities enabling it to maintain the atmosphere of  peace. We must watch the future; Israel, which is trying to  penetrate the region economically, and the workings of security  to focus its existence regionally, is at the same time trying to  hamper economics and security with its anticipated intervention  in inter-Arab disputes. Perhaps what Egyptian reports have  revealed, about Israeli machinations behind some of the  explosions, are a sign of what I mentioned. For Israel, from  this aspect, has restored Arab rejection of the Jewish question  and the Israeli reality from within Arab reality, instead of  from outside it as used to be the case.    I do not think the new phase will be a stable one at the  popular level, and many names will disappear after the  American-planned "peace" to renew the region in line with the  new policy based on protecting Washington's interests and  providing an atmosphere of what they call freedom here and  there, which will bring convulsions here and there.  <H5>  Resistance and Options </H5>   [Al-Jarushi] If we apply your argument to the situation in  Lebanon, don't you think an Israeli-Syrian-Lebanese peace would  result in the de-clawing of Hizballah and put an end to any  military activity in the south? That would force everyone to  fall into line.    [Fadlallah] It is natural that the matter of peace--should  it  succeed--could create great complications for the resistance,  but we do not think it will eliminate it. I think the resistance  has other options, which we are not discussing. It would be  obvious to say that Lebanon's political situation after peace  will be different from what it is before peace. But Lebanon  remains the land of freedom in the region. It is the country  which I want to be, in the global balance, the lung through  which the region's problems breathe, reducing its congestion,  and for this reason it will retain the dissident political  discourse which international spy agencies will explore to find  the inclinations of the rejectionist movements. We always used  to say that the intellectual and political freedoms in Lebanon  were not for the benefit of the Lebanese themselves, but for the  benefit of the international spy agencies that are in the pay of  various proponents of the Arab and Islamic status quo on the  Lebanese scene.    [Al-Jarushi] Let's move on from politics to strategic  thinking. The Islamic movement began as a cultural,  civilizational undertaking, then turned into movements and  parties working to establish an Islamic state, then slipped into  defending closed parties and groups. Some of the action of these  groups ended in violence and counter-violence. Don't you feel,  for your part, that the the Islamic movement is experiencing a  severe crisis?    [Fadlallah] I don't want to address this topic with the  expression "a severe crisis in the Islamic movement." I want to  be objective in studying the reality of the Islamic movement,  without all the exaggerations of politics and the media.    The Islamic movement is basically, in the concept of  Islamists, the belief that Islam is the foundation of  philosophy, compassion, and life; that it represents a form of  governance, and people may debate this proposition. We can say  that Islam has lived as a question of governance for its entire  history up until the 20th century. If we were to discuss the  Abbasid, Umayyad, or Ottoman caliphates, the details of the  nature of government would be discussed in exactly the same way  as a democratic or a socialist government. What is certain is  that Islam, from the prophetic era up until the fall of the  Caliphate, never existed without a state. The state was,  basically, the historical depth of Islam. The Islamists are not  inventing something new when they bring up the idea of a state.  The acceptance of party organization is the modern means for  achieving a state from the political point of view, and in the  framework of the democratic game, without regard to their view  of democracy. Thus the thought is hardly an innovation to  people. The question "Why a state?" is not asked of Islamists.  We ask the others in charge of governance, "Why a state?" Why is  there a Marxist party, or a nationalist party? Why shouldn't  there be an acknowledged Islamic party?    The Islamists are working towards integration with political  reality; not all of them perhaps, but I know of more than one  Islamic movement trying to open up to political reality. But  there is a will to eliminate political Islam. We maintain that  Islamic violence is a reaction to other violence. If freedom  were given, no Muslim would so much as carry a stick to fight  anyone else. So try democracy in the Arab world, and you will  find the peace you seek. The Islamists are not leading a  terrorist movement, but a defensive one. Whoever calls for  regimes to enter into dialogue with the Islamists and others  with an open mind and open heart will find only acceptance on  the part of the Islamists.    We are not comfortable with the shocks our Muslim lands are  experiencing. It is in no one's interest, no one's but that of  international spy agencies. All there is to it is that things  have not been handled correctly; fix that, and you will see that  reason will prevail.  <H5>  A Heap of Errors </H5>   [Al-Jarushi] Don't you feel that in your rhetoric there is a  whitewashing of the Islamic movements, as if they weren't  experiencing fundamental problems? Take Algeria for example. The  present regime wants to open a dialogue, but the Islamists are  setting unfair conditions for accepting the principle of  dialogue.    [Fadlallah] I am not absolving the Islamic movement of  errors. I am one of those who has gone on the record, in a loud  voice, with more than one remark and question mark, in many  places of the Islamic movement, including Lebanon and Iran. But  I was speaking of the public line. I know there are some small  movements that think violence shortens the whole movement to  attain its goals. We do not think violence is the basis, but I  allege that there is a blockade of the Islamic movement.    You mentioned Algeria. I have no detailed information on the  position of the new government, but we know the Islamists there  embraced the democratic experiment and won, and there was no  fraud. They question is, why were the elections nullified? Why  was the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] banned? This means there  is a will to nullify the will of the Algerian people, or, more  precisely, a majority of it.    As to dialogue, it is the right of the Islamists, who have  been stabbed in the back more than once, to take action to  protect themselves and to get the details about the nature of  this dialogue--is it merely a formal token, or a serious  dialogue? Will it create a problem in FIS's ranks? I do not have  precise information about the nature of the offer they were  made, or their reasons for turning it down, particularly because  at the time the offer was made, the government's iron fist  policy clearly grew more severe.    I am not one of those who absolves the Islamic movement of  errors. They are living in a heap of errors, but they are not  the only ones making mistakes. We must study the circumstances  of these errors. Are they voluntary, or the result of objective  circumstances?  <H5>  For Dialogue in Algeria </H5>   [Al-Jarushi] With the importance of the details, there is a  general line that, yes, the elections were annulled in Algeria,  and it is an unacceptable position, but is the response to that  to spark a civil war, kidnap and kill foreigners, and  assassinate intellectuals and journalists?    [Fadlallah] Actually, I have reservations about much of the  information provided these days. The official information is not  unbiased. Nor do I imagine that it was the Islamists who started  the violence. When the war machine went into action--and we have  experienced the same thing in Lebanon--it went crazy. We  absolutely cannot condone any group of intellectuals being  confronted, even should we disagree with them, especially media  people, artists, or whomever.    But the question is that you, as an intellectual or media  person or artist, might some way or another enter into this  whirlpool unintentionally. We know that some names, such as  Kasdi Merbah, and others, have come up, and there are other  voices accusing the regime of assassinating them. That may not  be an accurate judgement, but when you feel there is a plan to  distort the enemy, you become more careful.    We are for dialogue in Algeria, and in every other country,  but it is only natural for any side to think about the basis  upon which that dialogue would rest. It is your right to know  how to enter the field, to ensure for yourself the solidity of  the ground on which you are standing.    [Al-Jarushi] Excuse me, with your keenness for objectivity,  but I have begun to fear justifying rhetoric which could open  dangerous dead-ends to youth. The issue of violence in Algeria  goes beyond the limited individual problem. It has become a  process destructive to Algerian society.    [Fadlallah] We do sense that. I am not in a position to  justify young men running off in that direction, but I have the  occasion for objective study that attempts to judge one aspect,  through the biased media. This is why I have raised questions,  but not made judgements.    I recommend the study of the Algeria problem, because it  will  not stay confined to Algeria. There are problems on the way for  more than one country in the region. What is needed is to create  a condition of convulsion that can foil many global ambitions.  My understanding of the issue in Algeria, apart from the persons  who are taking action there, leads me to believe that this  country is experiencing a French-American struggle. What the  Americans want is to eliminate French influence from Arab and  non-Arab Africa. And so, if you want to get to the bottom of the  problem in Algeria, don't think of FIS or Ait Ahmed or Ben Bella  or Nahnah, or even the Algerian regime itself, think of global  interests, and the American-French struggle on Algerian soil.  This matter may not seem as clear as possible at the present  time, but the near future will disclose the outcome of this  process.    I am speaking in the context of our experience in Lebanon,  which is still taking its course as part of an American plan to  expel the Palestinians politically, economically, and  culturally. The terms of the Lebanon question are still in this  area.    The present plan is to create a state of madness in most of  the countries of the Third World, so that the madness will act  to destroy all values, and the people will lose their  self-confidence. This was the case in Liberia and Zaire, and it  happened in Lebanon, and now it is happening in Algeria. God  help other countries.    Algeria's problem is that it has oil, even if it is not that  much; the thing is to extend their control over all the world's  oil, so that America can prevent Europe and Japan from waging  economic war on the American economy.  <H5>  Circumstances Are Responsible </H5>   [Al-Jarushi] I want to go back to the issue of a state,  because I see it as the major difficulty at this time. Now,  after the Iranian experiment, which had great luster at the  outset, then turned rather ordinary, then the Sudanese  experiment, we are now experiencing the tragedy of Afghanistan.  Don't you think the expression "the Islamic state," without a  profound theory behind it, has become a virtual trap for  Islamists?    [Fadlallah] We must understand the facts, which are that  when  we think of an Islamic state, or a national or democratic state,  that does not mean it will come into being with a magic wand. A  firm infrastructure is needed. We note, for example, that Iran,  when setting out to build an Islamic state, had to contend with  a crazy war for eight years that damaged the whole economic  infrastructure. The result was that Iran emerged from the war  without any economic power, which made the state take action to  rebuild instead of speaking of details of a media plan. I do not  think Iran is unique in that regard.    We know that democratic countries are unable to find a  solution to the economic problem--does that mean democracy is a  mistake, or that circumstances did not help the enterprise to  succeed? Then we come to Sudan, whose experiment is still  fragile, and is still undergoing an insane and destructive war  it inherited from all the regimes that preceded it. Thus we do  not consider the Iranian and Sudanese experiences to be the  Islamic ideal, nor do we think the extent of their experiences  represents the extent attainable by any country--even a  non-Muslim country--by focusing their plans on their  circumstances. Judging them would be wrong and unfair. I say  there is no objective study of the Iranian experiment. In  comparison, have other countries in the Arab world succeeded in  economic development?    [Al-Jarushi] They have not succeeded, and thus there has  been  a great deal of talk for years about the failure of the regional  or national state.    [Fadlallah] We are not saying that the state has failed,  because there are domestic and foreign circumstances that have  forbidden or prevented the achievement of their goals. The line  has not failed, but circumstances have been an impediment. We  live in a complex world, from the economic, political, and  security standpoints--any movement, including democracy, has a  hard time succeeding.  <H5>  Tactical Retreat </H5>   [Al-Jarushi] The communists maintained their links to Moscow  for more than 60 years, and they are looking for excuses for  socialist experiments. They did not exert the effort necessary  to criticize these experiments or work on their evolution until  the structure collapsed and the whole thing came apart.    [Fadlallah] We work daily to criticize the Islamic  experiment, and loudly. Islamists are not like communists,  because they have no cult of personality. Plus, I believe that  the government the Soviet Union had was neither communist nor  socialist.    [Al-Jarushi] What are some of your criticisms of the Iranian  experiment?    [Fadlallah] I don't recall that many, but I have criticisms  related to political lines, and I have debated some of the  slogans they use domestically.    [Al-Jarushi] If we take the political areas, we notice that  the connection of the three experiments we have discussed  previously to individual and collective freedoms, and basic  human rights, stirs up many reservations and fears.    [Fadlallah] I imagine human rights in Iran are more advanced  than in most countries of the Arab world and the Third World  (?!). When you criticize Iran now you must begin with its  newspapers. Iranian newspapers now criticize all the power  bases, and the Friday preachers, who are supported by the  government, criticize the government in their sermons.    There are freedoms, but there is no room for a communist  party, because they consider it to be a party that contradicts  the basis of the state. Even so, I say that there is political  and media freedom not exercised by individuals in an absolute  fashion. There might be defects, and the security agency may  engage in--as it is in all countries of the world--some wrongful  practices, but human rights are not as bad as the Western media  say.    [Al-Jarushi] Your call for a humanitarian state before an  Islamic state--does it apply only to Lebanon?    [Fadlallah] This is no abandonment of the Islamic state, but  I said if it is not possible to establish an Islamic state in  Lebanon--and I believe that in the foreseeable future there is  no likelihood of establishing an Islamic state, because of  sectarian and international complications--we must establish a  humanitarian state for each of us to promote his ideas in a wide  arena undivided by sectarian boundaries. This is not an  abandonment of the idea; it is a movement to create an  atmosphere in which ideas may flourish, without psychological  and political complications.    [Al-Jarushi] Is it a tactical or strategic retreat?    [Fadlallah] It may be said that it is a tactical retreat.  The  originator of a thought cannot abandon his strategy.</p>

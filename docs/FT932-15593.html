			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: UK Safety Group reverses into Television South West UK SAFETY Group, the Bristol-based specialist shoe maker, is gaining a stock market listing via a Pounds 9.5m reverse takeover deal with Television South West, the former ITV franchise holder. TSW's name will be changed to UK Safety, which was formed by a 1988 manage-ment buy-out of the foot-wear business of the Ward White Group. Of the Pounds 9.5m acquisition price, Pounds 7.4m will be funded by a share exchange involving 14.3m TSW shares at 51.7p apiece. A Pounds 2.1m dividend will be paid to one of two Schroder buy-out funds, which currently hold 96 per cent of UK Safety. TSW is also raising about Pounds 1.5m via a 1-for-6 rights issue at 47p. Irrevocable undertakings to accept the offers had been obtained from sufficient numbers of UK Safety shareholders to ensure the acquisition, the company said. Schroders will hold about 38 per cent of the enlarged group and has promised not to sell the shares for a year. In 1992 UK Safety made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m on turnover of Pounds 33.7m. It has about 26 per cent of the UK's Pounds 77m leather safety footwear market. TSW's results for 1992 showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.2m, against Pounds 1.95m for the previous 17 months. Turnover amounted to Pounds 40.4m (Pounds 59.5m). An Pounds 4.8m extraordinary charge related to a reassessment of property assets and the discontinuation of its pension fund. Net assets per share stood at 50.8p. A proposed final dividend of 3p gives a total for the year of 5p (7p), payable from earnings per share of 28.4p (5p). Shares in TSW were suspended in January at 29p.</p>

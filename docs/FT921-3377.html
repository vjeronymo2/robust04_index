			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Wheels within wheels - Company cars Chancellor Norman Lamont's 1992 Budget Special has knocked flying many of the cones which have marked out the structure of the UK car market for more than a decade. Car owners and operators, both business and private most of us - - now face an unfamiliar landscape. Some companies may be considering whether to continue providing cars for their employees. Lamont began by cutting the 19-year-old special car tax to 5 per cent from 10; raising the excise duty on unleaded petrol and diesel fuel by the rate of inflation (about 4.5 per cent) and that on 'dirtier' leaded fuel by 7.5 per cent; and increasing the road fund licence fee from Pounds 100 to Pounds 110. So far, so good - not least for the motor industry, which had long complained that car tax was responsible in part for sales having plunged to an annual rate of 1.6m compared with a record 2.3m in 1989. The cut does not mean a straightforward 5 per cent reduction on pre-Budget prices, however, because it is computed on the pre-tax price less the discount allowed to the dealer. It nets out at just over 4 per cent, or about Pounds 400 off a small family saloon; Pounds 1,100 off a Pounds 27,000 executive car; and more than Pounds 3,000 off a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit (for the dwindling band still able to afford the other Pounds 96,000). Ford, which has seen its long market leadership threatened byVauxhall, quickly fired the first shot in what might well intensify the price war raging already between manufacturers. It cut up to Pounds 750 off some of its smaller models, on top of the SCT reduction. A l1-litre, three-door Fiesta plunged to Pounds 6,230 from Pounds 7,250. But it was Lamont's less headline-grabbing changes which are likely to prove at least as significant as the SCT cut; not least his pledge that companies which offer employees a cash alternative to a car will not wind up paying VAT - as Customs and Excise has insisted previously - on salary foregone by those who choose to keep their cars. This is of great importance because a company running 500 cars, but offering employees Pounds 3,000 cash instead, risked landing itself with a VAT bill for nearly Pounds 250,000 if only one employee opted for the cash. It is the overwhelming reason why companies have been frightened away from pursuing cars-for-cash schemes, even though many have begun investigating them because of last year's imposition - for the first time - of National Insurance charges on company cars and higher VAT (which, uniquely among business goods, cannot be reclaimed on car purchases). Lamont's banishment of the VAT bogy could yet produce large-scale desertions from the company car. This may depend on the consultative document - to be published this summer - on revisions to the car scale tax charges. We know that the intent is to scrap engine size bands, and the major price thresholds at Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000 above which individual tax charges rise sharply, in favour of a more progressive scale linked to vehicle price. Stewart Whyte, a senior official of the Association of Car Fleet Operators suggests, however, that companies should not now rush headlong into schemes that might have their ground rules changed within the next six months. 'When you won't know one side of the equation for probably another six months, it is clearly ridiculous for a company to jump into any new cash-or-car schemes now,' he says.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NEW CARS - HOW MUCH CHEAPER AFTER THE BUDGET  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Pre-Budget      Post-Budget      Saving                                (Pounds)         (Pounds)      (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rover Metro 1.1c 5-door           7,265           6,997           268 Peugeot 405 1.9 GR               12,400          11,293           477 Rover 216 GTI 5-door             15,775          15,188           587 Ford Scorpio 2.9 24V             28,370          27,278         1,092 Mercedes 400 SEL                 55,450          53,320         2,130 Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit II     99,990          96,144         3,845  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Arising from reduction of special car tax to 5 per cent from 10 per cent and consequent reduction in VAT.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified staff commentator: "Learn Suzhou's </F> Experience"]    [Text] Suzhou has gained a lot of good experiences in  building material and spiritual civilizations. A report in this  newspaper today on Suzhou's good public security is one of those  experiences -- one that is worth pondering by purposeful people.    Public security is a widely discussed issue -- an issue that  the masses are concerned about and the party and government have  attached importance to. Many localities have taken  comprehensive measures to manage public security and have  achieved noticeable results. But, situations in other  localities have not been very good -- leaders in these  localities still lack a sense of urgency, have not addressed  themselves to improving local public security, have not been  persistent in doing the work, or have not considered the work to  be important. Two kinds of one-sidedness in perceiving the  issue are at work:    "Poor public security is due to a backward economy. Public  security will automatically improve once the economy is  developed." People with this kind of thinking do not do things  with both hands -- they use one hand while the other is idle.    "Reform and opening up has invited an invasion by foreign  cultures and many people have led a decayed life-style,  therefore, social ills are inevitable. The profit-oriented  market economic system has aroused people's greed, so committing  offenses is beyond prevention." The conclusion from this theory  is that nothing can be done about the problem. Hence, these  people can never be taught to use the other hand.    The Suzhou experience has emerged at the right time. Based  on the facts, it is convincing criticism against the two  aforementioned erroneous views. Maybe a backward economy truly  has adverse effects on improving public security, but the theory  that once the economy is developed public security will  automatically improve is completely absurd. Good public  security requires good management. Without good management, how  can one expect good public security? Poor public security means  a poor investment climate. With a poor investment climate, how  can we expect the economy to develop in a sustained, rapid, and  healthy manner? If Suzhou followed this line, it would not be  the "paradise" that it is today. It would have been a paradise  for lawless elements.    The second view is half correct, but the conclusion is  completely wrong. I say it is half correct because it does  touch on the new developments and problems in current public  security work, which are much more complicated and difficult  than before. But, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said as early as  five years ago: "Reform and opening up will inevitably bring in  some bad influences from the West -- we have never  underestimated this." It is just for this reason that we need  to particularly emphasize the need to grip tightly with two  hands -- not any other way.    Of course, we need a correct way to be tough -- that is, we  need to take measures aimed at specific problems, think of new  ways to deal with problems, set new standards, and develop new  mechanisms. Suzhou has gained experience in these matters, which  is worth studying by other localities. As long as leaders at  all levels have a good understanding of their political  responsibility, straighten out their ideological thinking, and  enlist the help of the broad masses, they will be completely  able to ensure good public security and maintain social peace by  taking comprehensive management measures.</p>

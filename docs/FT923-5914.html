			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: ABB profits decline 7% in opening six months ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss power engineering group, said consolidated pre-tax profit in the first half fell 7 per cent to Dollars 496m but forecast that the pre-tax result for the year would reach 'about last year's level' of Dollars 1.05bn. 'To date, ABB has not experienced any upturn in demand in the recessionary markets and no improvement in demand is expected in the second half of this year in the industrialised countries,' the group said. However, ABB has continued to take in large orders at a rapid pace, notably from developing countries for power generation plants. In the first half, the value of new orders totalled Dollars 17.1bn, 18 per cent higher than in the first half of last year and bringing the group's order backlog at June 30 to Dollars 30.3bn. However, total revenues grew only 2 per cent to Dollars 13.8bn as the demand for standard products for industry and construction as well as capital goods stagnated or turned weaker. Revenues from western European countries were flat at Dollars 8.1bn and down 13 per cent in North America to Dollars 2.3bn. Earnings from the power plant division rose while those from environmental control products and systems declined. The group said earnings from the other business segments changed only slightly, indicating that margins had been preserved. In North America, gains from restructuring were more than offset by lower sales volumes and prices. Earnings were down in the Nordic region. Earnings in Germany, Italy, Switzerland and most Asian countries improved. BBC Brown Boveri, the Swiss group which holds 50 per cent of ABB, said its consolidated pre-tax profit for the half-year after deduction of third party interests was SFr344m (Dollars 277.4m), 7.5 per cent lower than in the comparative period. Revenues were up 5.7 per cent to SFr19.9bn. The board is proposing to split the bearer and registered shares five for one and to convert the participation certificates into bearer shares. The latter will dilute present shareholders' voting power.</p>

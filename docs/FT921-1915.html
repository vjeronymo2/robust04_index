			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Food: Menus for creditors - Restaurant view WHY, IN THE middle of the recession, are so many new restaurants opening their doors? What do such varied names as Christopher's, Snows on the Green, Les Saveurs, The Red River Cafe, Pied a Terre and L'Accento have in common? On the surface very little - except that they are all restaurants which have opened recently in London (along with a number of others) in what is considered to be the worst recession for many years. Is this because restaurants defy the laws of economics and survive in spite of monthly drops in consumer confidence and spending? Sadly not. Most restaurateurs, even those in the first flush of enthusiasm, quietly admit that business could be much better. But when these restaurants were planned business was a lot better. Even the smallest restaurants require a great deal of time to materialise, and in the 1980s raising the finance for a new restaurant was the easiest part of the package. Finding the site, getting provisional approval for the licence, tendering for builders and waiting for them to finish and the Environmental Health Officer to give approval can take 18 months and breach the overdraft limit. As soon as you approach this limit, opening day becomes even more urgent. Because it is the most immediate answer to a new restaurant's cash problems it is often not the restaurateur who decides when to open, but the bank or other investors. This year, the high interest rates of the past 18 months will have forced many to open in the traditionally quiet first quarter rather than wait until spring. Although these businesses are all restaurants they hide a wide variety of ambitions and financial backers. Snows on the Green is the first restaurant of a husband and wife team; Christopher's is a personal mission undertaken by its proprietor, Christopher Gilmour, and a few friends, to bring good US food to London. L'Accento is the type of good, very reasonably priced Italian trattoria every neighbourhood should have; Les Saveurs, the most lavish expression of French haute cuisine London has seen in a long time - but one that has been entirely funded by a Japanese millionaire. The Red River Cafe and Pied a Terre have risen on the sites of former, failed restaurants, of which there have been many in the last year. The restaurants which are opening at the moment are, however, the last expression of the relatively easy borrowing requirements of the late 1980s. Banks are much less friendly to those eager to open their own restaurant. The consequences will be felt, if not this year, then in 1993. The two chefs who in 1991 passed their industry's highest exams, and qualified as Meilleurs Ouvriers de Grand Bretagne, are not opening their own restaurants but, instead, are cooking in the more financially secure environment of a big hotel. Stephen Doherty is head chef at the Grand Hotel in Amsterdam, due to open in April, and Roget Narbett has just become senior sous-chef at the Dorchester in London. There are two big restaurants currently being planned for London - the rebirth of Quaglino's, and a new restaurant at the top of Harvey Nichols - but they will be the creation of either wealthy individuals or big corporations. Restaurants used to be a relatively low-cost world to enter, particularly for a husband and wife. Rising rents and rates have increased the break-even point; customers' raised expectations have increased the capital required. Now, falling returns have frightened off potential investors, and for the moment the glamour has gone. Those who enjoy the thrill of a new restaurant should make the most of those which have opened so far this year.</p>

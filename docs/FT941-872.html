			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Appleyard buys five Lex dealerships Appleyard Group, the North Yorkshire-based motor dealer, is acquiring five dealerships from Lex Service for Pounds 7.5m, their net asset value, writes Rebecca Rea. The amount will be satisfied by the issue of 4.75m shares, representing 7.2 per cent of the enlarged capital. In the 12 months to December 26, they incurred combined operating losses of Pounds 200,000 on turnover of Pounds 40.9m. This is the second time in less than a week that Appleyard has bought barely profitable dealerships. On Tuesday it acquired five outlets from Whitworths Holdings for Pounds 10.2m. Mr John Atkin, group business development director, said: 'We are seeking businesses south of the M62 to become more national. We have been very successful with our present dealerships and we hope to repeat the success with these new acquisitions.' Quicks Group, the car dealer, is selling its Birmingham Vauxhall dealership to Barnard (Selly Oak) for Pounds 1.08m cash. The book value of the assets was Pounds 1.13m at March 1. In the year to December 31 the business reported a loss of Pounds 200,000.</p>

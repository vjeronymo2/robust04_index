			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Proton prepares for big sales boost PROTON CARS (UK) the importer of Malaysia's national car, has acquired a 30-acre import centre and distribution headquarters at Bristol with the capacity to handle 45,000 cars a year - nearly three times its current sales volume. According to Mr Peter King, managing director of the UK company - which is based near Birmingham - it expects to be using all this capacity before the end of the 1990s as a result of production increases and a much wider range of models from the Malaysian manufacturer. It is also seeking to recruit a further 25 dealers to bring the UK total to 250, up from fewer than 160 at the time of the car's UK launch less than three years ago. Mr King said yesterday negotiations had started on the possible launch of the cars in continental European markets within two to three years. The UK is the only European outlet for the cars - Malaysia is also a right-hand-drive market. Proton, in which Malaysia's state industrial holding company has a majority stake, plans to lift production from 120,000 last year to 250,000 by the mid-1990s, including the capability to build left-hand drive vehicles and a greater variety of models. Proton Cars (UK) is 60 per cent owned by Mr David Brown, the north-west of England motor trade entrepreneur, 30 per cent by the Inchcape Group, 6 per cent by Mr King and 4 per cent by Mr John Miller, finance director. Launched 3 1/2 years ago, Proton is one of the UK's fastest growing new-car franchises. Sales rose from 6,555 in 1989 to 14,026 last year, with a projected 15,750 this year. Mr King forecast yesterday that Proton's sales would rise to 17,550 next year even though the market would remain unchanged from this year's heavily-depressed 1.6m.</p>

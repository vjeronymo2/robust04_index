			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RHR: "Bulgaria and Partnership for </F> Peace: Financial Problems"; as released by Brussels BELGA  Database]    [Text] Brussels, 11 Mar (BELGA) -- Bulgaria, which signed  the Partnership for Peace [PFP] last month, may lack the  resources to fully participate in the joint activities planned  with NATO due to financial problems, reports the Bulgarian Army  chief of staff.    General Lyuben Petrov ended a five-day visit to Belgium on  Friday [11 March], during which he noted the similarities  between army reforms in Belgium and Bulgaria, he told BELGA on  Thursday. His talks with his Belgian counterpart, Lieutenant  General Jose Charlier, focused in particular on the Partnership  for Peace proposal made by NATO to its former enemies in East  Europe.    General Petrov believes that the lack of financial resources  could, however, prevent his country from being a "major partner"  in multilateral cooperation activities with NATO. Bulgarian  President Zhelyu Zhelev came to Brussels on 14 February to sign  the Partnership for Peace document proposed by the Atlantic  alliance to former Warsaw Pact countries.    "We may not be greatly involved," said General Petrov on  Thursday, in reply to a question which raised the fact that most  of the costs of the Partnership will be borne by East European  countries.    He believes the Bulgarian Army welcomes this proposal which  includes possible joint participation in peacekeeping  activities. He pointed out that for the first time Sofia had  sent a contingent of blue helmets to Cambodia. But they  encountered "difficulties" when they arrived due to their lack  of preparation.    The Bulgarian chief of staff believes each participating  country is free to choose the Partnership activities. "We are  in the process of preparing a national program, which the  government and Parliament must then approve," he stated.    He is also pleased with the quality of the bilateral  military  cooperation which has existed between Belgium and Bulgaria over  the last two years, "the best" of any Western countries which  maintain military contacts with Sofia, and which has produced  "substantial exchange programs," in the words of General  Charlier.    The Belgian chief of staff observed that the first joint  military exercises planned by the Partnership would probably not  be able to start immediately. "We must first set up the  necessary structures, receive the political directives, and draw  up procedures," he stated.    During his visit to Belgium, General Petrov met with Belgian  Defense Minister Leo Delcroix. He also visited SHAPE [Supreme  Headquarters Allied Powers Europe], the Florennes air base, the  7th Armored Infantry Brigade at Marche-en-Famenne and the  National Geographical Institute.</p>

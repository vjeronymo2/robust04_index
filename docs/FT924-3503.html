			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Burning the house Jacques built: UK plans to torch 71 pieces of EC law at the altar of subsidiarity THE British government wants to throw 71 pieces of EC legislation on the bonfire at the Edinburgh summit this week, to put national governments firmly in control of Europe. As details leaked out of the scale of UK plans to roll back Community power, the European Commission was preparing a pre-emptive strike with its own more modest list of 24 EC proposals to be burnt at the altar of 'subsidiarity'. At the Birmingham summit in October, EC leaders pledged to bring the Community 'closer to the people', and at Edinburgh they hope to agree on a division of EC power in line with subsidiarity - the notion that decisions should be taken at European level only when national or local action would be ineffectual. The UK has chosen consumer, social, and environment policy as its targets. Of the items it wants scrapped, amended or withdrawn, 21 are EC measures to protect consumers, 18 are in social policy - mainly proposals to strengthen workers' rights - and 27 laws or proposals to raise 'green' standards against pollution. What is more surprising, Britain is also advocating loosening the EC's grip on competition policy. British officials insist that the 'hit-list' is not from the current UK presidency of the EC, but was drawn up by individual British ministries. It has already been sent to the Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors. Some Commission officials have reacted angrily, while others are confident the UK list will be heavily pruned - not least because it cuts across the aims of Britain's main allies on subsidiarity, Germany and Denmark, on social and environment policy. The inclusion in the UK hit-list of plans the Commission has not yet adopted  -and in at least one case not even discussed - will further fuel the suspicion of the smaller and poorer member states that it is trying to lead a big-country power grab by diluting the Commission's sole right to propose EC legislation. The smaller states see the Commission as guarantor of their stake in the Community. Of 37 EC laws already on national statute books, the UK wants to repeal 22 directives, including ones on the quality of shellfish and freshwater-fish water and eight on food quality. It wants to amend 15 existing laws, including ones on wildlife habitats, hazardous waste, and bathing, drinking and ground water, as being too prescriptive and expensive. 'More discretion should be left to member states on achieving standards' approved unanimously in the 1970s and 1980s, the document says on water. Britain wants 18 Commission proposals - largely on social policy - withdrawn altogether. These include plans for Europe-wide works councils, obliging companies with more than 1,000 employees in more than one member state to inform workers of job cuts, new working practices and technology. Draft directives on part-time work, the employment of young people, and working time would all be scrapped, as would a directive on the liability of suppliers of trans-border services. There is 'no evidence . . . that consumers are discouraged from buying services across frontiers by different liability regimes,' the UK document argues. A plan by the Commission to diminish packaging waste would be amended as 'too restrictive' in its environmental objectives. Under the heading of proposals 'not yet adopted by the Commission which should proceed no further', the UK says extending machinery safety provisions to second-hand machines is 'disproportionate'; queries the legality of extending equal treatment between men and women to social security areas such as pensionable age; and argues that plans to make environment impact assessment obligatory in policy as well as individual projects is constitu- tionally unacceptable. 'How to take account of environmental (or any) considerations in policy-making must be up to national governments,' the UK insists. Plans the UK thinks Brussels should reconsider include requests by member states to harmonise road safety and speed limits, price transparency and disabled people's access to public transport, and a 'communication on social exclusion' that the Commission has not even discussed at senior official level. Mr Delors' riposte, which the Commission will discuss tomorrow, is a careful mix of bread and circus. Trivia, such as the harmonisation of shoe-labelling and changeovers to summer-time, or the time-share directive the UK asked for to protect investors in holiday homes, would be torched. But in 'green' and social policy Brussels plans to offer up only the zoos directive and subcontracting rules. Meatier sacrifices include rules defining a Community ship-owner, and changes in the plans for liability of suppliers of services and the mobility of the disabled. The Commission is astutely proposing to withdraw two advertising directives - the regulating of pejorative comparison with other products and the banning of tobacco advertisements. The advertising plans incensed newspaper owners worried about revenue loss, and may have contributed to the avalanche of stories about 'Euro-lunacy', which the Commission's modest pyre is intended to reduce.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Polygram kicks into rap groove with RAL/Def Jam stake move Polygram, the London-based entertainment group, is expanding its US music interests by buying 50 per cent of RAL/Def Jam, the leading rap record label, for Dollars 33m. The acquisition of Def Jam - which numbers some the world's most successful rap acts on its roster including Warren G, Public Enemy and the Beastie Boys  -forms part of PolyGram's long-term strategy of increasing its music business in the US. The Def Jam deal follows last year's Dollars 325m acquisition of Motown Records, the famous soul label. PolyGram, which is also one of the world's largest classical music record companies as the owner of Deutsche Grammophon and Philips Classics, has been steadily expanding its US interests since its 1989 deals to buy the Island and A&amp;M record companies. Its expansion in the US has helped PolyGram, which also has extensive film interests and produced this year's runaway hit, Four Weddings and a Funeral, to sign up some of its successful European artists on a worldwide basis. The Def Jam investment will enable PolyGram to become a force in rap, which has in the early 1990s been one of the most dynamic areas of contemporary music. Rap started off in the mid-1980s as a cult phenomenon among young black Americans. In the early days it was dominated by small, independent record labels, including Def Jam which was founded in 1983 by Mr Russell Simmons in New York. Def Jam is now one of the most commercially successful rap labels and Mr Simmons is regarded as a role model for the new breed of young black entrepreneurs. PolyGram first forged links with Def Jam in June when its became the latter's US distributor and its licensee in other countries. PolyGram has traditionally pursued a policy with its music acquisitions of assuming responsibility for issues such as marketing and distribution, thereby leaving the original executives to concentrate on working with existing artists and nurturing new talent. Mr Simmons has signed a long term contract with PolyGram as has Mr Lyor Cohen, Def Jam's president and chief operating officer. Mr Cohen yesterday said: 'All we ever needed was a company to nurture us,' adding that with PolyGram 'finance, promotion, legal and distribution are covered and covered tight'.</p>

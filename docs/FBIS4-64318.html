			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz  charged that the country's problem is political, not economic,  and the solution should be a political one. In a statement  after meeting with ANAP mayors in Istanbul today, Yilmaz said  that the current difficulties in the country stem from a lack of  confidence in the government.    Asked to comment on Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's statement  that no one should engage in efforts to seek a new government,  Yilmaz said:    [Begin recording] It is natural that she should speak like  that, but everyone knows that we did not initiate the quest for  a new government. This quest comes from all sectors of society.  We only announced that we are ready to do our task on this  matter. Such a quest is an indication of a consensus that the  present government is not the solution to our problems. [end  recording]    Yilmaz declared that the search for a confidence-inspiring  and broad-based government will continue despite the prime  minister's appeal to the contrary. Even if a broad-based  government cannot be established, Yilmaz noted, a minority  government is a possibility if a general consensus is reached.  [passage omitted]    In a news conference in Ankara today, Fikri Saglar,  secretary  general of the Social Democratic Populist Party, noted the  recent search for a transition government and said that his  party is categorically opposed to this. Saglar remarked that  his party will not support any nondemocratic solution. Pointing  out that certain circles launched this quest the moment they  realized that their interests were undermined, Saglar said that  those who are looking for a government of technocrats or a  transition government are actually yearning for dark periods and  want to attain the dark monies of those dark periods.</p>

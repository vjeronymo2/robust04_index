			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Offices at Birkenhead business park WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION's north-west region has been awarded a Pounds 6.4m 90,000 sq ft office development at the Woodside Business Park in Birkenhead. When complete, the building will be home to the north-west's regional headquarters of the Child Support Agency - housing the 500 staff needed to implement the provisions of the Child Support Act. Sited on a riverside location adjoining the Woodside ferry terminal, the project is being developed by Wimpey Construction Developments. Due for completion in April next year, the development comprises two three-storey blocks and a four-storey central core all clad in traditional brick with a tiled pitched roof. The design has been developed by Wimpey Design and Build in association with architects Cassidy and Ashton and structural engineers Parkman Buck. Following on from the phase 1 development, which was pre-sold to HM Land Registry, Wimpey has pre-let the second phase to the Child Support Agency on a 25-year lease.</p>

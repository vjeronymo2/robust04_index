			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Alexanders Pounds 32,000 first-half profit The combination of a slowly strengthening market and enhanced operational efficiency enabled Glasgow-based Ford main dealer Alexanders Holdings to make a pre-tax profit of Pounds 32,000 in the six months ended March 31 1993. That compared with Pounds 408,000 last time, which was boosted by non-trading activities. However, for the full year ended September 30 1992, that was turned into a restated loss of Pounds 998,000, after Pounds 476,000 exceptional charges for costs incurred in reviewing various activities and reorganisation and restructuring. Mrs Aleksandra Clayton, chairman, said the latest profit reflected progressive recovery in the six months, the first half of which was characterised by continuing depressed conditions particularly in the used car market. Operational improvements were a function of substantially reduced operating costs, significant drop in staffing levels, and tighter control procedures. 'Further benefits from restructuring will be realised during a stronger second-half market', Mrs Clayton said. Earnings per share were 0.06p, against the reported 1.065p.</p>

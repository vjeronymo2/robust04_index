			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Gamble aims to end Tories' trauma The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications SO FAR, so good. The poll tax is all but dead, although the extended burial service will take a full two years to complete. The initial reaction to its successor the council tax, finally announced yesterday after weeks of agonising, was a qualified welcome to a pragmatic package targeted to meet the many anxieties of Conservative supporters. However, the drastic nature of the solution, which represents the biggest political U-turn for years, shows how traumatised ministers have become over the damage inflicted by the poll tax. A return to the rates is a gamble which has no guarantee of success, but at least it gives ministers a chance to restore electoral credibility and to seek to repair some of the harm done to the Tory party by the introduction of a local tax widely perceived as regressive and unfair. Mr Heseltine's original idea was to launch an across-the-board inquiry into all aspects of local government - finance, structure and organisation. That remains the intention, but the indications from yesterday's consultation papers are that the inquiry has degenerated into a piecemeal approach because of the need to ditch the poll tax fast. Virtually all effort has been focused on that. Any changes in structure and organisation lie well in the future. In the short term, at least, the tactic might work. The figures show an estimated average household charge for two or more people in the top property band of Pounds 668 and in the lowest band of Pounds 267 - well below the last average rates bill or the average poll tax paid last year. That is clearly good news for the government, particularly as the measures have been framed to avoid the big variations under the old rating system and to ensure there are not too many losers in the prime Tory territory of the south-east. There is therefore political logic in not creating too many losers among Tory supporters, and economic logic in the restoration of a link between the size of bills and ability to pay. It looks a skilful package, although it will lay the government open to the charge of looking after its own supporters at the cost of others. Yet many difficulties remain, mainly because no real attempt has been made to link reform of finance to reform of structure. Mr Heseltine and Mr Major may ultimately pay a heavy price for such a lopsided approach. The impression remains that the shape of local government is being refashioned almost accidentally as a result of the earlier botched attempt to abolish the unpopular rating system. The establishment of a fairer, more soundly based method of local revenue-raising will not end the tensions between local and central government, stretched almost to breaking point by the bruising fiasco of the poll tax. The confusion of responsibility between town halls and Whitehall has become an increasing source of conflict over the last decade and the consultation paper on structure showed that everything remains to be decided. Battle lines are already being drawn up in the conflict that is about to start over the introduction of unitary authorities, with many counties fighting for their existence against pressures from the districts to take over their powers. Mr Heseltine has guaranteed a lengthy, messy process by emphasising that it will be largely up to local opinion to decide what form of local administration is required, including in some cases the retention of two tiers of authorities. Politically the difficulty is that the majority of both county and district councils are at present Conservative-led and the party could be badly split by the conflicts. The blight of the poll tax might not yet be over. It might continue to distort domestic politics until clear lines for local and national administrative responsibilities are finally decided, and that is still some way off.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   HOW THE NEW TAX IS CALCULATED  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Upper              Council tax limit for          for standard       Council tax bands of           spending:          for standard        Percentage property           two or more        spending            of properties value              adults (pounds)    one adult (pounds)  in band  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- pounds40,000           267                 200                19 pounds52,000           311                 233                16 pounds68,000           356                 267                20 pounds88,000           400                 300                17 pounds120,000          490                 367                13 pounds160,000          579                 434                 8 pounds160,000+         668                 501                 7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  EXAMPLES OF WHAT COUNCIL TAX WILL COST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Poll tax            Council                            1991/92*(pounds)     tax** (pounds)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Inner London  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lambeth                           450                501 Wandsworth                          0                135 Westminster                        36                136 Outer London Brent                             330                423 Haringey                          420                620 Richmond upon Thames              279                392  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Metropolitan districts  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Barnsley                          185                502 Birmingham                        266                412 Liverpool                         334                448 Newcastle upon Tyne               316                480 Stockport                         310                475 Wakefield                         213                510 Wirral                            336                513  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- English shire districts  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bath                              245                409 Derby                             270                445 Huntingdonshire                   196                344 Langbaurgh-on-Tees                338                581 Nottingham                        295                423 Plymouth                          240                347 Ribble Valley                     273                442 Windsor and Maidenhead            288                405  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Per person **Bill for two or more adults in band covering average UK house price pounds68,000-pounds88,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In response to a question from a Korean Central  News Agency reporter regarding the replacement of fuel rods at  the five-megawatt experimental nuclear power station, a  spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry today gave the following  answer:    In connection with the replacement of fuel rods at the  five-megawatt experimental nuclear power station, we and the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Secretariat recently  exchanged many telex messages. Under our special position  [tuksuhan chiwi] in which we temporarily suspended the  effectuation of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty [NPT], out of a consistent position to show the  irreproachability [kyolbaeksong] of our nuclear activities, we  decided to subject the upcoming replacement of fuel rods to the  thorough surveillance of the agency. Therefore, we decided to  allow agency inspectors to observe [iphoe] the replacement of  fuel rods to verify that the nuclear material is not diverted  for other, nonpeaceful purposes [tarun pipyonghwajok mokchoge  yuyong].    The agency's observance activities, which we decided to  allow, include the observance [kwanchuk] of the replacement of  fuel rods, containment and surveillance [pongswaewa kamsi] of  all replaced fuels, and all other contents of inspection  sufficient enough to ensure the continuity of safeguards  [tamboui yonsoksongul pojanghanunde chungbunhan sachal  naeyongduri]. We also immediately issued visas for the five  inspectors, which the agency requested. As shown, we made all  possible efforts to prove the transparency [tumyongsong] of our  nuclear activities even though we are under a special position.    Nevertheless, the IAEA Secretariat is now making an  unreasonable request [pudanghan yongu] to select, preserve, and  measure [sontaek pogwanhago chukchong] some fuel rods during the  fuel rod replacement.    Saying that it would select and measure fuel rods means that  it would conduct regular and irregular inspections [chonggi mit  pijonggi sachal] after ignoring [musi] our special position in  which we temporarily suspended the withdrawal from the NPT.  This can in no way be allowed [tojohui hoyongdoelsu opta].    The only inspection activity that we can allow as a  voluntary  goodwill measure at present is an inspection purely to ensure  the continuity of safeguards to prove that the nuclear material  is not diverted for other purposes in compliance with our  special position [hyondangyeeso uriga chawonjogin sonuiui  chochiro hoyonghaejulsu innun sachal hwaltongun uriui tuksu  chiwie matke haengmunchiri tarunmochoge  yuyongdoejiannundanungosul hwaginhanun sunsu tamboui yonsoksong  pojangul wihan sachal ppunida].    Allowing the agency to subject all replaced fuel rods to its  containment and surveillance and to verify that they are not  diverted for other purposes is the expression of our greatest  goodwill [uriui choedaeui sonuiui pyosi].    The IAEA Secretariat, however, is insisting on unfair  demands, while openly ignoring our special position. This is  clear proof that the IAEA Secretariat is still treating us with  prejudice, while using suspicions of us as an excuse and that  the IAEA's partiality keeps expanding.    The IAEA Secretariat, which has in the past fabricated  inconsistencies by eliminating [word indistinct] samples, this  time wants to measure selected parts of the fuel rods. This  proves that it intends to continue to cling to the anti-Republic  pressure commotion by eventually making new inconsistencies.    What cannot be overlooked is that the IAEA Secretariat is  still not sending an inspection team, even though we have this  time allowed inspections to ensure the continuity of safeguards  and the so-called unfinished inspections, which was raised in  the last inspection conducted in March.    This clearly shows that the IAEA Secretariat has been  pursuing insidious political objectives by raising our nuclear  issue at the IAEA Board of Governors meeting and the UN Security  Council. If we allow the measurement of selected parts of the  fuel rods under such circumstances, the IAEA Secretariat is sure  to fabricate a new pretext in the anti-Republic pressure  commotion. We can no longer let the IAEA Secretariat use our  nuclear issue in the political game.    In case the IAEA Secretariat does not accept our reasonable  proposal and insists on its unfair demands to the end, we cannot  but replace the fuel rods in accordance with our operation plan.    In technical and security aspects, the replacement of the  fuel rods is an urgent matter that cannot be delayed any more.  Whether the IAEA inspectors are there to observe or not, the  spent fuel counter, thermal luminescence detectors, and  surveillance equipment installed by the IAEA in the experimental  nuclear power plant are still operational, therefore, our fuel  rod replacement work will be under thorough IAEA surveillance.    We will place all replaced fuel from the fuel rods under  IAEA  control and will allow examination when the nuclear issue is  resolved in a package deal in future DPRK-U.S. talks.    In the event the IAEA Secretariat drives the situation to  extremes, despite our maximum generosity and good intentions,  correspondingly, we will resolutely counter this [urinun ungdang  kue tanhohi taechohae nagal kosida].    With the resolution of the nuclear issue now reaching a  gateway stage [kwanmunjok taemok], the IAEA Secretariat should  think more deeply.</p>

The researchers here studied the  behavior of cells after migration in an embryonic cortex and  after transplantation into the cortex of intact female Wistar  rats in order to determine, specifically, the nature of the  migration demonstrated by neurons and glial cells and the  positions occupied by the migrating neurons of the transplantate  in the brain of the recipient. The label for the donor cells, [.sup]3[/]   H-thymidine, was injected intraperitoneally twice a  day on days 12, 13, and 14 of the pregnancy, so as to  incorporate the isotope in the neurons of layers 1, 5, and 6 and  in the nuclei of some astrocytes. The embryos were removed on  day 20, and cortical fragments were transplanted. The animals  were sacrificed on day 50 and studied. Transplanted cells that  had migrated were clearly visible in 6 rats. The distribution  throughout the brain of glial cells that had migrated was much  broader than that of the neurons and was similar to the movement  of astrocytes from the suspension grafts. Postmigration neurons  were found to be capable of repeated migration. No large  neurons, however, migrated. No donor neurons migrated to the  layers of their origin, i.e., neurons from layers 1, 5, and 6  were found in layers 2 and 3. Figures 6, references 32: 3  Russian, 29 Western.</p>

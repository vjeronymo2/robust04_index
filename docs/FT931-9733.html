			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: The flight into yen continues THE YEN came close to testing its all-time high against the US dollar yesterday on speculation that finance ministers from Japan and the US would discuss reducing the huge Japanese trade surplus this weekend, writes James Blitz. For the third day running, the yen gained new ground against most other currencies in heavy trading. It closed at Y72.46 per D-Mark from a previous Y73.00 on what one dealer described as the most turbulent day in his dealing room this year. Its performance against the dollar was even stronger, helped by lacklustre US retail sales figures. The dollar closed in London at Y120.2, down from Y120.9. At one stage it was as weak as Y119.5, near to the historic low of Y119.0 set last year. It picked up in New York to end at Y121.2 The yen also continued its extraordinary performance against sterling, ending at Y170.5 to the pound, up Y2, its third consecutive day of registering an all-time high. For British importers of Japanese goods, the exchange rate of Y234.25 recorded the day after the UK general election last year must seem a world away. The flurry of yen buying began after Mr Thomas Foley, the speaker of the House of Representatives, said he thought that President Bill Clinton might favour policies aimed at strengthening the Japanese currency. US Treasury officials later played down the possibility that an accord on reducing the Japanese trade deficit might be reached when Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, meets the Japanese finance minister this weekend. Mr Steven Hannah, a director of IBJ International in London, said the current flight into the yen was similar to one which took place last year, when words from politicians failed to be backed up by actions. 'There is still a risk that interest rates in Japan can fall further,' he said, believing that the current rally would be hard to sustain. However, Mr Jeremy Hawkins, vice-president of Bank of America in London, said the market could test the yen's record high against the dollar again. 'With the difficulties over the Gatt talks and the US embargo on steel imports, trade issues are taking up an increasing amount of the market's attention,' he added. Trading inside the European exchange rate mechanism remained quiet and the French franc finished at FFr3.379 against the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.383. However, omens of tension continued to be seen in the background. In Frankfurt, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, spoke in favour of 'limiting to greater extent recourse to foreign currency market intervention'. In Paris, the Director of the French Bankers' Association said banks are now losing FFr300m a month with base rates at 10 per cent and the cost of money at 12 per cent. He added that French base rates may have to rise.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The new strategy for defending the South American  continent is the main topic that the U.S. Southern Command  chief, General Barry B. McCaffrey, is analyzing with Brazilian  military commanders. Drug trafficking control through an  efficient fight in the Amazon region is part of the U.S.  military strategy in Latin America. McCaffrey met on 16 March  with Army Minister Zenildo de Lucena and the Army land  operations commander, to whom he explained the objectives of the  radar facilities and bases built on the borders of Amazon  countries.    In the opinion of the U.S. military chief, the United  States,  as a top military power in the Americas, is also a member of the  continent's defense pact along with the countries of the  hemisphere, an Army Planning Department official said on 16  March. McCaffrey today will meet the Armed Forces chief of  staff. On 18 March, he will visit the Naval Operations Command  in Rio de Janeiro.    A Vietnam war veteran, McCaffrey has taken advanced military  strategy courses. He graduated from West Point Military Academy.  In his capacity as Southern Command chief, McCaffrey is  responsible for all U.S. military activities in Latin America,  with the exception of Mexico and the Caribbean. Implementation  of the national security policy in the hemisphere is part of the  planning activities under his command, as a U.S. combat unit.    Meanwhile, in Buenos Aries, specialists and soldiers from  OAS  countries today continued debating enforcement of a new regional  post-Cold War security model.  <H5>  Integration </H5>   The deliberations, which began on 14 March, today focused on  the integration processes of Colombia and its neighbors,  Argentina and Chile; Mercosur [Common Market of the South]; and  the United States and Europe. The meeting was arranged in  November in Washington by the OAS Special Hemispheric Security  Commission, which is headed by Argentine Hernan Patino Mayer. At  the 23d OAS General Assembly, which was held in Managua, a  special resolution was approved to summon specialists and  soldiers of the Americas to analyze the situation in the region  within "the new international post-Cold War framework."    The Meeting of Specialists on Measures for Strengthening  Regional Mutual Confidence and Security Mechanisms is being  attended by deputy ministers, deputy foreign ministers, and  military officers from OAS countries. Brazilian Joao Baena  Soares, the OAS secretary general, is expected to arrive in  Buenos Aires this evening to join the meeting, which ends on 18  March.</p>

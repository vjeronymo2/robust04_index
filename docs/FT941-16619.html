			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Love affair with a mouse - Computing I have learned to love Windows. The Windows operating system must be one of the most successful marketing devices in the history of commerce. It is an 'environment' to be loaded into memory after your computer has loaded DOS, its own perfectly good operating system. In order to run Windows successfully, you will need a new computer with a fast processor and plenty of memory. If you don't have one, you might as well get a colour monitor so that you can enjoy the tartan wallpaper desktop design. You will certainly need a mouse to push around on your desk. Thus equipped, you are ready to go out and buy Windows programs to do the work you are doing already. Why? Because Windows is fun, that's why. Pushing a mouse around, clicking here and there, makes you feel powerful and authoritative. You have to take one hand off the keyboard for mouse control purposes. You might as well take the other hand off as well and relax into some really creative time-wasting. Windows was supplied with the computer I bought in 1992, as it is with almost all personal computers sold today. But I was slow in getting to grips with it for two reasons, both of them illustrative of a quality in me which my husband calls witlessness. First of all, I tried to move around Windows from the keyboard, without unpacking and plugging in my mouse. It can be done, but it is slow and clumsy. This is a factor to be considered if you are buying a portable computer: they tend to come with a 'tracking device' as a mouse-substitute. Some tracking devices are better than others. I got my own mouse out at last when Quicken for Windows presented me with an iconbar - a row of little pictures - which could only be reached by the mouse. Second, I stuck to Windows version 3.0 for far too long. Eventually my computer spat out a program I had been given to evaluate, with a message to the effect that my version of Windows really was not up to scratch. I upgraded to Windows 3.1 that week, and haven't looked back since. The new version actually has a shorter manual than its predecessor, because it looks after a lot of the complicated things like memory management without needing help from the user. It was easy to install. It replaced the older version automatically, preserving all my Windows programs and their arrangements. No longer are my Windows sessions abruptly and inexplicably 'terminated'. My favourite Windows program is Lotus Organiser, a computerised personal organiser with pages that seem to turn, coloured tabs to click on for the different sections, and a year planner that appears to fold out just like a paper one. This program is seriously useful simply because it is so much fun: I keep coming back to it, and begin to find that things really are getting organised. If you keep a to-do list in Organiser it is worth actually getting around to one or two of the items on it just for the joy of clicking in the 'Completed' box and seeing the chore dispatched to the end of the list with a line through it. You could, of course, keep a list of things to do on paper, and draw lines through them as required. But Organiser has some electronic tricks that are more difficult to duplicate. Items can be linked to other items; tasks to do, for example, can be linked to telephone numbers in the address section, to diary entries or to notes, enabling you to fly from one to the other. If you have a modem, Organiser will dial your telephone numbers for you. If you send and receive electronic mail, Organiser will go look in your letter box. If any of your to-do's involve another program, Organiser can be set to start up your word processor or database for you. For a complicated project such as a wedding or moving house, you could usefully have a separate Organiser devoted entirely to the subject. The only thing wrong with this program is a laughably inadequate manual. Everything must be figured out from the help screens. Huge manuals can be daunting, but this silly little pamphlet goes much too far in the other direction. We deserve better from Lotus. The other Windows program I have come to love this year is Microsoft's Visual Basic. When I was learning my computer craft, programming was just about the only thing you could do on a personal computer. The IBM PC was yet to be invented, and even elementary word processing was still in the future as far as a home user was concerned. Writing those little programs was for me an experience of mental exhilaration to be compared with my first sight of Raphael's portrait of Castiglione. Visual Basic brings that excitement back within range for all. While you're wandering around Windows, you might have a look at Solitaire, the American name for the familiar red-nine-goes-on-the-black-10 game of patience. It is brilliant. From the option list, choose 'Vegas rules'. Set it to keep score. Choose yourself an attractive deck of cards from the dozen on offer. You will never do any work again. All of the programs mentioned are widely available from computer dealers and shops. It is worth looking around for the best prices. Windows 3.1 costs about Pounds 55, Organiser about Pounds 90, Visual Basic v3 for Windows about Pounds 80, plus VAT in each case.</p>

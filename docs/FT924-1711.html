			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Spastics Society criticises Tecs THE Spastics Society yesterday criticised the standard of training provided to disabled people by the Training and Enterprise Councils. A report based on a survey of 138 organisations involved with disabled people said most Tecs had failed in their responsibility to ensure suitable high-quality training for disabled people. Mr Brian Lamb, the society's head of campaigns, said: 'Tecs have not met the training needs of disabled people and the gap between the rhetoric of what was supposed to be on offer and the reality is enormous.' Tecs, in their contracts with government, have to take account of the training requirements of 'special needs' clients. The society criticised the present funding regime for failing to recognise the extra costs that may be involved in training a disabled person. Cuts in provision had had a disproportionate effect on disabled people and fundamentally undermined the Tecs' abilities to carry out government policies aimed at targeted groups, the society said.

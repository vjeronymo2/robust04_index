			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei declines for the fifth day Share prices fell for the fifth consecutive day, with early gains wiped out by position covering by dealers and profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index lost 34.41 to 18,666.93, down 3.3 per cent on the week. The index moved between 18,847.07 and 18,666.13. Share prices were higher in the morning on buying by public funds and investment trusts. However, a fall in the futures market prompted selling in the afternoon by brokers closing their books on the last day of November delivery. Volume totalled 270m shares against 308m. The Topix index of all first-section stocks edged down 0.14 to 1,484.02 while the Nikkei 300 inched up 0.06 to 272.73. Losers led gainers by 539 to 399 with 236 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.09 to 1220.59. Traders said that public funds were the only buyers of the day. 'Share prices fell once they stopped buying in the afternoon,' said a Japanese broker. Sony rebounded Y130 to Y5,160, gaining for the first time in five trading days as overseas selling eased. Matsu-shita Electronic Industrial rose Y10 to Y1,500 but heavy electricals lost ground, including Fujitsu which fell Y10 to Y1,000. Brokers rebounded with Nomura Securities up Y10 to Y1,900 and Yamaichi Securities up Y10 to Y695. Banks, which reported weak interim earnings on Thursday, were mixed. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank fell Y10 to Y1,640 and Mitsubishi Bank rose Y20 to Y2,190. Steels were hit by profit taking. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, fell Y2 to Y373 and NKK declined Y4 to Y267. Kawasaki Steel, however, rose Y6 to Y416. In Osaka the OSE average fell 43.48 to 20,746.33 in volume of 30.7m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y130 to Y5,270. Roundup Activity was restricted throughout the region by the absence of Wall Street, closed for the Thanksgiving Day holiday. TAIPEI, however, picked up 1.3 per cent as textile and steel stocks found renewed demand. The index rose 81.80 to 6,421.82 in turnover of TDollars 41.96bn, for a 1.1 per cent rise on the week. The market's mood had improved after the authorities had agreed on Thursday to lift the ceiling for combined foreign holdings in listed Taiwanese companies to 25 per cent from 10 per cent. Among textiles issues, Hualon rose 30 cents to TDollars 23.60, and Shinkong Synthetic Fibres 50 cents at TDollars 32.30. Chung Shing Textile hit its daily 7 per cent limit at TDollars 15.60. SYDNEY capped a week of volatile price swings with a second day of gains as the market nearly recouped all of this week's early losses. The All Ordinaries index rose 24.3 to 1,910.0, sharply higher than Wednesday's 16-month low of 1,857, but 0.6 per cent lower on the week. Traders, however, noted that most gains were driven by local retail investors in the absence of the large US institutional investors who had driven the market lower earlier in the week. SEOUL continued lower for a seventh straight day as investors remained cautious, worried that the central bank was about to tighten money supply. The composite index ended 5.82 down at 1,085.16, for a decline of 3 per cent on the week. HONG KONG was unable to make much headway, finishing only slightly higher after fluctuating for most of the day around Thursday's closing level. The Hang Seng index closed up 10.97 at 8,658.83, for an 8.2 per cent drop on the week. Provisional turnover was a thin HKDollars 2.61bn. BANGKOK saw selling accelerate during the afternoon and the SET index finished 7.90 lower at 1,349.39 after a volatile day. The market fell 7.4 per cent on the week. Turnover was thin at Bt4.6bn. BOMBAY put on 1.4 per cent on the first day of the new account. The BSE 30 shares index rose 56.89 to 4,132.28.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 13 Mar (MENA)--'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice  chairman of the Yemeni Presidential Council and leader of the  Yemeni Socialist Party, has warned that an anti-Arab scheme is  being planned to spread terrorism and extremism with a view to  harming the ambitions of the Arab and Islamic nation and  isolating it from the rest of the world.    In a statement to AL-AHRAM published today, al-Bid says that  the features of this terrorist scheme are clear to all, and its  threat extends to a number of Arab countries.    He called for confronting the scheme by bringing it up for  discussion at the pan-Arab level. He said the backward  mentalities that want to impose their control on the Arab and  Islamic nation must be confronted.    Al-Bid welcomed any Arab effort to steer unified Yemen clear  of the specter of civil war and help the country to continue its  democratic and peaceful march and adhere to the Pledge and  Accord Document on national reconciliation.    He praised the efforts of Egypt and President Husni Mubarak  to contain the Yemeni crisis. He said Egypt, by virtue of its  relations with and assistance to Yemen, can play an effective  role on the Yemeni scene.    On the situation in Yemen, al-Bid said: From experience, we  have come to realize that Yemen had neither the right  circumstances nor the suitable leadership for unity of action in  the past.    Some believed the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document  ended the crisis, but this is wrong; the signing meant only that  we acknowledged the crisis and laid down the bases to resolve  it, he said.    "The situation requires that we move toward implementation  in  the appropriate circumstances," he added.    On fears that a military confrontation may break out in  Yemen, al-Bid said there are such fears, and the Military  Committee needs help from Arab forces -- especially Egypt, which  is the closest Arab country to us -- so that a civil war can be  avoided.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Franco-German military corps to be open to others FRANCE has told Belgium that Western European Union (WEU) members will be invited to join a Franco-German military force to make it the core of European defence, according to Belgium's deputy prime minister, Mr Willy Claes, Reuter reports from Paris. He was speaking after meeting President Francois Mitterrand. Mr Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced last year plans to set up a joint 35,000-strong corps by 1995 as a model for an EC defence arm separate from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. They have already commissioned a 5,000-strong Franco-German brigade and will launch a joint naval squadron next month.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Councils stretched over funds gap On Tuesday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced a 2.2 per cent rise in local government funding in the Budget. Yesterday, the Association of County Councils denounced it as a cut of 3.3 per cut in cash terms. The dispute perfectly illustrates the growing gap between central and local government, which appears to have widened this year with bitter attacks on both the chancellor and the environment secretary, Mr John Gummer, from councillors of all parties. Mr Clarke was referring to an increase in 'total standard spending' - the government's estimate of what local government should spend. This is used as the basis for grants to local government, which are topped up by council tax, levied by councils. It will increase from Pounds 42.58bn this year to Pounds 43.51bn in 1995-96. The counties, in common with the other English local authority associations, were talking about the amount they actually spend. This year, they spent Pounds 44.42bn. Next year, if spending on all services is frozen but extra responsibilities are taken on for community care at the expected cost, they predict this will rise to Pounds 45bn. The crucial point, as far as the councils are concerned, is that the government is budgeting for them to spend around Pounds 1bn less than they are already spending - before inflation, pay rises or any changes in responsibilities are taken into account. Central and local government have been out of kilter ever since the poll tax was introduced in 1990-91. This was almost redressed by the generous settlement negotiated for 1991-92 in an attempt to dampen the unpopular effects of the poll tax, but since then the gap has widened again, limited only by the government's policy of 'capping' local authority budgets to thwart excessive rises in local taxation. Councils say unrepeatable technical factors enabled them to avoid serious cuts in services this year. They made an unprecedented Pounds 775m draw on reserves. They also underestimated how much council tax they would collect in 1993-94 - its first year of operation - which effectively gave them a windfall for 1994-95. Next year, they claim additional factors will come into effect. These include a rise of 110,000, or approximately 1 per cent, in the number of school pupils, and a rise in the number of elderly requiring care. Local government finance experts suggest Mr Clarke's 2.2 per cent figure for the estimated total standard spending is in any case misleading. An analysis by Mr Edward Dimbylow for the Local Government Chronicle points out that Mr Clarke's figure included the new responsibilities for community care, which require extra funding. It also included the 3 per cent increase in the budget for police authorities, which is paid to local authorities, but is ring-fenced so that it can only be spent on police services. The chancellor had also included funding for local government reorganisation, which starts next year. Once these items are stripped from the equation, says the Local Government Chronicle, the increase in total standard spending 'hovers around 0.18 per cent, or a virtual cash freeze'.</p>

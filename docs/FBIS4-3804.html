			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and Zhou Shuchun </F> (0719 2885 2504)]    [Text] Tashkent, 20 Apr (XINHUA) -- On the morning of 20  April, the Chkalov Aircraft Production Corporation, which is  located in the eastern suburban area of Tashkent, was permeated  with a joyful atmosphere of Sino-Uzbek friendship and  cooperation. On the last day of his visit in Uzbekistan,  Chinese Premier Li Peng, accompanied by Uzbek President Islam  Karimov, visited this plant.    At 0930, the state guest motorcade drove in the aircraft  plant surrounded by green trees. When Premier Li Peng got out  of the limousine, he was welcomed by Uzbek girls wearing ethnic  dresses. Carrying trays with both hands, the girls offered the  guests bread and salt according to local custom. Young boys  played drums and trumpets to express their warmest welcome to  the distinguished Chinese guests.    In the assembling workshop full of thundering machines,  (Kuchelov), chief engineer of this plant, briefed Premier Li  Peng in detail on the situation and production technological  process in the 62-year-old aircraft production corporation. As  he listened to the briefing, Premier Li Peng watched various  equipment and components with keen interest. He frequently went  near working tables, shaking hands and exchanging greetings in  Russian with workers.    (Kuchelov) said: The Chkalov Aircraft Production Corporation  mainly manufactures cargo planes and assembles passenger planes  for civilian use. The plant is named after Chkalov, a  test-flight pilot serving in the early days of the plant. After  completing several arduous tasks, he died in a test-flight  mission. This plant is named after him and his statue stands in  the central part of the plant yard.    Stopping in front of a large plane soon to be completed, Li  Peng inquired in detail about the plane's functions. (Kuchelov)  said: It is the latest IL-76MF cargo plane with a carrying  capacity of 210-tonnes; it will be tested this year. It is  expected to leave the plant in 1996. He added: "I hope we will  manufacture this kind of plane for China in the near future."    After they walked out of the workshop, Li Peng and Karimov  mounted a just-completed IL-76TD cargo plane with a carrying  capacity of 40-tonnes. The host said happily: Last year, this  plant produced 7 planes of this kind and delivered them to China  this February. Li Peng walked into the specious cargo bay and  closely watched the technical demonstration of the opening of  the cabin doors.    Assembling workshop director (Lafemov), who has worked as a  technician in China for two years, told reporters: After its  independence, Uzbekistan established direct ties with China; now  the prospects for cooperation between the two countries in  producing aircraft are even brighter.    Afterwards, Li Peng briskly mounted an IL-114 small  passenger  plane next to the IL-76TD. According to the briefing, this is a  comfortable passenger plane with a capacity of 54 persons. It  can fly non-stop for 1,000 km, a perfect plane for domestic  flights.    Beside this passenger plane, (Kuchelov), on behalf of all  employees of the plant, presented two plane models to Premier Li  Peng. One was a model of the IL-76TD heavy airfreighter with  Chinese characters "China Lienhe Airline" on it, and the other  one is a model of the IL-114 passenger plane.    As the nearly one-hour visit drew to an end, Li Peng told  reporters what he thought of this tour. He said that what  impressed him most was the plant's broad scale, long history,  and variety of products. He was glad that China has begun  cooperation with this plant.    At the end of the visit, President Islam Karimov said:  "Premier Li Peng's visit is not only of political but also of  great economic significance. Today's tour manifests promising  prospects for cooperation between Uzbekistan and China."</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Stones and monks enliven first quarter - Thorn EMI Analysts will be examining with interest the results from Thorn EMI tomorrow. It will be the first time the music and rental group has reported on the first quarter. Most agree it has been a relatively quiet three months to June in the music industry, with only two big releases on the Virgin and EMI labels  - the Rolling Stones and the Benedictine Monks. Recent US statistics suggest overall sales growth in the music market was more than 10 per cent in the first half of the year, and positive noises from Polygram at its recent results suggest similar growth in Europe. Although most analysts are loath to make predictions on Thorn without comparable figures from last year, music sales growth of around 7 per cent is being pencilled in. Music accounts for nearly two-thirds of Thorn's profits. Operating profits of between Pounds 45m and Pounds 55m are tentatively forecast for the division, out of total overall profits of between Pounds 67m and Pounds 77m. A goodwill write-down on the sale of some non-core assets should bring pre-tax profits in at around Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m. Thorn's rental business, which includes Rumbelows in the UK and Rent-A-Center in the US, should chip in with operating profits of around Pounds 25m. The company is expected to give more details of new store formats it has been trying out. Analysts also hope to be reassured about the performance of the US operations in the face of the wide availability of cheap credit, which could hurt trade at Rent-A-Centre. Thorn shares, which have underperformed the market by around 8 per cent in the past three months, have recently rallied, reviving speculation over the group demerging. Observers, however, do not expect any further comment from the management on the subject tomorrow.</p>

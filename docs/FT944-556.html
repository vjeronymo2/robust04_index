			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / French team proves its worth The success of the French National Gendarmerie Intervention Group's assault on the hijacked Air France Airbus has served as a reminder of increasing sophistication of anti-terrorist action in the 1990s. From the moment on Christmas Eve morning when the airline was taken over in Algeria, the French government set in motion a well rehearsed plan of action. The apparent early prevarication by some French officials over whether or not to negotiate was a ploy by security chiefs to give time to prepare the commando operation. The GIGN is divided into four brigades each made up of 15 professional police and ex-army marksmen with an administrative back-up which includes signals intelligence staff. During the two days that elapsed between the hijack and the grounding of the aircraft in Marseilles one of the GIGN brigades practised the assault on an Airbus of the same type. Throughout this period the movement and the conversations of the hijackers were constantly monitored by existing listening devices, allowing the commandos to pinpoint those areas of the airliner most susceptible to attack and infiltration. The GIGN is just one of several specialised anti-terrorist units which France has established over the past two decades to deal with the threat of international terrorism in all its forms. Together with Britain's SAS and the Israeli special forces, the GIGN have earned worldwide international recognition for their record in thwarting terrorist actions. Controversy has never been far behind the actions of these units, however. They have to tread a fine line - often blurred by ministerial divisions - between what is politically acceptable and what is a military necessity. It was Castro supporters who initiated aircraft hijacks in 1961, diverting four airliners to Havana, the Cuban capital. But it was in the late 1960s and early 70s that the practice was used increasingly by mainly Middle East groups to highlight their cause and, wherever possible, to secure the release of political prisoners. Anti-terrorist experts believe that as long as a government holds firm and refuses to give in to terrorists there is less chance of hijacking increasing. However, they have continued with more than 20 taking place in the past two years alone. Some hijackings have been carried out by deranged individuals, others by common criminals bent on extortion. The bulk, however, are the work of political fanatics who believe that the publicity generated by the action is still worth dying for.</p>

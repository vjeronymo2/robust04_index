			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- China is relying on  property rights reform to invigorate its many state-owned  enterprises in its drive to establish a market economy.    Medium-sized and small enterprises with less than desirable  management and profits are being sold, transferred or merged  with others, said Jia Heting, deputy director for the Production  System Department under the State Commission for Economic  Restructuring (SCER).    He said 10,000 enterprises in the country underwent such  reforms last year. Two thousand nine hundred medium-sized and  small enterprises in China's 16 large cities were sold or  merged, and property rights worth 6 billion yuan (about 1  billion U.S. dollars then) were effectively made productive.  More than 400,000 employees were offered other jobs, according  to Jia.    These cities include Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and  Shenzhen.    "Such property rights reform helps to optimize the  allocation  of state assets in the socialist market economy," said Jia  Heting.    More and more enterprises from different regions or trades  are being merged, instead of only those from within the same  regions or trades, Jia said, adding that enterprises in  Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing are taking over others by buying  up their stock.    To transfer property rights, some enterprises agree to  shoulder old debts, or pay in cash immediately, he said.    The SCER official said a major move in the property rights  reform--the share-holding system--is gaining ground in China.  More and more pilot companies are going public, and nine  enterprises have been chosen to issue stocks in Hong Kong.    There are 3,800 pilot stock companies in China, Jia said.    China has promulgated a series of laws and regulations to  govern property rights reform, which include the Bankruptcy Law,  the Corporate Law, and the provisional regulations on enterprise  mergers, on management of state assets, on selling the property  rights of small enterprises and the assessing of state assets.    Economists expect large and medium-sized state enterprises  to  be transformed into stockholding enterprises, while small state  enterprises will be turned into non-state but publicly owned  enterprises through auctions or rental arrangements.    The large state enterprises will absorb non-state funds from  the market, and new state assets can be formed through stock  issues and creating income through investing in weak points of  the national economy, experts said.</p>

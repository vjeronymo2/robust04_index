			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: HK Telecom calls on local talent  -Simon Holberton examines the blueprints for an invasion of China At the very end of last year, Linus Cheung left Cathay Pacific, his employer for 23 years, and accepted the job as chief executive of Hongkong Telecommunications. For Mr Cheung, a Cathay man through and through, the decision was agonising. It cost him 10lbs in weight, but he gives no indication that he has spent any time looking back. 'The trust they (Cable &amp; Wireless, which owns 57.5 per cent of HK Telecom) have put in me is amazing,' Mr Cheung said in an interview yesterday. 'I'm breaking my back to make sure I deliver.' Mr Cheung holds the distinction of being the most senior Chinese executive of all the traditional big British companies in Hong Kong. But while he may display an uncommon humility, he is not sentimental: 'Without 1997 this job would not have been available to a Chinese person,' he says. His appointment 2 1/2 months ago went to the heart of Hongkong Telecom/Cable &amp; Wireless's strategy for China and its realisation that the company should be led by an ethnic Chinese. There may be good business to be done in cellular telephones in Singapore (population 2.5m), or nibbling at the edges of a liberalised telecoms market in Taiwan (population 21m), but China (population 1.2bn) is where the future lies for Hongkong Telecom. Mr Cheung acknowledges this himself when he says how he admires Lord Young, Cable &amp; Wireless's chairman, for 'localising' the top job in Hong Kong; and notes his welcome from officials in Beijing. 'They have reacted positively to my appointment,' he says. Cracking the China market will not be easy. History and geography confer on Hongkong Telecom a special place in China's emerging telecommunications market, especially in relation to Beijing's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT). China, through the MPT, accounts for 20 per cent of Hongkong Telecom's revenues. Also, as the principal and dominant telecoms operator in what is soon to be China's richest province, Hongkong Telecom has recognised that it has no alternative but to co-operate with the MPT - the guardian of China's telecoms system from foreign invasion and a regulator it cannot ignore. Mr Cheung yesterday gave the clearest exposition to date of what his company wants to do once the MPT relaxes its prohibition on foreign involvement in China's domestic network. 'We would very much like to invest in fixed network construction and management,' he says. 'We prefer those localities which require a high number of lines. We are open-minded as to where we do this but any investment will have to be commercially viable.' Mr Cheung believes the BOT (build, operate, transfer) model - which has been used so successfully by foreign investors in China's power industry - can be modified and used for regional telecoms development on the mainland. He believes Hongkong Telecom would want a continuing management role in a network after its transfer to the local PTT. The company has offices in Beijing and Guangzhou but will expand its presence on the mainland. It will soon open in Shanghai and Mr Cheung says he would also like the company to be represented in Xian and Dalian - to cover the north-west and north-east of China respectively. 'We have lots of friends in China,' he says. The company has very good relations with the MPT in Beijing. This was underlined last month when C&amp;W/Hongkong Telecom and the MPT formed a joint venture partnership in submarine cables. The Sino-British Submarine Systems Company is 51 per cent owned by the MPT and 49 per cent owned by Great Eastern Telecommunications, jointly owned by C&amp;W and Hongkong Telecom. Submarine Systems will lay optical fibre cable in and around the waters of China and maintain the optical fibre link between Japan and China. Given Britain's poor relations with China over Hong Kong it is remarkable that the deal went through. It is even more remarkable that Lord Young met Mr Jiang Zemin, China's president and Communist party chief. If China will let any non-mainland company benefit from involvement in the domestic telecoms network then that company will be Hongkong Telecom. With China's plans to increase the size of the telephone network from its current capacity of 40m lines to 100m (and possibly 140m lines) by 2000, Mr Cheung believes that foreign investment will have to come. For a Chinese nationalist like Mr Cheung to participate in the building of modern China gives rise to no small amount of pride. 'China has waited 200 years for prospects like these,' he says.</p>

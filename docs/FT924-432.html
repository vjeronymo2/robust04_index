			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / EC states asked to lift border controls EUROPEAN Community member states will be asked to lift border controls on goods on January 1 even though national restrictions on a number of sensitive imports and exports - currently checked at frontiers - are still in place. EC commissioners met yesterday for the last time before the barrier-free market comes into force, but failed to come up with a temporary solution to the single-market anomaly of continuing national quotas. Advocates of the barrier-free internal market fear member states will try to keep border controls on some goods such as textiles and footwear in order to enforce national quotas. EC foreign ministers failed on Monday to resolve a dispute which links the strengthening of EC trade weapons to the scrapping or harmonisation of national quotas on certain non-EC goods. The Commission did decide yesterday to set up an emergency unit made up of national single-market officials, who will consider any practical problems arising in the first months of the new free trade area. At Monday's meeting, ministers also failed to agree a definitive system for monitoring the movement of 'dual-use' goods, which have military and civilian applications. The lack of a definitive system raises fears that arms traders may be able to get sensitive dual-use technology through the EC's weakest external frontiers to areas of conflict. In addition to dual-use goods, there will be no definitive system for monitoring the movement of bananas until next July at the earliest, and member states have not worked out how to regulate the import and export of works of art in the absence of border controls. Brussels is particularly concerned to ensure that border controls on goods are lifted after January 1, because member states have singularly failed to meet the deadline for abolishing checks on people.</p>

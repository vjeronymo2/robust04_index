			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with OPZZ Chairperson Ewa Spychalska by Dorota </F> Bardzinska; place and date not given: "An Umbrella on a Hanger"]    [Excerpts] [Bardzinska] The All-Polish Trade Unions  Agreement [OPZZ] backed the government in the budget ballot.  Was this voting not very comfortable for the union?    [Spychalska] It was very difficult because the budget is  extremely stretched, does not secure the fundamental needs, and,  on top of it all, is not the full implementation of the program  of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. We understand that this  is a four-year program, but the people, who are simply going  through many hardships, do not really feel like waiting.    [Bardzinska] Why, then, did the union's deputies support the  budget?    [Spychalska] No one can work miracles. We evaluated this  budget and checked whether it was feasible and secure, whether  it clarified the legal situation. We also analyzed how the  budget distributed money for various purposes. The budget met  all of these conditions. I must also say that the additional  law that makes it possible to amend the budget is quite  important.    [Bardzinska] Does your support for the budget mean that you  have become a progovernment union?    [Spychalska] You are asking me whether we have placed a  protective umbrella over the government? Well, we have not,  among other reasons, because we publicly criticized all of the  things we did not like about the budget.    [Bardzinska] When this government was only beginning its  work, you used to say that the OPZZ would not give it even an  umbrella handle....    [Spychalska] The budget issue is not at all a matter of  protecting the government, but a matter of stabilizing the state  and setting things in order. As the situation gradually  improves and the budget's revenues increase, we will make  efforts to improve social protection mechanisms.    [Bardzinska] The budget ballot was probably difficult for  you personally as well, was it not? One of the deputy chairmen,  who, according to some commentators, may be your rival, voted  against...    [Spychalska] It is of secondary importance. Deputy Chairman  Wisniewski underscored very clearly the lack of money for  expenditures in the area of social policy because he happens to  be dealing with these issues. He stated in public that  increasing the deficit is not as dangerous as causing a social  outbreak by the lack of that money. He has good reason to say  so. However, if we look at this issue realistically, increasing  the deficit means greater inflation. The latter, in turn, hits  the poorest the hardest. It was difficult to persuade him to  change his mind; he remained faithful to his views until the  end. As a result, by the decision of the club, he was expelled  from the SLD. [passage omitted]    [Bardzinska] How would you comment on the president's veto  of the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases]?    [Spychalska] The president's action is in line with our  unionist action--when we voted against this law.    [Bardzinska] What can you say about the talks between the  OPZZ unionists and this government? Are they easier because the  OPZZ deputies belong to the coalition?    [Spychalska] They are difficult. Government representatives  are telling us: Why, you do know the program, so you should  understand the prospects for its implementation. We certainly  know that. However, we want this stated clearly in negotiations.  We want an implementation schedule to be prepared and certain  social minimums to be guaranteed.    Actually, I found it easier to discuss certain difficult  issues, such as the problem of reclaiming, with the  representatives of the Suchocka government--Minister Kuron and  Minister Osiatynski. The issues of reclaiming have not been  brought to an end yet because part of the statement by the  Constitutional Tribunal was adopted by the Sejm, but it did not  pass through the legislative path. Now, the committee that  handles reclaiming issues is forwarding so many motions to us  that they exceed the number of motions forwarded to us during  the two years of governments not favorable to us. The unionists  are indignant and asking: Why is it so difficult to reach  agreement? Or, what do we gain by being in the coalition?    Minister Miller told us that the committee is independent  and  is not in any way subordinated to him; he only ensures it  administrative support.    [Bardzinska] Does the OPZZ support the idea of returning  union property?    [Spychalska] Yes, it does. The controversial issue is only  the problem of pricing.    [Bardzinska] Your deputy said that he is not satisfied with  this government.    [Spychalska] I am not fully satisfied with it, either.    [Bardzinska] What are the reasons for this dissatisfaction?    [Spychalska] Talks with the government take too long. They  are often too general, and there are not enough earlier  agreements reached among the various ministries. Sometimes our  government colleagues just cannot decide on a firm solution--in  this or that way. However, it is high time they started doing it.    [Bardzinska] What does the OPZZ gain by being in the  coalition?    [Spychalska] Not much, really. It is even a very  troublesome situation for us, which we can feel rather strongly.  [passage omitted]    [Bardzinska] What is your evaluation of the recent protests  of Solidarity ["S"]?    [Spychalska] It is a pity that it all happened like this  because the things that "S" demanded in its protest actions are  the same issues we are discussing at the negotiation table with  the government. Apart from that, any strike results in losses.  People know perfectly well that there is keen competition on  the market and that, when there is a stoppage in a company, the  company's rival profits. Strike is a weapon that should be used  as a last resort. If it is overused, it loses its strength; it  simply ceases to be dangerous.    [Bardzinska] Did OPZZ unions take part in those protests?    [Spychalska] No, we did not approve of those activities.  However, there was neither a recommendation to take part in the  strikes nor a ban. Our organizations are legal entities and can  decide their activities themselves.    In referenda, work forces were asked the following  questions:  Do you want to earn more? Are you satisfied with your living  standard? Are you, then, ready to protest? Well, who would  answer "no" to such questions? Therefore, I could see that the  results of the referenda were not related properly.    [Bardzinska] Thank you for the interview.</p>

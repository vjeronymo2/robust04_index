			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Construction Contracts: Building oncology clinic in the Urals CONDER PROJECTS, the specialist design and build operation of the Miller Group, has just won the USDollars 28m (Pounds 18.5m) contract to design, construct and equip a five-storey oncology clinic with 12 operating theatres in Yekaterinburg in the Urals. Linked to an oncology hospital currently under construction, the building will also include anaesthetic and recovery rooms, a sterilisation plant, laboratories and teaching facilities. This is part of a major social programme aimed at improving Russian healthcare standards, and it will become the centre for the treatment of cancer and related illnesses in the Sverdlovsk region. Work is expected to start on site in mid-1993. This is the first project to be carried out as a result of Conder Projects' associate membership of the British Healthcare Consortium.</p>

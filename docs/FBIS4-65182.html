			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Voter Survey on June 12 Elections"] </F>   [Text] Rome 6 May (ANSA) -- Forza Italia, National Alliance  [AN] and two left-wing opposition parties, the Democratic Party  of the Left [PDS] and Communist Refoundation [Communist  Renewal], will all gain votes in the June 12 European Parliament  elections compared to the March 27 general elections, according  to a CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research] survey released  Friday [6 May].    The poll results, to be published in the next issue of the  news weekly, L'ESPRESSO, show that Silvio Berlusconi's Forza  Italia party would obtain 24.2 percent of the vote, compared to  21.1 percent in March, while its neo-Fascist government partner,  National Alliance, would increase its votes by 1.1 percent.    The Northern League on the other hand would drop 1.1 percent  compared to the previous elections, CIRM said.    The Left democrats would increase their votes by 1.4 percent  and Communist Refoundation by 0.9 percent, according to CIRM,  which did not say how it was able to separate the parties, both  right and left, which in the March elections were running under  the same ticket.    The opposition Greens would remain stable while the Pact for  Italy would lose 0.8 percent and the former Christian Democrats  of the People's Party would lose 0.5 percent. The Pannella  Ticket, too, would drop by 1.5 percent.</p>

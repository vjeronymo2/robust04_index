			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TUSTIN LIVES UP TO BILLING; LOARA'S WHITLOCK SCORES 49  </P> <P> Nearly 2,000 fans packed Tustin High School's gymnasium Friday night to see  Tustin, The Times' second-ranked basketball team, rout rival Foothill, 88-48.  </P> <P> "This is the first time in 14 years there has been such a blowout in this  game," Foothill coach Jim Reames said.  </P> <P> "We played an excellent Tustin team that is probably the best since Roger  Middleton was there."  </P> <P> Tustin used pressure defense to force 14 Foothill turnovers in the first half  and opened the game with a 15-0 run.  </P> <P> Foothill never recovered from a 27-8 first quarter deficit, and the Knights  trailed, 62-27, at the end of three quarters. David Beilstein led Tustin with  24 points, including 20 in the first half along with four three-pointers.  MICHAEL ITAGAKI  </P></p>

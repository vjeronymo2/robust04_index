			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lu Hsiang (7627 3276): "Hunan Gives </F> Preferential Treatment to External Businessmen Investing in  Agricultural Development"]    [Text] Being an interior province, Hunan still lags behind  the coastal provinces in the use of foreign funds, but being  referred to in history as a land of fish and rice, it has many  favorable conditions for agricultural development. In order to  attract Hong Kong and foreign investors, the Hunan Provincial  Government recently formulated new regulations and offered more  favorable conditions to them.    Hong Kong and foreign businessmen are encouraged to make  investments in the following projects: 1) The construction of  basic agricultural facilities; 2) The planting and raising of  high-yield and good-quality crops and animal breeds; 3) The  development of forestry; 4) The development of aquiculture; 5)  Tests and application of modern agricultural techniques and  technologies; 6) Processing of farm, forest, animal, and fishing  products; and 7) other export-oriented agricultural development  projects.    External businessmen may make investments or may carry out  cooperation in the form of providing funds, materials,  industrial property rights, patented technologies, or other  property rights. The Chinese side may make investments or may  carry out cooperation by means of providing funds, land assets  or land use rights, plants, equipment, technologies, crops,  forests, water resources, and other property rights.    If external businessmen want to make independent investments  to run crop, forest, animal, and fishing farms, they may do this  by going through the formalities for the transfer of the land  use rights. After acquiring the land use rights, the external  investors will be able to carry out their development projects,  and they also may transfer the land use rights to other people  after they fulfill the requirements of the first transfer  contracts. If external businessmen independently develop  collective agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery,  they may go through the formalities according to the contracts  on the use of collective land, but the collective land cannot be  resold.    When external investors use state-owned land to launch their  development projects, the longest term of land use may reach 50  years. The land use contracts may be extended if the same land  is still in use. If external investors use state-owned land to  launch development projects in the fields of agriculture, animal  husbandry, and fishery, they may be exempted from paying land  use fees for 10 to 15 years as of the date of approving the land  use. If the land is used to develop forestry, the term of  exemption may be 20 to 30 years.    In their investment in agricultural development projects,  external businessmen also may enjoy the following favorable  taxation arrangements:    First, when foreign investors launch developing agricultural  projects or introduce improved varieties and animal breeds  recognized by the provincial government to separated test zones,  their income from the test cultivation in the process of  scientific research will be exempted from local taxes for a  certain period of time.    Second, the improved seeds, seedlings, stud stock, feed,  medicine for protecting plants and animals, and the tools and  equipment for processing farm products imported by the  enterprises with external investment for the purpose of  exporting farm products will be free from customs tariff.    Third, a reasonable quality of materials and appliances used  by the external staff of the enterprises with external  investment in their daily lives are free from customs tariff.    Fourth, with the approval of the customs authorities, the  agricultural development zones may set up comprehensive bonded  warehouses and bonded factories. The goods imported to such  bonded facilities are completely free from customs tariff. The  farm products for further processing shipped by the chain  enterprises and for indirect export are free from customs tariff.    If the products are related to export licenses and export  quotas, the external investors may apply for such licenses and  quotas from the authorities in charge of foreign trade, which  first will meet the needs of foreign-funded enterprises involved  in developing agricultural projects in the issuance of export  licenses and quotas.    The provincial government also requires in the regulations  that local governments at all levels, as well as relevant  departments, offer effective assistance to external investors  involved in agricultural development projects, and help them  solve problems in their production and daily lives, and  guarantee their legitimate rights and interests.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Mar 03, BNS -- Russia did not call off the  negotiations with Estonia but just took a time-out to consider  the situation that has emerged, a senior foreign ministry  official told BNS in a telephone interview today.    Alexandr Udaltsev, senior official in charge of relations  with the Baltics at the Russian Foreign Ministry, said his  country had no intention to cause any protraction over  determining the date for the next round of negotiations. He  said protraction was "not in Russia's interests." The diplomat  said his country now had to decide as quickly as possible on how  to act.    Udaltsev said Russia might well return to the earlier  suggested Aug. 31 deadline for the withdrawal of its troops from  Estonia if "the Estonian party abides by the conditions already  on several occasions quoted by Russia."    "It is necessary that the Estonian party took into  consideration the minimum interests of Russia, and then we will  be ready to meet them halfway over the deadlines," he said.    Udaltsev reiterated the importance Russia gives to the issue  of its retired military living in Estonia. "We cannot go away  leaving them in a state of being let down. We are expected to  cut the terms of the troop withdrawal, and Estonia wishes that a  considerable deal of these people left together with the troops.  This is a prospect we cannot accept," he said.    He said it would be "very sad and shortsighted" if Estonia  declared breaking off the talks. He mentioned that "refusing  from negotiations is a senseless thing to do in any situation,  they must go on and continue under whatever circumstances except  for the very extreme ones."    Commenting of the topic of the deadline for the pullout of  troops from the Estonian territory, Udaltsev claimed that Russia  was "not shifting any deadlines." He said that taking the  suggested date of Aug. 31 as a formal deadline was a mistake  that emerged largely due the activity of Russia's partners in  the talks.    Udaltsev said the delegations since last November had  "discussed the possibility to withdraw troops by Aug. 31," and  that this had just been a position for the talks. Russia told  nobody about it, never took an obligation, the diplomat said,  adding that the date existed nowhere in the CSCE and U.N.  documents on the issue.    He said there had existed a position for the negotiating  process, which was linked to certain circumstances. These  circumstances, in his words, have passed by the present moment,  and, along with them, the negotiating position passed. "One can  return to it and consider it anew," he added.    Udaltsev said Russia under international resolutions had  taken the obligation to pull its troops out "quickly, in an  organized and orderly manner," and, as the resolutions  emphasize, according to the respective agreements. He said  these agreements were clearly named in the resolution of a  foreign ministers meeting that took place in Rome at the end of  last year. These are the agreements on the troop withdrawal, on  social security guarantees for retired military, and, he added,  also mentioned there is an agreement on the radar station at  Skrunda, Latvia. "Our partners must read these resolutions with  more attention and freshen the memory about by whom, where and  what kind and obligations were taken," he said.    He reminded that Russia so far had brought only forward the  final date for its troop withdrawal -- starting from 1999, and  finishing with 1994.    Commenting on Estonia's reaction to his own remarks over the  recent period, Udaltsev said it seemed to him that Estonia only  needed "some kind of pretext." In his words Estonians had  understood that they are entering a new round of negotiations  without any serious baggage, and, therefore, had decided to make  a sensation out of his remarks.    The two countries should not waste their time seeking faults  with each other but must simply sit down at a table and  seriously look for a compromise, the Russian diplomat concluded.</p>

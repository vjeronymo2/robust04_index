			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the judicial editorial staff] </F>   [Text] Although high-ranking government spokesmen, the  Cuban Embassy in Santa Fe de Bogota, and Ricardo Santamaria,  Colombian ambassador to Cuba, said yesterday they had no  information about a meeting between Colombian guerrilla members  and church spokesmen in Havana, EL TIEMPO was able to obtain new  and more revealing details thanks to the island's authorities.    The meeting between the Colombian Catholic Church bishop and  FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] commanders and  spokesmen of the Francisco Caraballo Group and the ELN [Army of  National Liberation] was scheduled for 1900 on 26 January,  assistants to the meeting and state security spokesmen have told  EL TIEMPO.    The meeting was held in building T-2, Zone 7, eastern  Havana,  and ended after 0100. It was attended by Ivan Marquez, Alfonso  Cano, and Alberto Gutierrez Bermudez on behalf of the FARC;  Leonel Pardo, on behalf of the Francisco Caraballo dissidents; a  labor leader and a rank and file church activist who identified  themselves as ELN spokesmen; and the controversial Colombian  bishop.    Marquez arrived in Cuba via Cancun accompanied by a man  surnamed Velasquez, who claimed he is a leader of the Zapatista  National Liberation Army [EZLN] in Mexico and one of the EZLN's  activists with close ties to the newspaper EL PREGON.    Moreover, Alfonso Cano had arrived in Havana on 25 January  aboard a Viasa, the Venezuelan airline, airplane. Several  witnesses saw him in the airplane, "but I do not know if he  boarded in Caracas or if he came in transit from Buenos Aires,"  one of them has said.    Gutierrez Bermudez, an FARC activist charged with  coordinating operations in the Magdalena Medio area, had arrived  in Cuba several weeks earlier, reportedly to organize the  meeting.    The labor leader and the rank and file church activist, who  later identified gvthemselves as ELN spokesmen and  representatives, left Santa Fe de Bogota on 22 January aboard a  Cubana de Aviacion flight.    The main topics reviewed during the meeting between the  prelate and the guerrilla spokesmen are well known by the  country: They reiterated the bilateral character of the  conflict, the need for a joint truce, and the need to sponsor  regional dialogues with the government.    Altogether, 31 Colombians--including Communist Party members  and spokesmen of labor unions and facade movements that are  charged with comprising the FARC and ELN urban intelligence  network--left for Havana.    They had been invited to participate, between 23 and 28  January, in the "Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Congress  for Our People's Solidarity, Sovereignty, Self-determination,  and Life."    The topics for the meeting were the situation in Latin  America; the popular forces' new tendencies for the construction  of new democratic alternatives; the foreign debt as an  instrument of infiltration and domination; the United States'  economic policy toward Latin America and the Caribbean; and new  forms of mechanisms for infiltration and domination, among  others.    Other topics included th lack of an effective democracy for  the peoples; U.S. policies on the threshold of the 21st century,  and hemispheric influence within its permanent goals of world  domination.    "This was a facade meeting, because it was actually a  Colombian guerrilla group summit and a prolongation of the Sao  Paulo Forum," a source has said.    According to other sources, the Sao Paulo meeting is a forum  that has been held four times (Quito, Santa Fe de Bogota, Sao  Paulo, and Havana), and it was always attended by spokesmen of  the most radical leftist organizations in Latin America. This  time the forum was used by the Colombian guerrilla groups to  identify themselves and distribute their manifestos.    "The Colombian participants' election was so secret each  person's passport was photocopied beforehand to guarantee an  adequate selection. We were not given a visa, only a special  invitation card so there would be no record in the passport,"  explained another source consulted by EL TIEMPO.    Another source has said: "Secrecy was necessary, because not  everyone who attended the Latin American meeting was elected to  participate in the private meetings."    "In fact, the bishop did not participate in the Latin  American meeting, only in the other meetings."    EL TIEMPO was able to learn two private meetings were held:  one, the summit held in Eastern Havana between spokesmen of the  Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board and the  church prelate. The other one was an extension of the Sao Paulo  forum.    The Sao Paulo forum was the main reason for the meeting,  aside from the summit.    The forum was held on Saturday and Sunday once the Latin  American meeting had concluded. The Colombian prelate was the  guest of honor and, according to the sources, Fidel Castro's  Government actively participated in it.    One of the sources has said: "It was an extension of the Sao  Paulo Forum. The Mexican surnamed Velasquez identified himself  as an EZLN activist, and the Peruvian whose surname is Castillo  said he was Shining Path's political organization secretary. [no  closing quotation mark as published]    "That is where the FARC leaders, the labor spokesman, and  the  rank and file church activist who claimed he was an ELN member  identified themselves."    Another participant revealed to EL TIEMPO yesterday  Gutierrez, Pardo, and the ELN activists were the ones who  distributed a pamphlet entitled "Political Declaration of Our  VII Summit: Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Board" once  the summit had ended.    What did the proclamation say? Signed by the FARC, the ELN,  and the Caraballo Group, the one-and-a-half page document read:  "The national security doctrine, an arrogant Presidency, and an  aggressive militarism still comprise the state's backbone with  the 1991 Constitution...."    "We state our solidarity with the heroical Cuban people in  their struggle against imperialism, their defense of socialism,  and the homeland's dignity...." (See annex)    Editor's note: EL TIEMPO tried many times yesterday to  contact the prelate who attended the meeting, but he could not  be located, so his name is omitted in this edition.</p>

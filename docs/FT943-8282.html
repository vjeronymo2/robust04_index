			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / British Rail's telephone inquiry bureaux criticised Train travellers are getting a 'deplorable and atrocious' service from British Rail's telephone inquiry bureaux, the Central Rail Users' Consultative Committee said yesterday. Some of the bureaux have come up with 'dreadful levels of accuracy' in the information given out, the passenger watchdog body said. BR acknowledged that the services were 'not meeting standards' and said talks were due to be held with the train-operating companies about improving performance.</p>

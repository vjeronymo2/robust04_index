			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has sent a  message to Russian President Yeltsin where he expresses hope for  the earliest solution of the Black Sea Fleet problem. As it has  become known to INTERFAX, in his message the Kravchuk expresses  regret over what he describes as the unconstructive stand taken  by the Russian delegation at the talks on the Black Sea Fleet  which took place in Sebastopol [Sevastopol] in April.    Kravchuk said about the need to divide the fleet in line  with  the Moscow understandings of 15 April (according to the  understandings Russia possesses 80 pct of the Fleet and Ukraine  -- 20 percent).    The Ukrainian President voiced the need to attach a special  status to the Marines.</p>

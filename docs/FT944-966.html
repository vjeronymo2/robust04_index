			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: BHP wins 7 per cent iron ore price rise Broken Hill Proprietary, one of Australia's biggest iron ore producers, has secured an average 7 per cent price rise for 1995-96 in the annual round of contract negotiations with Japanese steel mill buyers. This reverses the trend of declining prices seen in the previous three years, although the extent of the rise - which is calculated on a US dollar basis - is mitigated by the strengthening of the Australian dollar over the past 12 months. The annual contract negotiations between the Australian suppliers and the Japanese buyers play a key role in setting prices internationally. Australia is the world's fourth largest supplier of iron ore, after China, Brazil, and the former Soviet Union, while the Japanese steel mills source about half their raw material from the country. Iron ore is Australia's fifth largest export, earning around ADollars 3bn a year. The outcome of the latest round of negotiations, which began in Tokyo last month, was announced by BHP's iron ore division yesterday. It said a price of 21.15 US cents a dry long ton unit for Mt Newman fines, and 35.89 cents for Mt Newman lump ore, had been agreed, representing rises of 5.8 per cent and 7.9 per cent over current contract price. The differential between the prices for lump and fines was a record and reflected strong demand for lump ore, the company added. BHP described the settlement as 'satisfactory, given that the Japanese steel mills are in the early stages of a recovery to profitability after a harrowing recession'. The average 7 per cent rise is slightly bigger than analysts had forecast and BHP shares rose 22 cents to ADollars 19.48 on the news.</p>

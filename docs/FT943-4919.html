			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World News in Brief: Pope postpones visit to Sarajevo Pope John Paul postponed a visit to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo tomorrow after failing to receive security guarantees. Bosnian Serbs, whose forces surround Sarajevo, refused to provide assurances that Sarajevans who turned out to greet the Pope would be safe. They said Moslems would stage an incident and then blame the Serbs. Two United Nations aircraft were hit by small arms fire at the city's airport, where the papal aircraft would have landed.</p>

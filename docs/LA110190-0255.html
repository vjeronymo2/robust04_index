			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BREEDERS CROWN;  </P> <P> SCENIC REGAL NOT GOING BACK FOR SECONDS  </P> <P> Scenic Regal is a lady in waiting.  </P> <P> Friday night, she will try to become a queen of the sport she has served so  well when she attempts to win the Mare Trot, one of eight Breeders Crown  harness races contested at Pompano Park.  </P> <P> A victory would be the first for the 8-year-old mare after finishing second  three consecutive times in the race.  </P> <P> To accomplish that, she will have to beat eight rivals including the 4-year-old  Peace Corps, who won the 2-year-old Filly Trot in 1988 and the 3-year-old Filly  Trot last year. Only two horses have won three Breeders Crown races -- the mare  Grades Singing and the horse Mack Lobell, both trotters.  </P> <P> "This is just a perfect mare in all ways," said Harold Story, who drives Scenic  Regal for owner Dr. Terrance McGee, a veterinarian from Marlboro, Mass. "She  does absolutely nothing wrong, on the track or in the barn."  </P> <P> Scenic Regal has made 122 starts and has scored 68 wins, 23 seconds and eight  thirds, with earnings of $956,140. This year, she has eight wins, six seconds  and one third in 17 races.  </P> <P> Scenic Regal drew the No. 7 post. Peace Corps, who has raced this year in  Scandinavia and Europe, drew the No. 4 post.  </P> <P> While Peace Corps will try to do what only two others have done, Beach Towel  will try to make history in the 3-year-old Pace.  </P> <P> A victory or a second-place finish in the $366,933 race would make Beach Towel,  who has 17 wins and four seconds in 22 starts this year, the first harness  racehorse to win $2 million in one year.  </P></p>

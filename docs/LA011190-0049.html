			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER FIRED AFTER REPORT ON PROSTITUTE SETTLES SUIT;  </P> <P> POLICE: AN OFFICER SAID HIS RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED WHEN HE WAS DISCHARGED AFTER  REPORTING A CITY COUNCILMAN WAS SEEN WITH A PROSTITUTE.  </P> <P> A settlement has been reached between the city and a police officer who had  charged that his civil rights were violated when he was fired in 1987 after he  reported that a city councilman had been seen with a known prostitute.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was settled last Thursday as a federal jury was to begin hearing  the case.  </P> <P> Terms of the settlement were sealed by U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi,  and the parties in the case would not comment. The officer, Richard Rice,  previously had rejected a city offer of $50,000, saying he was seeking $100,000  in damages.  </P> <P> Rice filed the federal complaint in September, 1988, against the city of Bell  Gardens, City Manager Claude Booker, then-Assistant City Manager Maria Aguirre  and Police Chief William Donohoe.  </P> <P> Rice was placed on administrative leave, then fired, after he filed a police  report stating that an officer under his command saw a known prostitute get  into Councilman Roger McComas' motor home.  </P> <P> He was reinstated, with full back pay, in March, 1989, after a Superior Court  judge ruled that Rice had been improperly dismissed, and an appellate court  upheld the decision.  </P> <P> During the Superior Court hearing, Chief Donohoe said Rice was fired because he  lied in talking with the president of the local police union about the police  report on the councilman. The judge said, however, that there was no proof of  such a conversation.  </P> <P> When news reports of the McComas incident first were published, the councilman  called the report as a "big, made-up story."  </P> <P> McComas, who last spring became mayor of Bell Gardens, later acknowledged that  he picked up a known prostitute "for the heck of it," but said he did not  solicit or have sex with her, according to court documents.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office in May, 1987, decided not to prosecute McComas  for soliciting prostitution, saying there was not enough evidence.  </P> <P> The incident first was reported by Officer Joe Marquez, who said he saw a known  prostitute run up to McComas' motor home at a tavern on Eastern Avenue. The  woman, Marquez reported, opened the passenger door and climbed in.  </P> <P> After a trip around the block, Marquez reported, the motor home stopped again  just outside the bar, and the woman got out. Marquez then questioned the woman,  who told him the driver was a "regular customer" who used an alias, according  to the police report. The woman said the driver gave her money "not to tell the  police what we do or to mention the motor home," Marquez reported.  </P> <P> In an interview before the settlement, Rice said he believed he was entitled to  more than regaining his job, with back pay.  </P> <P> "I was unemployed for 12 months," Rice said "I had a lot of time to think about  this. There's been a lot of depression, anger and resentment at what people  tried to get away with. They seem to do what they want, when they want, and I  want to keep that from happening again."  </P></p>

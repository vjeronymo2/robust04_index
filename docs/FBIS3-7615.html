Jean Pierre Ngambi, secretary general of the Communist Party  of Cameroon, said on March 24 when he met the Korean ambassador  that the anti-socialist campaign of the United States must be  stopped, condemning the United States for totally reversing the  agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York  and leading the situation to the brink of a war.    Expressing the belief that the Korean people, firmly united  behind His Excellency Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of the  Korean People's Army, will win victory in confrontation with the  enemy under his wise guidance, the secretary general stressed  that the Communist Party of Cameroon would always support the  Workers' Party of Korea in its struggle for realising the  socialist cause and the reunification of the country.    Ali Hassan, general secretary of the Supreme Council of the  Nationalist Socialist Party of Syria in Lebanon, in a statement  on March 23 demanded that the unreasonable political plot of the  United States and its followers against Korea be stopped at once.    He appealed to all the people who love justice and peace to  wage a powerful solidarity movement for supporting the Korean  people in their struggle to defend socialism centering on the  popular masses.    A meeting of the presidium of the Central Executive  Committee  of the Federal Communist Party of Russia in a statement on March  25 extended full support and solidarity to the struggle of the  heroic Korean people united as firm as a rock around the  Workers' Party of Korea.</p>

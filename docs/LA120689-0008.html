			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWEATSHOPS IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> In our small town in the East, there were over 20 unionized clothing factories  from World War I to World War II.  </P> <P> In the '50s and '60s, clothing factories made up of primarily Chinese  immigrants started sweatshops in the section of Little Italy.  </P> <P> By the early 1970s, all these (unionized) factories were closed up because our  union manufacturers were having the work done in Chinatown.  </P> <P> Our union paid us no heed, and hundreds of other unionized factories went out  of business. The mediator whose office was in the union building ignored our  association's grievances, and 95% of the clothing factories in New York, New  Jersey and Pennsylvania had to close down. The New York Times would not print  our letters -- we could not get any answers, so we were forced out. We were  paying monthly dues to our association and a fee to the union.  </P> <P> Were the manufacturers paying off our association? You tell me. But hundreds of  us contractors had to close our doors. Nobody would listen to us and so we went  out of business and our operators went on the unemployment list.  </P> <P> BILL BERMAN  </P> <P> Camarillo  </P></p>

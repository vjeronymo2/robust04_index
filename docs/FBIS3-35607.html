Kazan Agrees To Nominate Its Candidates for  Parliamentary Election"]    [Text] Tatarstan leaders are ready to join in the election  campaign to elect the Federal Assembly. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has  learned that the collection of signatures to register President  Mintimer Shaymiyev and Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid  Mukhametshin as candidates in the elections for the Federation  Council was launched yesterday in the republic. If this is so,  the republic is in for a fierce struggle for seats at the  Russian parliament between the bureaucrats and the democrats.  Russian State Duma Deputy Ivan Grachev is intent on seizing one  more chance by running for the Federation Council.    This information has not been officially confirmed.  According to local observers, the silence is attributable to  the fact that the negotiating process between Kazan and Moscow,  which was resumed in January, has not yet reached the stage of  signing an interstate treaty and intergovernmental agreements.  According to Tatarstan Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov,  however, the republic's leaders expect the documents to be  signed before 13 February -- the deadline for completing the  registration of candidates. Once treaty protocols are approved  in Moscow, the Tatarstan president and parliamentary speaker  will definitely make an official announcement about their  joining the election campaign for seats in the Federal  Assembly's upper chamber. Then, observers note, one will be  able to state with certainty that the federal elections will  take place in the republic on 13 March and that State Duma seats  in all five one- mandate districts will be fiercely contested by  representatives of the local administration. Shaymiyev and  Mukhametshin will apparently be elected to the Federation  Council.    The bureaucrats' main rivals in the struggle for deputy  seats  will be representatives of the "Equality and Rule-of-Law"  electoral bloc, an association of Tatarstan's democratic forces.  Yesterday's meeting of its leadership approved nine candidates  whose election campaigns the bloc will support. Six of them  already contested the 12 December elections and won more votes  in their districts than any other candidates. Apparently, this  gives "Equality and Rule-of-Law" a chance to compete with the  republic's leaders for Russian parliamentary seats. Ivan  Grachev, for the time being the only State Duma deputy from  Tatarstan, elected on the "Yavlinskiy- Boldyrev-Lukin" ticket  and the bloc's chairman, will run for the upper chamber.    "We may lose to the nomenklatura, if more than 50 percent of  the voters turn out in electoral wards. But this would not suit  the republic's leadership, who keep saying that by ignoring  Russian elections the people prove the correctness of a course  chosen by Tatarstan," Grachev told KOMMERSANT-DAILY. Local  politicians, however, note that the bloc's chances are  diminishing because the democrats cannot put up a joint front in  the elections. Despite a decision by the bloc's leaders,  members of the Democratic Party of Russia's local branch and  representatives of other democratic movements are going to join  in the fray.</p>

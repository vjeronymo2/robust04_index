			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 75 (565) for </F> 19 April; compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and  edited by Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] President Nazarbayev intends early in May to submit  to parliament a message with an analysis of the economic  situation in the country and his proposals on the way out of the  crisis. He made the statement Tuesday at the opening of the  session of the new parliament elected on 7 March.    Addressing deputies, the president said that Kazakhstan has  for the first time a professional parliament. He expressed hope  that all branches of power would cooperate constructively.    Nazarbayev favored the need for further constitutional  transformations, including the restructuring of parliament into  a two-house one, granting it right to impeach the president and  granting the prime minister the right to dissolve the  legislature.    Earlier the head of state met a large group of deputies. The  president's spokesman, Nurlan Danenov, told Interfax that  deputies and the president have similar stands on many points.  Nazarbayev favored at the meeting the introduction of private  property and the equality by law of those nations living in the  Republic.    The institute of strategic studies under the president  published in an Alma-Ata [Almaty] newspaper an analytical  forecast of the future new parliament. It says that the  parliament may work before the presidential elections of 1996 or  more if pro-government deputies close their ranks, form a large  faction and will successfully confront the opposition.    Analysts believe that pro-government deputies ("People's  Unity of Kazakhstan" Union, leader--Nazarbayev, deputies elected  on the ticket offered by the president, and leader of bodies of  power) may agree to concessions to the opposition.    Presidential experts also forecast that if the  pro-government  faction is not formed, part of the deputies, if pressurized by  the opposition in adopting laws, may leave the parliament. If  so, a question could be raised about early elections.</p>

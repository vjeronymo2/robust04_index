			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOLVING PRENATAL CRISIS  </P> <P> In 1989, about 2,500 women in Orange County were turned away from prenatal  clinics because of overcrowding. Most hospitals and doctors in the county do  not even treat Medi-Cal patients. That leaves poor, pregnant women no place to  turn. They are left with only the dangerous option of going through their  pregnancy without care, and then showing up at some hospital's emergency room  when in labor.  </P> <P> Unless the deplorable situation is corrected, such conditions are bound to  cause health, social and economic problems for the mothers, their infants and  entire community. That fact was brought home again in the last few days in two  reports, one from the March of Dimes and the other released by the Orange  County Grand Jury.  </P> <P> The March of Dimes' six-month study, done by a UCLA researcher, predicted a  shortage of maternity beds that could, if not corrected, cause "severe  disruption" for the nine hospitals in the county contracting with Medi-Cal to  care for low-income patients, and for many other hospitals and for women from  all economic backgrounds.  </P> <P> The grand jury's report said the county was in a crisis over obstetrical care  for the poor, and it recommended that the county expand its prenatal service  clinics. The county should follow that advice. The Board of Supervisors has  been weak in its commitment to health care for the poor. The increased dangers  to mother and child of providing no prenatal care and added costs to the  community are well-documented.  </P> <P> The jury's report also urged the state to permit more obstetrics-only Medi-Cal  contracts, a change that a poll conducted by doctors in the county has  indicated would encourage more obstetricians to treat low-income pregnant  women. Nearly seven out of 10 obstetricians and about three out of every four  hospitals in Orange County now refuse to treat Medi-Cal patients. That is a  shameful statistic for the doctors and hospitals.  </P> <P> The obvious answer to the shortage of maternity beds is for hospitals to  provide more of them -- and for more doctors to commit themselves to more  deliveries, even if only one, two or three a month. Although the state made an  exception in granting its first obstetrics-only contract to AMI Medical Center  in Garden Grove (assuming it would become a full-service contract later), it  has, with understandable reason, been reluctant to sign more of them.  </P> <P> Although limited-care Medi-Cal agreements could provide a short-term solution  and help ease the pressure on some overloaded delivery rooms by spreading the  indigent patient load throughout the county, it has potentially serious  drawbacks. The creation of a medical menu of services for hospitals to pick and  choose from could, as the state fears, cause other hospitals to try to drop  their full-service indigent care. Another major shortcoming is that  limited-care arrangements do not address the basic issue of public underfunding  of medical services.  </P> <P> More doctors should be delivering more babies. But for that to happen, more  hospitals must agree to treat Medi-Cal patients. Medi-Cal must do more to ease  the delay and red tape in processing and make reimbursements more realistic for  hospitals, as already has been done for the obstetricians. Until that happens,  pregnant women will continue to face overcrowded delivery rooms and increasing  medical risks.  </P></p>

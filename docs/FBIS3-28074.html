We shouldn't approach  inter-Korean relations including the North Korean nuclear issue  in confrontational ways or regard them as a zero-sum game. We  have to look at Russia and China from a comprehensive viewpoint."    These are some of the points made by Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu on Tuesday when he presided over a conference of heads  of overseas South Korean missions. The remarks by Han, a former  political science professor and internationally noted columnist,  have attracted keen interest as he attempted to sum up problems  with South Korea's diplomacy and raised points for the diplomats  to reflect on. Han, who took over the diplomatic command post  with the inauguration of President Kim Yong-sam's administration  in February last year, was seen by many as issuing a warning  that the nation's diplomats must cast aside their mannerisms and  make a fresh start.    He said a lack of long-term vision, planning and  extemporaneousness, as well as rigidity and wild talking are  aspects that characterized past South Korean diplomacy. After  casting aside these characteristics, Han suggested the nation's  envoys should pursue practical, predictable, forward-looking,  self-confident and substantial diplomacy. Above all, Han  counselled his diplomats to stop pursuing confrontational  diplomacy with North Korea.    If there is one phrase that sums up South Korean diplomacy  other than "new diplomacy," he said, it has to be "practical  diplomacy."    Han noted that some are now saying it is the Chinese  president's turn to visit South Korea since former president No  Tae-u visited China in 1992. But under the "new diplomacy," Han  said, President Kim will visit China in March, without being  bound by protocol and formality. This, he explained, is  practical diplomacy.    The foreign minister then suggested "a diplomacy that can  anticipate the future," and "a flexible diplomacy" as desirable  directions after practical diplomacy.    Rather than panicking when an event unexpectedly takes  place,  Han urged the diplomats to carry out their work with mid- and  long-term prospects in mind so that the outcome can be  anticipated.    Han said there appears to be widespread misunderstanding of  the term "internationalization," which is becoming so popular  these days.    The belief that internationalization is needed only to  strengthen the country's economic competitiveness is not only  one-dimensional but also extremely myopic, he said.    In addition to short-term and practical purposes, the term  internationalization must be understood to mean Koreans' efforts  to establish a definite position in the world and pursue  spiritual and material well-being, Han said.    On North Korea and the unification problem, Han said, "we  have to realize that if North Korea managed to gain some benefit  from its negotiations on the nuclear issue, it would also be a  plus for us."    "We have to adopt this kind of idea as a premise for our  inter-Korean and unification diplomacy," he said.    The overriding consideration in South Korea's efforts to  help  resolve the North Korean nuclear issue has to be prevention of  the worst possible scenario, Han said, adding that South Korea  must adopt "a firm, yet flexible" attitude.    Han mentioned globalism, diversification,  multi-dimensionalism, regional cooperation and  future-orientation as the five fundamentals for the nation's  "new diplomacy."    "All these problems will become our problems in the near  future," Han said. "That is why we have to take a comprehensive  attitude toward them all."</p>

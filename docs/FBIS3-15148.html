In particular, according to the opposition, the  continuity of voting was broken. The Supreme Soviet also  infringed on the procedures by refusing to vote on an  alternative version of the draft law on the political system,  which was proposed by the opposition. "This attempt to  introduce presidential rule in Belarus in an illegal way cannot  be tolerated by us," stated the opposition deputies (40  persons). "It leads to a dictatorship." By the way, the  opposition did not participate [passage indistinct].    The former chairman of the Belarusian parliament, Stanislav  Shushkevich, called the roll-call voting procedure with regard  to constitutional articles a deception of the people.</p>

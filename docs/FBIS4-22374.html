			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Leyla Yunusova, chairman of the Azerbaijan </F> Society for Human Rights and Protection of the Law, by an  AZADLYG correspondent: "`We Will Defend The Rights Of Everyone,  No Matter What Their Political Views"]    [Text] As has been reported, the founding conference of the  Society for Human Rights and Protection of the Law in Azerbaijan  was held. Leyla Yunusova, chairman of the Azerbaijan Independent  Democrat Party, was elected chairman of the executive committee.  Our correspondent met with Leyla Yunusova and wanted to pose  some questions of interest to us.    [Correspondent] With what goals was the new organization you  represent established?    [Yunusova] Up to now, there has been no society occupied  with  defending the rights of citizens in Azerbaijan -- not during  Stalinism, voluntarism, or stagnation.    We tried to engage ourselves in preservation of the law in  the first stages of the democratic movement and the  national-liberation movement. We wanted to establish in the  initiative center of the APF [Azerbaijan People's Front] an  organization for the rule of law, and established a relationship  with the International Society for the Protection of the Rights  of Man [ISPRM]. At that time, Yusif Semedoghlu, the lawyer Fuad  Aghayev, Arzu khanym Abdullayeva, the painter Ehmed Rza and  myself were engaged in this work. After the tragedy of January  1990, Ferhad Zeynally, Arif Kheyrullayev, Ramiz Rzayev and  others made an effort to establish the ISPRM once again. In  August of that year Nadir Mehdiyev founded the Helsinki Group  for the Protection of Rights. Finally, in August 1992 the  Azerbaijan National Committee of the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly  [HCA] was created. At the end of all this, all other groups,  with the exception of the HCA, ceased activity. As for the HCA,  its activity consisted of collecting information about our  prisoners in Armenian captivity. Nevertheless, there were enough  problems connected with the defense of human rights in  Azerbaijan and, from this point of view, the establishment of a  public legal protection structure was necessary. Coming to our  duties, first, we have to lay the basis for a public  legal-defense organization which is removed from any kinds of  political interests. In the future, we hope to turn it into an  influential, multifaceted structure which preserves close ties  with the international legal protection movement. Our second  duty consists of educating the population, especially those  directly engaged in politics.    [Correspondent] You say that the organization will be a  public organization and will distance itself from political  influences. But you, yourself, and others in this organization  are actively involved in politics.    [Yunusova] You are right. But every single one of us can  defend his own political interests through the political  organizations to which we belong. We have selected these words  of Voltaire as our slogan in the public legal defense  organization: "It may be that my views are not in agreement with  yours, but I am ready to defend to the death the creation of  conditions for everyone to explain their own views."    These are certainly not empty words.    Organization members are preparing a list of prisoners. Not  all of the prisoners are those who are conducting the struggle  for the establishment of one, independent, democratic Azerbaijan.    But, in accordance with the UN's Declaration of Human  Rights,  we must defend everyone's rights, and think about the political  credo of individuals who need our defense.    The organization is certainly a young organization, but we  have presented our documents to the Justice Ministry for  registration; many people are coming to our organization, and  this shows how many of our countrymen are turned back from the  threshold of the structure of the state and need help and  protection. Unfortunately, for objective reasons we are unable  to succeed in resolving certain questions. Among our commissions  are: a commission for freedom of speech, for the legal defense  of citizens who have lost their jobs due to political beliefs,  economic freedom, and a commission on science and education. The  work of the first two commissions I mentioned is quite  satisfactory.    [Correspondent] Could you speak in some detail about the  work  of the commission on freedom of speech?    [Yunusova] The organization has established ties with a  number of international legal defense organizations. We  regularly send information to organizations like the Committee  for the Defense of Journalists, whose center is in the USA, and  the Foundation for the Defense of Glasnost of events violating  the freedom of the press in our republic and on the rights of  journalists.    In November and December an effort was made to make  political  censorship official. The Azerbaijan Press did not publish  opposition newspapers for two days following its subordination  to the Office of the President. The world reacted immediately to  this event: the USA State Department signed a declaration and,  as we know, international legal-defense organizations made  appeals to the republic leadership. Today, the world has  changed; now it is impossible to sign international acts on  human rights and trample on these rights behind an iron curtain.    In concrete terms, our commission has prepared a document on  interference by political censorship in every opposition  newspaper and a number of independent newspapers. This document,  which is in the nature of an accounting, has made it possible  for us to examine the dynamics of strengthening political  censorship against certain publishers at definite times.    On 15 February, we will hold a "roundtable" with the  participation of chief editors from the opposition press. It  will be devoted to a discussion of the situation in the  opposition press in 1994. Naturally, heads of other press organs  can also take part in this event.    In March, it is expected that representatives of two legal  defense organizations will come to our republic. It is also  planned that representatives from Helsinki Watch will go to the  battle zone. As for the goals of the delegations from Amnesty  International and the Denmark chapter of Helsinki Watch, they  are to familiarize themselves with issues of human rights of  freedom of speech here. We have already begun to prepare the  program for their journey.</p>

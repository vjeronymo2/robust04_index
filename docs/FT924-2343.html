			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Food: Beware of food book show-offs - Philippa Davenport selects the culinary gloss from the dross among this year's titles IN THE extravagant 1980s I lamented the trend for show-off cookbooks: oversized, over-illustrated and overpriced - featherweight material in heavyweight guise. Alas, the flood of ghastly volumes continues in the so-called caring 1990s. Probably the worst this year is The Tiffany Gourmet Cookbook (Doubleday Pounds 30). It is pure advertorial with menus for entertaining supplied by 'names', photographed in their properties, every one of them awash with Tiffany merchandise. Soft sell for the soft in the head. Recipes are relegated to the back of the book, hidden behind the green baize door so to speak, and useless to British cooks anyway. The first - and last  -I turned to called for 12 doves, cleaned, one-third of a stick of butter and a large Dutch oven. From the ridiculous to the sublime, the first book I would choose to buy or give as a present this Christmas is Maggie Black's Medieval Cookbook (British Museum Press, Pounds 14.99). Sumptuous and richly informative with recipes that work if you care to cook them, this is a model of how historical cookery books should be done. Christina Hardyment dips into more recent history in Home Comfort (Viking, Pounds 18.99). Her quest to establish exactly how our ancestors kept themselves clean, warm and well-fed explores kitchens, laundries, bakehouses, brewhouses, dairies, larders, stillrooms, dovecotes, fishponds and so on, tracing their histories and examining the ways they were managed and run. The background that this quiet sleuthing brings ('domestic archaeology' as the author calls it), makes visiting stately homes all the more rewarding. This book does not need colour illustrations and it has not got them. It is altogether a pleasing and unpretentious history of domestic arrangements. A nice little item I do not expect to find in the best seller list, is the book of the octopus, entitled 8 x 8 = 8 by Haris and Alexander Kalligas. It is quirky and delightful, just the thing for an erudite stocking filler. It costs Pounds 8.50 and can be obtained from Alsos Books, 14 Ashbridge Street, London NW8 8DM. Tel: 071-724-6774. Fax: 071-724-5294. Foreign cuisines continue to form a major part of many cookery lists. Italy is still the most popular country, but Spain is the new contender with champion supporters in Jose Maria Sevilla - about whose book and television series, Spain on a Plate, (BBC Books Pounds 14.95) I wrote earlier this year  -and Pepita Aris. The Spanishwoman's Kitchen (Cassell, Pounds 16.99) is the second in a series celebrating the relationship between food and landscape - The Frenchwoman's Kitchen by Brigitte Tilleray came first. The idea is that the author journeys through a country meeting the local women, eating and cooking with them, to take the true pulse of the regions. Aris is more painstaking than Tilleray, less fun in a way, but every bit as rewarding, if not more so. Aris's writing (and she writes at length) is vivid, but not purple, though she has an endearing weakness for exclamation marks. The recipes are detailed and easy to follow. This is a book to read now and take with you on self-catering holidays in Spain. Yan-kit So's Classic Food of China (Macmillan, Pounds 25) will, surely, become a classic itself and prove as successful as her first, prizewinning, book. I admire it but do not warm to it, alas. I recognise that this is my fault, not hers, but I seem quite unable to get to grips with cuisines rooted in a culture so different from the European one. Cooks less hidebound than me will rejoice. Our own islands feature strongly this year. In an Irish Country Kitchen by Clare Connery (Weidenfeld and Nicholson, Pounds 18.99) is not a book that sings with joy or bubbles with the personality of its author. The pictures are nostalgically pretty, the prose is plain, the information conscientious and carefully researched. This makes it sound dull, which it is not, but it is perhaps a little more staid than one would wish. The recipes are by the nature of the book not new but they are a sound collection and many of them are very appetising. This is an honourable record of traditional Irish cookery and successfully fills a gap in my kitchen library. Delicious Home Cooking by Caroline Conran (Marks &amp; Spencer, Pounds 14.99) is altogether more sparky. This is a recipe book full of familiar things (together with some less familiar things). Often Conran gives her own personal twists, but discreetly, so that the original character of the classic dishes is not spoiled. This is the sort of food I like most - to cook and to eat - and I shall use this book greedily. Pity about the large format and lavish photography. They may boost sales but . . . Colin Spencer is a staunch torchbearer for vegetarianism and against factory farming. Vegetable Pleasures (Fourth Estate, Pounds 9.99) is a selection of pieces written for his column in The Guardian during the past 12 years. Not being a reader of that newspaper, it is all new to me and I much enjoyed his outspoken, opinionated, often controversial and hilarious outpourings. I approve hugely of the fact that this book is a paperback original: a good read, good recipes and good value. But the most exciting recipes come in books from two young writers. First Annie Bell's dazzling Feast of Flavours (Bantam, Pounds 14.99) to which I devoted a column when it was published early in the year. It continues to enthrall. She is a truly original cook. Then there is Nigel Slater. He is not in the same class as Annie Bell but he has a strong feel for bright, breezy, contemporary, cosmopolitain style. High quality fresh ingredients are important to him and he is wisely wary of doing too much to them. The Marie Claire Cookbook (Hamlyn, Pounds 16.99) is a compilation of Slater's work for that magazine, with recipes spelled out in full and larger than life close-up photographs of the food, red hot from the oven or sizzling in the pan. Real Fast Food (Michael Joseph, Pounds 14.99) on the other hand, as the title implies, keeps a close eye on the clock and is suitably telegraphic. Snacks and supper dishes outnumber dinner party offerings. The pages are packed with recipe ideas rather than recipes proper, many of them not only very enticing in their own right but first rate for triggering ideas of one's own. This doubles the appeal, I reckon. Neither Slater's writing nor his cooking is laboured. There is liveliness, freshness and intelligence in all that he does. The Tenth Muse by Harry Luke (Rubicon Press, Pounds 12.95), first published in 1954 and revised and reprinted this year, is a delightful book and one that does not really fit into any particular category. Luke was a scholar, a keen traveller and a gourmet with an adventurous appetite. He was also a charming and witty man. This book is a potpourri of recipes and notes collected in the course of eating his way round the globe. Apart from the enormously varied recipes, there are some marvellous quotes, including a report from The Times in 1935 describing a royal dinner of roast cygnets. My favourite, in a final chapter on culinary don'ts, advises against cooking the sort of dinner which one of the guests, when asked how he had fared, described as follows: 'If the soup had been as hot as the claret, the claret as old as the bird, and the bird had had the breast of the parlourmaid, it would have been a damned good dinner'.</p>

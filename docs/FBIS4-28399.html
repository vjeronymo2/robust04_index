			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Danish Day has been observed in Hanoi and Ho Chi  Minh City. Together with the opening of the Danish Embassy in  Hanoi and the Danish General Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City, the  event opened up a new chapter in the Vietnam-Denmark relations.    The Danish minister of cooperation and development, Ms.  Helen  Degn, remarked that the tango has started. A high-level trade  delegation led by the minister herself visited Vietnam. She  bought with her a significant gift from Denmark: a long-term  development cooperation program for Vietnam. Under this  program, Denmark will give Vietnam a $100-million grant from  1994 to 1997. The money will be invested in the expansion of  Hoang Thach Cement Plant in its second stage, the upgrading of  La Nga Sugar Mill, the upgrading of the water supply system for  Dalat Town, research for the water supply system of Quang Ninh  Province, and for the waste treatment plan in Ho Chi Minh City.  Denmark also wiped $52 million off Vietnam's debt.    In 1992, the two-way trade turnover between the two  countries  was about $13 million. Last year the figure raised about $29  million, and increase of 116 percent. At present, the two  countries have signed an agreement on investment protection, and  an agreement on avoidance of double taxation is under  discussion. This will help promote trade and investment  activities between the two countries. In the past years, Denmark  was one of the European countries who had little economic  relations with Vietnam. Evidently, the tide has changed.  International observers state that Denmark was catching up with  other countries in relations with Vietnam, and now the tango has  started, it will continue.</p>

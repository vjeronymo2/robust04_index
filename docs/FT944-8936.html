			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sandvik surges to SKr2.46bn Sandvik, the Swedish cemented carbide and speciality steel group, doubled profits in the first nine months due to strong economic conditions in most markets. The figures, which jumped to SKr2.46bn (Dollars 339m) from SKr1.21bn, were helped by a lower depreciation charge and increased income from associate companies. The better-than-expected result, after an excellent third quarter, helped lift the group's B share by SKr5, or 4 per cent, to SKr127. Mr Clas Ake Hedstrom, chief executive, said demand in North America, Latin America and south-east Asia 'continued to be high' while 'order bookings in western Europe have picked up substantially following the turnround in Germany at the beginning of the year'. He expected continuing strong demand in the fourth quarter and higher full-year profits than 1993's SKr1.76bn. Demand has been driven by the recovery in the automotive sector and the chemical and energy sectors have improved, said Mr Gunnar Batelsson, group treasurer. He attributed the company's strong third quarter, when profits jumped to SKr986m from SKr245m, to demand and reduced holiday shutdowns at its main Swedish plant. The 1993 figures were hit by SKr200m in one-off costs. Underlying nine-month sales were 13 per cent higher at SKr18.09bn, while new orders surged 19 per cent to SKr19.7bn. The group's four main divisions all benefited from higher sales and earnings. High volumes and good productivity enabled the biggest unit, cemented carbide, to lift earnings sharply to SKr1.56bn from SKr935m on a 13 per cent jump in sales to SKr9.8bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Khamtai Siphandon, chairman of the Lao People's </F> Revolutionary Party Central Committee and prime minister of the  Lao People's Democratic Republic, delivered at a mass rally held  at the National Assembly Hall in Vientiane to mark the 45th  founding anniversary of the Lao People's Army -- live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Beloved comrades and friends,  45 years ago on 20 January 1949, in response to the aspirations  and the call of our national liberation cause, the Latsavong  unit was established under the direct leadership and command of  beloved and respected President Kaysone Phomvihan. That date was  the day of the merging of all scattered armed units set up in  all regions throughout the country into the Lao Itsala Army. The  event marked a major stage of growth and development for the  revolution. [passage omitted]    On the occasion of the historic founding anniversary of the  LPA, we would like to express our overwhelming affection and  gratitude toward the beloved and respected President Kaysone  Phomvihan for having organized, educated, maintained, and  provided leadership to our Army, thus enabling it to grow  stronger and bigger, into the state it is in now.    Beloved comrades and friends, looking back over the past 45  years, we can assume that the historic achievements and  victories of our Armed Forces have been accomplished thanks to  the correct and clear-sighted leadership of the LPRP. The party  has consistently organized, guided, and educated our Army. Our  party has creatively charted an overall military course for our  Army in conformity with the conditions in each period. It has  adopted a correct fighting strategy and a wise policy for the  Army. It has skillfully employed and combined various effective  forms of fighting together. Our party knows how to further  enhance all potentials in the country and to closely combine  them with the strength of the epoch. It has established a combat  alliance with the fraternal Vietnamese Army and people and has  solicited support and assistance from many friends and  progressive forces throughout the world, thus winning glorious  victories for our revolution. [passage omitted]    In recognition of the great achievements and virtues of our  Armed Forces, the party and state have decided to confer the  National Gold Order, which is the most honorable medal of our  nation, on the LPA for the second time on the occasion of its  45th founding anniversary. [Applause] [passage omitted]    On the occasion of the anniversary of this historic day,  once  again, on behalf of the party and state as well as the Lao Armed  Forces and people, I would like to express our profound  gratitude to all friendly and fraternal countries for rendering  effective and great assistance to the Lao Armed Forces and  people and actively contributing to their national liberation  struggle [in the past] and the tasks of national defense and  development at present. [Applause]    The multiethnic Lao people will always remember and are  grateful to the Vietnamese cadres, volunteer combatants, and  specialists and other internationalist combatants for making  sacrifices to the Lao revolution. The virtuous deeds of these  comrades will be recorded in the annals of the Lao nation  forever. [Applause]    Comrades and friends, our nation is firmly marching forward  toward its destination by carrying out comprehensive  restructuring. On the path of our advancement, we are blessed  with numerous opportunities and favorable conditions.  Nonetheless, we have also encountered numerous difficulties and  trials. At present, even though a trend toward peace, stability,  cooperation, and development is emerging, the situation still  remains complicated and confused.    Under these circumstances, our party and government must  continue adhering to and pursuing a foreign policy of peace,  independence, friendship, and cooperation, aimed at maintaining  and further developing normal relations with all countries  throughout the world -- and with neighboring countries first --  on the basis of respect for each other's independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity, noninterference in each  other's internal affairs, equality, mutual benefits, and  peaceful coexistence. We will continue, together with other  peoples of the world, making contributions to the cause of peace  and development.    To create favorable conditions for national development, we  must make and concentrate all efforts on safeguarding our  national security, stability, and tranquility. This is the duty  which must be firmly grasped and entered into by everyone with a  sense of responsibility. First of all, all party and  administrative committees, organizations and services from the  center down to all localities must increase their sense of  responsibility toward the tasks of national defense and public  security maintenance work, linking them with all spheres of work  and closely associating them with the socioeconomic development  of our country. At the same time, we must pay attention to  assisting and building the Armed Forces into a more powerful and  effective force for defending and preserving forever the  revolutionary fruits reaped with great sacrifices by our people.    The party and command committees at all levels must make  efforts to educate and train cadres and combatants in the Armed  Forces to continue multiplying and increasing the glorious  traditions of the LPA and our nation and enhance the tradition  of patriotism and their faith toward the country and party; to  actively study and firmly grasp the party's restructuring policy  and the state's policies and laws and to act as a model in  implementing them; and to heighten a sense of vigilance and to  stand ready to thwart all sinister designs of the enemies,  thereby securely safeguarding the country's independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity and firmly ensuring its  stability and tranquility. Efforts must be made to consolidate  and strengthen the Armed Forces by raising their quality as a  primary objective so as to gradually make them into a well-  organized, strong, and modern revolutionary army.    In the immediate future, efforts must be made to raise the  level of their capabilities in leading, commanding, and  maintaining combat preparedness; to encourage them to engage in  studies to raise the level of their culture and specialized  knowledge; to engage in training in both the tactical and  strategic fields; to increase unity between cadres and  combatants; to constantly improve the relations between the  Armed Forces and people; to closely look after the party; to  heighten a sense of self-dependence and self-building; and to  act as a model in working diligently and living frugally. At the  same time, we must enhance their actual roles and capabilities  in making contributions to the socioeconomic development of the  country, for example in the agricultural field, in building the  economic and cultural infrastructure, and in providing public  services.

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Commerzbank up 14.7% on brisk credit demand COMMERZBANK, the smallest of Germany's big three banks and the first to announce its figures for the first half of the year, yesterday reported group profits - excluding securities trading results - up 14.7 per cent to DM875m (Dollars 593.6m) to the end of June. The bank said demand for credit from its domestic customers had been 'persistently brisk' during the six months and total lending volume rose by 2.4 per cent to DM161.7bn. Taking into account trading profits, total group profits were up 17.5 per cent to DM975m. Reflecting a slight improvement in the interest rate margin, to 1.94 per cent across the group, net interest earnings rose by 12.3 per cent to DM2.2bn. Because of a weaker trend in securities transactions, net commission income fell by 2.2 per cent to DM633m. Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief executive, warned that because of generally difficult economic conditions the bank would probably have to make provisions for individual loan losses. The effect of this would be countered by extraordinary profits, chiefly via share disposals, he said. Commerzbank has a large exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the ailing Canadian property developer. It totals about DM560m, but Mr Kohlhaussen said yesterday he felt the bank was unlikely to lose any money as a result. He cited the bank's particularly good security, but also said he was heartened by a recent visit to the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands. Mr Kohlhaussen gave no clue as to when the bank would hold its rights issue, and sought to dampen speculation that it was discussing concrete proposals for a share swap and co-operation agreement with Paribas of France.</p>

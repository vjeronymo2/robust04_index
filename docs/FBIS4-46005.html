			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by D.S. Raizada] </F>   [Text] India's missile program is primarily intended for  defense of country's freedom, especially in light of the  countries having missiles that can carry both nuclear and  nonnuclear warheads surrounding India. As a sovereign country,  surely India, like any other country, has the right to defend  its freedom and territorial integrity. India was forced to  develop missiles when it saw that both Pakistan and China, as  well as a number of West Asian countries, are having missiles  and missile technology either indigenously developed or  clandestinely or openly imported from the Western world.    During his recent visit to the United States, the Indian  prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has in a very polite but  firm way explained that those who advise others must practice a  similar advice themselves. India had been in favor of  elimination of all weapons of mass destruction and had been  advocating at all international forums the need to keep the  world free from nuclear and chemical weapons. But India cannot  close its eyes to the latest weaponry available with its  immediate neighbors that exposes all its cities to the target of  the missile.    Of all the countries, America, [which] has been carrying  relentless campaign against India's missile program, knows fully  well that both Pakistan and China not only have technology, but  also have deployed missiles around India. The talk of South  Asia to be kept away from all missiles becomes fruitless without  capping Chinese missile program and arsenal and without keeping  Indian Ocean free of missiles deployed by the United States  under one cover or the other. The U.S. ambassador designate to  India, Mr. Frank Wisner, told the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee last Tuesday [24 May] that United States hoped that  India would consider very carefully before deploying short-range  Prithvi missile. In a rather one go, he said the United States  continues to argue in a reasoned manner with India about the  consequences of missile deployment.    Supplying F-16's to Pakistan for carrying nuclear weapons on  one side and dealing with China with a different tone while  threatening India to scuttle its missile and space technology  program does not speak the language of a friend. Whether  America likes Prithvi or not, India need not bother. What India  has to see is its own security perceptions. No arrangement for  preventing the danger of nuclear weapons in South Asia without  including China would even work as India's concern about Chinese  nuclear weapons is not without justification, which Mr. Wisner  has himself admitted.    The double standards of Clinton administration with regard  to  the deployment of ballistic missiles especially when China is  busy in the modernization of its Armed Forces and Pakistan is  deploying Hatf and M-11 missiles is not what is expected from  the United States. One wonders why the U.S. did not object when  Saudi Arabia deployed its short-range missiles during the Gulf  War, nor did it get up in arms when Chinese M-11 missiles were  sent to Pakistan. India also cannot afford to forget the threat  wielded by America in 1971 when the U.S. had moved its Seventh  Fleet carrying nuclear weapons in the Bay of Bengal.    Before leaving for the U.S. early this month, the prime  minister assured the nation that neither the usual trials nor  deployment of Prithvi missile would be derailed whatever U.S.  may desire. The statement of the U.S. ambassador designate to  India at the congressional confirmation hearing, [which] is  virtually a sort of warning to India of the likely consequences  should the Prithvi be deployed, appears not to have impressed  policy makers in India. Because whatever may be the U.S. stand,  India has its own security perceptions and would naturally be  guided by its own stand rather than by that of the U.S. India  situated in a missile-proliferated environment and its defense  forces, both Army and Air Force, has been looking forward to  match the arsenals of the neighbors so that it can defend itself  in case of any exigency. Indeed, the Indian [word indistinct]  statement just prior to prime minister's U.S. visit left nothing  for imagination. For, the billions of dollars flowed from U.S.  to India or not, India must have its prestige intact and not  allow any country to interfere in its internal affairs. Prithvi  must be tested and the work of Agni resumed. P.V. [Narasimha  Rao] assured its people that India is sovereign in taking  decisions and India will not compromise with its self-esteem and  security concerns.</p>

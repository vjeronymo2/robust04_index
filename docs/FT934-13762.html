			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hammerson share vote changes HAMMERSON, the inter-national property investment company which is in the hands of new management, yesterday revealed terms of its offer to reform its two-tier voting structure. Proposals for the equalisation of votes between the ordinary shares and the limited voting A ordinary shares include the provision to existing ordinary shareholders of 2 new shares for every 19 held to compensate for the elimination of their superior voting rights. The compensatory scrip will result in the allotment of 5.6m new shares, representing about 2.23 per cent of the enlarged share capital. The proposals, which were foreshadowed by the group when it launched its Pounds 200m rights issue in May and which are subject to shareholders' approval at a meeting on November 11, were immediately welcomed in the City. Standard Life, which is a large holder of both classes of stock and was consulted over the proposals, said it considered the terms 'quite acceptable' and expressed the hope that other shareholders would also find them attractive. Like many other institutional investors, Standard Life is strongly in favour in the principle of enfranchisement. Hammerson's ordinary shares closed 14p higher at 413p while the A shares gained 5p to close at 374p. Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, said the enfranchisement proposals were designed to bring the company's share structure into line with most other listed companies. 'As a result, the marketability and appeal of the company's shares should increase to the benefit of all shareholders,' he said. Hammerson pointed out that in setting the terms of the compensatory scrip issue it had taken into account the market price of the two classes of shares. Over the past 12 months the premium commanded by the ordinary shares over the A shares had ranged from 4.7 per cent to 11.3 per cent and was 8.1 per cent on Monday. The proposals are among a package of measures introduced since Mr Ronald Spinney joined the group as chief executive in May.</p>

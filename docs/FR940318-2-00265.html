(Thomas) of High Point, North Carolina determined that some of its buses failed to comply with the requirements of 49 CFR 571.131, ``School Bus Pedestrian Safety Devices,'' Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 131, and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Thomas also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of receipt of the petition was published on November 15, 1993, and an opportunity afforded for comment (58 FR 60240). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph S5.5 of FMVSS No. 131 requires that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]he stop signal arm shall be automatically extended. *&blank;*&blank;* at a minimum whenever the red signal lamps *&blank;*&blank;* are activated; except that a device may be installed that prevents the automatic extension of a stop signal arm *&blank;*&blank;*. While the device is activated, a continuous or intermittent signal audible to the driver shall sound. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Between September 2, 1992, and July 30, 1993, Thomas produced 305 Type A, B, C, and D school buses which were not equipped with a continuous or intermittent signal audible to the driver when the device is activated that prevents the automatic extension of a stop signal. Thus, these school buses do not comply with the standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thomas supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Delivery of the noncomplying vehicles has been limited to one state, Virginia. That state has had a stop arm requirement since the early 1980's and has required an interrupt switch, wired to the stop arm and crossing gate, since approximately 1986. Drivers use that switch only when the vehicle is loading or unloading passengers in the school yard so that buses can be positioned close together without damaging the crossing gate (emphasis original). Bus drivers in Virginia have been accustomed to activating the interrupt switch without an audible signal since the signal was not required prior to the September 2, 1992 (sic) effective date of FMVSS 131. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, Thomas stated in its Defect and Noncompliance Report that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> All vehicles will be repaired through customer notification by the Thomas distributor in Virginia. Repair parts will be supplied at no charge. The repair will consist of installing a chime, adding a wire to the existing wire harness, and connecting the wire to the chime. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No comments were received on the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA contacted Thomas for a clarification of this statement, and received a letter from Thomas that stated that a repair kit had been provided to all owners of the affected buses. This was accomplished through its dealer, Sonny Merryman, Inc. (Merryman), in Rustburg, Va. The letter that Merryman sent owners offered to reimburse owners who performed their own repair. Because the effect of an inconsequentiality determination is to excuse notification and remedy of noncompliance, and because the acts of Thomas amounted to notification and remedy as contemplated by statute, NHTSA has determined that the petition has been mooted by the actions of the petitioner, and no further action is required with respect to it. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  15 U.S.C. 1417; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 49 CFR 501.8. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on March 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barry Felrice, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Associate Administrator for Rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6378 Filed 3&hyph;17&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe left our  country this morning for Dakar, the Senegalese capital.    The foreign minister arrived here yesterday afternoon and  was  received by the president of the Republic with whom he mostly  discussed post- devaluation issues and the regional conflicts in  Africa. During the news conference he gave last night after his  meeting with Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan, Mr. Juppe  expressed satisfaction at the post-Houphouet-Boigny political  situation and the strengthening of the friendly ties of  cooperation between France and Cote d'Ivoire. To this end, he  disclosed the imminent visits of President Bedie to Paris and  French Prime Minister Balladur to Cote d'Ivoire. On the  post-devaluation situation, the French foreign minister  expressed confidence in the actions undertaken by our country to  deal with it. On Rwanda, Mr. Juppe expressed satisfaction at  the political support France has just obtained from Cote  d'Ivoire in its quest to bring the civil war in that country to  an end. [passage omitted] Yesterday, after his audience with  the prime minister, preceded by the one granted him by the  president of the Republic, Mr. Juppe spoke to our correspondent  Pierre Adipo. Let us listen to him.    [Begin Juppe recording] First, I would like to thank the  prime minister for devoting some of his time to me, despite his  heavy schedule. In coming to Abidjan, you know it is my first  official trip to francophone Africa, I wanted to demonstrate all  the importance we attach to what happens in this country. The  success of the economic reforms under way in the whole region  will be staked here, and after this first series of meetings I  must say that I am confident about the future. Courageous  measures have been taken, they are being applied with a lot of  determination, and the initial results are emerging. This is  what I was discussing with the prime minister, but, of course,  we also discussed cooperation between France and Cote d'Ivoire.  You know that your country can count on my country's  friendship. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Torn in the USA: Americans are asking if Clinton has a map to guide him through a complex, post-cold war world If a day in government is a long time, a week can seem an eternity. Rarely has one seen so many twists and turns as the last seven days, with President Bill Clinton first put on the rack for foreign policy mismanagement in Somalia and Haiti, then momentarily freed from it by his own verbal counter-attack and the release of the downed US pilot in Mogadishu, only to be defied again by the murder in Port-au-Prince of the justice minister just hours after he had warned that the safety of Haitian democrats was a matter of great concern to the US. A torrent of commentary has swirled around him and, if not all has been negative, the great bulk has questioned whether this president and his administration have any form of road map to guide their path through a complex and dangerous post-cold war world. This time, significantly, it has not only been the predictable congressional blowhards, instant screaming TV pundits and displaced Republican foreign policy experts who have been tearing into Mr Clinton for the problems in Somalia, Haiti and, if now to a much lesser extent, Bosnia. Senator Mr Richard Lugar, the Republican from Indiana, is invariably the soul of moderation, a firm believer in a bipartisan foreign policy. Yet this week he vented his complaints about the lack of consultation with the executive branch to the New York Times with uncharacteristic public venom. 'The roof has fallen in,' he declared. 'There is no significant congressional support for the president's policy in any of the three countries, and it's his own fault. A few people have stood beside him . . . but they are doing it solely out of loyalty to the constitution and the role of commander-in-chief.' David Broder, whose political columns in the Washington Post are normally restrained, took dead aim this week at the foreign policy team. To the public, he wrote, Warren Christopher, secretary of state, was 'a cautious corporate lawyer', Tony Lake, national security adviser, 'a bookish academic' and Les Aspin, secretary of defence, 'a garrulous brainstormer given to hypothetical musings'. 'All three of them seem to indulge, if not encourage, Clinton's penchant for talking issues to death . . . None of them has come close to achieving a degree of public confidence that would buttress the shaky trust in Clinton's management of international affairs.' He thought Mr David Gergen, the presidential counsellor who has worked wonders on the domestic side, should 'remind Clinton that there are Republicans who know their way around the world'. The 'ouch' could be heard around Washington. Yet the president has had his supporters, some from unlikely quarters. President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea wrote in the Washington Post that Mr Clinton had taken the 'responsible and courageous decision' on Somalia. He may not carry much weight in Washington, but Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, does and he has tempered his frequently biting criticism to help beat back congressional attempts to force an earlier withdrawal from Somalia. Some of the more thoughtful columnists, from Mr Clinton's own generation, have sympathised with his dilemmas and condemned the opportunism of his critics, especially the old interventionists. Michael Kinsley's syndicated column concluded that it was 'arguable and tempting' both that the US should continue to lead the world and that it should retreat from it. 'What is demeaning and harmful is the widespread belief that we can have it both ways.' E J Dionne of the Washington Post commended the economic emphasis in the Clinton foreign policy and urged him to make the connections to domestic well-being more clearly. 'It ought not to be surprising that after 50 years of engagement many Americans think that the country's priorities should be turned inwards.' Precisely for this reason Mr Clinton had been enjoying some of the best weeks of his presidency, with approval ratings back up over 50 per cent on the strength of his expositions on healthcare reform and the North American Free Trade Agreement (a battle not yet lost by any means) and a general sense that was getting on top of his job. A North Carolina speech on Monday, which did get lost in the foreign policy tumult, saw the president at his more effectively philosophical as he spoke of the need for personal, economic and community security during times of change. But the outside world does not go away, and there is concern that this progress should not be derailed by external 'crises' reflecting badly on the president's competence. This wired world, with CNN's ubiquitous cameras, demands instant responses from government and its opposition, but it also encourages an ephemeral attention span. This week's dramas may also be next week's history. Yet the latest passage of events has been instructive in the light it sheds on the way this administration operates in foreign affairs. Its vaunted collegiality did not prevent a serious disagreement between the state and defence departments over the safety of the aborted Haitian mission, and it still relies to a remarkable degree on the intervention of Mr Clinton to win hearts and minds and take action. Mr Christopher and Mr Aspin, for example, failed lamentably last week in their joint attempt to persuade congressional leaders that the US knew what it was about in Somalia. It took the president to set matters straight the following day, while this week the articulation of policy has been left almost exclusively, if understandably, to him. No wonder he sometimes wistfully comments on the time he devotes to foreign affairs. The Washington knives have been out for Mr Christopher since January, first on the grounds that he was no conceptual global thinker and then for failing to get the European allies to intervene more forcefully in Bosnia. Now he stands accused of a lack of concern for the safety of US troops in Haiti and inattention to Somalia, where he is said to have underestimated the apparent obsession of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, to nail General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali faction leader. As it is, relations with Mr Boutros Ghali, additionally miffed that US special envoy Mr Robert Oakley's diplomatic mission is not under UN direction, are severely strained. Yet there is no reason to suppose that Mr Clinton has lost confidence in his secretary of state, nor in Mr Aspin or Mr Lake. Indeed the president stoutly defended Mr Aspin's decision not to send additional weaponry to Mogadishu before the disastrous firefight two weeks ago that cost 17 American lives. If Mr Clinton's comments on foreign affairs do not always reflect the passion he can impart on domestic issues, there was no doubt of its presence this week. The heat has been turned down on General Aideed, up on the Haitian military, and is lukewarm towards US involvement in UN peacekeeping, unless the terms (US military command and a commitment to political engagement, as in Cambodia) are right. And if his critics could not see the consistency in this and thought he was 'naive', then they failed to understand that 'we are living in a new and different world' and that he had made 'a pretty good beginning on the things that affect us most'. As the sportswriters say here, the best offence is a good defence, and Mr Clinton, at the end of a difficult week, at least managed to launch that.</p>

The two countries have agreed to set up an  India-Germany joint mechanism to monitor progress in scientific  cooperation. An official spokesman summing up the prime  minister's visit to Bonn said both the countries have also  agreed to review the avoidance of double taxation treaty and  pursue efforts to sign bilateral investment guarantees. Our  correspondent Sudarshnam reports from Bonn:    [Begin Sudarshnam recording] The Federation of German  Industry and India-German Chamber of Commerce have sent 54  proposals to intensify the economic relationship between the two  countries. These relate to general and financial issues,  pharmaceuticals and chemical industries, private sector and air  traffic. As many as 40 ministries and departments in India  examined these proposals. Several of these have been  implemented. Decision in respect of some are awaited. [end  recording]    In another development, leading political parties of Germany  have assured India that the New Asia concept initiated by  Chancellor Helmut Kohl making India as a target country for  intensified bilateral cooperation will be honored whichever  party comes to power in this year's German elections. The  assurance was conveyed to the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha  Rao, when important German political leaders called on him in  Bonn yesterday. An official spokesman said that there is a  multiparty support to Chancellor Kohl's New Asia concept, as  Germany has willingly recognized that Japan, China and India in  Asia will be important political and economic powers in the  years to come. The chief of the German Agency for Aid has  shown his willingness to open a second window for soft credit to  finance infrastructure projects in India. The projects include  power and telecommunications sector. Meanwhile, the minister  of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, who is  accompanying the prime minister, has reiterated India's  willingness to improve bilateral relations with Pakistan. He  made it clear that Islamabad has no locus standi in Kashmir, and  it is not in a position to advise India in this matter. The  minister said India has no problems regarding protection of  human rights, and it is always ready to be open with  international human rights organizations.    As reported, the prime minister is leaving for Berlin today.  He will meet the German president and address the Humboldt  University. Mr. Narasimha Rao is also scheduled to have meeting  with German business leaders and inaugurate the Indian Cultural  Center in Berlin. On Sunday [6 February], Mr. Narasimha Rao is  returning home. Our correspondent Karuppaswamy reports that his  meeting with German indologists and business leaders will be  continuation of his earlier exprience in Bonn to reassure  Germans that the reform process in India is irreversible. The  visit of the prime minister is the first official visit from  India to the reunited Berlin -- the upcoming capital of the  united Germany.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / The European Market: German construction companies prepare for rebuilding of the east - Best growth prospects are beyond W Europe ACQUISITIONS in western Europe no longer feature on Bilfinger + Berger's list of priorities, Mr Christian Roth, chairman, said this month. That side of the business - and the continent - is adequately covered already. B+B, Germany's third largest construction company, recently tied up a collaboration package with France's Fougerolle, completing a round of strategic deals which have covered most of the gaps in the Community market. Philipp Holzmann, market leader with DM11bn (Pounds 3.7bn) sales, is in a similar position, It has, for example, a 30 per cent stake in Britain's Tilbury Douglas and control of Nord-France. For the present, most attention is focused on long-term prospects in the east rather than on the slender short-term possibilities of the looming EC single market. As Mr Hermann Becker, Holzmann's chairman and leader of the HDB industry association, pointed out last month, the Community construction market is in a rut. Growth can be expected this year only in Germany and, thanks to government-funded infrastructural work, Portugal. While total EC investment in building this year is expected to stick at about DM1,300bn, commercial construction will be down more than 5 per cent and member states' budget restrictions have in effect stopped growth in public works. New EC housing output is forecast to fall 0.5 per cent, and the only consolation lies in an expected 2.4 per cent rise in the market for apartment and house refurbishment. While German builders talk of 'stagnation' this year, they are careful to point out that the plateau on which they find themselves stands far above the business landscape in neighbouring community countries. They have shared handsomely in the boom which has carried German industry upwards since the late 1980s. Latest figures for B+B, for example, showed a further 20 per cent increase in sales and a 38 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for 1991. Holzmann's turnover rose 18 per cent. Holzmann's profits performance, which is not yet available, is unlikely to be quite so strong because the group depends on markets abroad for 47 per cent of its business, compared with B+B's 36 per cent. Now, while other German industries are mourning the demise of the post-unification boom - demand for cars and other consumer goods is tailing off in the former GDR - builders are starting to enjoy properly the benefits of rebuilding eastern Germany from the drains upwards. New estimates say there is DM2,000bn-worth of work to be done before eastern housing, factories, roads, railways and environmental services match those in the west. Political necessity, according to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, demands that it is done quickly to prevent westwards migration, or even social unrest. Despite the presence of foreign companies such as RMC and Tarmac, German builders have the market pretty much to themselves. As public spending is squeezed in the west of the country and all available funds are transferred to the five new states, so the construction industry refocuses its attention - Philipp Holzmann alone has bought 40 east German companies in the past two years - and looks beyond to the underdeveloped infrastructures in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Politicians talk of future EC membership for them, but German builders, working closely with industry and governments in Warsaw and Prague, have already redrawn the maps. They show pencilled-in lines criss-crossing Czechoslovakia and Poland, delineating projects, including all new road and rail connections sweeping from Frankfurt an der Oder to Warsaw and beyond. New stretches of rail will connect Stuttgart directly with the Polish capital, passing through Prague and Wroclaw. Germany's expectations are as high as the planned links are long. Starting with the advantages of geographical position and cultural and linguistic links, the building industry has moved speedily to implant itself in new markets where the domestic competition is still inexperienced, suffering from lack of up-to-date know-how and relatively thin on the ground. Of the 11 joint ventures in building materials and construction established in Czechoslovakia last year, seven were initiated by west German concerns. Foreign investors, again led by Germany, spent Koruna26bn (Pounds 500m) in the first wave of privatisations in the sector. All they need now is the forecast upswing in the market. The signs of recovery - estimated growth of 3 or 4 per cent this year following a 30 per cent nosedive in 1991 - are already there. Meanwhile, thousands of Czechoslovakia's skilled building workers are being kept occupied and trained in the German way among the 55,000 east Europeans currently employed on the federal republic's unique pilot project: rebuilding the former GDR.  ----------------------------------------------------------         EC: REAL CHANGE IN CONSTRUCTION INVESTMENT:                     YEAR ON YEAR (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------                                 1990     1991     1992 Germany                         +4.1     +1.8     +3.5 W Germany                       +5.3     +4.1     +1.5 E Germany                       -3.9    -14.0      +17 France                          +2.5     +0.9     -0.2 UK                              +0.8    -10.5     -3.6 Italy                           +2.4     +0.1     -0.4 Spain                           +9.0     +4.0     -1.0 Netherlands                     +1.4     -0.4     -5.7 Belgium                         +7.0     +2.0     -0.6 Denmark                         -3.6     -7.7     -2.0 Portugal                        +5.0     +4.5     +4.0 EC Total                        +3.5     -0.7     -0.1  ---------------------------------------------------------- Source: HDB industry association  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

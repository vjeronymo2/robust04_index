			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Profits drop by 33% at Rustenburg Platinum RUSTENBURG Platinum, the world's largest platinum producer, yesterday unveiled a 33 per cent fall in attributable profits for the year to June, due to lower metal prices, particularly for Rhodium. Sales of the South African company fell 15 per cent to R2.9bn (Dollars 1.05bn) from R3.43bn in 1991. Income from platinum fell by 9.9 per cent, largely because of the lower metal prices. The average price for the year received by Rustenburg and its smaller sister mine, Lebowa Platinum, was Dollars 363 an ounce compared with Dollars 428 in 1991. This was partially offset by a more favourable exchange rate. Income from by-products, principally rhodium, fell 19.3 per cent due to a lower rhodium price - Dollars 2,684 an ounce in 1992 compared with Dollars 4,601. Profit on metal sales fell 32.5 per cent to R928.9m from R1.38bn. Other income dropped to R90.7m from R143.1m, mainly because of lower cash holdings following a rights issue and a special dividend by the developing PPRust platinum project. The tax and lease charge was well down leaving distributable profits 33.4 per cent lower at R402.3m against R604m. The dividend was cut by a similar margin to 230 cents a share from 350 cents.</p>

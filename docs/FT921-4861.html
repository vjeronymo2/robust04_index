			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Confidence on a wing and a prayer in current turbulence - Rolls-Royce's long-term approach THE LOSSES incurred in its core aero-engine business last year did not appear to dampen Rolls-Royce spirits yesterday. Indeed Sir Ralph Robins, chief executive and deputy chairman, said the company was plugging on with its long-term strategy of expanding the range of its commercial jet engines, coping with the reduction in the defence market, and broadening the group's operations in other industrial power sectors to reduce dependence on the aerospace market. Both Sir Ralph and Lord Tombs, chairman, made it abundantly clear that Rolls-Royce was not seeking any strategic alliance with either General Electric (GE) and Pratt &amp; Whitney, its two principal US competitors. Instead, the UK company was determined to 'go it alone' and to continue broadening its market base to secure a 30 per cent share of the commercial jet engine market by the mid-1990s. Rolls-Royce, like other aerospace companies, suffered last year from the combined effects of the post-Cold War decline in military business and the slump in civil aviation. Short-term prospects remain uncertain. Sir Ralph conceded yesterday that there was little chance this year of a recovery in civil aero-engine spares business which has traditionally been a significant source of profits for aircraft engine manufacturers. However, the company believes it is now in a better position than in the past to take advantage of a recovery in the commercial aircraft business because of its expanded range of civil engines. This is reflected in its order book which has grown from Pounds 2.8bn in 1987, when the company was privatised, to Pounds 6.6bn last year. It has also taken vigorous action to reduce costs with 7,000 job cuts last year and plans for a further 3,000 job reductions this year. The company's broader civil engine product line has helped Rolls-Royce increase its share of both the US and Asia-Pacific commercial engine markets. The company is expected to win soon a big engine order from Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline, and is also competing for a big engine order from Japan Air Lines and Korean Air. However, its weakness remains in Europe, where it has failed so far to make any significant market inroads with big continental European carriers, apart from British Airways. The company is still smarting from last year's loss of BA's engine order for the UK carrier's fleet of Boeing 777 widebodies which went to GE. Lord Tombs expects that the recent aero-engine joint venture Rolls-Royce established with BMW, the German luxury car maker, will eventually enable the company to increase its European penetration. The current talks between Deutsche Aerospace and Fokker, whose jet engines are supplied by Rolls-Royce, could also boost the prospects of the Rolls-Royce Tay engine. At the same time, the UK company, which has already sold engines to Iberia, believes it has potential sales opportunities with airlines like Lufthansa, Swissair and Alitalia. Lord Tombs also defended yesterday his decision six years ago to break off a co-operation agreement with GE. Although some analysts still argue that there is not room for three big engine makers in the market, Lord Tombs argued that the GE deal would have limited the UK company's longer-term aero-engine prospects and ultimately turned Rolls-Royce into a GE sub-contractor. By concentrating on developing its own expanded range of engines and maintaining a strong balance sheet to weather the cyclical downturns, Lord Tombs believed Rolls-Royce was now in a far stronger position to compete in the cut-throat aero-engine market. He added that the company had spent Pounds 2bn on research and development to develop its expanded engine range during the last six years. This includes the Pounds 600m the company is investing in its new heavy thrust Trent engine to power the new generation of widebody aircraft. Broadening the company's base in other industrial power sectors had also started to pay dividends. Indeed, the industrial power division produced the bulk of profits last year and now accounted for about 40 per cent of the group's overall turnover. Both Lord Tombs and Sir Ralph insisted yesterday that the company should be viewed as a long-term business. 'When we were floated we said investors would have to be patient; that we needed a strong balance sheet to weather the cold spells in the industry,' Lord Tombs said. Yesterday's figures and the aerospace industry's uncertain short-term prospects suggest that investors will have to continue being patient.</p>

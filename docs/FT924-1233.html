			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Tesco buys retail chain in France TESCO, the food retailer, made the boldest foray yet by a UK retailer into continental Europe when it agreed to pay FFr1.47bn (Pounds 175.6m) for control of the 90-store Catteau supermarket chain in northern France. The deal is a significant acquisition by a UK retailer, and will fuel speculation that the largest UK retailers will be forced to expand into other European countries as the UK market begins to approach saturation. Of the FFr1.47bn Tesco is paying for the stores, 85 per cent will be payable next year. It is being financed entirely from Tesco's internal resources. Mr David Reid, finance director, said the acquisition would allow Tesco to gain experience of retailing in other parts of Europe. But he would not comment on Tesco's plans for European expansion. 'For the moment we will have our heads down making sure that this works, but in the longer term opportunities will arise,' he said. Catteau, a family-owned chain, will continue under its present management, supplemented by four members of Tesco's senior management. The Catteau family will retain 24 per cent of the shares. Tesco said it did not expect any redundancies as a result of the acquisition and hoped it would create jobs. Catteau operates 90 food stores in northern France - of which 56 have been added in the past five years - mostly in the Nord-Pas de Calais region. Two are hypermarkets operating under the HyperCedico name, of a similar size to Tesco's UK superstores. The 63 others, under the Cedico name, are smaller than Tesco UK stores. The chain also operates 25 convenience stores. The Catteau chain was originally founded by the family as a coffee-grinding business, based near Lille, Normandy, in 1915. The family moved into food wholesaling in the 1930s, and began retailing in the 1940s. The present chairman and chief executive are brothers, Mr Jacques Catteau and Mr Jean Catteau. Mr Reid emphasised that Catteau would continue to be run as a stand-alone basis. He said Tesco's plans to continue expanding by opening stores in the UK were unaffected by the acquisition. Tesco plans to spend between Pounds 350m and Pounds 400m next year on opening UK superstores, compared with the Pounds 150m it will pay for Catteau. Analysts' reactions to the announcement were mixed, although they said Catteau's profits of FFr126m last year represented some of the best margins among French retailers. But they added that the acquisition would focus attention on Tesco's growth prospects in the UK. Tesco goes shopping, Page 7 Recovery plan lifts Asda, Page 8</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Flight Control Centre (Moscow Region) April 29 TASS  - Another space week is nearing completion for Viktor Afanasyev,  Yuriy Usachev and Valeriy Polyakov aboard the Mir space station.    The flight programme for the last two days included  geophysical and astrophysical investigations as well as routine  servicing of some systems of the station and modules.    Using videospectrometric equipment installed on the  stabilised platform of the Kvant-2 module, the cosmonauts made  several snapshots of the Earth's surface. The main tasks of  this work were investigations of the ecological situation in  major industrial hubs and areas of oil and gas production.    To study further mechanisms of generation of elementary  high-  energy charged particles in the earth's radiation belts and  near- earch space, the crew fulfilled several experiments with  the use of a magnetic spectrometer.    Under a medical checkup plan, the ship commander and flight  engineer will undergo an echographic investigation of the  cardiovascular system on Friday under the supervision of the  crew doctor.    The station's flight continues under a preset programme. The  cosmonauts are healthy and feel well.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUILDER PLANS STADIUM COMPLEX NEAR FONTANA  </P> <P> Fontana officials Thursday announced details of a developer's plan to build a  $450-million stadium complex, including a 75,000-seat outdoor facility for  football and baseball and a 26,000-seat indoor arena for basketball or other  sports, on 250 acres of land northwest of the city.  </P> <P> The proposal for the development along Interstate 15 in western San Bernardino  County comes from the firm of Kagan Management Services Inc. and would involve  joint ownership by the city of Fontana, the Kagan firm and professional sports  franchises that agreed to move to the facilities.  </P> <P> But, according to a spokesman for the Kagan firm, no teams have been  approached, and none will be until the city approves a memorandum of  understanding with the firm on conditions for the project. The City Council  will discuss the matter Tuesday.  </P> <P> Fontana Mayor Nat Simon called the proposal "a risk-free deal for the city,"  adding: "We're not spending a dime of taxpayers' money, and we have a chance to  bring professional sports to our city. It could put our city on the map."  </P> <P> City Manager John O'Sullivan said the proposal avoids the problems faced by the  San Gabriel Valley city of Irwindale, when it sought to acquire the Los Angeles  Raiders football franchise with a $10-million advance cash payment, only to  lose the money when it couldn't come up with financing for the stadium.  </P> <P> "Until they bring us the teams, we don't do anything," O'Sullivan said.  </P> <P> Fontana is only the latest of four Southland cities to propose building either  indoor or outdoor arenas to attract pro teams. Irwindale, Santa Ana and Anaheim  also have expressed interest in such biddings.  </P> <P> With Los Angeles' negotiations to retain the Raiders not making much progress,  one Coliseum commissioner, Richard Riordan, expressed concern Thursday that the  Raiders might consider moving to Fontana. But he said that the team had told  Coliseum officials it was as yet not involved.  </P></p>

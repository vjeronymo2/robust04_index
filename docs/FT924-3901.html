			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Thailand (9): Low profile preferred - Foreign Relations THAI leaders are not much given to strutting around the world stage; not for them the role of defender of the Third World played by Dr Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, or that of economic guru played by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's elder statesman. Apart from the occasional dabbling in the affairs of their neighbours in Burma and Indochina, Thai governments usually prefer to concentrate on domestic affairs and keep a low international profile. The spotlight aimed at Thailand in the past few weeks following the refusal of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group to comply with the Cambodian peace agreement was therefore particularly unwelcome. As the United Nations Security Council considered the possibility of imposing economic sanctions against the Khmer Rouge, it immediately became clear that Thailand would have to bear most of the burden if sanctions were actually to be enforced. The Khmer Rouge is thought to earn at least Dollars 100m a year by selling gems and tropical timber from its strongholds in northern and western Cambodia to Thai businessmen, who in turn sell oil and other supplies to the guerrillas. Thai officials squirmed at the prospect of sanctions. They not only pointed out that a trade embargo would be difficult to enforce but made it plain that they hated the whole idea of putting pressure on the Khmer Rouge. Such an anti-sanctions policy was popular in the border provinces which profit from the trade with the guerrillas. But Thailand's support for an extremist organisation reckoned to have killed 1m Cambodians between 1975 and 1978 did not look good abroad - or in Bangkok, where the civilian coalition government had come to power in a September election in the aftermath of a middle-class, pro-democracy uprising. To make matters worse Thai politicians were accused of reneging on pre-election promises to reform Thailand's pragmatic and mercenary regional foreign policy. Liberal voters had hoped that the five-party coalition would voice a principled support for democracy, human rights and the need to protect the environment which is being wrecked by indiscriminate logging and strip-mining of gems in Cambodia. They had hoped that the new government would take a firm stance against the military junta in Burma and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. In fact, not much has changed. 'Each political party has its own foreign policy platform, but once they join together into a coalition it's necessary to see how to merge the policies,' Mr Prasong Soonsiri, the Thai foreign minister, told the Financial Times in an interview. 'Many issues which the individual parties were advocating during the campaign may have to be adjusted for the sake of unity.' That did not mean there would be no shift at all, Mr Prasong said. 'We notice that the world is attaching greater importance to issues such as human rights, democracy and the environment,' he said. 'Thailand has also emerged from a fight for democracy. . . We also wish to see our neighbours in a position which is accepted by the international community - but we are not in a position to manage their affairs.' Mr Prasong, a former air force squadron leader and national security chief, is all too aware that his ministry's conduct of foreign affairs is limited by the continued influence of the armed forces, especially on the borders with Burma and Cambodia. Thailand is a signatory of the Cambodian peace accord, but the Khmer Rouge leaders now flouting the agreement have long had close relations with Thai army generals, and the Thai officers on the frontier have profited from commissions on the informal trade with Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge, furthermore, is regarded by Thailand as a useful counter to the influence of Vietnam, Thailand's old rival, which invaded Cambodia in 1978, overthrew the brutal Khmer Rouge regime and installed the present Cambodian administration. Thailand takes an equally ambivalent attitude towards Burma, supporting the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council - which has been shunned by much of the rest of the world - at the same time as tolerating Burmese ethnic insurgent groups fighting the Rangoon regime from bases on the Thai border. Western diplomats can therefore be forgiven for suspecting that Thailand still prefers to see its neighbours unstable and divided than to risk the prospect of strong, united and prosperous nations on its borders - although it does seem to have made its peace with Laos. The question is whether such a policy is adequate for the 1990s. It favours army timber smugglers and small-time frontier traders, but may weaken the prospects of legitimate Thai businesses and investors in the region. Thailand, which advertises itself as a regional hub for Indochina and Burma, appears to be losing out to commercial rivals such as Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Malaysia in the fast-developing economy of Vietnam. Too much concern for frontier traders, as Mr Prasong appears to realise, may also distract attention from the vital task of attracting foreign investment to Thailand, fighting trade protectionism and securing access for Thai exports to the country's principal markets in the US, Europe and Japan. 'I came into office as minister of foreign affairs at a time when the world was changing rapidly; in particular the world has seen a move from military confrontation towards economic confrontation,' Mr Prasong said. 'The government has a duty to try to solve the obstacles arising from the increasingly competitive international scene. 'We see increasing competition in economic matters, in trade, and competition to secure markets and capital.'</p>

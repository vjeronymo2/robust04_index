			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of  reactions to the assassination of Institutional Revolutionary  Party (PRI) presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta  on 23 March in Tijuana, Baja California.    Today, Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon expressed  deep sorrow for Colosio's murder to Mexican President Salinas.  Calderon said the assassination will "obviously" have  repercussions on the Mexican elections, and added that problems  in Mexico and all countries should be resolved through dialogue.  (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1559 GMT 24 Mar 94)    Today, Salvadoran news media extensively covered Colosio's  assassination. Foreign Ministry sources informed ACAN-EFE that  the government has not issued an official statement concerning  the assassination yet. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1530 GMT 24  Mar 94)    Guatemalan political leaders expressed regret and  condemnation of Colosio's assassination. National Congress  President Vinicio Villar, a Christian Democrat, said social  differences should be resolved through dialogue and not with  weapons. The Union of the National Center (UCN) issued a  communique expressing regret for Colosio's death and compared it  to the 1993 murder of UCN presidential candidate Jorge Carpio  Nicolle. A number of newspapers also carried front-page reports  of the incident. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1453 GMT 24 Mar 94)    Today, the Nicaraguan Government condemned Colosio's  assassination "in the strongest of terms." An official message  released by the Social Communications Directorate of the  Nicaraguan Presidency said that "actions like these, in addition  to being strongly rejected by the Nicaraguan Government,  constitute a flagrant violation of the basic principle of the  right to life." Meanwhile, Tomas Borge, a member of the  Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN) directorate,  described the murder as "abominable," adding that Colosio was "a  man with progressive views who stressed the need for profound  democratic changes in Mexico." Bayardo Arce, another FSLN  leader, also condemned Colosio's death, characterizing it as a  loss for Mexico and the entire world. The tragic event has been  widely covered by Nicaraguan newspapers. (Panama City ACAN in  Spanish 1517 GMT 24 Mar 94)    Today by telephone, Panamanian President Guillermo Endara  extended his condolences for Colosio's death to his Mexican  counterpart Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Colosio's family.  Endara also issued a statement to ACAN-EFE which read: "May this  painful incident in Mexico serve as a lesson to every nation, in  the sense that the ballot is the only valid means of settling  political differences." (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1500 GMT 24  Mar 94)    Today, Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate of  Panama's Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), rejected  Colosio's assassination and said it may be part of a plan to  destabilize the Mexican state. Perez, a personal friend of  Colosio's, said that unless the law is changed, the PRI may be  without a candidate which is absurd because PRI has won every  election. The PRD candidate said Mexico may be on the path to  destabilization following the assassination of "an extraordinary  man who would definitely have been an excellent president for  the Mexican people."

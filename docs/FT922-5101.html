			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (11): Business warms to plans for balanced development - Industry viewpoint / Frank Popoff, president of Dow Chemical INDUSTRIALISTS, often viewed as the villains of the environmental war, will also be gathering in Rio for the summit. But according to Mr Frank Popoff, president and chief executive of Dow, the US chemicals group, they will be coming in a non-adversarial role. 'We need to reduce the adversarial relationship that has existed so far  - then, through mutual effort, we can actually achieve something,' he says. The summit offers an opportunity for industry to raise its credibility and demonstrate the many ways it is committed to sustainable development - balancing economic growth with environmental concerns, he believes. The minimum that should be achieved is that Agenda 21, an 800-page action programme which will flesh out the principles in the Rio declaration, should provide the template for global environmental reform, creating a framework for minimum pollution and maximum product, Mr Popoff argues. 'By coming together and talking about Agenda 21 we must be less political and more pragmatic in our approach,' says Mr Popoff. There's no point being utopian, but we must change course to sustainable development.' The chemical industry vies with the oil industry in public esteem for being the least environmentally-friendly, but, according to Mr. Popoff, chemistry has an important role to play in reducing pollution. Modern pesticides have been developed, he observes, which require grammes rather than tonnes per hectare, and are benign, decomposing extremely quickly. However, he stresses the importance of self-regulation within the industry as well. and the need for the sector to pre-empt national regulators from setting up different standards in different countries. Too many companies still regard waste and emissions reduction as something they must do to satisfy outside agencies rather than something they can do to realise economic gain. Dow has been running a campaign called 'Wrap' - Waste Reduction Always Pays  -for the last five years, based on the premise that the best approach to environmental problems is not to produce pollutants in the first place. The company has also set up a yield improvement programme that searched for ways of using fewer raw materials and less energy per unit produced. Dow's policy towards plastics has been driven by the need to control waste. The company is continually searching for ways to prevent pollution rather than dealing with it at the end of pipeline; it also aims to reuse plastics when possible, recycle what cannot be used and then reclaim the energy in the product. The principle of sustainable development fits in well with Dow's existing philosophy, says Mr Popoff. That is why the group has been quick to back the proposals. Mr Popoff warns that the price to be paid if the industry fails to regulate itself is chaos. In particular, if different standards are set up in different states, then the issue of pollution will become even more hopelessly intermingled with trade issues. Trade and the environment are already in a hopeless mess, he says. The solution to pollution must be based on market principles. The results of over-regulation and centralisation have been all too clearly demonstrated in eastern and central Europe. He believes taxes on consumption are preferable to competing subsidies. One clear opportunity is to reduce discrepancies in the gasoline sector, where consumer prices are five times higher in Italy than in the US - 'the US has been slow to address the issue of gasoline prices,' he says. 'It may be politically controversial, but by raising prices it would have the great advantage of reducing inordinate use. We must have a universal gasoline price.' Mr Popoff admits such a move would be politically difficult, but the electorate might well be interested in a politician who put forward such a fresh view. One of the most significant problems facing the summit will be that of reconciling the differing agenda of north and south. The north is interested in energy consumption, air and water quality, solid waste, and climate. The south's pre-occupations remain population growth, deforestation, desertification, water and technology transfer. 'All these things are compatible. The issues are global,' says Mr Popoff. 'We have to work together, because otherwise there are no other real options.'</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: False dawn for European engineers - The sector has retreated after a good performance in the first half INVESTORS in European engineering companies are having to learn the virtue of patience as they await the end of a recession that has spread steadily across the Continent over the past 18 months. It is not only in the UK - where the Conservatives' election victory in April produced a burst of enthusiasm that turned into a false dawn for manufacturing companies - that 1992 has brought disappointment for companies as well as their shareholders. In Germany, the powerhouse of European engineering, shares performed well in the first half of the year but more recently have fallen back. Mannesmann, the big German engineering company with an interest in cellular telephones, reached DM310.50 on June 23 - up 26.5 per cent since the start of the year - but has since dropped back, to close at DM293 yesterday. Linde, one of Europe's leading fork-lift truck manufacturers, reached DM876 on May 25, up 28.6 per cent since January 1, but closed at DM820 yesterday. The story is similar in Sweden, with Atlas Copco jumping 39 per cent from the start of the year to SKr334 at the end of May before retreating to SKr300 yesterday, and Asea, in partnership with Switzerland's Brown Boveri, gaining 40.5 per cent to SKr392 on July 3 before closing at SKr376 yesterday. This trend is a sign, says Mr Gebhard Klingenstein of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Frankfurt, 'that the whole upturn of industry has been postponed, and won't be happening this year'. Reports from the real economy tend to confirm what Mr Edward Hadas at Morgan Stanley sees as a 'growing doubt among investors that there is an end to the recession'. Incoming orders for the western German engineering industry, an important barometer, dropped 4 per cent in real terms in May, compared with the same month a year earlier, according to the VDMA industry association. The European engineering industry is international - 60 per cent of German mechanical engineering output is exported and a similar proportion of the larger UK engineering groups' turnover is derived from outside the UK. Therefore, the industry is exposed to economic conditions worldwide, and currently there are few bright spots. But it is also diffuse, and its constituent parts react in varying degrees to other external factors - most of which are negative at present. The near collapse of east European markets, for example, has cast a pall over the German machine tool industry, exacerbating problems caused by the downturn in western Europe. Other sectors hit by the upheaval in east Europe include sewing machines and textile equipment, according to Mr Hadas, while one of the very few sectors to have retained some stability has been food manufacturing machinery. For investors in European engineering stocks, one of the features of the sector is the relatively long lag between changes in business conditions and their effect on profit. Investors tend to look out for an improved order flow, and can then expect a rise in profits some months ahead. In this environment, share prices are much more sensitive to short-term changes of sentiment than to short-term trends in earnings, says Mr Hadas. On the immediate outlook, there is nothing to suggest a dramatic change in sentiment, and thus in share prices, over the next few months. One analyst even suggests the general environment could get worse rather than better, citing factors such as the current Italian budget deficit crisis - reducing the deficit could hit exports from German engineering companies to the Italian market. Mr Klingenstein is optimistic about the performance of machinery stocks for next year, partly because of a structural rise in demand - mainly from eastern Germany - and cyclical demand factors. Meanwhile, he says, shares are likely to go sideways. As in the UK, what is lacking in continental Europe is confidence, a problem that begins with the current reluctance of engineering companies' customers to invest, and feeds through to share prices. Restoring it is likely to be a gradual process as equipment demand grows slowly next year.</p>

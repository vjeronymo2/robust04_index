			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHAT SOME FORMER COUNTY EMPLOYEES ARE DOING NOW  </P> <P> The following are some of the county employees or elected officials who now  seek to influence county government either on their own behalf, for their new  employers or for their clients.  </P> <P> BRIAN MAY, a former aide to Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. He is a lobbyist who  recently won a county contract for a civil engineering firm. Until recently,  May's wife, Ruby, also a former Wieder aide, worked with her husband as a  lobbyist.  </P> <P> BRYAN SPEEGLE, former director of advance planning for the county. Joined  Culbertson &amp; Adams, a consulting firm founded by former county employees,  in June, 1987. According to county records, just before Speegle left, he  received a letter from Culbertson &amp; Adams thanking him for suggestions  later incorporated in a development agreement between the county and the firm's  client -- the Santa Margarita Co. However, county officials say such letters  are received routinely from consultants and developers. Speegle was until July  a registered "influence broker" under the county regulations applying to anyone  contributing more than $452 over a 12-mont period to any Supervisor and who is  employed or contracts with others as a lobbyist. Culbertson and Adams has two  County Environmental Management Agency consulting contracts totaling $70,053.  </P> <P> TOM DALY, former aide to Supervisor Don R. Roth. He quit in June to become  executive director of the Orange County Building Industry Assn., a major donor  to the campaigns of county supervisors. He recently began lobbying county  officials to reject Orange County Fire Chief Larry J. Holms' proposal to  require fire sprinklers in all new residential construction, which the building  industry says adds unnecessarily to the high cost of housing. Daly, who also is  an Anaheim city councilman, said he has only talked to members of the county  staff so far about Holms' proposal, but adds that he intends to lobby the  supervisors, including Roth, his former boss.  </P> <P> NANCY COSS-FITZWATER, formerly in charge of government relations at the County  Transportation Commission. She now works in a similar capacity at the Irvine  Co. According to commission Executive Director Stanley Oftelie, she continues  to exchange information and views about pending state and federal legislation  with her successor at commission, Monte Ward. Coss-Fitzwater was Ward's boss at  the Transportation Commission. Oftelie contends that there is no conflict of  interest in such contacts, because anyone can write or call the commission to  submit views on legislation, and because the transportation agency already has  frequent contact with the Irvine Co., which helps fund some transportation  improvements sought by the commission. (Oftelie himself is a former aide to  retired supervisor Ralph Clark.)  </P> <P> RALPH CLARK, who retired from the Board of Supervisors in 1984. He occasionally  has lobbied for companies seeking local government contracts, including a firm  that bid on the contract for the county's freeway emergency call boxes.  Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said Clark called him recently about a matter  involving the Orange County Transit District, which Clark helped found and  chaired for many years, but Stanton said he could not recall whether Clark was  acting on behalf of a client or not. Clark did not return a reporter's phone  calls.  </P> <P> BRUCE NESTANDE, former state assemblyman and county supervisor. He is now vice  president of Costa Mesa-based Arnel Development Co., continues to serve as an  influential member of the California Transportation Commission. Nestande  attempted to broker a last-minute settlement last year between slow-growth  activists and the supervisors that would have avoided the costly, bitter  election battle in which a slow-growth ballot measure was defeated 56% to 44%.  He also lobbied supervisors on behalf of the proposed half-cent sales tax for  traffic improvements that is now Measure M on the Nov. 7 ballot countywide.  Nestande chaired a growth management committee created by the supervisors and  now chairs the pro-Measure M campaign.  </P> <P> PETER HERMAN, who currently works for Hon Development Co. He once was  considered so powerful while an aide to Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley that he  was dubbed the "sixth supervisor." Herman has talked to Riley and his staff  about a planned Hon development in South County, but was recently asked by  Riley aide Tom Matthews to stop coming around. "I told him in person that I  didn't appreciate him coming in like that and that certainly the company had  others who could talk to us instead." Herman says he believed that he was best  suited to talk to Riley because of his familiarity with the supervisor.  </P> <P> DAN MILLER, former aide to Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. He now works for the  management consulting firm of Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells, which has had  several contracts with the county, its transportation agencies, the county  grand jury and city governments.  </P> <P> Miller also is a former member of the county administrative staff, where he  dealt with county budget and financial matters. Miller said he has met with  county supervisors or their staffs several times to discuss his firm's  business. He doesn't consider that lobbying, however, because he said such  contacts are usually initiated by county officials who have various questions  about current or pending work.  </P> <P> May, Clark, and Speegle could not be reached for comment. Gibson deferred to  his boss, who told The Times that an interview with Gibson would be OK, but  then Gibson did not return The Times' phone calls.  </P> <P> May, Clark, and Speegle could not be reached for comment.

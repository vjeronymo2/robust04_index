			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Man in the News: Dour Scot with an empire from east to west  -William Purves The career of Mr William Purves is a tale of 'go east young man' redolent of Britain's imperial past. Thirty-six years ago he left his job of bank clerk in Scotland to seek his fortune in the colonies. Now the chairman of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is to take control of the UK's Midland Bank, which Mr Purves's bank is about to acquire. However, the 60-year-old Scot seems unmoved by the prospect of taking over one of the big four English clearing banks. He has already got used to big titles. Hong Kong folklore has it that the three men who rule the colony are the chairman of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, the chairman of Hongkong Bank and the Governor, in that order. Since December 1991, Mr Purves has held the the first two of these posts. Although the Midland takeover would propel the Hongkong Bank into the limelight of the international banking stage, Hong Kong looks on the UK partner as a smaller, weaker bank. Indeed, many Hong Kong bankers describe the UK as a 'sunset economy' and point to the opportunities from branching out on to the Chinese mainland. Mr Purves is often to be found on the mainland and has cultivated a close relationship with the Chinese government, which takes over the colony in 1997. Colleagues and friends attach adjectives like 'dour', 'hard-working' and 'tough' to him, rather than 'ambitious' or 'self-important'. Colleagues describe him as 'not the kind of man who seeks personal publicity'. He himself says he is a dedicated banker, rather than a principal pillar of colonial society. In this respect, he differs from his more flamboyant predecessor, Sir Michael Sandberg. Sir Michael's nine-year reign as chairman left the colony with numerous monuments to the bank's glory, such as the Dollars US1bn Hongkong Bank building, with its unused helicopter landing pad, and a palatial residence of questionable taste on the Peak, the island's most exclusive area. By contrast, employees claim that Mr Purves has been known to fly economy class. He sees the Hongkong Bank as an institution where Scottish banking principles offer a good model, and hard work and loyalty are the keys to success. The principles Mr Purves reveres include common sense, frugality and conservatism, although occasionally his puritanism can rub people up the wrong way. When the Bank of Credit and Commerce International collapsed, he angered local BCCI depositors by accusing them of greed for having been attracted by that bank's slightly higher interest rates. His innate caution might appear odd, given that he has been associated with an ambitious programme of overseas expansion, which has taken Hongkong Bank into the US, Canada, Australia and, almost, Scotland - through a failed bid for Royal Bank of Scotland in 1981 - in the last 12 years. But Hongkong Bank has given itself ample time to consider the wisdom of a move on Midland, having acquired its initial 14.9 per cent stake in the bank more than four years ago. The gestation of the deal had been longer still. On the day that Mr Purves's appointment as chairman was announced in December 1985, he said: 'If the opportunity arose we would like to do more in Europe, but it's not something that's likely to present itself in the immediate future.' He became chairman exactly 30 years after leaving the National Bank of Scotland's Kelso branch for the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. He had then worked his way through the hierarchy; being a rugby-playing Scotsman provided a slight edge in a bank with a strong Scots contingent. He stresses, however, that he has got where he has by dint of hard work and being fair. Few of his colleagues argue with this. Mr Purves claims the paternalistic image of the bank is overplayed, but it clearly expects hard work and loyalty, and it rewards them. 'The bank is a bit like a boarding school, with Mr Purves playing the role of a senior prefect,' says one insider. Mr Purves still calls in new trainees and makes a valiant effort to remember all their names - a significant task, as the bank has 10,000 more staff today than eight years ago. His powers of recollection are renowned and it is this, he claims, that gives people the impression he is a details man. Some, however, have criticised him for being too involved in the nuts and bolts of bank business, and not sufficiently focused on broader strategies. The Hongkong Bank chairman wields immense power: there are no big shareholders breathing down his neck, as a result of a ruling on a maximum shareholding of 1 per cent - which will go as a condition of Midland takeover. Moreover, the board comprises mainly non-executive local businessmen, unlikely to question the bank's executive committee. But the burden on Mr Purves has been relieved to an extent, through the appointment of the deputy chairman, Mr John Gray, as chief executive of Hongkong Bank. Mr Purves, therefore, has had more time to concentrate on the difficulties caused by the bank's operations outside Hong Kong. Hongkong Bank has allowed its overseas operations to run with a large degree of autonomy, which has sometimes backfired in the tough economic climate of the last two years. 'When you put someone in charge, you should let them get on with it. But there have been problems and we have sadly had to make changes. I have been accused of being too slow to make those changes, but you have to give people the chance,' says Mr Purves. For example, Mr John Bond, a director of the bank, has been sent to the US to turn round a subsidiary, Marine Midland. But Mr Purves says this does not reflect a change in management style. Midland Bank would, in the main, be left to run itself under the existing regime. There is speculation that Mr Purves may relocate to London to control the growing bank empire from the City; but he is non-committal, stating that he will do what his board wants him to. But he also says he is getting old and is looking towards retirement. Friends suggest he would have difficulty parting company with his business interests completely, and for that reason might want to remain close to London. However, although he has assumed the badges of his post as Hong Kong's most eminent corporate man, such as a company Rolls-Royce, Peak dwelling and even a share in a race horse, the social trappings do not seem important to him. 'I have other outside interests that I would like to pursue. A long time ago I was interested in gardening and bee-keeping. And I would like to have time to read,' he says. But, in the meantime, he has a HKDollars 30bn acquisition to complete.</p>

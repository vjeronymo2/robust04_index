			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bird fight puts heat on Booker - Slight decrease to Pounds 30m and cautious note sounded on second half BOOKER, the food distribution and agribusiness group, yesterday reported a slight decrease in interim profits and sounded a downbeat note about the outlook for the second half. Mr Jonathan Taylor, chairman, said: 'Overall, current trading is satisfactory but . . . we remain cautious for the year as a whole.' Mr Taylor said he was concerned about the group's Arbor Acres chickens farms in the US, which were facing increasing competition, and the possible adverse impact on consumer confidence in the UK of November's budget. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 36.8m to Pounds 29.9m in the six months to June 12, although the previous period was flattered by a Pounds 5.3m gain on disposals. Sales rose from Pounds 1.47bn to Pounds 1.5bn and operating profits from continuing operations rose from Pounds 37.4m to Pounds 38.9m. In spite of sluggish trading conditions, Booker said effective action had been taken to increase operating efficiencies and reduce costs, so margins had improved slightly. Food distribution profits recovered strongly from Pounds 16.2m to Pounds 19.2m. Sales in cash and carry started to improve during the second quarter and this trend was improving. More important were the cost savings resulting from the extension of information technology throughout the depot system. The total group workforce fell by 1,340 to 21,000, with most of the job losses occuring in cash and carry. Booker Fitch Food services improved profits as a result of tighter operation control. Its biggest fast-food contracts had been concentrated into two dedicated depots, reducing costs. However, the catering market remained dull. Within food distribution, current trading was improving, but the group said it was not possible to predict the impact of the next budget, which would come before the peak Christmas period. Profits from fish and prepared foods were static at Pounds 9.6m (Pounds 9.8m). The group said it was difficult to secure price increases from supermarkets to compensate for higher costs. Agribusiness profits fell to Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 10.1m). In the UK, McConnell Salmon had returned to profit and other businesses were benefiting from sterling's devaluation. Earnings fell to 10.5p (12.2p), although excluding exceptionals they rose from 10.42p to 10.51p. The interim dividend was held at 7.5p. COMMENT The preference of US consumers for chickens with lots of white meat is hurting Booker, which breeds birds with more dark meat than the competition. It will be 1995 before a suitable female bird is ready, so the pain could continue for some time. Meanwhile, the success of rationalising food distribution shows that Mr Charles Bowen, the recently appointed chief executive, has plenty of scope for improving controls further. The shares are on a prospective multiple of 13, a 15 per cent discount to the market and just below the food sector's rating. A maintained dividend looks assured. The shares, down 9p to 432p, are underpinned by a prospective premium yield of more than 6 per cent, but are unlikely to advance until the new man shows his hand.</p>

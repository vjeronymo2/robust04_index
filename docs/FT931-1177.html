			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Barclays to lose its finance director MR PETER WOOD, finance director of Barclays, is to leave and join Standard Chartered, Barclays said yesterday. The announcement came the day after Barclays said it intended to appoint a chief executive from outside. Mr Wood, 50, who would have been a contender for chief executive of Barclays if it had wanted an internal appointment, made no comment on the reason for his departure. Both banks said he had been talking to Standard since January. Barclays appointed Mr Oliver Stocken, finance director of its BZW investment banking division, to succeed Mr Wood from May 1. Mr Andrew Buxton, Barclays' chairman and chief executive, said the bank was 'sorry to lose' Mr Wood. He will succeed Mr Richard Stein, who is retiring as a director from June 30. Mr Rodney Galpin, Standard chairman, welcomed Mr Wood's 'wide and varied experience in one of the world's leading banking groups'. Barclays emphasised yesterday that talks about Mr Wood's appointment had predated its announcement on Wednesday that it would undertake a worldwide search for someone to take on Mr Buxton's role as chief executive while he remained chairman. But Mr Wood's approach to Standard came after Mr Buxton disclosed that he intended to split his two roles, and might seek a chief executive from outside. Some institutional shareholders had pressed for a division of the roles. Barclays' ordinary shares fell 1p down at 414p, and Standard's fell 3p to 710p. Observer, Page 19</p>

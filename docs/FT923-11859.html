			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Observer: Nelson loses his touch Who's to blame for the peculiar affair of the too successful National Savings Bond? It is rare indeed for the government to be pushed around by a building society, let alone a second division one. Did the authorities just get the rate wrong or did they, more seriously, underestimate the sheer scale of protest? A post-mortem need not take too long. For a start, there is no point in blaming the poor old National Savings movement. It is doing everything the government wanted. Besides having more than doubled its contribution to Treasury coffers, it is behaving remarkably commercially, helped by the presence on its board of Mark St Giles and Roy Heape, two leading lights in the UK unit trust industry. No one can sensibly argue that the people running National Savings had no feel for the likely impact of any rate move. They knew what they were doing, as the government should have. If the Treasury was unsure, it could have tapped the chancellor's old adviser, Alastair Ross Goobey, who sits on the board of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, which has been kicking up all the fuss. Clearly, the government had access to plenty of advice but ignored it. If anyone is to carry the can, it is Tony Nelson, the ex-Slater Walker hand, who is now Treasury economic secretary and the minister responsible for National Savings.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (4): Anxiety over losses and graft - Privatisation: public opinion is moving in its favour Mr Engin Civan may go down in Turkish history as the man who made privatisation possible. Mr Civan, a former state bank president, was shot and wounded in September. He admitted gangsters were trying to recover a Dollars 5m bribe because he had been sacked before he could authorise their loan. His tale of corruption, power politics and organised crime gripped the country for weeks. People always suspected state companies were corrupt, inefficient and politicised. But Mr Civan's revelations accelerated a gradual shift in public opinion in favour of privatisation. The state's industrial giants are formidable lossmakers. Last year, they contributed one-fifth of the public sector borrowing requirement of Dollars 29.72bn. Next year, according to the government's optimistic draft budget, their losses will shrink to Dollars 1bn. State companies control or dominate the telecommunications, airline, iron and steel, mining, petroleum and electric power industries. The state owns the biggest banks. State companies employ 863,000 people, about half of them surplus to requirements. The first privatisation programme was announced in 1984. But no government was ever interested in reducing the public sector. Privatisation has raised just Dollars 2.2bn in 10 years. Three-quarters came from sales of minority stakes in private companies. Only Dollars 600m were 'real' privatisations, mostly in peripheral sectors. The companies' losses, their inefficiency - water is rationed in Istanbul, power-cuts are frequent - and the corruption oozing out of them make privatisation seem only a matter of time. In January, the prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, recruited Tezcan Yaramanci from the private sector as her new privatisation supremo. He says: 'I believe today that Turkey has advanced more in the last 10 months than in the last 10 years.' But privatisation has split the government. Mrs Ciller's junior coalition partner, the social democratic SHP party, blocked privatisation until her DYP party approved a political liberalisation package. Earlier this year, Mrs Ciller tried to impose privatisation by decree. The SHP appealed to the constitutional court, which ruled that the government must win parliamentary approval first. She only won the SHP's grudging support in October. But even MPs from her own party and the conservative opposition Motherland party, as well as SHP members, threaten to oppose the bill. Mr Yaramanci expected to raise Dollars 2.5bn from privatisation in 1994. His 1995 target is Dollars 9-12bn. He insists he can still raise Dollars 1.5bn this year: 'From the organisational point of view, privatisation is ready to go. Right now there are two or three companies ready. International investment circles have been contacted. There is demand for these companies.' However, even economy minister Aykon Dogan considers these targets far too high. Etibank and Sumerbank, two small banks, would be first on the block. Fifteen per cent of privatisation revenues will go to a severance-pay fund for state company employees who lose their jobs. Big companies, such as the telephone system or the national airline THY, would probably find ready buyers. But others will be a very hard sell. The Erdemir steel works or state banks need lots of costly restructuring. The government has started tightening controls on its companies. They are now subject to commercial law. In theory, they can be declared bankrupt. Tedas, the electricity distributor, is trying to put itself on a profit-first footing. Mr Mehmet Bozdemir, Tedas general manager, says: 'before, the state came first. Now profit comes first.' Mr Yaramanci says he will break companies up into individual business units prior to privatisation. But 'restructuring (for) productivity increases is left to the private sector after privatisation.' The proposed regulatory systems looks messy. The government hopes to sell 49 per cent of the telephone company to strategic investors who would hold management control. The government, using its 51 per cent stake, would retain a regulatory role. It plans to privatise the electricity generation industry, but retain a distribution monopoly. This is a recipe for confusion and conflict, which is unlikely to attract many investors.</p>

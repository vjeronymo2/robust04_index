			<p>CSO     [Excerpt] While the controversy between U.S. authorities  and the Office of the Prosecutor General over the battle being  waged in the country against drug traffickers is still on-going,  the Antinarcotics Police launched a heavy offensive that  resulted in captures of individuals and drug seizures in Valle,  Santander, Meta, Guaviare, Vichada, and Caqueta Departments.    Initially, in Valle Department, the police, cooperating with  the Air Force, achieved the immobilization of a Turbo Commander  twin-engine plane containing a shipment of 1,020 kg of cocaine  base. Carefully camouflaged in 20 packages, each weighing 51 kg,  it apparently was intended to be transferred to a Chevrolet  truck. The official report notes that, about 2100, during the  course of inspection and control operations at the Alfonso  Bonilla Aragon International Airport, the authorities detected  on the taxi platform of the aircraft, registration HK 3275, the  1,020 kg of cocaine base and the truck with license plates  CAG-660, to which the drugs were to be transferred. Three  persons were captured.    According to preliminary investigations by the Antinarcotics  Police, the white Turbo Commander twin-engine plane with red and  gray trim belonged to Hector Fabio Gonzalez Martinez. However,  the stake-body type Chevrolet truck with a tarp was owned by  Fernando Isaza Uribe, a native of the municipality of Tulua. The  Office of the Prosecutor General is probing the possible  connection of these individuals with the shipment seized.    As for the identities of those captured, the official report  stated that they were Julio Hernando Campo, a native of Cali;  Isaac Munoz Londono, from the Valle capital; and Ovidio Giraldo  Giraldo, from the municipality of Cartago. The items confiscated  and the persons detained in the operation were left at the  disposal of the Valle Regional Prosecutor's Office.  <H5>  In the East </H5>   Furthermore, as a supplement to the authorities' offensive  against the drug traffickers, it was confirmed that, during  various operations in the eastern part of the country, four  small planes carrying approximately 900 kg of cocaine were  intercepted. Six persons were captured and subsequently placed  under the orders of the prosecutor's office.    Specifically, it was established that the immobilization of  the airplanes took place in Meta, Guaviare, Vichada, and Caqueta  Departments, and that the confiscated drugs apparently came from  Peru, although the planes carried Bolivian registration. It was  reported that the operations would continue, with backing from  artillery-equipped helicopters.    Similarly, in Santander Department, more precisely, in  Bucaramanga, the police arrested three individuals who were  transporting 100 kg of cocaine, possibly to Venezuela. According  to preliminary reports, the drugs were to be taken to Europe,  using the Caracas International Airport as a bridge. The  Santander Regional Prosecutor's Office is attempting to  investigate further connections in this case.    Spokesmen for the Antinarcotics Police confirmed that they  would pursue the operations throughout the country, especially  in areas invaded by guerrilla groups. They claimed that it has  become obvious that the drug traffickers in some regions are  being aided by the subversives in their tasks of collecting,  transporting, and distributing alkaloids.

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ATTORNEY GENERAL;  </P> <P> GATES, BLOCK ANNOUNCE BACKING OF LUNGREN  </P> <P> Los Angeles' two top cops endorsed Republican Dan Lungren's bid for state  attorney general Wednesday, triggering a debate over whether Lungren or his  Democratic opponent, Arlo Smith, can claim top bragging rights to the crucial  support of California's vast law enforcement community. In announcing their  support for Lungren, Sheriff Sherman Block and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl  F. Gates cited the former five-term congressman's personal character and his  aggressive anti-crime stance.  </P> <P> "I believe him to be an individual with impeccable integrity and credibility  and one who will serve the cause of justice in this state," Block said at a  Burbank news conference. "During the time he served in Congress he was always  available and always responsive."  </P> <P> Echoed Gates: "(Lungren) will look at the problems of crime, of gangs, of  narcotics in California and aggressively beat those problems." Both Block and  Gates are Republicans.  </P> <P> Later in the day, law enforcement officers backing Smith held press conferences  in Los Angeles and Sacramento to reaffirm their support for the 11-year San  Francisco district attorney. Among them was Mel Jones, president of the Assn.  for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, whose 7,000 members work for Block.  </P> <P> "Voters are faced with a distinct choice for attorney general -- a law  enforcement professional with 36 years' experience prosecuting criminals or a  politician who has never prosecuted a case," said Jones, speaking on the steps  of the downtown Criminal Courts Building. "Dan Lungren could only qualify for  an entry-level position in the attorney general's office if he were to apply  for a job instead of run for one."  </P> <P> In their effort to counter Lungren, Smith backers in Sacramento went so far as  to trot out a dog owned by Smith's press secretary to poke fun at the  Republican's campaign biography. The 4-year-old collie, they said, recently  received a membership card from the Washington-based Assn. of Federal  Investigators, which once awarded a "Legislator of the Year" honor to Lungren.  </P> <P> As the November election nears, the two candidates for the state's top law  enforcement position have placed a high priority on endorsements from the  plethora of police organizations across the state and nation.  </P> <P> In general, Lungren, who helped draft and win passage of major anti-crime  legislation while in Congress, has won the backing of most management-oriented  California police organizations. Smith, who once headed the criminal division  of the state attorney general's office, has been endorsed by some of the  largest police rank-and-file labor organizations.  </P> <P> Lungren called Wednesday's endorsements by the high-profile Block and Gates --  as well as those from organizations such as the California Police Chiefs Assn.  and the California State Police Assn. -- among "the most important" events of  the campaign.  </P> <P> "With the help of the people that they represent, I intend to help lead a fight  in this state to make sure we balance the score on the side of the  law-abiding," said Lungren. "I want to shine the light of day on the  shenanigans that go on in Sacramento in the Legislature that ensure . . . the  cries of (crime) victims and the urgings of law enforcement are not heard."  </P> <P> Lungren also pledged to fight for stiffer sanctions against casual drug users,  although he stopped far short of backing Gates' recent controversial remarks to  a U.S. Senate committee that casual users should be shot.  </P></p>

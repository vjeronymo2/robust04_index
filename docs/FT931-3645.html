			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Management: Tupe or not Tupe. . . Could it be the Thatcherite nightmare is coming true? That British legislation to promote the free market in the UK, namely Compulsory Competitive Tendering in local and central government, is being thwarted by European legislation to protect the rights of workers, namely the transfer of undertakings regulations? The UK's transfer regulations, known as Tupe, stem from the EC's 1977 Acquired Rights Directive which was designed to protect some employee rights when businesses or undertakings are transferred from one employer to another. The government insists Tupe will rarely apply to contracting-out, while trade unions and many lawyers insist it will invariably apply - making it harder for private business to make money on government contracts by cutting the wages bill. Private contractors want clarification on their potential liabilities before tendering. The government has been lobbying hard in Brussels for the directive to be revised to exclude contracting-out. But the UK is unlikely to get what it wants unless the unions abuse the leverage Tupe seems to give them or unless a wave of retrospective Tupe claims are unleashed. There are two important questions about Tupe: what do the regulations require and when do they apply? Both questions are difficult to answer definitively. The regulations insist staff cannot be dismissed as the result of a transfer, although it may be possible to dismiss people soon after for other reasons. The regulations also insist terms and conditions of employment cannot be changed without consent and collective deals and union recognition must be carried over. There is less clarity about two further things - whether pension terms can be altered and how long the previous employment conditions must be maintained. The Acquired Rights Directive specified a period of one year but that was not mentioned in the UK's Tupe regulations. When the regulations apply depends on the definition of a 'transfer' and an 'undertaking'. To take two extremes, the regulations would normally apply if a contractor was employing substantially the same staff as before on the same premises with the same equipment. The regulations would not normally apply if the contractor employs none of the existing staff and conducts his operation at different premises with his own equipment. Recent judgments at the European Court of Justice suggest EC judges favour a broad definition of both a transfer and an undertaking which would capture a broad range of the services currently being prepared for contracting-out. It is even possible to be caught when a council or government department terminates its existing service and buys in a new service. In general terms manual worker operations are more likely to be caught by Tupe than white collar administrative functions. That is unfortunate for contractors as manual operations are usually easier to save money on through job cuts and wages are usually more generous than the private sector. What are the solutions? Contractor lobby groups believe Tupe will have a greater effect than the government has admitted. But the lobbyists believe that even without legal clarity there are things that could be done. Departments could slim down and reorganise prior to contracting out, although that might still transgress the regulations and seems unpopular with the government. The government could indemnify companies against Tupe-imposed costs or extend contract periods to make it easier for companies to recoup the extra costs. Alternatively public authorities should be required to make a 'realistic' return on capital on services such as cleaning. The current requirement for cleaning is 5 per cent which allows them to pay wages on average 10 per cent above the private sector. But according to John Hall of the Cleaning and Support Services Association the preferred, but not foolproof, method of Tupe avoidance for companies will be the refusal to take on existing staff unless they agree to changes in their terms and conditions.</p>

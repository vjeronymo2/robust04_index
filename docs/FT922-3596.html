			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Observer: Outflow impending Which of the folk who navigated Britain's water industry into the private sector will be the first to pull the plug on his career? Given all the fuss about water charges, the drought and generous perks, the chairmanship of a water plc is not the comfortable haven it may have seemed. True, the stability - if not stagnancy - of the companies' chairmen since privatisation contrasts sharply with the rapid ebb and flow among their underlings. But a few top retirements could well soon be in the pipeline. North West Water's chairman Dennis Grove, for one, is 65 next month and so it would be no surprise if he asked to be relieved of further duty. His deputy, Littlewood's chief executive Desmond Pitcher, would make an admirable replacement. Moreover, several of Grove's counterparts in the other companies are also well into their 60s, and must be wondering whether it's worth swimming on, especially if they are not going to land knighthoods. If they decide to go, Observer will be interested to see whether it proves as easy to recruit the next generation of chairmen as the first. After all, now the industry is privatised there's less need for a full-time chairman as well as a chief executive. Hence the rate for the job should drop, even though the complaints look likely to go on rising.</p>

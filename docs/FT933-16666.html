			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Arts: New York Balanchine bonanza - David Vaughan attends the final gala performance New York City Ballet's Balanchine Celebration, about which Clement Crisp wrote in its early stages, came to a triumphant end on Sunday with a gala performance that began at 4 in the afternoon and lasted until 10.30 in the evening, with intermissions when cocktails and zakouski (Russian hors d'oeuvres) or American dessert (brownies and carrot cake) were served, and a longer break when you could get a box supper prepared according to Balanchine's own recipes. As for the dancing, the programme reprised the chronological format of the season as a whole, but with an international flavour to illustrate the fact that Balanchine generously gave his ballets to companies all over the world. Guest artists from the Kirov, the Paris Opera, the Royal Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Dance Theatre of Harlem, San Francisco Ballet, and Pacific Northwest Ballet (Seattle) appeared alongside City Ballet dancers. Thus, there was a multinational Apollo with the Danish/American Nilas Martins and Zhanna Ayupova (Kirov), Patricia Barker (Seattle) and Isabelle Guerin (Paris) as his muses. The sensation of the evening was Darcy Bussell in the pas de deux from Agon (with Lindsay Fischer), proving that she is a born Balanchine dancer. In Who Cares? Viviana Durante danced 'The Man I Love' with Robert LaFosse and Elizabeth Loscavio (San Francisco) spun vertiginously through 'My One and Only.' At the end dancers and audience joined in a vodka toast to Mr B. The waiter with the drinks for Peter Martins, Lincoln Kirstein and Jerome Robbins was none other than Mikhail Baryshnikov. As Clement Crisp indicated, the heroines of this extraordinary marathon were Kyra Nichols and Darci Kistler, to whom I would add Nichol Hlinka, who gave a delicious account of Donizetti Variations with Nikolaj Haabbe, the company's latest Danish recruit and of Columbine in Harlequinade, opposite a mercurial Damian Woetzel, and, with Peter Boal, realised all the tragic poetry of the Divertimento from 'Le Baiser de la fee'. It must be added that some ballets were sadly undercast, most conspicuously when Nilas Martins, the son of Peter Martins, ballet master in chief, attempted roles like Orpheus and Apollo. There is a dwindling number of dancers in the principal ranks who knew Balanchine. The next generation will come from the School of American Ballet, whose senior students also danced a selection of Balanchine excerpts in this year's 'Workshop' performances, as well as one complete ballet, Symphonie Concertante, in acknowledgment of the fact that it was originally made for the school, in 1945. Nearly 50 years later, the very promising Rachel Rutherford and Tara Keim danced the leading roles. Rutherford, partnered by the elegant Peter Hansen, was also ravishing in 'Tales from the Vienna Woods' from Vienna Waltzes. Symphonie Concertante was also in the repertory of American Ballet Theatre this year at the Metropolitan Opera House. Kevin McKenzie, the highly respected dancer who has taken over the artistic direction, announced before the season that he intended to take the company back to its old policy of emphasising the 'theatre' aspect of the company's title. No brand-new works were given, but the company took into its repertory Kenneth MacMillan's Manon and Christian Holder's Les Liaisons dangereuses. Concerning the latter, I can only echo Clement Crisp's remark about Glen Tetley's La Ronde: 'it lasts - was that all? - 50 minutes.' Manon is probably the best of MacMillan's full-length ballets, certainly the one most accessible to companies other than the Royal Ballet. Alessandra Ferri and Cynthia Harvey have both danced the title role there, and are thoroughly at home in it. Ferri was partnered by Julio Bocca, not the subtlest of dance actors. But the supporting company, led by such artists as Gil Boggs and Robert Wallace (who both danced Lescaut), Kathleen Moore, Victor Barbee, and Ethan Brown, showed that they can form an acting ensemble worthy of comparison with the Royal Ballet itself. The revival of David Blair's production of Swan Lake looked rather dated, but it is at least a straightforward rendering of the traditional choreography. Nina Ananiashvili and Bocca gave it the old fashioned star treatment, neither to their own nor to the ballet's advantage. Otherwise, it was the ballets with the highest dance values that came off best, notably Ashton's Symphonic Variations and Mark Morris's Drink to me only with thine eyes. Another Mark Morris work was seen in the brief season at the City Center of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens: Paukenschlag, to Haydn's Symphony No. 94 (the 'Surprise'). Morris is sometimes criticised for being too close to the music, but what he does in a ballet like this is wittily and inventively to clarify the music's structure. Morris has been busily turning out new pieces for his own company, which will be seen later in the summer at Edinburgh.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Another six Katyusha volleys were fired at the  Galilee overnight. There were no casualties and no damage was  caused. Residents of the northern towns spent the night in  shelters.    Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that IDF [Israel  Defense  Forces] contingents, including convoys of tanks and artillery,  moved overnight toward the northern border.    Our monitor Mikha'el Gurdus reports that Radio Beirut  reported that the IDF shelled areas north of the security zone  last night and that Israeli helicopter gunships carried out  overflights, mainly over Tyre. The sites shelled by the IDF  artillery are the locations the Katyusha rockets were launched  from.</p>

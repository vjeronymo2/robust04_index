			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BM heads for Pounds 30m loss and sharply higher debts BM GROUP, the construction equipment group that has lost nearly 90 per cent of its market value since last June, is heading for a pre-tax loss of at least Pounds 30m this year and much bigger-than-expected debts. The bad news and a survival plan will be announced shortly, alongside results for the six months to December 31. The interims are expected to show a slide in pre-tax profit from Pounds 17m to about Pounds 8m as sales have fallen 10 to 15 per cent below budget. The interim dividend, 2.1p last time, is likely to be cut. But the impact of a root-and-branch review being carried out under new chairman Mr Moger Woolley will be felt in the full-year figures, which in 1991/92 showed a record pre-tax profit of Pounds 34.6m on sales of Pounds 519.5m. By the June year-end, the group is expected to breach banking covenants on interest cover - which is supposed to be three times - and on gearing. The latest estimates are that interest costs of roughly Pounds 15m will reduce profit to less than Pounds 10m before Pounds 40m of exceptional charges. About Pounds 13m of these have already been announced following the disposals of the lossmaking Blackwood Hodge UK and Spain. Other costs include extensive restructuring and redundancies at Blackwood Hodge Canada, at Benford, the Warwickshire-based manufacturer, and at Wadkin, which makes woodworking machines. Tax, dividends and further balance sheet reductions, including a write-down in the value of the pension fund, are set to reduce shareholders' funds from Pounds 171m to about Pounds 120m. Net debt is expected to be at least that, compared with Pounds 61m last June, giving gearing of 100 per cent plus. The survival plan includes slimming down the group to less than Pounds 400m turnover. Among the planned disposals are a 75 per cent stake in British Building and Engineering Appliances. BM grew rapidly under its founding chairman Mr Roger Shute, who resigned through ill health last June, precipitating the share price collapse. BM had acquired two troubled companies in the previous two years, Blackwood Hodge in November 1990 and Thomas Robinson in January 1992. Market value peaked at nearly Pounds 460m early last year. At last night's closing price of 47p it was about Pounds 52m. Mr Woolley was appointed last October and brought in Robert Fleming as financial advisers and Price Waterhouse as auditors to help conduct the review.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias left for Tehran  at 1000 today on a two-day visit to Iran. The foreign minister  will then proceed to Istanbul where he will participate in the  spring conference of NATO foreign ministers on 9-10 June.    In a statement made shortly before leaving for Tehran, the  foreign minister described these upcoming visits as very  interesting. Concerning his visit to Iran, Mr. Papoulias  stressed that it is in the mutual interest of both countries to  maintain and develop their existing good relations. He added  that Iran is a strategic area, a regional power with influence  in the area and that Greek foreign policy is interested in this  broader region.    The foreign minister also noted that he will met with  Turkish  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin on the sidelines of the NATO  foreign ministers conference in Istanbul. Responding to a  journalist's question on whether there has been any Turkish  reaction to the Patriarchate's demand for greater security and  what his comment is on this demand, the foreign minister said:  The demand is certainly justified after the recent terrorist  attacks against the Patriarchate. You know that the Greek  Government has reacted strongly in all directions. We also  protested to the European Union about this situation. I think  this issue will be one of the main topics of discussion with Mr.  Cetin. Mr. Papoulias concluded: We certainly have every reason  to demand this reinforced safety of the Patriarchate.</p>

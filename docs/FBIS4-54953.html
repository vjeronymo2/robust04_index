			<p>BFN     [Text] The leaders of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]  are not blaming anyone for the fact that the party gave a weak  perfomance in the first round of the elections. On the  contrary, what they are focusing on is that in three weeks' time  they should be able to get the majority of their remaining  candidates into parliament. Edit Nagy reports:    [Nagy] The MDF wishes to head a national coalition of forces  that could turn around the power relations which emerged after  the first round of the elections, said Spokesman Karoly Herenyi,  who added: That is why the MDF wishes, possibly, to conclude  local agreements with the Christian Democratic People's Party  [KDNP] and the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP].    Karoly Herenyi said that the forging ahead of the left wing  is unstoppable in the east central European countries and that  in our country this was not caused by the MDF's campaign or its  four years of government. As a result of the unpopular measures  which were taken, questions arose in people's minds which four  years were not enough to answer.    It was said about the further tasks of the MDF that their  aim  is to get at least two-thirds of the remaining 100 candidates  into parliament. They will work out the strategy for this in  the coming days. Karoly Herenyi also drew attention to the fact  that there was no debate during the evaluation of the first  round at the [MDF] presidium session; they did not blame anyone  for the results and they do not fear a party split, either.</p>

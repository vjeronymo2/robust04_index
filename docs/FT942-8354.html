			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Computer Associates to acquire Ask Group Computer Associates, one of the largest software groups, is to acquire the Ask Group, a California company that specialises in software for manufacturing systems and database management, for about Dollars 300m in cash. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Computer Associates will offer to purchase all outstanding shares of the Ask Group for Dollars 13.25 per share, a premium of Dollars 4.25 over the pre-offer share price of Dollars 9. Following the tender offer, any Ask shares not owned by Computer Associates will be converted into the right to receive Dollars 13.25 per share in cash. The agreement has been approved by directors of both companies. EDS and Hewlett-Packard, the two largest shareholders of the Ask Group, have agreed to tender their shares, representing a total of 27 per cent of the outstanding shares. 'The ASK/CA combination is the best possible outcome for the employees, shareholders and customers of ASK, and we look forward to working with CA,' said Mr Eric Carlson, Ask chief executive. Ask has gone through a series of top management changes over the past three years as it struggled to achieve sustained profits. The company recorded heavy losses, after charges, in fiscal 1992 and slim profits of Dollars 149,000, or 1 cent per share, in 1993 on revenues of Dollars 426m. The company employs about 2,000 people but is restructuring operations and cutting its workforce. Computer Associates, which has grown to become one of the world's largest software companies through acquisitions, has about 7,000 employees and reported revenues of over Dollars 2bn for 1993. 'We're excited to have the opportunity to include the Ask people, products and clients in the CA family,' said Mr Charles Wang, chairman and chief executive.</p>

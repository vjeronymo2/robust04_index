			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Commenting on the U.S. stance,  which is trying to abort and obstruct the attempts being made by  Lebanon and other states to secure a resolution from the UN  Security Council condemning "Israel" for its attacks on Lebanon,  the latest of which was the savage raid on al-Biqa' on 2 June,  Hizballah issued the following statement:    Following the massacre that the Zionist enemy committed  against our people, who want to live in freedom and dignity, we  are not surprised by the recent U.S. positions, which form a  political and diplomatic shield for the enemy. The enemy's  violation of the land and people; its resorting to acts of  kidnapping, murder, and destruction; its breaching all  international laws, norms, and charters; its pursuit of a policy  of organized terrorism and brutal aggression against our nation;  and its disregard for world public opinion are all the result of  its feeling of impunity under the U.S. umbrella. The United  States pays no attention to laws and human rights slogans when  the issue concerns "Israel's" violations and attacks.    The justifications used by the U.S. Administration to  prevent  the condemnation of "Israel" are based on the need to continue  the peace talks and to disregard anything that might obstruct or  jeopardize these talks. This means releasing "Israel's" hand to  commit more crimes and attacks as long as the victim has no  right to complain and the international community is not obliged  to condemn the aggressor. This also means the shedding of more  of our blood and our people's blood on the altar of  negotiations. Concern for continuing these negotiations has  become a cover and a justification for the continuing and  unrelenting Israeli aggression. All this is taking place under  the shadow of a domineering and tyrannical U.S. policy that is  persistently trying to control UN bodies and organizations  including the UN General Assembly. The United States wants to  use the United Nations to serve its policy and to make it an  obedient tool condoning the injustice and aggression practiced  by "Israel" with U.S. support and protection. The United States  has disregarded all international rules and norms and has  adopted a policy of double standards. This is proved by the  United States not applying the same international rules and laws  on "Israel" that it firmly applies in other regions and  countries.    The U.S. claim that what is taking place is between "Israel"  and Hizballah and does not concern the Lebanese Government is a  false claim. It can be refuted by the wonderful solidarity  displayed toward the Resistance and with which Lebanon--its  Government, political forces, and people, with their various  groups and tendencies--responded to the Israeli crime. This  proves that the Resistance has become the mecca of all  Lebanon--Government, parties, and people. This Resistance is  the truest expression of the entire Lebanese people's rejection  of the Israeli occupation and their position, standing in one  trench in confronting it and foiling its plans against the land,  sovereignty, civil peace, and all the foundations of national  unity among all the Lebanese.    We ask: How long will decisions be imposed on people and how  long will injustice and aggression be practiced against them?  How long will international political and economic  organizations remain hostage to the United States such that they  have become establishments and offices appended to the U.S.  State Department?</p>

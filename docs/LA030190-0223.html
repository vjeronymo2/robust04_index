			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNHERALDED MULLER OUSTS TOP-SEEDED EDBERG IN INDOOR TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> Top-seeded Stefan Edberg became the latest upset victim at the Volvo Indoor  tennis tournament Wednesday night as unheralded Gary Muller stopped the world's  No. 3 player, 6-1, 7-5.  </P> <P> Muller kept Edberg pinned to the baseline for most of the night as he used a  low-bouncing serve and an assortment of strong passing shots to post the most  impressive victory of his seven-year professional career.  </P> <P> "I felt confident going into the match," Muller said. "I actually felt like I  had a good chance."  </P> <P> The second-round match with Muller was the first for Edberg since a stomach  injury forced him to retire in the finals of the Australian Open.  </P> <P> "I knew I would have a problem," Edberg said. "I haven't played that well (in  practice) since Australia.  </P> <P> "The problem is not really hitting the ball. It's getting to it and then  putting something into it.  </P> <P> "Muller was on tonight. He played good tennis. he took advantage of my  mistakes. That's why he won."  </P> <P> Muller said the key to his victory was putting constant pressure on Edberg.  </P> <P> "He wasn't able to gain any confidence early," Muller said. "I served fairly  well and I didn't make any stupid errors. I kept my game together."  </P> <P> Muller built a 5-0 lead before closing out the opening set with an ace.  </P> <P> After trading service breaks with Edberg in the second set, the South African  regained the edge in the 11th game when Edberg followed his serve to the net  and then was unable to push a backhand into play, putting Muller up, 6-5.  </P> <P> Muller served out the match at love, grabbing the victory when Edberg netted a  running forehand.  </P> <P> Edberg's loss left third-seeded Andrei Chesnokov as the highest-seeded player  left in the tournament.  </P> <P> Michael Chang, the No. 2 seed, was bumped from the tournament on Tuesday night  by Glenn Layendecker.  </P> <P> Chesnokov survived a brief first-set rally by Roger Smith before settling down  for a 6-4, 6-4 victory.  </P> <P> "I think I played my best game this year," said Chesnokov, ranked 19th in the  world. "I had a good (service) return and I feel perfect."  </P> <P> In other matches, seventh-seeded Marcelo Filippini of Uruguay defeated Brian  Page, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3); West Germany's Michael Stich topped New Zealand's Kelly  Evernden, 6-1, 6-2; qualifier Danie Visser eliminated No. 9 Paul Annacone, 7-5,  6-7 (7-9), 6-4; and No. 12 Richey Reneberg beat Ken Flack, 6-3, 6-2.  </P> <P> Malivai Washington, a former University of Michigan All-American, defeated  fifth-seeded Christo Van Rensburg, 6-4, 6-4, and Wally Masur of Australia  topped Uruguay's Diego Perez, 6-2, 6-3.  </P> <P> Australian Darren Cahill had been worrying that his game was falling apart, but  he put enough of the pieces together to top Tim Wilkison, 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-0),  7-5.  </P> <P> "I haven't been playing well lately and to get out of a match like that has to  be helpful," Cahill said after his three-hour battle with Wilkison.  </P></p>

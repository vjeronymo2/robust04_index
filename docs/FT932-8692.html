			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Technology: Generating a new alliance - Westinghouse and Rolls-Royce are both benefiting from a wide-ranging partnership Over the past year, not everyone on the crowded flights from the UK to Orlando, Florida has been heading for Disneyworld, Cape Kennedy or the sunshine state's other big attractions. For executives from Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, the journey ends in a somewhat confusing ride down Ingenuity Drive and Strategy Boulevard. In an empty scrubland that will one day be a high-powered industrial area - hence the names - their destination is the headquarters of Westinghouse Electric's power generation business. Westinghouse officials have been travelling in the other direction, to London and Newcastle, as the two companies develop a relationship that began in the earliest days of the modern power equipment industry but took on new meaning last June. That was when Westinghouse and Rolls-Royce announced a 15-year agreement aimed at strengthening both companies in the highly competitive worldwide power generation equipment business. The deal was one of the most important recent tie-ups in the power equipment industry and covers technology transfer, joint development of combustion turbine technology and marketing of combustion turbines and combined-cycle power plants. It is early days yet, but the new co-operation looks to have made a good start, even if the tangible results so far are just one contract. Last autumn, the Tennessee Valley Authority gave the partnership an order for two replacement generators to be built by Westinghouse and four steam turbine rotors to be built by Rolls-Royce, with Westinghouse installing and servicing the equipment. This may sound prosaic, but it was the kind of order that the UK company would have found hard to share in had it been bidding without a US partner. A large retrofit such as this also opens the way to other business in the replacement market in the US, says Richard Maudslay, managing director of Rolls-Royce's industrial power group. But the agreement is nothing if not wide-ranging and, behind the scenes, cross-border activity has been intensified since June, with a clutch of inter-company groups set up to push the co-operation forward. Common purchasing of components has already begun and in both companies there has been a big management effort to spread involvement in the tie-up into middle-management and the manufacturing workforce. As executives in several disciplines work out how to make the tie-up effective, its rationale is becoming increasingly clear. As with all good industrial link-ups, both companies need each other - for technology and market presence. 'No one company is going to be able to do everything to stay competitive in this business. Because we had totally different portfolios, we realised we could work together,' says Frank Bakos, vice-president and general manager of the Westinghouse power generation business unit. 'There are some very positive benefits from the agreement,' says Maudslay. 'With our different products we can balance out each other's weaknesses.' Technology transfer via licensing or other agreements has long been an integral part of the power equipment industry; Westinghouse's early steam turbines, for example, were based on designs by Sir Charles Parsons, the 19th century inventor of steam turbines. Westinghouse has had a series of agreements with Mitsubishi companies in Japan stretching back to a 1923 generators deal with Mitsubishi Electric. In combustion turbines, it has co-operated with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries since 1961, and has a similar co-operation with FiatAvio of Italy which dates from 1954. In their early days, the deals with the Japanese were 'somewhat tutorial', according to Bakos, but have lately taken on a more balanced look as the Japanese expertise in the design and production of turbines developed. The trilateral alliance between the US, Japan and Italian companies has now become a fully-fledged network. MHI is producing the largest turbines within the group, the 701F model which can produce up to 220MW for 50 Hz markets such as Japan. But Westinghouse recognised in the late 1980s that its single biggest liability was lack of access to the aero-engine technology that its big rival General Electric has used with some success in developing its land-based gas turbines. The Orlando company searched for the aero-technology it needed, although, says Bakos, it was a period when it was being wooed as well as wooing. Apart from GE, the only other leading aero-engine producers are Pratt &amp; Whitney, which is working with Siemens on a new heavy-duty gas turbine for the end of next year, and Rolls-Royce. The key to the successful transfer of aero-engine technology to large-scale electric power generation is to incorporate those elements which can help improve efficiency and output without jeopardising reliability or adding excessively to costs. So one of the most important tasks for the teams from Orlando and Newcastle is to work out what can be used in the next generation of Westinghouse gas turbines, which could be launched in the second half of the 1990s. John Kessinger, a Westinghouse power generation executive with responsibility for strategic alliance products, points out that new materials or designs that make aero-engines lighter may not be relevant. Alternatively, some aero-derivative technology will be relevant but would only be cost-effective if produced in very large numbers. However, some of the work done on designs of aero-turbines and compressors will be very valuable, he says. Designs for turbine blades, vanes and transmission pieces, some of the aero-derived cooling technologies, new materials and design techniques such as computational fluid dynamics could all be useful. 'We're still in the middle of trying to figure out what makes sense for us,' says Kessinger. For Rolls-Royce, a clear advantage of this development is that it gains access not only to Westinghouse's existing heavy duty gas turbines, but to a new generation enhanced by its aero-derived technology. Coupled with Westinghouse's technology in combined cycle power (the increasingly popular gas turbine/steam generator/steam turbine combination), this strengthens the UK company in markets where it has a stronger presence than its US partner. But the deal is also important for both companies at the smaller end of the combustion turbine market. Rolls-Royce already has the industrial version of its RB211 engine, which generates about 28MW of power, but is committed to developing a 50MW industrial version of its forthcoming Trent engine. This version should be ready at the beginning of 1996, says Maudslay. Maudslay wants both these engines to be strongly marketed in North America, and it is better to do that with a US link, he says. At Westinghouse, Reg McIntyre, general manager for combustion turbines, says: 'We keep pressing them on the Trent engine.' With Westinghouse's help, it could become the centrepiece of a highly-efficient 70-75MW combined cycle plant. The two companies are also working on developing steam turbine technology, a more mature and more crowded market than that for gas turbines. 'It did not make sense for each to develop its own products independently,' says Maudslay. As a result of the tie-up, the Westinghouse power generation business is emerging as the focal point for a technology interchange involving, on the one hand, Rolls-Royce and, on the other, the US company's alliances in Japan, Italy and 10 other countries. For Bakos, that is tantamount to having access to 9,000 engineers worldwide working on steam or combustion turbines. Getting this 'great global engineering department' to work is worth the effort, he says. It has a combined annual research and development budget in excess of 30 per cent of the company's power generation sales - and no one in engineering could afford that amount of spending alone.</p>

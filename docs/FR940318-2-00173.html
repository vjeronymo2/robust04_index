			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, OSHA has determined that the State's amendments for Fixed and Portable Power Tool Requirements are at least as effective as the Federal amendment. The Fixed and Portable Power Tool Requirements amendment has been in effect since September 13, 1983 with a broader scope that applied these requirements to the processing of all materials. A 1991 amendment reduced the scope, but it is still broader than the Federal. During this time OSHA has received no indication of significant objection to this different State standard either as to its effectiveness in comparison to the Federal standards or as to its conformance with the product clause requirements of section 18(c)(2) of the Act. (A different State standard applicable to a product which is distributed or used in interstate commerce must be required by compelling local conditions and not unduly burden interstate commerce.) OSHA therefore approves these amendments; however, the right to reconsider this approval is reserved should substantial objections be submitted to the Assistant Secretary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Location of Supplements for Inspection and Copying. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A copy of the standards supplements, along with the approved plan, may be inspected and copied during normal business hours at the following locations: Office of the Regional Administrator, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 1111 Third Avenue, Suite 715, Seattle, Washington 98101&hyph;3212; State of Washington Department of Labor and Industries, Division of Industrial Safety and Health, 7273 Linderson Way, SW., Tumwater, Washington 98501; and the Office of State Programs, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, room N&hyph;3700, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public Participation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c), the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process or for other good cause which may be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds that good cause exists for not publishing these supplements to the Washington State Plan as a proposed change and making the Regional Administrator's approval effective upon publication for the following reason: The standards were adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of State law and further public participation would be repetitious. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This decision is effective March 18, 1994.

L. 91&hyph;596, 84 Stat. 1608 [29 U.S.C. 667]). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed at Seattle, Washington, this 24th day of November 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard S.

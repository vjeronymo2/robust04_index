New forms of management were created, entrepreneurship  developed, and enterprises and organizations were privatized.    In industry there was no further deepening of the decline of  production, and the output of foodstuffs increased. In  agriculture the production of animal husbandry products grew  steadily, and the productivity of livestock increased.    Implementation of the state program for targeted social  protection of the population stabilized the standard of living.  The growth rates of the monetary incomes of the population  outstripped the growth of consumer prices. There was an increase  in the consumption of certain basic food products.    But the economic reforms are proceeding with difficulty. The  crisis of mutual nonpayments has become more severe. Some  productions have shut down. The production volume has decreased  in many branches of industry except for flour-cereal and  manufactured concentrated feeds, printing, forestry, wood  processing, and pulp and paper. The volume of cargo shipments  has decreased.    In spite of the reduction of the inflation level as compared  to 1992, it is still fairly high. The commodity supply on the  consumer market is decreasing. While foreign economic activity  is expanding, the commodity structure of exports is  deteriorating. The volume of paid services offered has decreased  considerably.    Against a background of a relatively low level of officially  registered unemployment, there has been an accumulation of  concealed unemployment.  <H5>  Indexes, Prices, and Rates </H5>   During 1993 there was a steady rise of consumer prices in  the  republic. There was a ninefold increase in the price of  foodstuffs, nonfoodstuffs--7.5-fold, and paid  services--24.2-fold. Compared to December of the preceding year  the prices of meat and poultry increased 13.3-fold, sausage  items--11.7-fold, eggs--12.2- fold, vegetables--16.4-fold,  margarine products--14.4-fold, and fruits--8.8-fold. Prices at  the city markets increased 10.2-fold during this same period,  including for crop growing products--10.9-fold, and animal  husbandry products--12.1-fold.    The cost of a selection of the 19 most important food  products in December was (taking the market into account) 22,390  rubles [R] and it increased 8.5-fold as compared to December  1992.    Prices of nonfoodstuffs increased 11.7-fold as  compared to December 1992; fabric prices increased 7.5-fold,  leather and textile footwear--12.6-fold, woolen  fabrics--8.1-fold, clothing and linen--12.5-fold, and  construction materials--9.9-fold. Prices of durable goods  increased 9.5-fold, including: rugs--6.6-fold, furniture--  13.4-fold, and fur items--10.4-fold.    Prices and rates of consumer services increased  13-fold as compared to December 1992, transportation  services--ninefold, housing and municipal services--10-fold,  cultural institutions--23.7-fold, and services of a legal nature  and of banking institutions--20.6 percent.    By the end of 1993 there was a retardation of the growth of  prices from the producers, which was influenced by the growing  shortage of monetary funds among the majority of consumers of  industrial products. As compared to December 1992, the highest  rates of growth of prices were observed in the following  branches: electric energy--16.1-fold, ferrous  metallurgy--11.6-fold, electrical engineering--11-fold, and  meat--15.3-fold.  <H5>  The Standard of Living </H5>   The monetary incomes of the population in December amounted  to a total of R272 billion and had increased 9.6-fold as  compared to the same period of 1992. This came to R72,800 per  capita.    The average amount of wages paid to workers in December 1993  was R128,100, a 9.5-fold increase as compared to the same period  of 1992, including in industry, where it reached R118,100,  agriculture--R113,700, construction--R189,100,  transportation--R174,900, public education--R82,600, culture and  art--R72,100, and public health--R99,900.    The subsistence minimum (Footnote 1) (The  subsistence minimum was calculated on the basis of the  methodology of the Russian Federation Ministry of Labor.  According to it the subsistence minimum includes: Costs of food  products based on the minimum amounts of their consumption  determined by the Institute of Nutrition of the Russian Academy  of Medical Sciences, the Institute of Socioeconomic Problems of  the Population of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the  Ministry of Labor of Russia; expenditures on nonfoodstuffs and  services, and also taxes and mandatory payments, based on the  structure of expenditures on them among the 10 percent of the  least well-off families.) on average per one resident increased  10.2-fold as compared to December 1992 and amounted to R24,900.  In 1993 there was a rise in the level of consumption of meat and  meat products, fish, fruits and berries, sugar, vegetable oil,  and other fats, while there was a reduction of the level of  consumption of grain products, dairy products, and vegetables  (except potatoes).    The overall number of citizens registered with the  employment  service who were not engaged in labor activity as of 1 January  1994 was 12,800 individuals, 3,800 people, or 0.23 percent of  the economically active population, had the official status of  unemployed. About 100,000 people are working part time and are  potentially unemployed.    According to a preliminary estimate, the population of the  republic as of the beginning of 1994 amounted to 3.749 million.  The reduction of the number was caused by unfavorable changes in  the processes of natural reproduction: The level of the death  rate (11.8 per 1,000 population) exceeds the level of the birth  rate (11 per 1,000 population).    In 1993 there were positive aspects in the marriage and  divorce processes: The number of marriages increased and the  divorce rates slowed up.    Education. As of the beginning of the current  school year there were 2,504 general educational schools in the  republic, in which 551,800 children were studying. There are  90,700 children studying in 457 schools with in-depth study of  subjects, including 87 gymnasiums and 28 lyceums. There are  seven nonstate schools in operation. In the republic 23 percent  of the students attend the second shift and 10 schools conduct  classes on three shifts.    There are 63,800 students in the 16 higher educational  institutions and three branches, and 53,700 students in 65  secondary specialized educational institutions and five  branches. Four nonstate VUZ's [higher educational institutions]  have received licenses and 1,075 individuals are studying in  them.    The ecological situation. During 1993 there was a  certain reduction of discharges of pollutants into the  atmosphere and bodies of water, primarily because of the decline  of industrial production. In 1993 there were nine cases of  surging and emergency discharges and overflows of pollutants  into the atmosphere, bodies of water, and land.    The consumer market. The retail commodity turnover  of officially registered enterprises of state and cooperative  trade, including public catering, during 1993 amounted to R866.9  billion and had increased ninefold in actual prices as compared  to the preceding year. The actual volume of commodity turnover  in comparable prices decreased by 23.1 percent.    Still predominant in trade is the state sector, which  accounted for 64 percent of the retail commodity turnover (in  1992--65 percent), consumers' cooperative enterprises--19  percent (20 percent), and the private sector--11 percent (1  percent), and other nonstate forms of ownership--16 percent (14  percent).    About 55 percent of the retail commodity turnover is in food  products (49 percent in 1992). The volume of sales of canned  meats in 1993 as compared to 1992 increased by 60.4 percent,  canned fish--40.2 percent, fish--12.6 percent, natural tea--21.9  percent, and vegetable oil--19.9 percent. At the same time there  was a reduction of the sale of margarine and margarine products  by 48.3 percent, and meat and poultry--5.8 percent.    In Kazan 5.4 percent less products in comparable prices were  sold during 1993 than during 1992. There was an increase in the  volume of sales of onions--17 percent, mutton--16.8 percent,  chickens--10.9 percent, geese--2.2-fold, and eggs--3.9 percent.  At the same time there was a reduction of the sales volumes of  fresh cabbage (14.8 percent), beets (13 percent), carrots (9.1  percent), apples (18 percent), pork (7.1 percent), fresh milk  (9.7 percent), and sour cream (13.5 percent).    The services market. During 1993 the republic  population received paid services worth R61.8 billion, which in  actual prices is 9.9 times higher than last year's level, but in  comparable prices it is 35.6 percent less.    The volume of sales of consumer services in the report year  was 8.4 times higher than in the preceding year, but in physical  mass the volume rendered was 39.6 percent less.    There was an increase in the proportion of paid services for  keeping children in preschool institutions, health protection,  and services of a legal nature because of the sharp increases in  prices and rates. The proportion of services of consumer service  enterprises is tending to decrease. A large proportion of the  population has been forced to do without a number of services  because of their high cost.  <H5>  Industry </H5>   During 1993 industrial enterprises produced R3.103 trillion  worth of products in current prices, which is 6.8 times more  than during the preceding year. At the same time the index of  the physical volume of industrial production was 85.1 percent of  the 1992 level.    The process of destatization of enterprises has continued in  industry this year. As of the beginning of 1994 36.7 percent of  the large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, producing  46.5 percent of the industrial output, had a nonstate form of  ownership.    In the fuel and energy complex during 1993 as  compared to the preceding year the extraction of oil decreased  by 14.5 percent, gas--by 14.3 percent, and the production of  electric energy--by 12.9 percent.    In machine building there was a reduction of the  production of compressors (by 26.7 percent), large electrical  machinery (54.5 percent), metal cutting machine tools (20  percent), and trucks (34.9 percent). There was an increase in  the output of passenger vehicles (16.9 percent), and  installations for loading centrifugal electric pumps for  extracting oil (4.9 percent).    In the chemical and petrochemical industry the  output of synthetic resins and plastics increased by 4.6 percent  as compared to 1992 but pipes and parts of thermal plastic  pipelines produced from their basis decreased by 19.4 percent,  and polymer films--by 19.5 percent.    As compared to 1992 there was a considerable reduction of  the  production of synthetic rubbers (27.8 percent), mineral  fertilizers (41.9 percent), medical preparations enjoying high  demand among the population and cardiovascular medications (32.9  percent), and antibiotics (71.1 percent).    In the timber, wood processing, and pulp and paper  industry last year the output of commercial timber  decreased by 5.5 percent as compared to the 1992 level. The  shortage of wood raw material led to a reduction of the  production of window and door frames (by 43.3 percent), and  plant manufactured houses (6.4 percent). There was an increase  in the output of paper (by 39.8 percent) and cardboard (0.9  percent).    In the construction materials industry in 1993  there was a reduction as compared to the 1992 level of the  production of construction brick--17.3 percent, linoleum--13.6  percent, prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and  parts--13.1 percent.    At enterprises of light industry there was a  reduction of the production of cotton fabrics--by 13.3 percent,  knitted items--11.7 percent, and footwear--by 25.4 percent.    A more favorable situation has developed on the market for  goods for cultural and domestic purposes and household use;  there was an increase in the output of refrigerators--by 9.2  percent. During the course of the conversion enterprises of the  defense branch assimilated and began to produce freezers,  electric mixers, grills, electric irons, telephones, ogonek  fireplaces, stoves with numerical program control, etc.    In the food industry the production of meat,  including subproducts of category I, butter, fatty cheeses,  granulated sugar, cereals, confectionery items, nonalcoholic  beverages, and mineral water exceeded the 1992 level.    Among the nonfoodstuffs in daily demand there was a  reduction  as compared to 1992 in the output of toilet soap (51.5 percent),  household soap (27.3 percent), and detergents (17.2 percent).  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   The reregistration of kolkhozes and sovkhozes begun in 1992  is continuing. Kolkhozes and sovkhozes are still the main  organizational form of management in rural areas of the  republic. The number of farmer-run farms has increased and the  allotment of land for collective gardening and orchard raising  has continued.    In animal husbandry there has been a considerable increase  in  the delivery of products from farms of agricultural enterprises  and also from private yards of the citizens. During 1993 the  sale of cattle and poultry for slaughter increased, according to  calculations, by 3 percent, and milk--by 7 percent. Egg  production was at practically the same level as the preceding  year.    The increase in the volume of production of animal husbandry  products was brought about mainly by the increased productivity  of the livestock. The average annual milk yield per cow on the  kolkhozes and sovkhozes increased in 1993 by 8.1 percent, and  eggs from one laying hen--by 1.3 percent, and there was an  increase in the average daily weight gains of cattle and hogs.

The volume of investments dropped as compared to 1992 by 5.5  percent in comparable prices.    An amount of R475.3 billion was invested in the construction  of production facilities, and their proportion of the overall  volume decreased somewhat, amounting to 65 percent. Fixed  capital valued at R337.1 billion was put into operation.    Capital investments of R257.7 billion went for the  construction of nonproduction facilities. Of this amount, 59  percent was used for housing construction, 8.2 percent--for  construction of general educational schools, and 5.4  percent--for construction of public health facilities.    Last year residential buildings were constructed with an  overall area of 1,274,700 square meters, which is 12.2 percent  less than in 1992, and 60 percent of the housing was constructed  by enterprises of the state sector.    From all sources of financing the following were put into  operation in the republic: general educational schools to  accommodate 9,800 (63.4 percent of the 1992 level), preschool  institutions to accommodate 3,000 (73.4 percent), hospitals with  400 beds (113 percent), outpatient polyclinic institutions for  1,500 visits per shift (9[figure illegible].1 percent), and  clubs and houses of culture to accommodate 4,600 (114.9 percent).  <H5>  Transportation and Communications </H5>   In 1993 all kinds of general purpose transportation  transported 88.5 million tonnes of cargo, including rail--15.3  million tonnes, automotive--20.8 million tonnes, river--17.8  million tonnes, air--0.03 million tonnes, and pipeline--34.6  million tonnes.

The movement of  passengers increased only on rail transportation.    Communications enterprises rendered R27.5 billion in  services, including consumer services--R3.8 billion.  <H5>  Foreign Economic Activity </H5>   The volume of export-import operations of enterprises and  organizations of the republic of Tatarstan through direct ties  amounted to $948.5 million and increased by 45.9 percent.  Exports from enterprises and organizations amounted to a total  of $761.1 million and increased by 73.3 percent.

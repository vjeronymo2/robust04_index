			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIDEAST FEARS PUT STOCKS INTO WORLDWIDE DIVE;  </P> <P> MARKETS: TOKYO'S EXCHANGE PLUNGED 5.8%, THE FOURTH-BIGGEST ONE-DAY DROP IN  HISTORY; THE DOW FELL 3%. OIL PRICES SKYROCKETED TOO.  </P> <P> Fearing that a Mideast war would cause economic chaos for much of the  industrialized world, investors continued to bail out of stock markets from New  York to Singapore on Thursday, sending prices on nearly every major exchange to  their lowest levels in at least a year.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 76.73 points, or 3%, to close at  2,483.42 -- the lowest close since July, 1989. But the selloff was nothing  compared to the rout in Tokyo's market, where the value of the Nikkei stock  index fell 5.8% -- the fourth-biggest one-day drop in history.  </P> <P> Fears of war in the Mideast also sent oil prices rocketing. The price of the  benchmark U.S. crude rose 71 cents Thursday in New York to $31.93 a barrel, the  highest level in seven years.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, long-term interest rates soared anew as investors dumped bonds.  </P> <P> "At some point, everyone (in the stock market) rushes for the exit, and some  people get trampled," said Michael Metz, market strategist at Oppenheimer &amp;  Co. in New York.  </P> <P> By the end of the day, U.S. stocks were worth $95 billion less than they had  been the day before. Share values have slid by more than $500 billion since  July, when prices peaked, according to Wilshire Associates, a Los Angeles firm  that tracks the value of shares traded on the nation's largest exchanges.  </P> <P> The rise in oil prices was a major factor in the stock selloff. Investors  believe that petroleum production in Saudi Arabia and other Mideast nations  could be abruptly curtailed if war breaks out between the United States and  Iraq. That would send oil prices and inflation soaring, which could cause  economic problems in any nation that depends on petroleum imports.  </P> <P> Fears of such a scenario rippled through market after market Thursday. In  Frankfurt, the DAX 30-stock index fell 3.5%, and, in London, the value of the  FT-SE 100-stock index slid 1.4%. The Paris CAC 40-stock index closed down 2.1%  and the Hong Kong market tumbled 2.9%.  </P> <P> The Japanese market's plunge took the Nikkei average of 225 stocks down  1,473.28, to close at 23,737.63. The Nikkei had not been below 24,000 since  February, 1988.  </P> <P> In early Friday trading, Japanese stocks turned up, rising 607.62 on the  Nikkei, on reports of Iraqi troop pullbacks. But analysts said the  bargain-hunting was unlikely to last.  </P> <P> The continuing drop of stock prices in the United States prompted some U.S.  firms to announce plans to buy back some of their shares. Fannie Mae, the  government-sponsored, publicly held firm that buys mortgages from lenders,  announced plans for a buyback, as did Intel Corp., the big computer chip maker.  </P> <P> U.S. market analysts said investors have become increasingly hesitant to hold  stocks because many believe that a war with Iraq is imminent. "There were no  peaceful sounds yesterday," said Michael Sherman, chief investment strategist  at Shearson Lehman Bros. in New York.  </P> <P> Although war always makes investors nervous, a war in the Middle East is  particularly worrisome because it would probably affect worldwide oil supplies  and prices. Rising oil prices fuel inflation.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates sometime later this year  to help spur the weak economy. But it is believed to have delayed rate cuts  because of fears of oil-driven inflation, and some analysts believe that the  central bank may continue to delay further easing for some weeks.  </P> <P> Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, with 250.4 million shares  changing hands, compared to 175.5 million Wednesday. Only 148 stocks advanced,  while 1,643 fell.  </P> <P> Investors sold virtually everything they could, including the oil and gold  stocks that had rallied in recent weeks on the Mideast crisis. Blue-chip losers  included Boeing, off $2.50 to $42.50; IBM, off $2.125 to $96.875; Procter &amp;  Gamble, off $3 to $71.125, and Exxon, off $1.75 to $49.625.  </P> <P> The broader measures of stock market performance also declined steeply. The  NYSE Composite index fell 5.34 to 168.88, a 3% loss. The NASDAQ Composite index  of over-the-counter stocks plummetted 14.62 to 360.22, down 3.9%.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYBE DODGERS SHOULD WORK A LITTLE HARDER  </P> <P> The more I think about it, the more I believe that last year's Dodger  championship was pure luck.  </P> <P> This year's team has a better pitching staff, with the addition of Mike Morgan,  and a better right side of the infield.  </P> <P> But a winner is not someone who rests on his laurels after one little  championship. Just look at the Lakers.  </P> <P> No one is suggesting that the Dodgers win four consecutive championships, just  that they look as if they want to win four consecutive championships.  </P> <P> GARY ROBERT FENTON  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

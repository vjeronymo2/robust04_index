			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / SmithKline's deal brings an expensive bargain: David Wighton analyses the purchase of Diversified Pharmaceuticals Mr Jan Leschly, chief executive officer of SmithKline Beecham, recently described Merck's purchase of drug distributor Medco last year as 'strategically . . . a stroke of genius'. But he questioned the Dollars 6.7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) price tag. So it should have come as little surprise that SmithKline wants to buy Medco's smaller rival Diversified Pharmaceuticals - or that Mr Leschly argues at only Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) it is a much better deal. Not that it looks a bargain by normal standards. Diversified made an operating profit of just Dollars 39.9m last year. To be fair, Diversified is growing rapidly with profits rising by over 60 per cent last year on more than trebled sales of Dollars 142.1m. But Mr Jean-Pierre Garnier, chairman of SB Pharmaceuticals, says its importance for the group cannot be measured in traditional terms. He simply warns that pharmaceuticals companies without similar deals 'will probably not survive in the increasingly competitive environment'. Mr Leschly sees the move as a vital part of his efforts to move the group from being a 'manufacturer selling pills' to a supplier of 'total pharmaceutical care'. This transformation is deemed necessary because healthcare in the US is moving from one controlled by doctors to one controlled by the payer - a change which has been associated with the creation of two new groups of businesses, health management organisations (HMOs) and pharmaceutical benefit management companies. Both act as intermediaries buying care and drugs on behalf of their customers, which in the case of pharmaceutical benefit management companies are usually HMOs. Mr Leschly says SmithKline's deal is unique in that it involves not only the purchase of a pharmaceutical benefit management company, Diversified, but also close links with its parent United HealthCare, which owns health management organisations with 1.6m members. 'That triangle is essential for the strategic importance of the deal.' SmithKline and United have agreed to a minimum six-year alliance, through which SmithKline will have exclusive rights to data from those 1.6m members. This data will help SmithKline to greater understanding of the cost/benefits of drug use. United will continue to use Diversified for its owned managed care operations. Mr Leschly says the acquisition will 'enhance' the 'presence' of SmithKline's products in the managed care sector yet stresses it will not attempt to force its products through Diversified. 'If we forced them to do certain things it would not be competitive and that would not be in our interests. We want them to continue their fruitful relationship with other manufacturers.' He argues SmithKline will bring benefits to Diversified, including access to its salesforce and specialist clinical knowledge. As for the price, Mr Leschly says SmithKline is paying Dollars 210 for each of the 11m people for whom Diversified directly manages pharmaceutical benefits. On the same basis he says Merck paid more than Dollars 325 a head for Medco. Lex, Page 22</p>

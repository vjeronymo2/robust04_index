			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: STOP PROCRASTINATING; PLAN NOW FOR TAX SAVINGS  </P> <P> Labor Day has passed, summer is over. It's time to stop procrastinating and  focus on how to reduce your tax bill come April 15.  </P> <P> Sure, you have more than three months before year-end. But Christmas is too  late to start planning tax-saving strategies.  </P> <P> Fortunately, Congress has not performed any major surgery on tax laws this past  year, so the steps you used last year generally still apply, says Edward  Rosenson, tax partner in the Century City office of Ernst &amp; Young, the  accounting firm.  </P> <P> "Basic planning is not a whole lot different," Rosenson says.  </P> <P> Here's a checklist of year-end tax strategies you can consider:  </P> <P> * Defer income. By shifting income from this year to next, taxes on it won't be  due until 1992. Consider buying Treasury bills, short-term certificates of  deposit or other investment vehicles whose interest won't be paid until 1991.  Ask your employer to defer bonuses or other supplemental pay. If you are  self-employed, consider delaying billing your clients until January. If you are  selling real estate, consider an installment sale allowing you to receive  payments into the future. One caution: Deferring income could backfire if tax  rates are significantly raised next year.  </P> <P> * Accelerate expenses. Pushing deductions into this year can generate more  deductions sooner, thus reducing your taxable income. Such an outcome is  especially useful if you expect your income to decline next year, you are  retiring or you plan to stop moonlighting.  </P> <P> Make your mortgage payment, ordinarily due in January, in December instead.  Prepay your state estimated tax and property tax.  </P> <P> The same caution applies, however: Accelerating expenses may backfire if tax  rates are significantly increased next year. That would make your deductions  more valuable next year.  </P> <P> * Bunch expenses. There are some expenses you may not want to accelerate.  </P> <P> Take miscellaneous expenses -- including certain employee business costs,  magazine subscriptions, union and professional dues, investment and financial  planning fees. They are deductible only to the extent that they exceed 2% of  your adjusted gross income. Medical expenses are deductible only to the extent  that they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income.  </P> <P> Consequently, estimate how much of these expenses you are likely to incur this  year. If you're unlikely to exceed those thresholds this year, consider  postponing expenses until next year. Conversely, if you will exceed those  thresholds, accelerate expenses that you would have incurred next year.  </P> <P> * Maximize contributions to retirement plans. Put the maximum into your 401(k)  company savings plan. It's arguably the best tax-deferral vehicle around, in  part because companies typically match employee contributions by up to 50%. You  can contribute up to $7,979 this year.  </P> <P> And if you are planning to contribute to your individual retirement account or  Keogh plan, start doing so now. Don't wait until April 15. You'll get more time  to accumulate tax-deferred earnings.  </P> <P> * Reduce your non-mortgage debt. Only 10% of interest paid this year on car  loans, credit cards and other non-mortgage debt is deductible (that falls to  zero next year). Considering that credit card debt is so expensive, with  interest charges as high as 21%, it makes sense to reduce plastic debt.  </P> <P> One way is through a home equity loan or credit line. Interest on loans of up  to $100,000 is fully deductible. But be careful. If you default on a home  equity loan, you could lose your house.  </P> <P> * Plan your charitable contributions. If you have assets such as stock that  have appreciated in value, plan to give those instead of cash. That way you'll  avoid paying capital gains tax. (If you still like the stock, you can buy it  again at the same, higher price, increasing the cost basis upon which future  capital gains taxes will be calculated.)  </P> <P> Also, as another alternative to giving cash, consider giving old furniture,  books and other garage or attic items. In many cases, you can deduct their fair  market value.  </P> <P> If you pay quarterly estimated taxes, consider making charitable contributions  now. That way you might generate deductions sooner to reduce income subject to  estimated tax.  </P> <P> * Plan your capital gains and losses. It's often a bad idea to buy or sell  assets solely on tax considerations. But if you have some big losers from the  stock market, and have other assets on which you'll pay big capital gains tax,  consider whether it makes sense to sell the losers to generate capital losses.  Those losses can be used to offset capital gains dollar for dollar. Also, up to  $3,000 of capital losses per year can be used to offset ordinary income from  wages and salaries.  </P> <P> * Consider gifts to children. The best thing is to give assets that will  appreciate in value, such as growth stocks or real estate. That shifts capital  gains taxes to the youngsters, who presumably are in a lower tax bracket. It  also reduces the size of your estate potentially subject to estate taxes.  </P> <P> You can give up to $10,000 per recipient per year, free of gift taxes. Congress  has been considering limiting the total amount you can give, free of gift  taxes, to $30,000 per year to all recipients. It's far from certain that such a  provision will be enacted. But to play it safe, you might want to make gifts  now instead of later, Rosenson suggests.  </P> <P> * Look at tax-free or tax-deferred investments. In a high tax bracket and need  more tax-free income? Consider such investments as municipal bonds,  tax-deferred annuities and Series EE savings bonds. And California may soon  offer tax-free bonds with face values as low as $1,000.  </P> <P> * Adjust your withholding. If you got a big tax refund last year, adjust your  withholding to eliminate it. That refund was a big interest-free loan to the  government.  </P> <P> Also, adjust your withholding if your situation was changed by marriage or  divorce, a new job, a baby or a new home.  </P></p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Old masters sales boost Parambe Parambe, which deals in investments and works of art, lifted its pre-tax profit from Pounds 66,000 to Pounds 114,000 in 1992. The growth in asset value - the company's principal objective - was 6.3 per cent to 60.8p per share. Dealing income from works of art doubled to Pounds 170,000 in a sluggish market. That was largely the result of sales of old master drawings to a US museum, which was unlikely to be repeated in 1993. However, there were further write-downs of investments in art dealers and a sharp reduction in investment income from that source. Earnings per share rose to 1.27p (0.79p) and the dividend is again 1.1p with a final of 0.55p.</p>

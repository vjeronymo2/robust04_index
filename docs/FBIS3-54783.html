			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Central Election Commission has issued a  decree to explain the provisions of the election law in the  Republic of Kazakhstan; the rights of citizens and public  movements to campaign in favor of this or that candidate; and  ensure strict observation of existing regulations on  pre-election campaigning.    Campaigning is not allowed on the day before voting or on  voting day. It is not permitted to post up election materials  on the premises of a polling station or of a polling district;  to circulate anonymous election materials. People working for  state bodies and the local bodies of self-management are not  allowed to campaign.    Because candidates and their supporters have to make public  speeches to the electorate and put up election posters in order  to campaign for the election, district election commissions  should provide deputies with free halls for election meetings.  The issue of providing deputies with premises should be  examined in five days.    In agreement with a regional television and radio company, a  district election commission should ensure that each candidate  for the Kazakh Supreme Kenges has an opportunity to present his  platform in Kazakh or Russian and place advertisements, provided  he pays for this with the money to be allocated by the Central  Election Commission for his election campaign. Each candidate  will be allocated 10 minutes on the radio and 10 minutes on  television, irrespective of where he works. A speech can be  presented once or repeatedly.    The republic's public movements, which have been registered  by the Law Ministry, are allocated 30 minutes of air time on  Kazakh radio and television [words indistinct]. Self-nominated  candidates are allocated an additional five minutes on regional  and city television or radio. The schedule for allocating  air-time to deputies will be compiled by the leadership of a  regional television and radio company and will be approved by a  district election commission.    The editorial staff of newspapers founded by the regional  administrations and administrations of Almaty and Leninsk, as  well as of other publications, should promptly publish the  background of candidates, their platforms, and pictures [passage  indistinct].    During the election campaign, the mass media should not  favor  this or that candidate, election association, or election  platform.    A law-enforcement body and a district election commission  should call to account those who breach the law on elections by  circulating pre-election reports which do not correspond to  reality and discredit the honor or dignity of a deputy and his  agent.    [Words indistinct] to ensure that each candidate to the  Supreme Kenges enjoys equal conditions in the pre-election  campaign. [passage omitted]</p>

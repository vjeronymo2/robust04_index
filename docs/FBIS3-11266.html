			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon; from the "Evening </F> Information Review" newscast]    [Text] Health should not be used as a political weapon.  This statement acquired unheard of implications when it was  pronounced on 17 March on the floor of the House of  Representatives of the United States, the nation that has held  an economic blockade, which includes food supplies and  medicines, against Cuba for the past three decades.    The demand was presented by (Julie Finesilver) in her  argument against the U.S. siege against Cuba on the occasion of  a draft bill submitted by Democrat Charles Rangel. The  presentation by (Finesilver), a pharmaceutical company  consultant, was the one, among various speakers who participated  before a House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee  subcommission, that caused a great impact. During a marathon  session in which tens of interventions, which also included  positions supporting the blockade against Cuba, were heard, the  insistence of solid arguments, such as those of Congressman Jose  Serrano and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, were evident in  favor of a rational handling of the island. [sentence as heard]    The debate was a solid reflection of the weakened influence  of followers of the so-called Torricelli Law, which is aimed at  intensifying the blockade's impact on 11 million Cubans.  Politicians, businessmen, representatives of the Cuban community  residents in the United States, and other individuals went to  the podium to speak in favor of or against the blockade;  nevertheless, the idea that the Unites States suffers steep  economic losses as its hostility against Cuba prevails was  emphatically reiterated.    One of the most objective arguments was that of (Finesilver)  who, when she displayed a box of PPG [expansion unknown], pills  used in Cuba to lower cholesterol levels, expressed regret the  box was empty, because the blockade prevents North American  citizens from acquiring the product despite its international  recognition.    A devastating truth was felt in the room when the speaker  stated Cuban and North American scientists could work together  if the blockade were lifted. Only because there is a trend in  the United States in favor of lifting the inhuman measures, only  because of this did the U.S. House of Representatives begin  debating such a conflictive issue. Irrefutable opinions such as  those of Mrs. (Finesilver) were heard at that time.</p>

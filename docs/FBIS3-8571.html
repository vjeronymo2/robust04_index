He was referring to the criticism of Poland's position  during the vote on Chinese motion on March 9 in Geneva not to  adopt a resolution on human rights observance in China. Poland  abstained.    Jan Woroniecki from the ministry said that Polish vote was  not a decisive one as the Chinese motion was accepted by 20  votes with 16 votes against.    According to Woroniecki, the situation in China is "very  complex and remote from Poland." He added that China is a big  country and any perturbations would mean different implications  for international security. He also admitted that most probably  China will not look upon the Polish abstention unfavourably.    The resolution on human rights observance in China was  prepared by the European Union countries and aimed to stress the  inadequate protection of religion, culture and ethnic identity  of Tibetans and other minorities. Woroniecki recalled that last  year when China lodged the similar motion, Poland voted against  it. Poland stressed then that it can see changes in China and  hopes they will continue.</p>

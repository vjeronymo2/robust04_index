			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's trade agenda THE announcement of provisional US anti-dumping duties on the steel exports of 19 countries was bound to cause a reaction. What must be avoided however is either an overreaction or the wrong reaction. The priority is to encourage the new US administration in the right overall trade policy direction, with completion of the Uruguay Round the immediate task. This does not mean all is well with anti-dumping. Even Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and self-proclaimed 'cautious activist', admits that 'as currently written and applied, both national and multilateral anti-dumping laws err in the direction of deterring competitive behaviour that is not unfair or predatory'. To put the point more bluntly, the anti-dumping bureaucracy is like the sorcerer's apprentice. The US Commerce Department routinely finds 97 per cent of all foreign companies it investigates guilty of dumping. How do the other 3 per cent escape? There is no reason therefore to doubt the statement by Mr Ron Brown, the new commerce secretary, that these findings, however untimely, are not policy statements' but 'mandated procedures and the result of exhaustive investigations'. It is the fundamental criteria which are wrong. But as an equally enthusiastic user of the anti-dumping remedy, not least for steel, the European Community is in no position to throw the first stone. The sensible reaction would be a shrug of the shoulders. The desirable reaction would be to seek US co-operation in attempts to modify the Gatt code, with the aim of making the underlying economic criteria, which bias the procedure in favour of findings of dumping, less economically irrational. There is, alas, little chance of that. Wrong reaction The wrong reaction, though the most probable, would be for the EC to seek US agreement to a voluntary export restraint on steel, to replace the one terminated by the Bush administration last year. The world does not need further cartelisation of its steel industry. Still less does it need a precedent on which the US automobile industry will pounce. The EC should instead recognise the absurdity of the global anti-dumping conspiracy, as demonstrated in the ludicrous provisional duty of 109.22 per cent imposed on the export of 35,000 tonnes of steel plate by British Steel, and then move on. It should focus instead on encouraging the Clinton administration to develop a sensible trade strategy. The ill-assorted Clinton administration does not know what it wants on trade. Many in Congress and industry do. They want to bash 'unfair' foreigners and 'protect' supposedly endangered American jobs. The multilateral alternative needs to be made credible. Under current law, however, the US administration needs to notify Congress by March 2 that it intends to proceed towards a deal on the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations. This now seems unlikely. Two alternatives The administration has two realistic alternatives: to seek a relatively short but unencumbered extension of its 'fast-track' negotiating authority, with a view to early completion of the round on the basis of what has already been agreed; or to obtain a longer extension, with the aim of reopening large parts of it. Both procedures would be risky. But the second looks like euthanasia for the round. To reopen discussion of such issues as agriculture, intellectual property, anti-dumping, subsidies, standards and the creation of a multilateral trading organisation, when negotiators have not yet agreed on market access, would almost amount to restarting the round. It would call into question both the good faith of the US as a negotiating partner and the credibility of multilateral trade negotiations. This is what Sir Leon Brittan, the new EC external trade commissioner, should be telling his American interlocutors. For perhaps the first time in the postwar era, the US administration does not believe instinctively in the importance of the multilateral trading system. But Sir Leon does. Leadership now rests with him and with the EC. The Clinton administration needs to be cajoled towards expeditious compromises on the outstanding issues in the Uruguay Round. All else is secondary.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Hafnia board withdraws support for Skandia bid THE month-long struggle by Skandia, the Swedish insurance group, to take over Denmark's second largest insurer, Hafnia, ended yesterday after Hafnia's board of directors said it would now support the rescue package proposed by the group of Danish shareholders dissatisfied with the Swedish offer. Previously the board had given its full support to the Skandia bid. The reversal of Hafnia's original agreement with Skandia took place after the deadline for a final statement from Skandia's board was postponed. The Skandia statement was expected following a 'due diligence report' carried out on Hafnia. Mr Ebbe Christensen, chairman of Hafnia's board, said that he could 'understand if Skandia were disappointed because they no longer had an agreement where they thought they had one'. But Mr Christensen said that he hoped it would still be possible to establish a future co-operation with the Skandia. The agreement between Hafnia's board and the group of Danish shareholders involves a DKr1.5bn (Dollars 234.3m) increase in Hafnia's share capital through a rights issue. The two institutional shareholders, the LD Fund and the Local Authorities Pension Insurance Fund, which have led the disaffected Danish shareholders, have welcomed the move.</p>

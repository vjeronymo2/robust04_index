			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Algerian conference snub Algeria's leading political parties yesterday boycotted the first day of a conference for national reconciliation called by the country's High State Council, writes Francis Ghiles. The two-day meeting aims to end the violence which over the past two years has claimed over 3,500 lives and is also set to approve a new collective presidency to replace the body which has ruled Algeria since elections were cancelled in January 1992. The Islamic Salvation Front, which was poised to win the election, dismissed the idea of dialogue with those who had 'stopped the electoral process and spilt the blood of Moslem people'. The leader of the lay opposition party, the Front des Forces Socialistes, Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, said any head of state appointed by the conference would have no legitimacy.</p>

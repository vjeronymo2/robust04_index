			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Brussels renewscall for EC-led growth package MR Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, yesterday threw his weight behind calls for a Community-led growth package, warning that unemployment next year was likely to rise to 11 per cent amid sluggish growth of between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent. Mr Christophersen said he hoped that the EC summit in Edinburgh next month would send a 'strong signal' of support for co-ordinated action based on a multi-billion dollar public works programme and joint efforts with Japan and the US to put 'more steam' into the world economy. In a speech in Brussels, Mr Christophersen also implied that such a package could entail dilution of the conditions for the EC's planned shift to a common currency, particularly in regard to budget deficits. The Danish Commissioner said: 'What we are seeing is more a lack of revenue (rather) than expenditures getting out of control. Under these circumstances, it would be understandable if some member states do not compensate fully on the revenue side.' Any suggestion of backsliding on the 'convergence criteria' set out in the Maastricht treaty is bound to raise alarm in Germany. The Bonn government and the Bundesbank agreed to sacrifice the D-Mark for a common European currency only on the condition that member states met strict criteria on inflation and budget discipline. This week, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, criticised the convergence criteria as inadequate and warned against 'lazy compromises' in the selection of countries for monetary union. Mr Christophersen's view that the criteria on budget deficits may have to be relaxed in the short-term is shared by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission President. Officials close to Mr Delors said yesterday that a growth package involving at least Ecu5bn (Pounds 4.bn) of new loans from a European Investment Fund or the European Investment Bank would be combined with planned increases to the EC budget under the so-called Delors II package. A primary target is infrastructure investment in eastern Europe, viewed as a powerful sales-pitch to Germany.</p>

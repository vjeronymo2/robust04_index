			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Services hit as recovery slows Britain's recovery is slowing, particularly in the service sector, and recent gains in employment may be reversed in the current quarter, the British chambers of commerce warned yesterday. The chambers said their latest quarterly survey of 8,105 companies in manufacturing and services showed that growth of sales and orders flattened in the fourth quarter, setting a 'glass ceiling' on expansion that was well below pre-recession levels. Manufacturing exports proved an exception with substantially more manufacturers reporting a rise in sales and orders compared with those reporting a fall. The poll, carried out between November 26 and December 17, showed a jump in the balance of manufacturers reporting higher export sales to plus 26 per cent in the last quarter from plus 12 per cent in the third quarter, while the balance of those reporting higher orders increased to 20 per cent from 9 per cent. But this positive news was offset by slight falls in home orders for manufacturers and service companies. the balance of manufacturers reporting higher home orders fell for the first time in more than a year to plus 21 per cent from 23 per cent, while the balance of domestic orders for the service industry slipped by 1 point to plus 18 per cent. The chambers said manufacturers were unlikely to experience significantly higher sales growth in the current quarter while results from the service sector were disappointing. big service-sector companies experienced the greatest slowdown in order growth. Mr Christopher Stewart smith, BCC president, said the recovery 'remains finely balanced and could easily be blown off course. it is not yet strong enough to have a significant impact on employment.' The survey found that on balance 4 per cent of manufacturing companies expect to reduce their workforces in the current quarter, with job losses concentrated among large and medium-sized employers. The service sector expects to increase labour slightly, with 3 per cent of companies planning to raise staff. These are concentrated among small and medium-sized firms, however, while most large service companies expect to downsize. The sluggish economic recovery resulted in a largely unchanged rate of growth of investment plans between the third and fourth quarters. There was a slight divergence in capacity utilisation between service companies, where one in five reported working at full capacity, and manufacturing, where improved export business lifted the proportion of full-capacity companies to about one in four. The chambers' assessment of business confidence showed a similar contrast. Expectations of improved profits and turnover slipped slightly among service companies while hopes of higher sales and earnings among manufacturers rose. The chambers said London and the thames valley were among the most buoyant UK regions while recovery in Scotland lagged the rest of the UK. Mr Richard Brown, the chambers' deputy director-general, said a slowdown was 'very worrying' for the service sector because it was more sensitive to consumer demand.</p>

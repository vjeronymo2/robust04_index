			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Maxwell kept pension fund trustees in dark A 'PHANTOM' board meeting in September 1991 at which Mr Robert Maxwell authorised stocklending from the Maxwell pension funds was unknown to pension trustee directors, it emerged yesterday. Confidential minutes of the board meetings of Mirror Group Pension Trustees (MGPT), obtained by the Financial Times, show that the only directors present at a meeting on September 2 were Mr Maxwell and his son Ian, together with Mr Trevor Cook, the pensions manager. At the meeting, Mr Robert Maxwell, the MGPT chairman, drafted a letter assuring Invesco MIM, one of the managers of the pension funds, that the programme of stocklending - lending out assets to boost income  - was approved by the board of MGPT. However, in one of the crucial sections of a forthcoming report by the parliamentary committee on pension reform, to be published after the general election, other directors of the MGPT say they were unaware that pension fund assets had been lent out until after Mr Robert Maxwell's death in November. Several who were contacted yesterday said they had only recently become aware of the September 2 board meeting and the letter to Invesco. Stocklending is a legal and commonplace practice, but normally high quality collateral is given until the assets are returned. Stocklending with inadequate collateral was the mechanism Mr Robert Maxwell used to divert Pounds 400m from the care of pension fund managers to his private companies. One pension trustee director said yesterday the directors had received legal advice that, though the board was quorate with two directors, decisions could be deemed illegal if the rest of the board was not made aware of them. Mr Cook, not a director of MGPT, confirmed that he had signed and sent the letter to Invesco on Mr Robert Maxwell's orders. As far as he was aware the minutes of the meeting had been filed in the normal way. The letter, addressed to Mr James Scrymgeour-Wedderburn of Invesco MIM, says 'at your request we confirm our earlier advice that you take instructions from Bishopsgate Investment Management', the investment company chaired by Mr Robert Maxwell, which managed the bulk of the pension funds. It adds: 'We concur with the stocklending operation being carried out by Bishopsgate on our behalf'. On BIM's instructions, MIM passed it some Pounds 20m of assets for stocklending. There is no suggestion that MIM directors acted improperly, as the letter appeared to give them adequate authority for the transfer. The letter also recognises that BIM, not Invesco MIM, 'is responsible to us for the holding of adequate collateral'.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNION WARNS UNITED PILOTS OF 'DIFFICULT CHOICES' SOON  </P> <P> The Air Line Pilots Assn. told its United Airlines members Tuesday to be ready  for "difficult choices" ahead after reports that the union and the airline's  parent company were discussing a plan that could include an employee-owned  stake in the company.  </P> <P> In a letter to United ALPA members, Chairman Frederick C. Dubinski said UAL  Corp. -- which has received a $5.4-billion, $240-a-share takeover proposal from  Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis -- undoubtedly will be bought out by  somebody.  </P> <P> "In fact, whether you like it or not, you and all the other employees are going  to help pay for it," Dubinski said. "The only choice is whether we buy it for  someone else or ourselves."  </P> <P> He said United pilots may have to "act rapidly, decisively and conclusively to  assure our survival and prosperity," noting that acquisition by an outsider  likely would mean a leveraged buyout that could saddle the company with loads  of new debt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Inevitable' Decisions  </P> <P> A leveraged buyout is an acquisition financed mainly by borrowed funds that are  repaid with the target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets.  </P> <P> "We must watch this situation very closely, ensuring that we have all the  information we need to make the difficult choices that are inevitable,"  Dubinski said.  </P> <P> The union has only two choices, Dubinski said -- "concessions to an outsider or  investment in the airline by the employees. There is no good third choice."  </P> <P> UAL stock closed down $4.375 a share to $254.125 on Tuesday in New York Stock  Exchange trading.  </P> <P> Several news reports indicated that ALPA and UAL officials met during the  weekend to discuss plans for either a management-employee buyout or a  recapitalization that would put a big enough block of UAL stock in an employee  stock ownership plan to help thwart any hostile takeover attempt.  </P> <P> Representatives of UAL and ALPA refused to comment Tuesday on whether meetings  were held during the weekend or on reports of the purported plans.  </P> <P> Telephone calls seeking comment Tuesday from two unions representing other  United employees -- the International Brotherhood of Machinists and the Assn.  of Flight Attendants -- were not returned.  </P> <P> Dubinski said in his letter that the level of contribution to any employee  stock ownership plan by the pilots would depend on the number of employees and  employee groups participating.  </P> <P> "Depending on the declared interest of the other employees, we may need a great  level of participation or a slight level," his letter read. "It would make good  sense for you to be financially prepared for the worst."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pan Am Interested  </P> <P> United's pilots in the past have expressed an interest in buying the company  and in 1987 proposed a $4.5-billion plan to buy the airline from its  then-parent, Allegis Corp. Last week, ALPA officials said its advisers were  being consulted about the Davis bid.  </P> <P> In addition to Davis, New York-based Pan Am Corp. has expressed interest in a  possible merger with UAL, and there has been speculation that a bid for UAL may  be made by the New York corporate buyout firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;  Co.  </P> <P> Louis Marckesano, an analyst with the Philadelphia investment firm of Janney  Montgomery Scott Inc., said a deal involving UAL management and its employees  would eliminate fears in Congress and the Transportation Department that the  airline would be stripped of valuable assets, as might happen with a leveraged  buyout.  </P> <P> "With that kind of plan, you would assure continuation of UAL as a strong  airline," Marckesano said, referring to a management-labor buyout. "It would  create labor peace, which would be pretty important in the future."  </P></p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Cray's former chief offloads entire holding of 9m shares SIR PETER Michael, the former chairman of Cray Electronics, yesterday conditionally sold his entire holding of 8.98m ordinary shares in the data communications and software systems group, which bought the Dowty information technology division from TI for Pounds 50m last August. It is thought the sale price was about 140p, which would have given Sir Peter about Pounds 12.6m before expenses. Yesterday the shares closed up 2 1/2 p at 148 1/2 p. Some 3.39m shares were his existing holding. The balance was converted from his entire holdings of deferred convertible shares, A deferred redeemable shares, and B deferred redeemable shares. These derived from the final tranche of Cray's share option-based incentive bonus package for Sir Peter, Mr Roger Holland, his successor as chairman, Mr Jeff Harrison, finance director, and Mr Jon Richards, group managing director. The bonus was triggered in July by the group's 1992-1993 results. Pre-tax profits leapt from Pounds 2.35m to Pounds 29m boosted by the Dowty acquisition. Earnings were up from 1.9p to 13.8p per share.</p>

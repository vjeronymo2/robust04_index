			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUARTE FIRM TAILORS TEXTS FOR A LOCALE AND HERITAGE  </P> <P> Eskimo Chief Willie Kasayulie smiled faintly as he recalled a child in his  village seeing a moose for the first time -- and calling it a cow.  </P> <P> Concern accompanied his amusement.  </P> <P> Textbooks from the Lower 48 states describe skyscrapers, farms and pigs --  ideas foreign to his Yupiit tribe in western Alaska. But the familiar moose,  berry picking and salmon fishing were never mentioned, lamented Kasayulie, who  is president of the Yupiit School District's governing board.  </P> <P> To remedy the situation, the district decided to buy culturally relevant  reading materials for grades 2 through 9.  </P> <P> It turned to Hoffman Custom Products, a publishing firm in Duarte that  customizes supplemental reading programs for school districts.  </P> <P> For $400,000, the firm wrote texts featuring maps of the villages, wildlife  sketches by a local artist and stories sprinkled with names of residents.  </P> <P> By weaving accounts of time-honored Yupik practices into reading materials,  district officials hope to strengthen children's respect for their elders and a  heritage that spans 10,000 years.  </P> <P> "Parents have lost a lot of stature," Kasayulie said of his tribe on the  Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, 500 miles southwest of Anchorage. "We're trying to  recapture that before it is totally lost."  </P> <P> Although the customized books are now just supplemental texts for the 307  students in six schools, Yupiit Supt. Brad Raphel said they will replace basic  readers by fall. Kasayulie and other Yupik school officials visited Duarte this  year to review the texts.  </P> <P> Ada Sullivan, president of Hoffman Custom Products, said nine employees and up  to 25 free-lance writers write the texts in collaboration with district  officials. The firm has also customized texts for schools in Cincinnati,  Detroit, Cleveland and Dade County, Fla.  </P> <P> Reading specialists disagree over how reading materials should be used.  </P> <P> Aileen Johnson, a UCLA reading language specialist, doubts the value of writing  texts to fit instructional goals. Reading concepts should be taught using  literary works, she said.  </P> <P> "There's nothing like a good book," she said, adding that if literature is used  properly, no supplements should be needed.  </P> <P> John McNeil, a UCLA literacy professor, disagreed, saying that most classics  reflect the culture of a white upper class, denying the experiences of  minorities and current issues such as environmental problems and AIDS.  </P> <P> Most of the nation's 15,500 school districts use a reading textbook with  classics as supplements, according to Donald Ecklund, school division vice  president of the Assn. of American Publishers.  </P> <P> The content in Hoffman's Yupik books is more than 75% local and includes  passages on native legends, the tanning of animal skins and even False Teeth,  the local dog-sled racing champ.  </P> <P> In one exercise, in which students must decide the focus of a story, the ritual  of filling a dead seal with snow is explained: "The woman did this so the  seal's spirit would not get thirsty. Then the seal's spirit could go back to  the sea."  </P> <P> Most lessons are presented in English and Yupik, the first language for the  youngsters. Children learn that "assirluku snow-go-m Kitugtellra" becomes "the  best way to fix a snowmobile."  </P> <P> The Cincinnati Public School System also wanted regional information in its  supplemental books. The 52,000-student district was searching for supplemental  material to help teach reading, writing, listening, speaking and thinking  skills in one program, said Reginald Green, Cincinnati's deputy superintendent  of instruction.  </P> <P> Hoffman tailored the program for kindergarten through eighth grade for  $900,000, incorporating local tidbits in 30% of the material.  </P> <P> In a writing lesson, the legendary Johnny Appleseed is described wandering  along the Ohio River laden with a sack of apple seeds. Elizabeth Blackwell, the  nation's first female doctor and a Cincinnati native, is also mentioned. Green  said that teachers have reported their students are progressing faster and that  parents have told him their children are reading more on their own.  </P> <P> Ecklund said he has not heard of other publishers who customize textbooks.  Hoffman, he said, is "unique; most publishers cater to national markets."  </P> <P> Customizing for every school district would simply not be profitable for major  publishers, said Gail Burns, product manager of Massachusetts-based  Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., a national textbook publisher for elementary and  secondary schools.  </P> <P> Hoffman, which has produced reading texts and audiovisual aids for two decades,  launched its customizing division two years ago, Sullivan said.  </P> <P> The company has also designed computer software for scoring tests in Dade  County, Fla., schools and created a remedial reading program for pupils in  Cleveland.  </P> <P> The Yupiit Reading Project was Hoffman's toughest challenge.  </P> <P> The 5-year-old school district, which began using the program in fourth through  sixth grades in 1988, includes the villages of Akiachak, Akiak and Tulusak.  Surrounded by willow-covered tundra, the villages are in a wildlife refuge on  land belonging to the native Alaskans.  </P> <P> Hoffman's writers interviewed village elders and studied the Tundra Times, a  local newspaper, to capture the native flavor.  </P> <P> Michael Williams, Yupiit school board vice president, said students and parents  have told him that the project has increased their self-esteem.  </P> <P> The number of books or periodicals checked out from libraries in the villages  has leaped from 54 to 1,700 a month, Raphel, the district's superintendent,  said.  </P> <P> The customized textbooks also educate teachers on the Yupik way of life, he  said. "A lot of them are from the Lower 48 and don't know the area, the  climate, the people. They would come in, bring their little packets of material  and teach what they were familiar with."  </P> <P> And, he said, the new materials have changed the way teachers view students'  absences for food-gathering trips.  </P> <P> Acknowledging outdoor learning as legitimate and elders as experts, Hoffman has  also designed grade sheets for parents to rate their children on traditional  skills.  </P> <P> A sampling of the abilities listed would make the average child in the Lower 48  wince: "Can endure continuous berry picking, knows the proper wood for smoking  fish, understands winter and cold survival techniques, practices gun safety  laws, makes nightly entries into school journal."  </P> <P> "Learning cannot be isolated from the environment," because everything is seen  through a cultural filter, said Hoffman vice president Carol Bradley, a former  educator.  </P> <P> She recalled how an Alaskan teacher's aide described Los Angeles' night lights  as she flew into LAX: "It's like berries on the tundra."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SKILLS YUPIKS MUST LEARN  </P> <P> On hunting trips  </P> <P> Repair boat motors  </P> <P> Identify poisonous plants  </P> <P> Use winter or cold-water survival techniques  </P> <P> Estimate dates of return with basic map skills  </P> <P> Communicate with travelers and fellow hunters in Yupik  </P> <P> During berry-picking season  </P> <P> Identify plants used for medicine  </P> <P> Pick berries with few stems and without bruising  </P> <P> Endure continuous berry-picking  </P> <P> On salmon-fishing trips  </P> <P> Boys  </P> <P> Untangle nets  </P> <P> Build fish racks  </P> <P> Use axes, chain saws and other building tools  </P> <P> Know the right current of the river to set and drift nets  </P> <P> Girls  </P> <P> String smelt  </P> <P> Freeze raw fish  </P> <P> Light fires for the smokehouse  </P> <P> Identify young alder wood for stretching fish  </P></p>

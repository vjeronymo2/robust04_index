			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (8): A fishing line to Europe - The industry provides 15% of the country's exports Fish accounts for 15 per cent of all Moroccan exports and the industry employs at least 150,000 people. The fishing agreement between Morocco and the European Union is a key part of the kingdom's relations with its northern neighbours, most notably Spain. Earlier this month the four-year agreement with the EU, which was due to run until 1996, was renegotiated. It will now end in May 1995, to be replaced by an agreement which will run for three years. For all practicable purposes, it is an agreement with Spain and, to a lesser extent, with Portugal. Indeed, 95 per cent of the 750 foreign fishing vessels which are allowed in Moroccan waters are Spanish. Although those rights to fish have not changed since the first agreement with the EU, after Spain's accession to the EU in 1998, the idea of biological rest, introduced in the 1992 agreement, has reduced the amount of the catch by 20 per cent. The European Union pays Ecu102m for the right of European vessels to fish in Moroccan waters. To this figure should be added licence fees paid by individual shipowners that are worth Ecu10m-15m every year to the Moroccan exchequer. In exchange, the EU grants Morocco preferential access to its markets. Import duties on Moroccan fish are to decline from 8 per cent in 1993 to 5 per cent in 1996, compared with normal EU duties on foreign fish of 25 per cent. However, the new Gatt rules will erode such preferential access as they cut import duties overall over a period to 12 1/2 per cent, a situation about which the Moroccans are not happy. This month's agreement with the EU entails scientific co-operation and allows Moroccan inspectors on foreign vessels. There are to be talks on cuts in the amounts that Morocco will allow European vessels to fish after May 1995 and more co-operation to control and preserve fish stocks. While the Spanish ships respect the two-month biological rest agreed in 1992, the Moroccans appear not to do so. They argue that any curb on fishing, notably by smaller boats, affects the income of fishermen, particularly in the north (people who work on small boats are usually paid in kind) and the absence of fish, albeit temporarily, pushes up the price of other foods in the markets. Shrimps and hake are found in the north, but a variety of fish is taken from Moroccan waters. Moroccan vessels tend to fish near the coast, Spanish vessels further out at sea. How much is fished illegally by foreign vessels or sold by Moroccan ships to foreigners on the high seas is impossible to tell. Some observers believe its value runs to Dollars 100m. An estimated 550 foreign boats, mostly small fishing vessels from Andalucia, fish off Morocco's north and north-western shores but by far the most valuable catch is squid, caught further south. An estimated 150 Spanish vessels based in Las Palmas fish off Morocco's Saharan shores. The fact that Morocco's administration of the Western Sahara is recognised by the EU but not its sovereignty over the former Spanish colony has never been an obstacle. In its agreement with the EU, the southern Moroccan fishing zone is deemed to start between Tan Tan and Sidi Ifni which have always been Moroccan and to extend to Mauritania, thus neatly side-stepping the question of sovereignty. Squid is also important for the Moroccan fishing fleet which boasts 450 high sea vessels, 300 of which are in activity, and 2,500 smaller coastal boats. The larger vessels fish an estimated 150,000 tons a year, 80 per cent of which is squid worth an estimated Dh2.7bn; the smaller boats take 450,000 tons, worth about Dh1.3bn. Of the 600,000 tons of fish and squid drawn from the sea every year by Moroccan boats, one quarter is exported, bringing in an estimated Dh4bn; one fifth, mostly sardines of which Morocco is the largest world exporter, is canned and sold abroad, one quarter is consumed locally and the remainder - mostly fish of mediocre quality or not kept in good condition because small fishing boats lack basic equipment, notably refrigeration - is turned into byproducts. A big effort is under way in Morocco to modernise the fishing fleet and improve equipment at the main ports: Safi, Agadir, Tan Tan and Larache. Morocco's fishing grounds are exceptionally rich. The potential catch off the country's shores is 1m to 1.5m tons a year, it is estimated. In 1962 Morocco extended its territorial waters and since 1981 it has claimed an exclusive fishing zone. However, today the industry is in crisis. The infrastructure of the ports has not been completed by the stated time, thus forcing fleet owners to invest instead of the state; the buying of boats has at times been rather speculative rather than rational and credits are becoming harder to extract from Moroccan banks. Spare parts are expensive. Another factor which has affected the profitability of fishing in the area is that the price of squid - dictated by its largest market, Japan - has declined in recent years. Costs will also rise because Morocco will have to conform to European quality standards which come into force next January.</p>

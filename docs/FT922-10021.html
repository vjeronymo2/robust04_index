			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (5): Battleground for 1995 election drawn - The day party politics came to the colony IF YOU thought that Hong Kong was a place administered by Britain in which domestic politics played little or no part then you had better change your mind, or else you are about to be mugged by reality. For 148 years of Britain's rule of its Far East colony this may have been the case, but September 15, 1991, will go down in the history of Hong Kong as the day on which the power of Britain's colonial government began to wane. It was the day when party politics was introduced to Hong Kong and it was also the day Hong Kong's future masters in Beijing came to rue. Those elections returned 18 democratically-elected politicians - 12 of whom fought the election under the banner of Martin Lee's United Democrats; 21 members representing 'functional constituencies', such as lawyers, trade unionists, and teachers; 18 members appointed by the governor, and three occupied by top civil servants. Just how Hong Kong's politicians arrive at a modus vivendi with the colonial government will determine the extent to which the colony's transition from British to Chinese rule is smooth or rough, difficult or easy. So far the omens are decidedly mixed. At present the colony is ruled by a theoretically all-powerful governor who takes advice from an Executive Council (ExCo) consisting of permanent civil servants, and appointed pillars of the community, both Chinese and expatriate. This government, however, holds no majority in the local legislature - known as the Legislative Council, or LegCo - and its legitimacy to govern is becoming increasingly questioned by not only those who were democratically elected last September (and who form a de facto opposition) but also, implicitly, by some of its own appointees. 'In the past policy was decided first in discussions which reached consensus and then we went public,' says Alan Lee, an appointed member of the LegCo and a member of the governor's ExCo. 'Now it's discussion, differences of opinion, debate and vote. Consensus politics has gone; that is the reality of the situation.' The government's room for manoeuvre is severely limited. Its ability to alter the constitution of Hong Kong is limited by the Basic Law - drafted and passed into law by China - which has taken as its template for governing the colony after 1997 the political system as it was in the late 1980s. This is the so-called 'executive-led' government which prevailed for most of British rule in Hong Kong. But the executive has been weakened by the introduction of partial elective democracy last September. The Chinese drafters of the Basic Law did not anticipate the consequences of last year's elections and it is not wholly clear if Britain did either. This situation was graphically demonstrated by LegCo's reaction to the first budget presented by Mr Hamish MacLeod, the colony's financial secretary. The budget appeared astute; its key details were carefully leaked to the local press and its proposals had all the hallmarks of a government which had read the United Democrats' election platform and was attempting to implement some of it. The corporate tax rate was raised, soothing noises were made about social programmes, and personal allowances were raised by a greater margin than inflation. The LegCo debate was, however, acrimonious and for a time, it looked as though the budget would not be passed. It was only passed after Mr MacLeod made what in any other parliamentary jurisdiction would have been a fatal concession: he promised to lower taxes for the lower and middle classes in his next budget. Senior government officials now conceded that they were wrong-footed by LegCo's response. 'We thought it a balanced, middle-of-the-road document which balanced social concerns with economic needs,' says one. 'Even though it was that it still produced a split. This is a reflection on the state of politics rather than of substance.' The only option left to the government is to try and move closer to centre of politics in the colony in an attempt to limit the area of dissent as far as possible. 'We can't bulldoze our way through any more,' says the official. Government officials rightly note that politics in Hong Kong is not characterised by the extremes of left and right. There is a broad consensus in the colony about what has made Hong Kong rich and prosperous. But that said the familiar arguments about how to distribute the national wealth are there (as the budget debates testify), and there is a brewing controversy concerning the legitimacy of the government, and a politicisation of the electorate taking place. Martin Lee's United Democrats, who won a majority of the democratically-contested seats last September and won the support of most of the others, are not shy of reminding the government that they are the ones who won the people's mandate last September. This is an argument which government officials privately concede but one from which they understandably shy. It remains unclear, however, whether those who voted for the United Democrats did so with the hope that it would challenge the government and China as much as it has. But even the government's natural supporters openly recognise its dilemma. 'The Government can't claim it has the support of LegCo on policy or on the law-making process,' said one. 'The Government doesn't have a government party; it can't have and does not have a majority in LegCo.' This is just a foretaste, however, of what the government will have to face in the coming year. Looming large is the issue of electoral reform. It is an issue which divides LegCo, a committee of which is studying the problem, but it is one which may well have reverberations in Westminster and possibly even in Washington. In advance of the 1995 elections the battleground is already beginning to be drawn. Alan Lee is devoting this summer to drawing up a constitution for a new business-oriented party to be formed out of the Co-operative Resources Centre - a grouping which counts 16 LegCo members among its number, and four ExCo members. Pro-Beijing interests are also mustering their force. Mr Tam Yiu-chung, vice-chairman of the pro-China Federation of Trade Unions, has announced his intention to form a party. This will marry the grass-roots organisation of his union interests with business interests represented by the 'One Country Two Systems Research Institute' run by the late Sir Y K Pao's son-in-law Dr Edgar Cheng. Separately, the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association, which represents mainland companies in Hong Kong and is directly controlled from Beijing, has made claim to one of the nine extra 'functional' constituencies that will be created for the 1995 elections. Its application is expected to be successful. The contestants are readying themselves for the race. Just how level the playing field will be has yet to be decided.</p>

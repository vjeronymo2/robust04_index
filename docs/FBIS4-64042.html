			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Karmalito] </F>   [Text] Simferopol May 26 TASS -- The Crimea is seeking to  settle differences with Ukraine only at the negotiating table,  local parliament speaker Sergey Tsekov emphasised in an  exclusive interview with TASS on Thursday.    He gave a positive assessment of today's talks between  Crimean and Ukrainian parliamentary delegations in Kiev.  According to him, the negotiating teams managed to reach  understanding and to enter into dialogue in search for a  compromise.    "We have an impression that Ukraine's Supreme Soviet is  determined to find a solution to the existing problems and  realizes that the current complicated situation in the Crimea  was prompted by certain reasons", Tsekov pointed out. "It is not  a result of activities of some political extremists and radicals  that have come to power. This situation is quite objective, and  problems it is generating should be solved without any use of  force, but solely by means of negotiations", he stressed.    The Crimean parliament speaker believes a mutual compromise  would determine "Ukraine's fate rather than the Crimea's  future". He noted that "all that has been done so far just  tended to drive the existing problems deeper down. In fact,  tensions were gradually stirred up over the past eighteen months  of a difficult transition period. Meanwhile, there are no  grounds for fuelling passions at the moment. Assertions about  stepped up military preparations in the Crimea do not correspond  to reality. Although there are certain facts: Amassing of  Ukraine's national guard troops, sending of armoured combat  vehicles to Simferopol. But all this is not as serious as one  could think", Tsekov said. He warned that the situation should  not be further aggravated. This threatens to affect the  upcoming season of summer vacations, and therefore to undermine  the Crimea's local budget.    "If one intends to foment a conflict in the Crimea, he will  not need large military forces, 500 troops will be quite  enough", the Crimean speaker noted. But combat operations on  the peninsula would inevitably mean its separation from Ukraine  forever, he stressed, citing the examples of Nagorno-Karabakh,  Moldova's Dniester region and Abkhazia. "We do not want this to  happen. Obviously the use of military force cannot solve the  existing problems", Tsekov said.</p>

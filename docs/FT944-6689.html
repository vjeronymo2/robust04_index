			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Decision on 'Swatchmobile' site The pioneering micro city car that is being developed by Mercedes-Benz, the German executive and luxury carmaker and SMH, the Swiss watchmaker, is likely to be produced at a new plant in France or Germany. The board of Micro-Compact-Car, the joint venture formed earlier this year by Mercedes-Benz and SMH, is due to meet on Friday and is expected to make a preliminary decision on a production location. Final approval of the site is likely to be given by the boards of the parent companies next week. The Alsace region of France and the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg are believed to be the front-runners to win the project. Mr Hans-Jurg Schar, marketing and sales director of MCC, said that the so-called 'Swatchmobile' would be built either in France or Germany and not in Switzerland. SMH and its chief executive Mr Nicolas Hayek had hoped to bring production of the micro car to Switzerland, but Mr Schar said that the 'offers from Biel and Oensingen cannot compete with sites that receive European Union subsidies'. Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, has some of the highest labour costs in the world. Mercedes-Benz, which holds a 51 per cent stake in the venture, and SMH, the maker of Swatch watches, which holds 49 per cent, are aiming to launch the 'micro compact car' in Europe by 1997/98 with an initial production capacity of 100,000 to 150,000 cars a year.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWSUITS AGAINST NINTENDO GO TO HEART OF THE WAY JAPAN COMPETES  </P> <P> Its business is games, and its primary customers are adolescent boys. But don't  be fooled. Nintendo is treating its market as seriously as NASA orchestrated  the first lunar landing.  </P> <P> No detail is too small, no issue too trivial. Nothing is left to chance.  </P> <P> New games, for example, are evaluated on a scale of zero to 40 long before they  are selected for publication. All games developed by outside authors are  manufactured, along with the in-house titles, at Nintendo headquarters in  Japan. Toy store shelves are checked weekly to monitor sales, and new products  are introduced deliberately and in limited supplies to keep business flowing  smoothly.  </P> <P> "Nintendo is very paternalistic toward the industry . . . and without that  protection, the video game business would already have gone through the same  spike and fall that ruined it in the mid-1980s," said Gregory Fischbach, chief  executive of Acclaim, a Long Island, N.Y., video game maker. "If Nintendo  hadn't provided this marketing control, there would be no business today."  </P> <P> Indeed, Nintendo successfully resuscitated the collapsed market for video games  in 1985 and patiently nurtured it into a business expected to generate sales of  more than $3 billion this year. But now the Japanese game maker, which controls  as much as 80% of the market, has been slapped by disgruntled California  competitors with two multimillion-dollar antitrust lawsuits that strike at the  heart of Nintendo's approach to reviving the industry.  </P> <P> Scheduled to go to trial later this year, the suits have potentially broad  implications for personal computer software publishers and other technology  concerns. Many technology and legal experts also say the suits challenge some  of the basic business tactics Japanese companies have employed to build -- and,  in many cases, dominate -- markets in the United States.  </P> <P> The suits, filed separately by Atari Games and an unrelated company, Atari  Corp., over the last three months, accuse Nintendo of monopolistic practices.  </P> <P> Atari Games, which has developed three video games for Nintendo, maintains that  the Japanese company has competed unfairly in the game market by doing two  things: insisting on manufacturing every cassette intended for its players and  unilaterally deciding how many cassettes each of its outside licensees will  get. Taken together, the suit says, those actions essentially dictate the size  of the video game market and leave other game and player developers at the  mercy of Nintendo.  </P> <P> In the other suit, Atari Corp., the video game maker that dominated the market  in the early 1980s, accused Nintendo of monopolizing both the video game and  player market by preventing game developers from writing versions of  Nintendo-authorized games for rival player makers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Into Monopolies'  </P> <P> Analysts say Nintendo's approach to the video game market is tantamount to a  computer maker preventing software developers from writing versions of a  computer program for competitors' machines. But some U.S. experts also say the  company's overall strategy is characteristic of the aggressive yet methodical  approach often taken by Japanese concerns to build their businesses, though  perhaps taken to an extreme.  </P> <P> "The Japanese are into monopolies," said Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of Soft*  Letter, a software market report. "They really believe you can have orderly  markets, and they believe the best way to have these orderly markets is to  minimize competition."  </P> <P> The notion, accepted in Japan, where the economy is tightly monitored by the  government, flies in the face of the free market system, argues Trip Hawkins,  founder of Electronic Arts, a San Mateo personal computer game publisher.  </P> <P> Nintendo's response has been that the suits are nothing more than "sour grapes"  from the companies that let the original video game craze collapse and then  failed to jump back quickly enough when it rebounded several years later.  </P> <P> "I'd hide under the American flag, too, if I were in their shoes," said William  White, advertising and marketing director of Nintendo of America, Nintendo  Co.'s Redmond, Wash., U.S. subsidiary.  </P> <P> Still, White acknowledges that the Japanese do business differently from their  American competitors. "American companies don't play hardball like this," he  said. "There's more of a sharing of the pie by American companies. In Japan,  it's different: Winners win big and losers lose."  </P> <P> But, as White added, in the United States, the losers also are more than  willing to take their case to court.  </P> <P> The suit by Atari Games, considered the more far-reaching of the two cases,  seeks $100 million based on the claim that Nintendo's insistence on  manufacturing all cassettes intended for its players has restricted Atari  Games' market.  </P> <P> At the crux of the suit is the "lockout" chip that Nintendo installs in each  game cassette it manufactures. The special chip allows the games to operate in  the Nintendo game players and is designed to prevent all but  Nintendo-authorized and manufactured games from playing on the system.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ample Precedent  </P> <P> Nintendo has steadfastly claimed that the security chip is needed to prevent  inferior, low-quality games from damaging the market, as they did in 1982.  Further, it argues that by manufacturing all games with these chips, it ensures  that supply does not exceed demand, creating a glut of the sort that also  occurred in 1982.  </P> <P> But critics charge that the maneuvers are little more than monopolistic  practices to prevent a proliferation of copycat games that would cut into  Nintendo's chokehold on the market.  </P> <P> There is ample predecent for technology firms, such as personal computer  makers, to protect their patented and copyrighted inventions and materials from  would-be copiers. But Nintendo is the only company in recent years to try to  assert control over both the basic machine as well as the material developed by  outsiders that is played or run on it.  </P> <P> (Record company executives, however, recall that more than three decades ago,  rival phonograph makers RCA and CBS tried something similar. RCA made players  with a fat hole and 45 r.p.m. records to match it; CBS' players had tiny holes  and records made by its in-house manufacturing arm matched that size.  Phonograph owners who wanted to use both kinds of records were forced to buy  plastic inserts for records or fat tubes for record spindles as standard  accessories.)  </P> <P> Nintendo, critics charge, leaves little room for choice by game developers.  "Nintendo is trying to advance the principle that they must control the  software that is played on their hardware, and that's patently ridiculous,"  said Kenneth Wasch, executive director of the Software Publishers Assn., a  trade group supporting the lawsuits.  </P> <P> "It's like a manufacturer of compact disc players saying that they must judge  the quality of the recording artists. Suddenly we would have one company saying  that Madonna was OK, but Prince was out. No one does business that way," Wasch  added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Security Chip Used  </P> <P> If Nintendo's practices are upheld in court, Wasch and others fear that  personal computer software publishers could be left without much protection  from huge computer makers.  </P> <P> Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley attorney specializing in patent and copyright  protection, says Nintendo's use of a security chip to lock out unauthorized  software could be copied by computer makers, as well, to prevent unauthorized  software from playing in their machines.  </P> <P> "This is a much more important issue to the personal computer business than the  game business," Reback said.  </P> <P> Wasch added, "Computer software publishers would fight like hell if any  hardware manufacturer would even try do do this. I can't imagine a computer  maker trying this now, but stranger things have happened."  </P> <P> Although the practices may offend some Americans, Yoshihiro Sano, president of  the US Japan Business News, a weekly Japanese-language newspaper published in  Los Angeles, says they are quite common in Japan.  </P> <P> "The Japanese are very calculated and planning oriented. That Nintendo wants to  control the entire manufacturing process for their products is typical for  Japan," he said. "The approach they have taken to the U.S. market is a very  Japanese way of doing business. It's just extreme for Americans."  </P> <P> The key to Nintendo's success in the United States stems from its accurate  assessment of what went wrong with the business in the early 1980s. According  to Peter Main, marketing vice president for Nintendo of America, the company  dissected the first craze and concluded that it died out because of shoddy  games that confused and angered buyers -- not because buyers suddenly lost  interest in the pastime.  </P> <P> Next, the U.S. subsidiary carefully followed the path blazed nearly three years  earlier by its Japanese parent, a 99-year-old company that got started making  cards for the popular Japanese game Hanafuda. Since introducing the Famicom in  Japan in 1982, Nintendo has sold about 13 million systems there, the equivalent  of about one for every three households.  </P> <P> In the United States, Nintendo has sold about 11 million systems and projects  sales of another 8 million units this year alone. Sales of Nintendo-authorized  and manufactured game cassettes are expected to reach 50 million this year,  about 50% higher than last year's record high.  </P> <P> Although growth has been spectacular, Main contends that the key is ensuring  the growth rate remains manageable and customers are carefully led through the  buying cycle already established in Japan.  </P> <P> For example, Main says, the company is preparing to introduce a new, more  sophisticated and more powerful version of its game player, possibly later this  year. The machine could be brought to market sooner, he acknowledged, but "we  need to get all we can out of our current product" before introducing its  replacement.  </P> <P> The company takes the same approach with video games themselves. For example,  one of the hottest games on the Japanese market is Super Mario Brothers III.  But in the Unites States, the company only recently introduced its immediate  predecessor, Super Mario Brothers II.  </P> <P> Although the game could easily be exported to the United States, Main says it  is important to take players through each version in proper order to make sure  that the players enjoy their experience and stay in the fold. Further, he  argues, the progression from one version to its successor shouldn't be hurried,  because the market could become glutted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unique Approach  </P> <P> By contrast, during the last video craze, manufacturers made millions of copies  of popular titles in an attempt to satisfy the hyper-inflated demand. The  result was a glut, thousands of inferior products -- and the market's almost  overnight collapse.  </P> <P> Nintendo's approach to quality control also is novel. Rather than enter into  multi-year licensing agreements with game developers for a number of products,  Nintendo signs agreements covering only a single game. If a developer has a  sequel or new product, it must negotiate a new contract.  </P> <P> "The name of the business is selling games, of course. The second sale is based  on customers getting satisfaction from the first," said Main. "We're not  controlling the market, but we are saying that you can't enjoy some games  without having first played earlier versions. It's understanding that kind of  progression that makes sense."  </P> <P> To Nintendo allies such as Acclaim's Fischbach, Nintendo's approach is nothing  other than prudent managing for the long term. "Unless it's grown slowly, the  market won't last any longer than it did the first time," he said, adding that  he's happy to accept lower sales now in exchange for a more lasting business.  </P></p>

Journalists sometimes ask me about the situation in these  countries, and I assume from their questions that they are  seeking analogies with the West. The history of Western  capitalism is well known. Many volumes have been written on the  subject, describing the path from feudalism to the first  accumulation of capital. But not so much has been written  describing the path from a socialist to a free-market economy,  and on how to solve social problems along the way. This is a  little-known topic. And yet we are dealing with this topic  every day, we are adding chapters to this book every single day  by means of our practical decisions, solutions, actions, and our  society's reaction. This should be borne in mind by those who  wish to understand our situation and avoid stereotypes.    I would like to draw your attention to three matters. The  first one is the result of the latest parliamentary elections in  Poland, where the present government was formed by traditional  parties which, though changed, have their roots in the previous  system. It is very important to know that this choice, made by  the majority of society, does not mean that the population voted  for a return to communism. It merely means that society voted  for the best possible path, permitting a linking of the reforms  to sensitivity for human affairs and expectations. This was a  politically mature choice.    I think the new government's primary characteristic is that  it is continuing the reforms. It has to do so. There is no  other way for Poland, a country that has opted for democracy and  democratic institutions, an efficient economy, and participation  in European integration and the European security system. I  think that these democratic elections (in Poland) were a clear  sign that we are pursuing this path and that we are more mature  and further ahead in this march than some of our critics make  out.    The Polish people approve of the main paths of the reforms  and the changes that have occurred over the past five years.  But society still needs to make sacrifices. That remains a key  issue. The problem has to be viewed from three angles --  political, economic, and perhaps the most important one,  psychological.    From a political angle, the main problem is stability. This  is essential for the political reforms, and we have a good  chance of maintaining this stability over the next four years.  That provides us with enough time to implement essential though  sometimes unpopular decisions. I think the democratic system in  Poland has to be steadily developed, and the elections have  given us the chance to do so.    The economic sphere contains greater complications. The  problem here is finding a compromise between the need to expand  the economy and society's expectations, in order to avoid  frustration and disenchantment. After many long debates, we  have reached the conclusion that right now the government's  chief task should be to protect the positive trends that have  appeared in the economy. This is not in pursuance of some  social democratic principle, but the consequence of a pragmatic  approach toward the economy. This is necessary if we are to  concern ourselves with the future of the economy.    So first of all it is necessary to maintain such positive  trends as the increase in the GNP, and find the money with which  to meet society's expectations half way and solve social  problems. This is a question of social policy, for we cannot  accept such high unemployment and the heavy, sometimes, tragic,  living conditions that have become the lot of millions of Poles.    In this sphere we must proceed gradually, because a rapid  change in the situation is impossible. From the political point  of view, this is a basic problem for the Polish left wing, i.e.  for the social democrats, who comprise the largest party in the  ruling coalition. Our stance is very clear -- the first  priority is economic development, and we are prepared to use all  available means to protect the economic growth and raise the  output of Polish industry.    Of course, our economic program must contain such basic  issues as social security and general expenditures on social  benefits. In every single postcommunist country, these problems  are not just economic, but also political, and they occupy a  prominent position in domestic policy. I think we have to be  more energetic in our social policy, especially in combating  unemployment, and I hope we will succeed in finding a fair  compromise between the exigencies of economic development and  the expectations of society over the next four years, which is  when the present coalition will be still in power.    The psychological aspect of the reforms is perhaps the most  important one. Not just in Poland, but also in Russia and other  East European countries, there is a problem of how to convert  people's thoughts about the future into reality following these  great revolutionary, or, if you prefer, evolutionary changes.  Social enthusiasm and patience used to be an important factor.  Today, there is virtually no enthusiasm left, and society's  patience has run out. And the main problem is compelling people  to take an active role in the changes.    I do not think these issues are being correctly resolved in  our countries. The problem is to encourage Poles to take an  active part in democratic institutions, political structures at  all levels, trade unions, and the country's economic life.    A very important and positive fact is that literally  thousands of people are taking an active part in privatization,  stock exchange operations, and the acquisition and disposal of  shares. This is essential if we want to have a society that is  energetic and geared to a free market.    Of course, Poland had and still has an advantage over its  neighbors inasmuch as under the previous system it maintained a  small but neverthleless real private sector in the economy. The  main task at present is to convince people that further reforms  possess a purpose and genuine justification, and that these  further reforms are not being pursued just for the hell of it,  nor have they been suggested by American advisers, the IMF, or  our friends in Davos here. The reforms are of fundamental  importance for every Polish family, because thanks to them we  can proceed ahead to a better life. It is of vital importance  that everyone understands this, and we must find good arguments  to channel our educated society's energy potential into pursuing  the reforms.    The chief danger to the reforms in Poland, and probably in  other central and East European countries, is not the coming  into power of a left wing or right wing party, but society's  frustration and disenchantment, which could spoil the progress  of the reforms. We must eliminate this danger, and I think that  in Poland we are managing to do so.</p>

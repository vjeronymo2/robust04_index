			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Judge faces probe in Italy scandal MR Diego Curto, one of the most senior judges on the company law bench at Milan's court of justice, has been placed under investigation in Italy's 18-month political corruption scandal. The move followed an inter-rogation on Thursday at which Mr Curto, who has been practising law in Milan for the past 34 years, was questioned about his role in the period before the demise of the Enimont chemicals concern. Executives at Montedison, the industrial arm of the troubled Ferruzzi group, allegedly paid about L135bn (Pounds 56m) in kickbacks to politicians during the lifetime of Enimont, the ill-fated chemicals joint venture between Montedison and the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group. Attention turned to Mr Curto after the arrest last month of Mr Vincenzo Palladino, deputy chair-man of Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of Italy's most prestigious banks, on allegations regarding the Enimont affair. Mr Palladino, who is also a prominent lawyer and business consultant, was appointed legal guardian of a crucial packet of 80 per cent of Enimont's shares by Mr Curto as the battle for control between Eni and Montedison reached its peak in November 1990. It has since emerged that Mr Palladino received L4.5bn for his efforts, which lasted just 22 days. About half the money was allegedly paid into a foreign bank account. Because Mr Curto himself is a judge, the allegations against him of aiding and abetting a crime will be investigated by magistrates in Brescia, which is responsible for disciplinary matters in the Milan judicial district. Mr Curto, who has presided over some of Italy's most heated corporate battles, yesterday protested his innocence.</p>

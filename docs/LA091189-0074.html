			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BECKER SERVES A DEUTSCH TREAT;  </P> <P> WEST GERMAN DROPS LENDL IN FOUR-SET FINAL  </P> <P> In the fourth set, in the final tiebreaker, on the last day of the U.S. Open,  Boris Becker stood at the service line and did something odd.  </P> <P> He smiled.  </P> <P> Here was the sort of pressure that could unnerve the strongest of psyches and  Becker decided to smile, of all things, as if he had a secret on the world.  </P> <P> "It's something you can't explain," said Becker of West Germany. "It's  something coming up inside of you. What it is is believing in yourself."  </P> <P> Two points away from his second Grand Slam title in two months, Becker sent two  high-speed serves at Ivan Lendl, who glared hollow-eyed across the net.  </P> <P> Becker's first was an ace. He needed one more.  </P> <P> So as his second serve blew down the middle and bounced aimlessly off Lendl's  racket, Boris Becker made believers out of everybody once again.  </P> <P> Becker completed a rare double-slam Sunday as the Wimbledon champion also  became the U.S. Open champion when he defeated Lendl, 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 6-3, 7-6  (7-4) in 3 hours 51 minutes.  </P> <P> In a matchup of the world's two best players, Becker was better. His fourth  Grand Slam title, but his first outside of Wimbledon, came at the expense of  No. 1-ranked Lendl, who lost his fifth Open final Sunday.  </P> <P> "It's quite unbelievable," he said.  </P> <P> A U.S Open champion on three occasions, Lendl has lost the final five times and  this one may have been the toughest to take because he was so helpless at  exactly the wrong time.  </P> <P> Lendl pointed to the fourth set tiebreaker and what Becker did the final two  points.  </P> <P> "Tiebreakers are usually a shootout, but with a serve like his . . . he hit two  great serves," Lendl said. "There is not much that you can do about it. I don't  know what to say."  </P> <P> Becker's serve was particularly eloquent, especially at critical moments. He  had 11 aces, including one at game point to even the fourth set at 6-6 and send  the match into the tiebreaker.  </P> <P> Unlike the first-set tiebreaker, Becker fell behind quickly. Lendl led, 2-0, on  two Becker errors, but allowed him to tie with a lob that sailed long and a  crucial double fault.  </P> <P> At 3-2, Becker's first volley drove Lendl deep to his backhand in the far  corner and then he put away the return with a backhand volley winner.  </P> <P> Lendl hit out from the baseline and his forehand was long for 5-3, so when  Becker carelessly dropped a backhand into the net, it was with the knowledge he  had the next two serves and the end of the match was totally within his power.  </P> <P> That is why Becker smiled. He stood with one foot close to the baseline, one  directly behind and rocked from one to the other.  </P> <P> Within seconds, it was over. As the ball dribbled away from Lendl, Becker threw  both arms into the air and stood motionless for several seconds, a red-headed  statue.  </P> <P> Just as he had done when he defeated Stefan Edberg to win at Wimbledon, Becker  heaved his dark blue and red racket into the stands. After shaking hands with  Lendl, Becker was soon holding the silver U.S. Open championship trophy aloft.  </P> <P> Standing to one side, what must Lendl have been thinking?  </P> <P> Maybe it was the first-set tiebreaker, which he lost after falling behind, 5-0.  It could have been the third set when he broke Becker, then had a key  double-fault to lose his own serve at love and miss his chance to even the set.  </P> <P> Possibly Lendl was thinking about the kind of player Becker has become, a rival  to his own No. 1 ranking.  </P> <P> "Obviously top players have something more than the others and they win a lot  of matches because they come up with better shots than anybody else," he said.  </P> <P> Tracing Becker's thought was simpler. He remembered the shot that saved him  from losing in the second round, the one on match point that hit the net cord  and bounced away from Derrick Rostagno, who was waiting to hit a simple volley  that would have beaten Becker.  </P> <P> "To win a Grand Slam, you have to once come from a match where you are almost  out of the tournament," said Becker, who earned $300,000 for the victory. "All  the time it's like that, at least for me.  </P> <P> "So I knew after I survived that match that things could only get better for  me, not worse. It made me calmer."  </P> <P> It did not make him No. 1, however. Even though Lendl's lost, he retained his  top ranking over Becker by six computer points.  </P> <P> Becker lost in the second round of the Australian Open, but then made the  semifinals at the French Open and won Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> Lendl won in Australia, lost in the fourth round of the French Open, the  semifinal at Wimbledon and now the final at the U.S. Open. Even Lendl admitted  that he and Becker are close to equal.  </P> <P> "Boris and I have been playing well throughout the year and the other players  have had ups and down," Lendl said. "I don't know if you can call it two No. 1s  or whatever."  </P> <P> Lendl was asked if Becker is the No. 1 player this year.  </P> <P> "I think there is a very good case for it," he said.  </P> <P> Certainly there was not much separating Becker and Lendl on this humid  September Sunday. They won exactly the same number of points, 143. They both  committed 43 unforced errors. Becker held 14 service games, Lendl held 15.  </P> <P> But if there is a lasting memory at the 109th U.S. Open, it is Boris Becker  standing there at the service line with a smile on his face.  </P> <P> It was a Grand Slam smile.  </P></p>

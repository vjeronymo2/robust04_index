			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Letter: Slogans and company directors have their day Sir, When Lord King set about the task of turning round British Airways he sacked a great many people, explaining as he did so that it took too long to change people's attitudes - it was quicker to change the people. I cannot imagine why this memory came back to me as I read your comment about the unsatisfactory nature of the statement from the board of BA ('BA off course', January 22). Lord King's place in history is secure, as - strangely enough - seems to be the place of the slogan 'Fly the flag', which came to me one lunch-time as I was walking from the offices of BA's then advertising agency FCB to the Savile. But it is not just slogans that have their day. Directors do too. Osman Streater, Savile Club, 69 Brook Street, London W1Y 2ER</p>

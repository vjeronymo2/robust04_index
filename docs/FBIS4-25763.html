			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata said here Monday [13 June] that his country is  unable to participate in military missions around the world.    At a meeting of the committee for budget attached to the  House of Councillors, Hata said that Japan can only take actions  within the framework of the Constitution, including such  activities as backup support and mine-sweeping during the Gulf  war.    "It is very difficult for Japan to cooperate with the United  States in the military aspect of possible sanctions against the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea," the prime minister said  while referring to the nuclear dispute on the Korean peninsula.    Before the routine meeting of the committee for budget, both  the Japanese prime minister and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa  said Japan should keep in close touch with the United States,  South Korea and China to strive for a peaceful settlement on the  nuclear dispute in the Korean peninsula.    Meanwhile, measures put forward at the U.N. Security Council  concerning the issue should be carried out step by step, they  said.</p>

ATA reporter said that when Serbian authorities banned the  Albanalogic Institute, they gave a decision to Mr. Qosja  according to which he must be taken the passport and pay a 3,000  DM [German marks] fine. This is the biggest punishment for  passing the border with Albania without exit visas. The  punishment is applied by Yugoslavia since 1981 in order to stop  any kind of communication between the Albanians who are  separated by Albania-Kosova border which is under Serbian forces  control.    The Council for Human Rights Protection in Prishtina, the  Albanian Intellectuals Forum, and the Albanalogic Institute  appeal to the international community for stopping the  repression on Albanians of Kosova and taking the passports from  them.</p>

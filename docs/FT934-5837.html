			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Fashion: Belgian chic - from riches to rags / Does anyone actually wear the deconstructionists' designs? / A look at the clothes on the catwalks, below, and, right, on some real-life customers The most interesting and challenging clothes right now come from a man who makes jackets out of old Metro posters and a woman whose idea of decoration is hospital-style tape ties. This sounds like the same avant-garde freakiness that spawned fashion-victim long black layers, impossible to wear for anyone other than scrawny superwaifs, but the growing band of sophisticated women who love these clothes tell a different story. Ann Demeulemeester, Martin Margiela and Dries van Noten are the tongue-twisting Belgian triumvirate leading the 'deconstruction' movement which turns the traditional precepts of clothes-making literally inside out, putting lining fabrics, raw edges, seams and so on on the outside. These are controversial ideas that originally made a strong point about consumerist fashion in recessionary times but, as the threesome insists, such ideas are only a tiny part of their output. The designers are the direct descendants of the older avant-garde grouping of Rei Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake, who have long toyed with such themes. But whereas the Japanese looked to their own culture and the future for their uncompromising shapes, the Belgians are infused with a powerful nostalgia for Europe's fashion past. The Belgians graduated from art school in Antwerp in the mid-1980s. They share a philosophy which then seemed revolutionary, that clothes should be a quiet mix of individual pieces, new and old, to enhance the personality. With brash, gilt-buttoned logoland all around them, they needed shock tactics to get noticed. Hence Margiela's anarchic shows in derelict hospitals and car parks featuring plastic-bag dresses bound round with Sellotape, or waiter's aprons worn with thigh-high waders, Demeulemeester's overlong sleeves and tape-ties looking suspiciously like ideas from straitjackets or hospital robes, and van Noten's retreat into institutional-looking baggy grey or beige linen. Now that fashion has undergone a sea-change and recycling, plain clothes and tiny details are desirable, they find themselves in the vanguard and they have softened their position. Far from clothing women in ugly black layers, they say, they want them to look their natural best. The result in their spring collections, and those from kindred spirits such as Martine Sitbon and Helmut Lang, is a delicate, lyrical freshness that makes the efforts of better-known designers to follow the same lines look like the bumbling of clumsy dinosaurs. These Belgians are far from the snarling nihilists some of their publicity suggests. Margiela is a charming, gentle giant whose chunky marled sweater and sea dog's cap make him look more like a North Sea fisherman than a designer. He finds beauty both in precious old clothes and the ability to remodel them in modern form. His ideas tread a fine line between the witty and the wacky, usually coming down on the right side because of their quality. The soft, chunky Aran-style sweater shrouded in a layer of fine net, the clingy crop-top apparently made from a pair of long socks, the antique-looking crepe dress with its darts and hem carefully unpicked and pressed open (yet still flatteringly cut), the man-styled jacket cut with a narrow shoulderline and overlong sleeves to emphasise femininity - the list seems endless. Margiela's influence on current fashion is eloquently displayed by his spring collection. There is not a single new piece, just his favourites from previous collections, all coloured grey and carefully dated with their year of design. There they all are - the apron skirt, the flesh-coloured chiffon body with tattoo print, even the recycled paper jacket, all invented here but seen on many international catwalks for the first time this season. Sheila Cunningham, a 60-year-old East End social worker and one-time assistant to New York fashion doyenne Diana Vreel, is one of his fans. 'His clothes are a private pleasure. They don't cry out 'designer' and could be second-hand but they are well-made and feel wonderful. Dark colours are good for work and public transport. The shapes are individual enough to transcend trends. I buy such things in sales and need them to last.' Ann Demeulemeester, a small, pale blonde with limpid blue eyes, is a perfectionist whose business is self-financed and controlled. She says she 'only started designing when I felt I had something different to say, to put my soul into clothes. Mainstream fashion was about comedy then but I was trying to design poetry.' Her clothes are detailed with craft-like care. Tiny ties that bind and fasten, fine tucks in the back of a swirling soft dress that give it a flattering sensuousness, the femininity of a bias-cut velvet skirt under a narrow, but mannish, brocade frockcoat - wearing these clothes is a subtle pleasure. Her spring look is soft and fragile, with tiny linen camisoles suspended over mesh tops and hitched-up Victorian skirts, and pale, delicate colours replacing some of the black. 'I wanted to dispel the idea that my clothes are sad,' she says, 'though sadness is a fine emotion.' Dries van Noten, who looks as beautiful and delicate as his printed chiffons, is the most accessible of the three in design terms. Always more inclined to use colour, he likes fragile, ethnic fabrics, antique embroidery and beading which he mixes with plain textures. His spring collection of nostalgic chiffon lingerie dresses, softly rose-printed overblouses and double chiffon reversible skirts is one of the season's prettiest. The clients' comments show the appeal of these clothes to be their subtle detail and unshowy luxury. This is because they are cleverly designed and well made from the best fabrics. There is an idea that the deconstructed look can be achieved by chopping up, rebuilding and leaving raw edges on any old undersized, overwashed 1970s leftovers. If you do that you will just look as if you are wearing - well - chopped-up 1970s leftovers. To look elegant and believable, even deconstruction must be handled by artists and experts. A selection of the Belgian designers work can be seen at the following shops: A la Mode, Hans Crescent, London SW1; Browns, South Molton Street, W1; Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, SW1; Joans, Floral Street, WC2; Joseph, Brompton Cross, SW3; Pollyanna of Barnsley; Warehouse of Glasgow and Whistles, St Christopher's Place, W1 and branches.</p>

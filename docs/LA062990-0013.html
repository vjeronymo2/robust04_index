			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOY, 5, DIES AFTER BEING FOUND HANGING IN GARAGE  </P> <P> A 5-year-old boy died shortly after he was found hanging Thursday in the garage  behind his South Los Angeles home, authorities said.  </P> <P> The body of Gabriel McGee was discovered about 1:35 p.m. by his mother, who had  gone out to the rear of the family's home in the 5300 block of South 8th  Street, Los Angeles Police Lt. Fred Nixon said.  </P> <P> A 6-foot-tall stepladder lay on the floor beneath the child, Nixon said.  </P> <P> McGee was rushed to Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, where he was  pronounced dead, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> Police said they are unsure whether the death was a suicide or a homicide.  </P> <P> "All we know is that he climbed the ladder and either stepped off or had the  ladder pushed," said Lt. Richard Iddings of the LAPD's Child Abuse Unit.  </P> <P> As the boy's family and playmates gathered in the driveway of the home,  saddened adult neighbors standing on street corners and lawns characterized  Gabriel as sociable.  </P> <P> "He was a sweet child," said a neighbor who identified herself only as Barbara.  "He always liked to play with the kids around here and play in the yard."  </P> <P> Dabbing tears from her eyes, she joined a chorus of other neighbors who  rejected speculation that Gabriel may have killed himself.  </P> <P> "That child ain't climbed no 6-foot ladder," said a girl who claimed to be the  boy's cousin. "There's just no way he is going to do something like that."  </P> <P> Iddings said the boy's parents were being questioned Thursday by the police,  but investigators had no suspects.  </P></p>

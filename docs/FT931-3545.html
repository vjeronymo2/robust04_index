			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / FT Conference: EC to review water standards A QUARTER of Europe's rivers fall below European Community environmental standards, the European Commission said yesterday. It announced a wide-ranging review this year of all its directives on water quality. Mr Tom Garvey, deputy director-general of the environment directorate, said some EC standards might be modified or dropped in the light of new scientific evidence. But Mr Garvey, speaking in London at a Financial Times conference on the European water industry, said he was disappointed at the lack of improvement in EC water quality in the past 20 years. UK water companies and their Continental counterparts have been campaigning fiercely for a review of the EC water directives, some of which were issued in the 1970s. They say many unnecessary and expensive to implement. The companies have also been concerned that the National Rivers Authority, the water quality watchdog, could add billions of pounds to industry spending by a severe interpretation of the directives or by setting its own statutory water quality objectives. Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of the economic regulator Ofwat and responsible for setting price rises, told the conference that 'an unending escalation in prices would be intolerable' and that prices were 'now in danger of being driven ever upwards by new obligations'. Lord Crickhowell, chairman of the authority, accused the water companies and Ofwat of exaggerating the likely costs of measures such as water quality objectives when the objectives had not yet been set. The water industry has estimated that this decade's capital spending to bring UK water in line with environmental standards could be between Pounds 30bn and Pounds 45bn. The Water Services Association, which represents the 10 large water and sewerage companies of England and Wales, yesterday welcomed the commission's proposed review.</p>

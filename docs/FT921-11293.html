			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / International Company News: SocGen confident of recovery SOCIETE Generale, one of France's largest private sector banks, expects to see a recovery in gross operating profits to around FFr10bn (Dollars 1.84bn) in 1991, after a fall in profits during the previous year. The news of Societe Generale's anticipated recovery came only a day after Paribas, another prominent French bank, warned that it had fallen into a loss - of FFr200m - last year for the first time in its history. Both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agencies, have put Paribas under surveillance to decide whether to reduce its rating. The projected increase in Societe Generale's profits represents a marked improvement on its performance in 1990, when net profits fell by 25 per cent to FFr2.7bn after it was forced to increase provisions for bad debts and securities. Mr Marc Vienot, president, speaking at a shareholders meeting in Paris, yesterday refused to disclose the likely level of 1991's net attributable profits. He said only that they 'would not be poor'. In the first half of 1991, net profits rose to FFr1.83bn from FFr1.41bn in the year-ago period. Mr Vienot said although first-half results were usually stronger than those of the second, last year the performance in the second half had been stronger than in the past. Societe Generale increased its lending by 13.4 per cent last year, with business loans showing particularly strong growth of 18 per cent. However, demand for new credit was poor because of the low level of French interest rates. The group cut back on country risk provisions last year, after reducing its exposure by 10 per cent from 1990. It was forced to increase provisions for commercial debt in 1991, but managed to reclaim part of the FFr1.2bn set aside in provisions for its share portfolio. The French stock market authorities have criticised the share sale agreement between Pinault, the timber and retailing group, and the Maus family, the main shareholders in the Au Printemps retail group for which Pinault has made a FFr5.3bn two-thirds bid. The Commission des Operations de Bourse said the agreement was not fair to Au Printemps' minority shareholders.</p>

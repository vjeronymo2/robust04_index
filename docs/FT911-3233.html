			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Electricity workers vote on 8.9% THREATS of industrial action in the electricity supply industry appeared to recede yesterday as unions arranged ballots of their 70,000 members over the improved 8.9 per cent offer. The offer will be put without a recommendation. Mr Eddie Newall, national officer for the electricity supply industry at the GMB general union, said he believed a majority of his members would accept the offer if the only alternative was to take industrial action. The possibility of industrial-action ballots among 95,000 British Rail workers will be discussed today at a meeting of the Federation of Rail Unions attended by Aslef, RMT and TSSA. Recommendations are expected to be decided on by the executive committees of the unions on Friday. The latest group poised to threaten industrial action is made up of Post Office counter and clerical staff. The executive of the Union of Communication Workers, the union that represents about 14,500 Post Office staff, is due today to endorse a recommendation from the union's postal committee for a strike ballot to begin at the end of this week.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Ford cuts discounts to rental fleets FORD is to cut its sharply discounted sales to many big rental fleet operators, whose combined new car purchases from all carmakers approach 100,000 annually, John Griffiths writes. This should help Ford to return to profitability this year, Mr Ian McAllister, chairman and managing director, said yesterday. A study for the Retail Motor Industry Federation, the franchised dealers' trade body, found that discounts of up to 40 per cent have been available from some manufacturers. A number of large fleet deals have been concluded directly between manufacturers and fleet operators, bypassing the dealer networks.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'KING OF THE RIGHT' HEADED THE WRONG WAY  </P> <P> Whereas I am in favor of all people volunteering their time to show  appreciation for our societal privileges, I don't think it should be government  mandated at the expense of drivers' licenses and student loans. I believe this  because the people in power for the most part are greedy and self-absorbed,  unwilling to volunteer their own time, so why should we?  </P> <P> Also, today's society dictates that young people work harder to accommodate the  same middle-class lifestyle that our parents had, thus allowing less time to  volunteer.  </P> <P> While I do my part (I'm a teacher, attend school and still volunteer many  hours), I will not condemn my peers for their selfishness.  </P> <P> Besides, rallying behind the imparted wisdom of someone who grew up wealthy --  never having struggled, nor understood nor appreciated the opinions or tastes  of the middle class -- is another crusade we can do without.  </P> <P> ANTHONY KARCH  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWIMMING / NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> RELAY RALLY GIVES TEXAS LEAD OVER USC, 360-291  </P> <P> Texas extended its lead over USC at the NCAA swimming and diving championships  when Doug Gjertsen passed Dan Jorgensen in the last leg of the 800-yard  freestyle relay Friday.  </P> <P> After two days, Texas leads USC, 360-291. Stanford is third with 231 points.  UCLA is sixth with 175.  </P> <P> Texas led the relay until the 600-yard mark, when Dave Wharton of USC passed  Matt Stahlman of Texas. Wharton made up more than one second on his leg. But  Gjertsen was waiting.  </P> <P> Gjertsen, who earlier won the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:33.15, caught  Jorgensen with 100 yards left and held on for the victory.  </P> <P> "I was confident that I could have swum faster in the relay, but I have a lot  of swims tomorrow," Gjertsen said.  </P> <P> Texas entered the session with a 17-point lead, but USC overtook the Longhorns  for the team lead, 204-201, after three events.  </P> <P> Princeton opened the evening by winning the 200-yard medley relay in an NCAA,  American, and U.S. Open record time of 1:27.31. UCLA finished second, also  under the old record.  </P> <P> USC made its move in the 400-yard individual medley when Dave Wharton won for  the third year in a row. Ray Looze, also of USC, was second. Wharton's time of  3:43.62 was well off his record.  </P> <P> Wharton led by a body length after 100 yards and steadily pulled away. Looze's  time of 3:47.08 was a lifetime best.  </P> <P> In the 100-yard butterfly, Anthony Nesty of Florida pulled away from the field  to win with a time of 46.62 seconds. Although Shaun Jordan of Texas finished  second, USC continued to hold an advantage because Erik Ran finished fourth and  Brad Bailey was 12th.  </P> <P> Nesty, who won the 100-meter butterfly at the Seoul Olympics, trailed Ran at  the 50-yard mark and pulled ahead at 75 yards.  </P> <P> However, the Trojans' advantage was short lived. Texas won the next two events,  Gjertsen the 200-yard freestyle and Kirk Stackle the 100-yard breaststroke.  </P> <P> In the next event, the three-meter springboard, Donie Scott of Southern  Methodist defeated Thursday night's one-meter champion Mark Lenzi of Indiana,  974.55-663.90.  </P></p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow advances to record high in slow trade Wall Street US EQUITIES once more reached record levels yesterday, but the power of the advance was somewhat undermined by the lack of participation in one of the slowest trading days of the year, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 28.17 to 3,397.58, but a meagre 157.6m shares changed hands on the big board. Declining issues trailed those advancing by 640 to 1,083. Gains were less pronounced in the transportation sector, where the Dow Jones Transportation average added only 2.62 at 1,402.28, while the Dow Jones Utilities average eased 0.13 to 213.88. Among other market indices, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.44 higher at 418.49, while the Nasdaq composite put on 1.37 to 587.13. Wall Street took its opening cue from higher overseas markets in the absence of any domestic market stimulus. Traders will receive a clearer picture of inflation from today's release of April's producer price index and tomorrow's announcement of the April consumer price index. Among featured issues, Wal-Mart climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 53 in heavy volume on the back of predictably strong first-quarter earnings of 34 cents a share, against 27 cents a year ago from the big discount retailer. May Department Stores, which also reported quarterly earnings yesterday, firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 55 7/8 . The company had net income of 60 cents a share in the first three months of this year, compared with 56 cents a year earlier. A number of blue chip stocks moved higher in heavy trading, including IBM, up Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 93 7/8 , BankAmerica, Dollars  5/8 ahead at Dollars 48, and Philip Morris, which gained Dollars 1 to Dollars 79. General Dynamics edged forward Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 66 1/4 after news that the company has agreed to sell its missile operations to Hughes Aircraft. The big three US auto makers weakened, with Chrysler losing Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 18 5/8 , Ford down Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 and General Motors Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 39 3/8 . Seagate Technology was one of the most active over-the- counter stocks, firming Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 16 3/8 . Trading was also heavy in MCI Communications, Dollars  1/8 easier at Dollars 32 1/2 , Sun Microsystems, Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 30 1/4 , Lotus Development, Dollars  3/4 cheaper at Dollars 30 3/4 , and Microsoft, down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 114. Canada TORONTO surged 1.6 per cent as pressure on bank shares lifted after the market finally heard some encouraging news on Olympia &amp; York. Newspaper reports said the UK government may relocate some of its offices into O &amp; Y's Canary Wharf. The TSE 300 composite index closed 52.8 up at 3,427.2. Advances outnumbered declines by 336 to 219 after volume of 28.03m shares valued at CDollars 357.9m. Bank shares, pressured over the last two months by fears of heavy losses from exposure to debt-troubled O &amp; Y, gained 81 points or 3.12 per cent as a sector. Bank of Nova Scotia rallied CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 20 7/8 , Canadian Imperial moved ahead CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 28 5/8 , Royal Bank of Canada gained CDollars 1 to CDollars 24 7/8 and Bank of Montreal scored an advance of CDollars 1 to CDollars 44 1/4.</p>

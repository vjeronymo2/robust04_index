			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Overt intervention by Italians EUROPEAN currencies had a turbulent afternoon on the foreign exchanges yesterday after the Bank of Italy intervened heavily in the open market to support the lira, writes James Blitz. Although opinion polls suggest that the Irish people will vote 'Yes' to the Maastricht Treaty on European union today, traders have been noticeably edgy about the overall prospects for European Monetary Union (Emu) since the Danes voted 'No' in their referendum. Yesterday, the lira fell victim to uncertainty yet again: the failure of the Maastricht accord would reduce the incentive for this politically muddled country to reduce its massive budget deficit. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, fanned the flames over the Italian currency yesterday. The bank said Italy's budget deficit could lead to a devaluation of up to 8 per cent. Heavy lira selling ensued, the currency dipped below L758 to the D-Mark for the first time in six months and ended firmly at the bottom of the grid in the European Monetary System. The Italian central bank responded with its heaviest intervention in the market this month, selling D-Marks for lire. A Bank of Italy official was forced to confirm publicly that the speculation about a devaluation was 'nonsense'. But at L757.50 to the D-Mark, the currency was trading close to the intervention point, suggesting that the Italians' efforts amounted to little more than a holding operation. By contrast, sterling appreciated sharply against the D-Mark after Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, underlined Britain's commitment to European economic convergence. He also said the pound could enter the narrow bands of the EMS when the time was right. There was nothing new in Mr Lamont's remarks, but the market's directionless mood made his statement seem important. Sterling rose nearly a pfennig following the statement, peaking at DM2.9254 before closing at DM2.9250. A mixed batch of UK indicators had little effect on the pound: May's retail sales were poorer than expected, increasing by 0.3 per cent, and May's industrial production figures were only marginally better than predicted, rising 0.7 per cent. Sterling was helped by a weaker tone to the D-Mark, which lost ground to the US dollar. There was nothing concrete behind the US currency's strength. A dealer said that today's holiday in Germany had led to short-term dollar buying; another said that an Irish 'Yes' to Maastricht would weaken the D-Mark as Emu tensions ease. The dollar climbed more than a pfennig against the D-Mark to finish at DM1.5780 in Europe. In New York it slipped back to a DM1.5745 close.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (6): Signs of a healthy revival - Syndicated Loans THERE ARE signs of a healthy revival in the syndicated loans market after several years in the doldrums, as borrowers take advantage of a renewed willingness among banks to start lending once more. Activity in this area of the international capital market slowed in the late 1980s as banks shied away from making new loans while they were still preoccupied with the financial difficulties besetting some of their borrowers. However, now that the banks have resolved these credit issues, they are looking to rebuild their loan books with high-quality assets. The most active lenders in recent months have been Anglo-Saxon banks which are responding to an increased demand for credit as the US and UK economies come out of recession. Some Japanese banks are also seen to be seeking to participate in international loans to compensate for a poor climate for lending at home. Banks have been queueing up to participate in loans to good-quality names. As a result, some loans which have been syndicated in recent months have been substantially oversubscribed. For instance, a three-year credit facility arranged for Spain in July was over-subscribed by Ecu2bn (Dollars 1.8bn). As a result, the borrower was able to increase its facility to Ecu5bn from an original Ecu4bn and the additional Ecu1bn was used to reduce the commitments of other banks involved in the loan. The high interest in the deal meant that Spain was able to get very favourable terms for its multi-currency, revolving facility. It will be paying a margin of 7.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) in addition to an annual facility fee of 5 basis points. The loan arranged for Spain was the largest financing to be put together by a European government this year. They note that the syndicated loans market is now attracting a much wider range of borrowers than 10 years ago, from sovereigns and corporates to local authorities and even housing associations. There are several reasons why many borrowers prefer to raise funds in the syndicated loans market than in the bond market or in the stock market. Bankers say the syndicated loans market can provide very large loans very quickly and the loan can be as flexible as possible to suit the borrower. Furthermore, the syndicated loans market practically guarantees confidentiality to the borrower, an important factor if a company is seeking to raise financing for an acquisition or a merger. The present climate of low interest rates and the banks' much more positive stance towards lending are working to the advantage of the borrowers. Many are enjoying a substantial reduction in the margin they have to pay over Libor. For instance, bankers say blue-chip corporate borrowers can expect to pay a margin of around 35 basis points over Libor for a straightforward five-year loan, compared with 50 basis points two years ago. So far this downward spiral in pricing has applied only to borrowers with a good or improving credit rating. It remains a struggle to interest banks in loans to borrowers they perceive to be too risky. For example, banks are still reluctant to lend to many Italian borrowers, since their memories of the Efim debacle are still fresh. When Efim, the Italian state industrial holding group, went into liquidation in July 1992, it owed Italian and foreign banks L9,500bn (Dollars 6.3bn). Initially, the treasury had proposed to repay the Efim loans by using bonds with below-market interest rates. This idea was fiercely resisted by the banks and the treasury backed down and agreed to repayment in full.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 20 LEAD MANAGERS OF INTERNATIONAL SYNDICATED LOANS AND NIFS*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Group                  Volume (USDollars m)       No of issues  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Chemical Banking Corp            132,505.63                238 J P Morgan                        90,877.74                 93 Citicorp                          89,056.34                127 NationsBank                       79,850.64                 76 Bank of America                   76,510.36                100 Chase Manhattan Bank              66,138.91                112 Bank of Nova Scotia               62,957.16                 60 Credit Lyonnais                   61,392.60                 64 Barclays                          61,042.04                 91 NatWest Bank                      54,892.01                 89 Sumitomo Bank                     54,213.38                 75 Societe Generale                  48,968.56                 64 Deutsche Bank                     47,703.21                 58 BNP                               46,731.34                 54 CS/CS First Boston                44,500.01                 66 First Chicago                     43,061.54                 79 Fuji Bank                         41,724.38                 73 Bankers Trust                     41,682.90                 53 UBS                               39,063.85                 73 RBC Dominion                      38,095.53                 30  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Deals signed during January to September 30, 1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IFR Securities Data  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

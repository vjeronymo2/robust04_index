			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Clampdown on dole fraud saves government Pounds 44.7m A CLAMPDOWN on dole fraud last year netted the government Pounds 44.7m, the Department of Employment said yesterday. In 250,000-plus investigations during 1992-93, more than 61,100 people withdrew their benefit claims, while 2,602 claimants and 55 employers were prosecuted. In one operation at London's Heathrow airport more than 100 minicab drivers were caught, while 550 seaside workers in Wales withdrew claims after an investigation. The department says it is identifying more cases of collusion by employers, who encourage workers to claim unemployment benefits while paying low wages. The practice is particularly prevalent in textiles, construction and agriculture. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said: 'This behaviour gives unscrupulous employers an unfair advantage over their competitors. Their workforce claim benefits, and so are paid lower wages. It is unfair competition, an example of how the black economy corrodes the fabric of our society.' The Department of Employment has estimated that about 8 per cent of unemployment claims may be fraudulent, amounting to some Pounds 500m. This year it has no financial target for savings but aims to have 63,000 claims withdrawn by the end of the financial year. Last year's operations, which grossed Pounds 71.1m, cost the department Pounds 26.4m. It says it saved Pounds 2.69 for every Pounds 1 invested. 'Travelling' fraud, whereby claimants sign on in one area and work in another, is on the increase, according to the department.</p>

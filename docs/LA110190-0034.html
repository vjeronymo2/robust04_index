			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Rock Loses a Round: Rock fans in England received some bad news Wednesday when  the government decided that Britain's new commercial FM station will feature  music "other than pop or rock." This is bad news not only for fans but also for  the various rock stars -- such as Phil Collins, Robert Plant, David Bowie, and  Elton John -- who lobbied for a rock format on the country's just-formed  commercial FM station. It is expected that the station, which is to be  operational in late 1991, will feature classical music. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

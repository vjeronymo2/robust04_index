			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Budget woes continue to plague the Denver Symphony orchestra. The orchestra,  whose current season was almost wiped out by red ink, now must end the season  this Saturday, three months early, because of a nearly $1-million shortfall.  "Obviously, we cannot continue to run without cash in the bank, and at this  point in time we can't run until June," chairman John Low said. He said the  orchestra, which is canceling eight concerts, will be back next season. Low  blamed the financial problems on lack of public confidence in the orchestra's  management, which for years has allowed the symphony to run in the red. "Donors  -- substantial donors -- do not like to support an organization that does not  balance its budget," he said. The orchestra had canceled the current season but  a last-ditch fund-raising drive last fall allowed it to open, two weeks late.  Musicians, who will be paid through the end of the week only, were surprised by  the latest announcement. "Nobody in the orchestra knew we were going down the  tube at this moment," said David Abosch, principal oboist, who joined the  symphony in 1949. "We were told that once we got through late February and  early March, we would be all right." Violinist Lee Yeingst said the musicians  were hoping that the board of trustees "will still be beating the bushes,  trying to find money." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

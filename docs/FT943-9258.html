			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Cumbria urges N-waste inquiry Cumbria county councillors decided yesterday to ask Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, to call in the planning application by Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste disposal company, for a Pounds 120m rock laboratory beneath Sellafield. The council believes consideration of the plans, which would study the geology of the site for Nirex's proposed Pounds 2b underground nuclear waste repository, should be part of a wide-ranging public inquiry into the whole issue of nuclear waste disposal.</p>

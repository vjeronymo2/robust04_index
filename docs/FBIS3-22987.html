			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with `Red Star' Militia Commander H.M.; place and </F> date not given: "We Shall Continue Armed Action Until the  Occupation Army and the Settlers Leave Our Land"--first  paragraph is AL-HURRIYAH introduction]    [Excerpts] We met the fighter H.M. in a field near one of  the villages of the occupied West Bank. He was introduced to us  as one of the commanders of the `Red Star' brigades that operate  against the Israeli occupation. He promised us to speak plainly  and with figures. The following conversation with him took place.  <H5>  Settlers Among Our Targets </H5>   [AL-HURRIYAH] Yesterday an Egged bus belonging to settlers  near Hebron; before it a group of settlers near al-Birah; before  that Rabbi Druckman and the settler (Ephraim Ayyubi). Why have  settlers now become a target of Red Star?    [Commander H.M.] Druckman is a leader of the extremist  settlers, a former Knesset member, and a founder of the  pro-settlement Gush Emunim. The settlers near al-Birah were  among those responsible for killing the Palestinian student Rami  al-Ghazzawi from al-Birah. The Egged bus was the transportation  link between the settlement of Qiryat Arba' and Beersheba. They  all fit into one context.    Whoever wants to chase the settlers from his land must fight  them. The settlers will remain among our targets because they  form the nucleus of colonial occupation and the reserve for  military occupation. They run rampant as if they were masters of  the land and we, their slaves, while the occupation army stands  silent. They have mistreated our people, slain our sons,  terrified our women and children, and attacked our property.  They must leave this land at any cost. We have heard the whole  world, with Yasir 'Arafat in its forefront, denounce the killing  of the Israeli settler Hayyim Mizrahi and condemn the Fatah  youths who carried out the heroic operation against the settler  Mizrahi. This frightens no one, so much as it proves to us that  we are on the right path. We don't think the occupation needs a  pretext for repressing the people and throwing our sons into  prison. We are in a state of war with the occupation. We don't  think that laying down our arms will provide us with safety.  Safety will be provided by the departure of the occupation and  the settlers from our land.  <H5>  Big Collaborators, Small Collaborators </H5>   [AL-HURRIYAH] Compared with others in the field of  operations  to liquidate collaborators, you have the smallest number. What  is the reason?    [Commander H.M.] The Red Star forces believe that every  collaborator must meet his just desserts. They certainly are not  lenient with collaborators, who harm many fighters and cause a  large number of them to be killed by the soldiers of the  occupation. Nevertheless, we in Red Star want to exercise care  in dealing with collaborators and distinguish between "big  heads" and "little heads." We think that punishing the big one  is more useful than punishing the little one. Punishing big ones  can serve as a lesson to the little ones. The little ones can be  deterred by warning and by putting them under house arrest and  surveillance. The big ones have passed the point of no return  and must receive their punishment.    We make a decision about a collaborator only after gathering  a sufficient amount of information, documents, and even pictures  that prove his guilt. [passage omitted]    [AL-HURRIYAH] The media has carried sensational accounts of  the way in which you carried out the resolution to execute  [alleged collaborator] Ahmad 'Awdah. How was it done?    [Commander H.M.] We wanted to use the same weapon with which  'Awdah used to threaten the members of our people. He always  used to carry his pistol at his side. We commissioned two of our  comrades, who watched him until the right moment came. They  grabbed the pistol from him and opened fire on him. So we also  won over the gun in the service of our work against the Israeli  occupiers.  <H5>  Unfair, Unfounded Charges </H5>   [AL-HURRIYAH] One force recently published a letter saying  that you laid claim to operations that their fighters carried  out, such as the operation against Rabbi Druckman, or the one  against the settlers' car in al-Birah, or even the one against  the customs bureau in Jerusalem.    [Commander H.M.] First, I would remind you that we could  have  used the same method that this group used in distributing  letters and issuing communiques about the double claims to  certain military operations against the Israeli occupation and  settlers' livestock. But we preferred to remain silent, knowing  well that this kind of information war is not in the interest of  the intifadah or of those who wish to oppose the occupation. Our  interest, besides escalating our operations, is to work to  mobilize forces and join ranks.    Nevertheless, I can make a few quick observations.    This group charges that we claimed responsibility for the  operation that set fire to a customs office in the center of  Jerusalem, whereas a unit belonging to that group carried it out.    Unfortunately, the information is wrong. If it indicates  anything, it indicates the truth of our position, our  information, and our statements, and the falseness of the  others' information and statements. On 23 October 1992, we  announced our responsibility for setting fire to the customs  warehouses, not a customs office, in the 'Atrot district in the  heart of an industrial area in one of Jerusalem's suburbs, not  in the center of Jerusalem proper, as the statement of this  group says. Perhaps the person who drafted this statement,  claiming to belong to the field of armed action, has no  connection to armed action. I think my comrades in arms in the  strike forces and armed groups are well aware and will agree  with me that the operation against the Israeli customs  warehouses was carried out only by Red Star's Martyr Ahmad  al-Kilani group.    As for the Burqin operation near Nablus, which, according to  this communique, targeted an Israeli military vehicle, I wish  the author of the communique would show me a statement issued by  Red Star about the operation. We did not claim responsibility  for the operation because we never carried it out.    Regarding the operation against Rabbi Druckman, it was  followed by the operation against settlers near al-Birah and the  number 51 Egged bus operation near Hebron.    The force that issued the communique claimed responsibility  for the first two operations, but not for the bus. Military  observers commented that the bus operation was implemented in  the same manner as the Druckman and al-Birah operations. We do  not want testimony from military observers. Although, thank God,  we lost none of our comrades in all these operations to capture  or martyrdom, we are always concerned that no one claim our  struggles and sacrifices for himself.    Two vivid examples come to mind. They provide sufficient  proof.    On 29 March 1984, DFLP [Democratic Front for the Liberation  of Palestine] forces carried out a Land Day operation in the  heart of Jerusalem. Although some heroic members of the group  were captured or killed, one of the other groups claimed the  operation for itself. Later it was forced to retract the claim  because of irrefutable facts. That is one example.    Another example is the operation that targeted the settler  Hayyim Mizrahi. The other group claimed responsibility for it by  notarized communiques, but we discovered afterward that those  who had carried it out were a group of Fatah youths who rejected  their leaders' decision to halt the intifadah. I think these two  examples are sufficient, without citing operations by the heroes  of Islamic Jihad's Sword of Islam group for which others claimed  responsibility despite the death of martyrs who everyone knew  belonged to Islamic Jihad.</p>

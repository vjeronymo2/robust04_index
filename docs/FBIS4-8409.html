			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Scepan Aleksic] </F>   [Text] Cajnice, April 12 (TANJUG) -- Moslems from Gorazde  were told when the NATO-U.S. planes would carry out the second  attack on Serb positions near the town, a number of Serb  fighters, who witnessed Monday's attack launched a little after  14:00 hours told the TANJUG correspondent.    Two U.S. planes carried out the raid which lasted 45  minutes.  Civilian targets and Serb positions near Gorazde were attacked  and six missiles were fired accompanied by incessant machinegun  fire, According to Serb fighters on the front line in the Serb  village Bare, two kilometers south of the town on the right bank  of the river Drina.    According to the Serbs a full hour before the attack the  Gorazde Moslems had informed the Serb fighters by radio when the  U.S. air raid would take place, Goran Saric, a commander of a  Serb unit in the Gorazde battlefront said.    As soon as the planes flew in a huge crowd came out on the  streets of Gorazde and many climbed on roofs of buildings and  looked on with binoculars, the deputy commander of the unit  Ljubisa Borovcanin said. They had nothing to fear because the  Serbs had not shelled the town in the last 15 days, he added.    For all their sophisticated electronic equipment the U.S.  planes seemed to fire clumsily, with imprecision and at random,  Borovcanin said adding that they used very powerful missiles  judging by the ten meter long and two meter deep craters they  had left and which were also seen by the TANJUG correspondent.    We did not have the authorization from our command to fire  on  U.S. planes and that is why we did not do so, commander Saric  said. "However the fighters are already losing patience,  especially after the death of their friends and I am sure that  they will fire on the planes next time not heeding anybody's  orders."    In NATO's Monday attack two Serb sanitary cars, clearly  marked with Red Cross signs were destroyed, two Serb paramedics  were killed and two Serb houses razed to the ground and not  tanks as is claimed by NATO, according to information from the  command of the Herzegovina Corps of the Bosnian Serb army.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Herbert Hax, chairman of the "Council of </F> Five Wise Men" by Christian Reiermann; place and date not given:  "`The State Has Some Catching Up To Do'"]    [Text] [Reiermann] The research institutes are predicting  an economic recovery. Is this upswing not coming too early?  Reforms might not take place because the pressure is easing off.    [Hax] We cannot hope for stagnation to continue just to  force us to do what is necessary. We must also be capable of  introducing painful reforms during more prosperous times. In  times of incipient recovery, the labor market will keep  reminding people to do their homework. Nobody can ignore 4  million unemployed.    [Reiermann] Who will have to stay in to do their homework?    [Hax] The state has a lot of catching up to do. It has to  tackle budget consolidation at all levels with much more  determination.    What is missing is a reliable indicator of when tax breaks  will be introduced -- for the taxpayer in general and for  companies in particular. This can be done in spite of the  public spending deficit, if only saving is taken seriously. In  addition, the state should do more deregulating and privatizing.    [Reiermann] Are you content with the wage round partners?    [Hax] Companies and trade unions have acted in a responsible  manner this year. This must be continued by all means, even if  the economy picks up again.    [Reiermann] Trimming in prosperous times?    [Hax] This is difficult. The trade unions in particular  should realize that they cannot simply demand compensation later  for the present cutbacks. One thing must be clear to everybody:  The employment level depends on the wage level.    [Reiermann] Companies seem to have achieved the biggest  progress.    [Hax] That is right. But so far, companies have only dealt  with the destructive part of structural changes: severe cuts in  costs and jobs. Now we need the creative part.    [Reiermann] What does that mean?    [Hax] They must set the course for future-oriented growth,  develop new products, open up new markets.    [Reiermann] But this can only work if the framework  conditions are right.    [Hax] Sure, otherwise production moves. In this case,  Germany would no longer export products, but jobs.</p>

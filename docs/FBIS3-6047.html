The two sides, however,  decided to meet again next Wednesday to carry on with their  talks.    An informed source said that at the sixth working-level  contact held at peace house in the southern sector of Panmunjom,  North Korea eased up somewhat on its four key demands. But the  North Koreans issued a fresh demand that the two sides jointly  announce an "agreement on the principle of the exchange of  special envoys" before discussing procedural matters for the  exchange, the source said. The South brushed aside the North  Korean proposal as unnecessary.    Stressing that the principle of exchanging special envoys  has  already been agreed, the South called on the North to begin  discussing procedural matters, he said.    With Saturday's failure to agree on the envoy exchange, it  has become practically impossible for the two Koreas to exchange  special envoys before March 21 when the third round of  U.S.-North Korea high-level talks are supposed to take place.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Faulty argument in support of weak dollar Sir, Wynne Godley and William Milberg, in their 'Three cheers for a weak dollar' (Personal View, July 6), paint a highly misleading picture of the American balance of payments situation. They claim that imports have for years been growing faster than exports. That is factually wrong. How could it be correct when the US current account deficit declined from Dollars 150bn in 1986 to Dollars 66bn in 1992? What Godley and Milberg fail to recognise is that the balance of payments since 1992 has been affected by the recession in Europe and Japan, while the US economy has bounded ahead. That is why imports of goods and services have risen much faster than exports of goods and services recently. Just as we have a measure of the budget balance that abstracts from the effects of recession - the structural balance - we need such a measure for the balance of payments. It would show a much smaller structural current account deficit than the actual one. It follows that their case for a weaker dollar is itself a weak one.

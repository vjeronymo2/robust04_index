			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Hotels chief welcomes 'bargain Britain': Tourism THE LURE of the UK as a holiday destination for foreign tourists has been boosted by the slide of sterling against other European currencies. 'It's getting cheap now to come to the UK for a holiday, cheaper almost than anywhere else in Europe,' says Mr John Bairstow, chairman of Queens Moat Houses. The group has 86 hotels in continental Europe and 103 in the UK, and mainly targets the business executive and conference market. Mr Bairstow predicted in August that the UK side of the business would progressively become just one of the major areas of operation 'rather than the mainstay of the business'. The fluctuation in exchange rates has, if anything, given impetus to that transfer of status. Mr Bairstow explains: 'Trading over in Germany and the Benelux countries is very high indeed compared to the UK, where it is still very flat. If devaluation is by 20 per cent, where effectively it looks as though it may settle, then it will increase our continental earnings and asset values by 20 per cent on a repatriated basis.' In the first half of this year, UK operating profits for Queens Moat Houses were up by 6.6 per cent over last year to Pounds 38.7m. But the rise in Germany was 37 per cent to Pounds 23.1m; 22 per cent to Pounds 12.9m in the Benelux countries, and 26 per cent to Pounds 2.9m in France. While Mr Bairstow's continental holdings are doing better, a relative fall in the value of sterling also augurs well for the UK hotels. He says there is a lack of tourists from the Continent in the early part of the year because it was cheaper for them to stay at home. 'The UK became an expensive holiday place,' Mr Bairstow says. 'We have here in the UK all the infrastructure to cater for people, but what we didn't have was the exchange rate which made it worthwhile for people to come.' British hotels may now be relatively cheap, but they have to offer a high quality of service to satisfy continental visitors. 'I don't think the UK hotel industry is ever going to be the same again,' Mr Bairstow comments. 'The demand for higher-quality facilities is growing, and when people come back into the UK hotel business I think they are going to be much more demanding.'</p>

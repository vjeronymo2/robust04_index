			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. `Sideshow'"] </F>   [Text] A series of recent reports about the security  situation on the Korean peninsula are too complex to understand.  We are not even aware if North Korean-U.S. and North  Korean-International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] negotiations on  the nuclear issues are being held. The recent U.S. sideshow  makes the security situation on the Korean peninsula more  complex.    U.S. evangelist Billy Graham recently visited with President  Clinton and Kim Il-song separately, conducting secret diplomacy.  We do not dislike this event, however, nothing special resulted  from either meeting, which fell short of our expectations. It  is true, however, that the secret diplomacy made a contribution  to easing the tension. We suspect that, besides a peaceful  diplomatic gesture, the United States is conducting a sideshow,  which is causing the people to think that this is a  demonstration of military strength. The sideshow has been  produced daily by the U.S. Defense Department and press. Let us  cite some actual examples:    The United States will deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK;  the U.S. aircraft carrier, Independence, is moving toward the  waters of the ROK; if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula,  the ROK and U.S. Combined Forces can win in four months; if  North Korea attacks the South, the United States will not be  content with simply repulsing the North Korean forces, but will  occupy Pyongyang and overturn Kim Il-song's regime; the United  States has decided to conduct the Team Spirit exercise this  year; and the United States will send more than 1,000 U.S.  troops to the ROK...    What is an issue is that such reports are not discussed in  advance with the ROK. The people have felt somewhat uneasy  because the United States have unilaterally made such remarks  without full negotiations with the ROK side. The ROK Government  has not actively coped with such reports. There have been many  cases when it has been too late for the ROK Government to cope  with such reports.    Generally speaking, it seems there are two points that make  the people feel uneasy about such a sideshow. One, the people  are anxious over possible U.S.-ROK friction about the security  of the Korean peninsula. Two, the demonstration of military  strength, true or not, may incite North Korea.    Of course, we can understand why the United States is  conducting such a sideshow. We think that the sideshow may be a  U.S. strategy to resolve North Korea's nuclear issue before 22  February when the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors is  expected to be held.    The ROK feels deeply that a war should not break out again  on  the Korean peninsula. For this reason, the ROK cannot but be  surprised at the U.S. unilateral strategy. In addition, the ROK  is doubtful that the sideshow will be helpful to resolve North  Korea's nuclear issue.</p>

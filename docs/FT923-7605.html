			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: Norwegian insurer attacks ruling VITAL FORSIKRING, Norway's second-biggest insurer, has issued a sharp warning that domestic insurance companies would be forced to halt stock market investment unless new regulations covering allocation of life insurance profits were amended. Mr Bjoern Elvestad, Vital's president, said life insurance companies would have serious problems in maintaining their role as long-term investors in Norwegian companies because of the current rules. 'The consequence of these regulations may be that insurance companies will be forced out of the stock market, and in that event an important source of funding for Norway's capital-impoverished businesses will dry up,' Mr Elvestad said. Vital estimates the need for capital by large, domestic stock-listed companies during the next four years at NKr100bn (Dollars 17bn). New regulations, based on the Norwegian Insurance Act, now call for the policyholders' share of annual profits from life insurance companies to be credited completely to the policyholder and on a continuing basis, based on market value. These allocations will have to be made annually, as well as at the termination or transfer of an insurance contract. 'As unrealised gains are also to be distributed, companies' abilities to withstand major fluctuations in the securities' markets, will be reduced,' Mr Elvestad said. He said the 'market-value principle' imposes an unwanted short-term focus on the companies' share investments.</p>

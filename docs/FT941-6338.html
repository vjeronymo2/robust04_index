			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: PIA must tackle causes notsymptoms of bad practice Sir, It is inevitable that there will always be those who oppose change. Change can upset the status quo and threaten vested interests. The PIA's birth pangs have hardly started yet. Speaking as a compliance practitioner, the publication of the PIA's prospectus and how it intends to act as a regulator marks a significant milestone in the PIA's quest for recognition as the self-regulatory organisation by the SIB. A major hurdle for the PIA to clear to gain credibility is how it proposes to tackle the causes rather than treat the symptoms of bad practice. One of the key issues is product bias, which a commission-based remuneration system produces, particularly since Lautro's maximum commission rules have been abolished. Product bias, if allowed to proliferate unchecked, threatens the core on which financial services regulation is founded - treating the client's interests as paramount even where there is a conflict of interest. Given the choice, it will require a perfectly altruistic adviser or salesman to recommend a product that earns him less commission but is more suitable for the needs of the client. I suspect that in practice a 'smart' adviser or salesman is likely to choose the product that will earn the highest commission possible and proceed to make a convincing case for recommending the product to the client. If the PIA truly marks a new dawn, it must waste no time in tackling the causes of bad practice that is highly damaging to the reputation of the industry. If it can do this efficiently, then it should be able to face the future with equanimity and confidence. The pangs and upheaval caused by its birth would have been a price worth paying.

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / A bubble borne along on a wave of money: Stephen Fidler examines the forces driving cash into emerging markets When a stock market rallies by about 10 per cent in a day - as Brazil's did on Tuesday - something other than a calm reassessment of that market's quoted companies is under way. Brazil's market - and others across Latin America, Asia and eastern Europe - is rising on the weight of money flowing from New York and other big financial centres. Almost Dollars 40bn went into stock markets outside the industrialised world last year. Mr Michael Howell, equity strategist at Baring Securities in London, calculates that Dollars 160bn (Pounds 107bn) of emerging market shares were held by foreigners at the end of 1993; seven years earlier, the figure was Dollars 2.4bn. Since 1988, emerging market share prices have doubled. Last year, annual returns to investors were an average 67 per cent. Unsurprisingly, some investors are starting to worry that this is a bubble which may soon burst. Mr Howell argues that changes in the global economy over the last 10 years make the flows into new markets durable. The free flow of capital around the world, economic reform in developing economies and a jump in the US savings rate as baby-boomers get older are driving the change in investment patterns. At the same time, returns on investments in industrialised countries have fallen. But not everyone agrees. Mr Roger Nightingale, a London-based economic consultant, says the big shift of funds into emerging markets is 'definitely temporary'. He argues that the bubbly markets are driven by one thing: Japan's relaxed monetary policy which has created huge outflows of capital. That policy is a response to government fears about unemployment. Once capital outflows from Japan slow - when monetary policy tightens as the unemployment problem recedes - the emerging markets will crack, he says. Capital outflows from Japan last year probably reached Dollars 200bn. This balanced a current account surplus of around Dollars 137bn and inflows of capital from foreigners repaying loans to Japanese banks. According to Mr Nightingale, the Japanese government has placed that money abroad, mainly in US Treasury bills. This has helped keep US interest rates low and has driven US investors out of low-yielding money market funds into equity funds - and the new markets. US mutual funds showed record inflows last year of about Dollars 130bn, of which almost 30 per cent went into international funds. According to preliminary figures from Lipper Analytical Services, net sales of emerging market mutual funds investing in equities reached Dollars 20.7bn. This underestimates total mutual fund investment in emerging markets, since it excludes fixed-income funds typically accounting for a fifth of the equity total, equity funds launched in the fourth quarter, and investment in developing country stocks by general equity and global equity funds. According to Lipper's Mr William McBride, the total assets of emerging funds now amount to around Dollars 100bn. Most of this money (at least 90 per cent of 1993 net sales) is in open-ended funds. This could cause severe volatility in the emerging markets: as investors sell their mutual fund shares, fund managers are forced to liquidate their underlying shares. In the face of heavy sales, the questionable liquidity of many emerging markets would be put to the test. 'I wouldn't want the job of trying to sell Dollars 50m of stock for cash in, say, the Indonesian market,' said Mr McBride. Turnover in the Jakarta market averaged Dollars 33m a day last year. Since a large proportion of this mutual fund investment is from small investors in the US who have been switching out of low-yielding money market funds, the most likely trigger for such a shift would be a sharp rise in US interest rates. Most economists believe some increase in US rates is likely this year. If this rise is modest, US rates will still be at historically lows levels and a substantial flow of funds into mutual funds could be expected to continue. Mr Roger Palmer, of Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, says that even if interest rates turned high enough to tempt mutual funds investors back into money markets, bank deposits and the like, the growing interest of pension funds and insurance companies should help sustain a continued flow of finance into the emerging markets. Mr Anthony Bottrill, deputy managing director of the Washington-based Institute for International Finance, a think-tank owned by international banks, says: 'We are seeing the beginnings of a large portfolio shift that can last 10-15 years.' The movement into emerging markets has been underpinned not only by their good performance, but also by the idea that diversification can reduce overall risk in a portfolio. The problem is that the more institutional investors pile into the emerging markets, the more their investment decisions dominate those markets, reducing the diversification benefits. The behaviour of such longer-term investors may not in any case be enough to sustain performance in emerging markets. The evidence of the 1987 stock market crash was that, in times of trouble, investors retreat to the markets they know best. In other words, the performance of emerging markets remains hostage to what goes on in the industrialised world. Investors should make sure they know what is happening to US interest rates - or even to Japanese unemployment. World stock markets, Page 39</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Books: Loafer's guide to the slack life - Nick Curtis reviews a novelty handbook for disaffected youth THE OFFICIAL SLACKER HANDBOOK by Sarah Dunn Abacus Pounds 6.99, 116 pages Once we had the Anarchist's Handbook: now this jokey apathist's handbook sees the genre of novelty publishing hit new levels of disposability. Sarah Dunn's book will be given as a Christmas present by unimaginative friends and confined to the downstairs toilet before fetching up at the charity shop. Although more care and intelligence has been lavished on this loafer's guide than is usual for a humorous book, its subject matter ensures a short (bathroom) shelf-life. Americans invented slacking as a handy term for a lifestyle with no life or style, coralling the perennial traits of disaffected youth into a convenient 1990s phenomenon. Intellectual pretension and terminal laziness; a belief in conspiracy theories, unrealised artistic potential and in sponging off parents; bad clothes and bad haircuts. These predate the temporary label of 'slacking' - I remember them all embarrassingly well - and will outlive it. Slacking is a glitch in the sociology of youth culture, and Dunn's book slouches onto a bandwagon that began with Richard Linklater's film Slacker and is already grinding to a halt. To correspond with its subject matter, the Handbook (presumably rendered 'Official' by an endorsement from Linklater) is thematically and graphically all over the place, styled with a deliberate cut-and-paste sloppiness. Dunn is at her best when studying the supposed historical basis for full-fledged slacking, co-opting Socrates, Hamlet, Buddha and Jesus as prototypes in the pantheon of goofing off. Second best is slacker style, with its tips on attaining functionally insane hair ('submit to angry drunken girlfriends armed with prinking shears') and the history of the goatee beard. Thereafter, Dunn's occasional flashes of incisive humour are swamped by too many multiple-choice quizzes and flow charts on slack sex and slacker jobs. The chapters on intellectual posturing are dull, although the conspiracy theories are fun. The promised chapter on how to make hallucinogenic drugs from household chemicals proves to be a fib, by the way. Dunn has a witty command of contemporary phraseology, but her book is unworthy of it. Like 'Generation', and 'The Blank Generation', 'Slacking' will soon be confined to the scrapheap of labels pressed into service to classify the seemingly unclassifiable post-1980s, late-20s, dissolute youth culture. The strain of The Official Slacker Handbook's false premise shows. The most delicious irony, of course, is that no serious slacker wannabe would ever find the time to read it.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Expansion helps Greenacre advance GREENACRE GROUP, the USM-traded nursing home and residential care operator, has completed another year of profitable growth, with pre-tax profits 49 per cent higher for the 12 months ended January 31 1993. The profit was Pounds 1.36m (Pounds 913,000) on FRS 3 basis, after charging Pounds 65,000 for the loss on the sale of the home brewing business. Turnover jumped from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds 4.82m, including contributions from acquisitions down from Pounds 681,000 to Pounds 410,000. Mr Tony Acton, chairman, said beds under operation and/or development rose from 334 to 460 and the number of homes from seven to 10. He said the group's limited reliance on publicly funded residents would leave it relatively unaffected by the initial confusion widely expected to result from the Community Care reforms which were introduced on April 1. Fully diluted earnings per share were 0.57p (0.47p) on increased capital after conversion of preference shares into ordinary. The final dividend is 0.15p for a total of 0.28p (0.25p).</p>

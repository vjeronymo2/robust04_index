It was founded  on the initiative of Hryhoriy Rychahov, chairman of the regional  branch of the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine; Andriy  Krupnyk, city council deputy; Yuriy Zaporozhchenko, regional  council deputy; and Viktor Tymofeyenko, chairman of the local  branch of the New Ukraine association. The latter is notorious  for the statement he made at last year's regional council  session. He said he could prove that "it is Ukraine that is an  empire which for 30 years has been sending its politicians to  lead the Soviet Union, in which time these politicians ruined  Russia".    The reform bloc regional branch's two latter founding  members  also coauthored the Odessa Oblast Council's ultimatum statement  on the immediate signature by Ukraine of the CIS Charter. The  initiative founders have now been nominated as candidates for  people's deputies of Ukraine. The director of OdessaInform  enterprise, Vitaliy Voskoboynykov, was elected coordinator of  the Interregional Bloc for Reforms' branch in Odessa. The aim  of its activity is backing the Kuchma-Hrynyov tandem in the  forthcoming elections.</p>

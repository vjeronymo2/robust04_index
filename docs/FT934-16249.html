			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Book Review: From bare beginning to family fortunes The 20th-century odyssey of a remarkable Jewish family By Ron Chernow Random House, Dollars 30, 820 pages The Warburgs were a wonderfully talented and creative lot. Paul, a partner in the US investment house of Kuhn Loeb, provided an original blueprint for the US Federal Reserve. Aby's work on iconography left a lasting mark on art history and, courtesy of the Nazis, on London, which acquired the Warburg Institute. Siegmund, founder of SG Warburg, did more than any other individual to revive the fortunes of the City of London in the postwar period. Members of the family were also around - and were heavily scarred, financially and psychologically - when many of the great historical upheavals of the 20th century took place. The Hamburg-based bank, MM Warburg, whose Jewish partners were fierce German nationalists, lost most of its capital in the first world war and its name in the second; Max Warburg served on the German reparations delegation at Versailles and was subsequently excoriated in Nazi propaganda for a settlement that he did not support. Jimmy of the New York Warburgs advised, then fell out with, FDR at the time of the New Deal. It was he who invented the phrase 'soak the rich' and on whose Connecticut farm George Gershwin wrote much of Porgy and Bess while conducting a passionate affair with Jimmy's wife. Max and Siegmund played a courageous role in extracting Jews from Germany, with support from the rest of the family in Scandinavia and the US. Felix, who spent years as a senior partner at Kuhn Loeb without pretending to know much about banking, was the pre-eminent American Jewish philanthropist of his day. All in all, a marvellous subject for a multiple biography. Yet this door-stopping volume by Ron Chernow makes an off-putting start to the job. He is not helped, admittedly, by a blurb writer who accuses him of laying bare 'the whole stormy, heart wrenching history of Jews and Germans in the 20th century' - a singularly tasteless way to talk about the Holocaust. But the real problem is that the book is infuriatingly reticent on how the Warburgs came by their wealth and eminence in banking. The bare outlines of the story are that the family started as money changers and pawnbrokers in the Westphalian town of Warburg in the 16th century. From this they graduated into trade finance in the Hanseatic port of Hamburg. In the late 19th century they invaded Wall Street by marrying into the Schiff and Loeb families, thereby securing a far better US bridgehead than the Rothschilds managed to achieve. Over a long period the family established a network of international connections that survived the depredations of two world wars. Yet there is no more than sketchy detail of how Moritz, then Max, turned MM Warburg into one of the most powerful private banks in Germany. We are not told how the bank made the transition from trade finance to the domestic investment banking that left it vulnerable to the aftermath of the 1929 crash. Nor again, of how, apart from force of personality, the partners of Kuhn Loeb made the fortunes they so ostentatiously displayed. In contrast, we are presented with very precise details of how many diamonds and rubies Warburg daughters are given on marriage, a great deal about the furnishings of their houses and exact numbers for the surrounding acreages. Happily, the book is saved in the end by the unbeatable quality of the story. The plight of the German Jews, the most heavily assimilated in Europe, is revealingly portrayed through the fortunes of the Warburgs, whose sense of loyalty to their country made it difficult to leave. The banks' Jewish partners were hounded from company boards and forced to sell MM Warburg to non-Jewish members of the staff for a song, leading to a contentious change of name to Brinckmann, Wirtz. Max, meantime, placed too much trust in the slippery Dr Hjalmar Schacht, head of the Reichsbank, in his attempts to make deals for the lives and property of members of the Jewish community. There were moral and tactical dilemmas everywhere, not least over how to confront Nazi propaganda without providing ammunition to the anti-Semites who attributed Germany's woes to an international conspiracy wrought by Jewish bankers. Although Chernow raises questions about some of the actions of Max towards fellow Jews, it is a tale that commands sympathy and respect. The book also comes to life when it reaches Siegmund Warburg. Here Chernow tackles the business issues in more detail and the great dramas of Siegmund's life - the contested takeover of British Aluminium, the attempt to shake up Kuhn Loeb and the power struggle to put the Warburg name back into Brinckmann, Wirtz - are rendered to good effect. It is a warts-and-all portrait, including details of a covert romance with the ballerina Alexandra Danilova and speculation that Siegmund and Theodora Dreifuss, a Swiss graphologist and psychologist, were lovers. Whatever the truth of these particular matters, Chernow's suggestion that Siegmund sent all letters of congratulation on his knighthood to Dreifuss seems wholly plausible. He was, in today's vernacular, a control freak, and would have delighted in putting Dreifuss's analysis to future use. The paradox of Siegmund is that, for all his inventiveness, he failed time and again to get the big strategic moves right. The initial postwar assault on Brinckmann, Wirtz was bungled through family feuding. By alienating American members of his family, he forfeited the chance to control Kuhn Loeb. Links with AG Becker in the US and Paribas in France went nowhere. But in his inimitable way, he was undeniably a great banker. That much shines through an otherwise unflattering portrait.</p>

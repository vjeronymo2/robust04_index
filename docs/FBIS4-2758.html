			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "China Gears Up To Strengthen Patent Rights"] </F>   [Text] China should promptly fortify its protection of  intellectual property rights to facilitate the construction of a  market-oriented economy.    Addressing a meeting on the 10th anniversary of the  implementation of China's Patent Law, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing  said yesterday that the State Council will soon issue a special  regulation for strengthening the law.    He noted that China's efforts in approving patent  applications have reached international standards since the  country acceeded to the international Patent Co-Operation Treaty  (PCT) earlier this year.    Gao Lulin, director general of China's Patent Office,  explained that being a standing-member country of the PCT could  help China simply [as published] procedures for patent-rights  applications at home and abroad for both Chinese and foreigners.    But Gao pointed out the country's current Patent Law should  be further amended, as some sectors of intellectual property  rights are still without legal protection.    For example, China will no longer rule out protecting  intellectual property rights of new plant varieties, as it does  in the current Patent Law, he added.    China is working to draw up a seed-patent statute to protect  the intellectual property rights of scientists and technicians  engaged in the research and development of new seed varieties.    "We are trying to provide a desirable legal environment for  the country to soak up foreign investment and technology for  setting up cooperative projects," he noted.    The Patent Law was approved by the National People's  Congress  in 1984.    The country accepted ony 14,000 patent applications in 1985,  but last year--after 10 years of implementation of the law--it  handled more than 77,000 applications.    By the end of February, China had handled a total of more  than 370,000 patent applications. Of these, more than 320,000  were from Chinese inventors, while the rest came from 66 foreign  countries and regions.    China has also stepped up its efforts to punish those who  violate the law.    By the end of last year, the country's courts had accepted  and heard more than 1,900 cases involving the infringement of  patent rights, according to official figures. More than 1,600  of these cases have been resolved, according to Ren Jianxin,  president of China's Supreme People's Court.</p>

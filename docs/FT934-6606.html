			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / People: High Gosforth restructuring on course The High Gosforth Park Company, the plc which owns Newcastle Racecourse, has restructured its board to lay more emphasis on racing expertise. Captain the Hon Nicholas Beaumont, clerk of the course and secretary at Ascot Racecourse, has been appointed chairman designate of High Gosforth Park; he will succeed Roy Baker, former chairman of National Tyre Services, in early 1995. In the meantime Beaumont has become a non-executive director. The Captain's nephew, the Hon Wentworth Beaumont, a member of the Jockey Club and a steward at Newcastle, who also serves on panels at Carlisle, Ripon, York, New-market and Ascot, has joined the High Gosforth Park board. Other new board members are David Stephenson, formerly managing director of Newcastle Breweries, and James Marris, recently retired regional chairman of British Gas Northern; Sir Alick Rankin, chairman of Scottish and Newcastle and Ken Bell, chairman of Bellway, have retired. The company, whose course offers the only Grade One racing between York and Ayr, is fighting a protracted planning battle to ensure its future by selling some of its Green Belt land for housing and commercial development. The board restructuring is intended to help carry through the upgrading. 'We must be teed up and ready for the off,' says managing director and clerk of the course David Parmley.</p>

Introduction </H5>   Tokyo Electric Power is aggressively pursuing R&amp;D of new  energy. Especially promising in this respect is a fuel cell, for  which expectations run high when it is implemented as a power  generation system closely linked to sites where demands  originate. At present, the company is conducting basic research  in the fused carbonate and solid electrolyte fuel cell types,  while, at the same time, engaging itself in the validation test  of the Itsui 11 MW plant using a large capacity installation for  regional supply as well as development of element technology  involving a phosphate fuel battery. With respect to  small-capacity equipment, in order to gain knowledge concerning  development of a large-capacity equipment, the company is  continuing a validation test aimed at grasping the practical  capabilities of plants developed by manufacturers.    Following report 2 which appeared in the previous issue,  this  paper will deal with the 200kW fuel battery installed at  Shibaura 4-chome District Thermal Supply Center (Shibaura FHC)  focusing on operational condition and performance verifications  based on long-term operations.  <H5>  2. Summary of Plant </H5>   The fuel battery installed within the Shibaura DHC is a  pre-PC-25 battery (the initial lot (53 machines produced) of  PC-25 currently being shipped by IFC, an American firm)  designated as PCX, a package-type water-cooling  atmospheric-pressure battery with rated output, 210 V; and  output voltage, 210V, 3&phgr;, 50H. It is possible to obtain heat  of approximately 210 Mcal/H when hot water with temperatures in  the range 70-80&deg;C constitutes rated capacity.    This PCX was installed Kandenko Co. main office building's  underground floor in March 1988; after its indoor operations had  been verified, it was moved to Shibaura DHC First Plant in May  1990. The Shibaura DHC is designated as the [19.6ha] district by  Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and its first plant with its all  electric heat supply facility with a receiving capacity of  1,500kW, installed in the underground floor of Shibaura Square  Building, consists of a high-efficiency heat pump and a  large-scale heat storage tank. Almost all electric output of PCX  is consumed as DHC's electric power; moreover, since nearly all  exhaust heat can be supplied to heat a storage tank, we are  verifying not only reliability and durability of the plant but  also conducting a verification test aimed at gaining some idea  of the facility's performance as a cogeneration system.  <H5>  3.

The  cumulative generating time set to operating hours of the Kanko  Denko Head Office Building as of now, 31 January 1993, is in  excess of 17,000 hours. Although the main unit of the battery  had been exchanged twice, as a plant, these hours represent the  longest operating time in the world. Moreover, immediately after  the facility had been moved to the Shibaura DHC, the world  record of 3,246 hours were set. Judging from the operating  conditions of PCX thus far observed, first of all, at Kandenko  Main Office Building, because of the plant's adjustment tests  and the initial problems associated with PCX, it was necessary  to halt the operations frequently, which contributed to lowering  of time availability factor. After it had been moved to Shibaura  DHC, however, we enjoyed relatively stabilized operations,  raising the time availability factor to 71.1&percnt;. However,  because  of a drop in voltage, it became necessary to limit output. For  this reason, the usage ratio based on calendar day was low.  After the old battery was replaced by a new one, because of the  adjustment tests which made it necessary to stop operations, and  combined with invertor problems, the availability factor is  somewhat low; however, an average operating load of 137.6kW  represents a considerable improvement.

Table 2 shows PCX thermal supply performance of PCX at  Shibaura DHC. During the period since August 1989, when  operations began, until December 1992, a total of 1,183 Gcal of  heat was supplied to the DHC thermal storage tank. This  constituted 3.9&percnt; of the total heat output at DHC during  this  period. Especially with respect to the hot water supply, by  supplying 50&percnt; of the fuel battery's exhaust heat, PCX was  able  to meet 69.2&percnt; of DHC's energy needs. It also is  contributing to  the production of hot water to some degree. As for cold water,  although an adsorption type refrigerator was installed  experimentally, with the temperature of hot water at 75&deg;C,  enabling PCX to use its heat, COP remained low at 0.3&deg;C even  when it was at its highest; consequently we were not able to use  it in actual operations. A daily average of the amount of hot  water supplied was 1,366Mcal. This represents 26.6&percnt; of  planned  heat output of 5,135Mcal at the rated operation time  (214kcal/H). Although this figure is somewhat lower than the  calendar day usage ratio of 32&percnt;, we were able to use  85.2&percnt; of  heat generated by the PCX plant at DHC.  <H5>  4. Battery Main Unit </H5>   In June 1991, because of a drop in battery voltage, the main  unit of the original PCX battery became incapacitated when its  cumulative power generating time reached 10,250 hours. It was  then replaced by a reserve battery, PCX No.1 equipment  (validation test completed at the company's New Tokyo Thermal  Power Station) which already had put in 5,000 hours. Like the  original battery, under the similar circumstances, this one also  stopped working in May 1992, when a cumulative total of  operation hours reached 9,723. It became evident from this that  the durability of PCS battery's main unit, namely, its effective  life, is approximately 10,000 hours. However, since reformer and  other equipment still are functioning well, we had decided to  replace only the battery's main unit and to continue our test  until 1996.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-48A>             Fig. 1. Properties of Battery I-V </FIG>       We assembled Toshiba 200kW battery's main unit (prototype  No.  1), which has the same specifications as ONSI Company product  PC-25, a modified version of PCX, into the PCX plant. In August  1992, jointly with Toshiba, we began testing its effective life  value. With respect to the PC-25, based on its experience with  the original PCX battery, the company improved part of the  material and changed battery's current density from  300mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  to 235mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; . In addition to  the change made in its form and setting of piping, modifications  in control systems and cooling conditions through raising of  rated voltage became necessary. In replacing the PCX battery  with the PC-25, we studied the extent to which these can be  matched.    The properties of Toshiba 200kW battery's initial I-V are  shown in Fig. 1. In comparison with the PCX battery, the battery  voltage, including the part in which battery's current density  is decreased, has been raised substantially.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-48B>             Fig. 2. Energy Balance at 200kW </FIG>       Fig. 2 shows the energy balance (obtained when accumulated  hours reached 2,500) of the plant equipped with the new 200kW  battery. Power generating efficiency is as high as 36.6&percnt;.  When  this figure is compared with the 30.2&percnt; efficiency of the  PCX  battery (the value obtained when accumulated operating hours  reached 5,600 as had been reported previously), it became clear  that the increase in battery voltage has resulted in the  substantial increase in efficiency. However, gain in  power-generation efficiency was counterbalanced by a decrease in  exhaust heat recovery efficiency. As a result, we obtained an  overall efficiency of 79&percnt;, approximately the same as that  of  the PCX battery.    Fig. 3 traces changes which occurred in battery voltage as  of  February 1993 during the course of power generation for over  2,000 hours. The test data covers the use of the plant for only  a short period of time, and in comparison with that of the PCX  battery, a drop in voltage of the new battery is small, and  effects of start-stop are not clearly shown.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-49A>             Fig. 3. Shift in Battery Voltage Through Time (Equivalent </FIG>       With the exception of the test period devoted to data  collection, thus far, because of the invertor problems, the  plant operating load was restricted, not exceeding 150kW.  <H5>  5. Long-Term Usage Conditions of Reactor </H5>   In order to improve the reliability of the fuel battery,  important problems which must be dealt with, in addition to that  of the battery's main unit, have to do with achieving longer  effective life of a reformer and other chemical reactor  catalysts. Since the beginning of operations, we hardly have had  any problem with the reformer and low-temperature fuel  processing units (desulfurizer and CO transformer) of this PCX,  still going strong after over 17,000 hours of continuous  operations. These will serve as a valuable validation data.    With this test research, in order to validate plant's  performance, including twice-a-year load tests, we conducted  from time to time the analysis of gas constituents found at the  outlets of the reformer, CO transformer, battery anode and  cathode. Fig. 4 shows relationships between the conversion rate  of the reformer's methane [= (CO+CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; ) /  (CO+CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; +CH&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt; )], thus far obtained from  analytical results, and reforming pipe temperature. Also shown  in Fig. 4 is the city gas flow rate. During this period, because  of the problems involving PCX battery's main unit and a change  made in the temperature setting of the reforming pipe,  output-reforming temperature relationships are found to vary.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-50A>             Fig. 4. Reforming Pipe Temperature and Methane Conversion </FIG>       When we examine the same output (city gas flow rate) shown  in this figure, we can see that the methane conversion rate  increases as the reforming temperature climbs. The dotted lines  of the graph represent the conversion rate of methane reforming  reactions in a chemical equilibrium state when the difference  between the reforming pipe temperature and internal reaction  temperature is hypothetically set at 50&deg;C under the same  reaction condition (1 atm. S/C=3.5). When a load is low, we can  see that the tendency is to approach fairly close to equilibrium  state.    Moreover, as flow rate increases, a methane conversion rate  tends to go down; for this reason, it appears that the setting  of reforming pipe temperature is raised so that the conversion  rate can be maintained at a certain level.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-51A>             Fig. 5. Change in Performance of Reformer and CO </FIG>       Fig. 5 below shows changes occurring in methane and CO  transformer's conversion rates through time. The methane  conversion rate is designed to compensate temperature so that,  as shown in Fig. 4, the CPX's original reforming pipe  temperature can be set up (for output). As you will see from the  graph that under 100kW output hardly any changes occur in  methane conversion rate since the beginning of the operations.  Recently, however, output is exceeding 150kW, causing  substantial reduction in the methane conversion rate. At  present, even if the methane conversion rate should become  lower, since the hydrogen usage ratio of the battery's main unit  is not increasing out of proportion, we do not have any process  problems. It will be necessary, however, to monitor the  situation in the future.    Effects of the CO conversion rate [=Co&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  /  (CO+CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; )] on the flow rate and temperature, on the  other hand, are relatively small. Consequently, the plant is  able to maintain good operating conditions since the beginning,  to date, showing hardly any performance degradation. With  respect to the desulfurizer, moreover, since sulfur content of  the city gas is low, about 5 ppm (odorant), it is not possible  to obtain data containing dusulfurization ratio. However, for  the present, we see no strong indication of toxic effects  involving the reformer. In the future, as long as power  generation goes smoothly, we intend to continue with the  validation of the durability of these reaction catalysts.  <H5>  6. Plant Reliability </H5>   Since this PCX plant is a testing machine, we had had many  problems in the beginning. After it was moved to Shibaura DHC,  however, with the exception of gradual degradation of the  battery's main unit itself, we were able to enjoy relatively  stable operations. However, at present, it has yet to reach the  level of practicality required of a commercial machine.    The number of troubles which occurred in the course of CPX  operations are categorized and summarized in Table 3. From July  1991 to June/July 1992, a cut-off period at Shibaura DHC, the  replacement of the old battery with the new and an overall  maintenance of the facility were carried out. Because of the  operating experience and the state of PCX No. 1, the maintenance  work, including a preventive measure, carried out for 1992  consisted of the following: replacing a water condenser and a  cooling water circulation pump reserve; changing an  air-flow-control valve and the type of non-stoppage electric  source unit; use of domestic electric parts products; and a  complete exchange of cooling water piping packing.

Moreover,  degradation of the PCX battery's main unit and corrosion of the  heat exchanger, considered typical phosphate fuel battery  problems, also have occurred. When viewed in terms of the period  involved, because of the effects of the enforced measure, the  number of failures per 1,000 hours gradually has been  decreasing, especially a clear trend for improvement, insofar as  the same types of troubles are concerned, is emerging. However,  because of the long-term operations, new troubles also are being  generated. Our plan is to examine causes of these troubles and  implement a measure for improvement so that the same problems  will not occur in the next generation of the equipment  developed. After August 1992, as facility maintenance began to  take effect, water leaks and rudimentary electrical problems  began to decrease. However, the fact that the plant controller's  PI/O base broke down twice indicates the need for improvement in  instrumentation and control systems.    As a problem involving unmanned equipment occurring since  August 1992, we must mention a failure of the invertor which hit  us immediately after the old battery was replaced by the new.  Because a fuse was cut and a transistor sustained a damage, it  became necessary to shut down the plant. The same thing happened  again when the invertor pole was replaced. Since we experienced  hardly any problems when operating with the 150kW battery, we  came to the conclusion that this might have been caused by  assembling the main battery unit with high voltage into the  invertor without providing any design margin. By making various  measurements around the invertor, we were able to identify  electric parts which possibly could be exceeding utilization  requirements. In February 1993, the invertor's condenser, fuse,  and other electric parts were replaced, and their installation  verified the stable operations of the PCX plant at the rated  output.  <H5>  7. Future Test Schedule </H5>   Our plans are to undergo pre-utilization inspection  necessitated by the change made in the battery, subsequent to  which, to continue the verification of durability of the new  fuel battery and of effective catalytic life of the reformer and  mono-oxidation transformer until 1996. At the same time, we plan  to examine an actual operating setup by carrying out operations  and by simplifying maintenance. In addition, our plans include  introduction of the Tomitsu Energy Park's 50kW battery and three  other small equipment, and we hope to fully utilize our  experience gained through the operation of the PCX plant in  developing these battery equipment.</p>

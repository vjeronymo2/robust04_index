			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORENO ESTATE  </P> <P> Ruth Ryon was misinformed regarding the estate she attributed to Antonio Moreno  in Hot Property (April 23).  </P> <P> This was originally the Canfield Estate. Moreno married Daisy (I think that was  her name) Canfield. Since he was a popular movie star at the time, his name was  associated with the estate.  </P> <P> In 1952, we purchased a small home across from the main gate. The estate at  that time was a very nice school for young ladies.  </P> <P> Twelve years later we purchased the larger home on the corner of Micheltorena  and Landa, across from the side wall of the estate. The female occupants at  that time (except for the nuns) were wards of the court and were certainly not  young ladies.  </P> <P> HELENE BAUS  </P> <P> Palm Springs  </P></p>

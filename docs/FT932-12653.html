			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Argentina looks for up to Dollars 11bn - The country is exploiting its higher standing ARGENTINA is returning to international financial markets in force. The country - or its private sector, since companies are doing most of the fund-raising - is expected to raise between Dollars 8bn and Dollars 11bn in foreign capital to cover this year's current account deficit. Last year, it raised about Dollars 8bn. Argentine companies last year sold bonds worth Dollars 1.91bn on local and international markets, nearly twice as much as in 1991. In the first quarter of this year alone, companies raised a further Dollars 1.43bn through bond sales. Officials at the Comision Nacional de Valores (CNV), the capital markets watchdog, believe a further Dollars 3bn of corporate debt could be placed this year locally and overseas. Argentine companies are turning to foreign debt markets because international interest rates are lower and maturities longer than locally. Deregulation in Argentina also allows companies to sell paper in local and international markets simultaneously. Foreigners have bought about Dollars 1.8bn in shares listed on the Buenos Aires stock exchange since 1991. Last year, three companies raised another Dollars 1.52bn through international equity placements, including American Depositary Receipts. CNV officials say companies could raise another Dollars 1bn through local and international equity programmes this year. Privatisation issues will remain a leading attraction for overseas capital. The government hopes an initial public offering this summer of half of YPF, the national oil company, will raise at least Dollars 2bn. The government could raise another Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 4bn through the sale of minority stakes in companies already privatised. Last year, privatisations attracted Dollars 4.12bn from abroad. Argentina's standing in financial markets has improved steadily. On April 7, the government and creditor banks reached agreement on reducing its Dollars 29bn bank debt. Actual interest payments rose because the government was previously servicing only part of its debt, but the agreement enhanced Argentina's status and was expected to help to further reduce risk premiums on new Argentine borrowings. But some investors are impatient over often insufficient and sometimes misleading information companies provide. Analysts warn companies could find raising money more difficult unless business dealings become more transparent. Analysts say loose accounting regulations allow companies to hide profits from minority shareholders and tax authorities. Complex shareholding structures can conceal a company's real owners. Inadequate balance sheets make it hard to monitor management. Estimating real liabilities and assets is equally difficult. The CNV is trying to improve management accountability. It recently ordered Perez Companc, Argentina's third-largest listed company, to restate its 1992 accounts because the CNV suspected it of concealing profits. The CNV also ticked off Molinos Rio de la Plata, part of the Bunge y Born food giant, for not explaining adequately an item in its accounts called 'payments to third parties' that consumed nearly Dollars 26m in the second half of 1992 - about 6 per cent of turnover. Some companies may already be finding it harder to raise money overseas. Bunge y Born recently had to pull a unit's international share offering after poor investor reaction. Investors hope Argentina will follow Chile and Mexico, which are cutting down on abuses. Mr Martin Redrado, CNV president, says this is happening. He says: 'There is less (manipulation) now than a year ago, and in a year's time there will be even less.' The government hoped proposals for a private pension fund system would add depth to local capital markets. But the proposals are being diluted in Congress, meaning Argentina's reliance on foreign capital will continue.</p>

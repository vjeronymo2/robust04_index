			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Arts: Today's Television Politics is big on the airwaves tonight. The BBC has a comprehensive coverage of today's UK local government elections at 11.30pm, and Channel 4 (9pm) looks at Russia's first free parliamentary election last year in Moscow Central, part of the Bite the Ballot series. Producer Clive Gordon won a 1993 BAFTA for his investigation of Bosnia, but this time he goes for the bizarre. He focuses on three candidates competing to represent Moscow: one has to prove his sanity to be declared a candidate; another is reckoned to be a local mobster; and a third, an exiled millionaire, can only return to Russia because he is standing for parliament. With crime such a hot issue, the vigilante is becoming a popular hero. In Taking Liberties (BBC 2, 8pm), Polly Toynbee asks whether juries are too lenient in cases in which citizens take matters into their own hands so enthusiastically that innocent people die as a consequence. At last, the cricket team in Outside Edge (ITV, 8.30pm) gets to play a match. Richard Harris' play has been running out of steam of late but this should be a happy climax.</p>

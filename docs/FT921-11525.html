			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Letter: SIB argues that survey results not flawed Sir, Mr Scurfield (Letters, January 29) casts doubt on the results of a survey commissioned by the Securities and Investments Board into termination rates for life assurance policies. We commissioned the survey because of the absence of published information. When we made the results available last December, we also published details of the methodology used. That methodology involved calculation of termination rates using information about premiums, rather than policy numbers, supplied by life offices in their statutory returns to the Department of Trade and Industry. As the researchers made clear in their report, (and as SIB has in its comments), there are some limitations in the figures, stemming, for example, from the inclusion of temporary short-term assurances, the treatment of paid-up pensions contracts and other factors. Moreover, the termination rates quoted in the report are a 'snapshot' for 1990 which, because of the recession, might be worse than for other years. It is also recognised that the aggregate termination rates hide significant differences between individual life offices. But notwithstanding these limitations, the main message - that termination rates are uncomfortably high - is clear. SIB therefore rejects Mr Scurfield's assertion that the survey is 'flawed' and that no further conclusions should be drawn from it. If there is now to be a debate about how the industry might develop a common methodology for the calculation of termination rates, SIB would very much welcome this. We would also welcome greater willingness on the part of the life offices to make publicly available information on the persistence of life assurance policies.

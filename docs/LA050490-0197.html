			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGICIANS WILL NEED ALL THEIR MAGIC;  </P> <P> TRICK FOR MANDELA, DE KLERK TO ACCOMMODATE MAIN MINORITY AS WELL AS NEW  MAJORITY  </P> <P> If the extraordinary closed-door talks between the government of South Africa  and the nation's black leaders that began Wednesday are to triumph in epochal  reconciliation, both sides will need to demonstrate unaccustomed civility and  elasticity.  </P> <P> How can the 71-year-old Nelson Mandela -- after 27 years in jail -- convert an  African National Congress that employed terrorism to advance its just  anti-apartheid crusade into a supple and skilled negotiating instrument? How  can Frederik W. de Klerk -- the South African president who fears the  unleashing of raw emotions and deep forces if the talks fail -- keep the  political right at bay while he steers his unbeloved, heretofore racist  government toward true power-sharing?  </P> <P> Based on South Africa's track record, no one should want to bet the house that  any good will come of all this. The odds favor failure.  </P> <P> But bet the long-shot anyway, for both De Klerk and Mandela already have gone  too great a distance to want to retreat in failure; and both are now showing  strong and steady leadership at the very time that it is most needed. On  Wednesday De Klerk termed the process "irreversible." Mandela, sometimes  speaking in the white Afrikaans language, pointedly praised the president's  language.  </P> <P> Precisely that sense of having come to a new chapter in history will be  required to overcome minority whites' fears of retaliatory repression at the  hands of the black majority in any wholly one-person, one-vote system. It will  be needed also to allay black fears that negotiations will produce a rigged  system where black votes count for less than white ones.  </P> <P> A relationship of trust -- and political imagination -- between Mandela and De  Klerk will be crucial to success. So will agreement by both sides to negotiate  a structure that offers the hope of producing a truly stable multiracial  society. Such a prospect will be advanced if the negotiations look to forge a  sophisticated system -- perhaps even bicameral -- rather than a crude one. That  might well mean a powerful lower house (one-person/one-vote) and a less  powerful, but nonetheless important, upper house. That kind of approach could  give all fearful minorities, including whites, enough political clout to feel  confident about their future in a country suddenly -- though quite properly --  ruled by the majority.  </P> <P> Radicals on both sides -- to the ANC's left and to De Klerk's right -- bitterly  oppose such a compromise. That fact alone commands this formula to serious  consideration.  </P></p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Stagnant rivers and poisoned seas - Victor Mallet examines Thailand's pollution problems / Worldwide water PORNCHAI Taranatham remembers the boyhood pleasures of catching fish in Bangkok from the Chao Phraya river. 'Thirty years ago it was easy,' he says. 'When I was in high school we could walk along the river and get shrimp and big fish. Not any more.' As deputy director-general of Thailand's pollution control department, he is painfully aware that many years will pass before the Chao Phraya can be restored to its former state. Nowadays the water in Bangkok's famous klongs (canals) is black and foul-smelling. The Chao Phraya, which drains most of the country's central plain, is heavily polluted with sewage and industrial waste. 'The oxygen in the Chao Phraya is going down and down,' says Pornchai. Dissolved oxygen levels near the port at Klong Toey are consistently close to zero and species of fish found a decade ago have disappeared from the lower reaches of the river. The river spews its filth into the Gulf of Thailand. At the estuary, a mangrove swamp - preserved only because it is in the grounds of a Buddhist temple - is festooned with rubbish thrown in the river by the citizens of Bangkok. Further south, the sewage dumped into the sea by the tourist resort of Pattaya has earned the city international notoriety as one of the most disgusting bathing spots in the world. On the other side of the Gulf, mafiosi-style businessmen have shamelessly destroyed acres of wetlands in the 'Three Hundred Peaks' national park to establish prawn farms. Thailand in the 1990s is a vivid Asian example of how rapid industrialisation, uncontrolled urbanisation and unchecked tourism growth can hurt the environment to such an extent that the foundations of economic growth - including some of the businesses responsible for the damage in the first place - are threatened. The tourism industry is stagnant, partly because potential visitors are deterred by traffic jams and air pollution in Bangkok and dirty sea water in resorts such as Pattaya. Thai fishermen unable to catch enough fish in the Gulf of Thailand - due to overfishing and the destruction of breeding grounds - encroach on the waters of nearby Vietnam or have converted their boats into mini-tankers for smuggling diesel from Singapore. Factories too have been affected. Last year, Phoenix Pulp and Paper was forced by the government to close its plant in north-east Thailand for six weeks after it polluted a river. A nearby sugar mill was also temporarily shut down after water used to put out a fire there washed molasses into the river and killed thousands of fish. The importance of husbanding fresh water resources is being brought home to the people of Bangkok this year by official warnings that low water levels at two important dams may make it impossible to meet all demands for water from farmers, industrialists and householders in central Thailand in the dry weeks before May's monsoon rains. A controversy over whether to blame the water shortage on climatic cycles or on environmental degradation - such as the deforestation of watersheds - has yet to be resolved. As Thailand gets richer and its urban, middle-class citizens more vocal in their demands for a higher quality of life, governments in Bangkok have slowly started tightening environmental legislation and allocating money to water projects. Only about 2 per cent of Bangkok households are connected to a sewage treatment system and much of the waste from the city's 7m inhabitants goes straight into the Chao Phraya. The government and the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority have, therefore, embarked on a Dollars 800m (Pounds 555.5m) project to build sewage treatment plants, which should eventually process three-quarters of domestic waste. Such projects are not confined to Bangkok. Municipal workers in the resort of Patong on the island of Phuket are building a main sewer to link more houses and hotels to the town's expanding waste water treatment plant. Foreign companies with international images to protect and worldwide company standards to enforce are taking the lead in adopting environmentally friendly practices in resorts such as Phuket. The Holiday Inn on Patong Beach has a waste water treatment plant, uses recycled water for irrigating the garden and has water-saving aerators fitted to all taps and showers. Tourism's importance to Thailand, and the damage inflicted on the industry by environmental destruction, was underlined by the recent decision to declare Pattaya and Phuket pollution control and environmental protection zones. Unfortunately, the problem in Thailand is not a shortage of regulations but a lack of enforcement. To outsiders, it is surprising how many Thai officials say the fear of assassination by business gangsters is an obstacle to the implementation of green legislation. Pornchai says the pollution control department cannot fill staff vacancies because anyone qualified could earn three times as much in the private sector.</p>

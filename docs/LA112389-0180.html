			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'ADAM' FOUND ABANDONED;  </P> <P> CHILD ABANDONMENT: DISCOVERY OF NEWBORN NEAR DUMPSTER IN DRUG-SELLING AREA OF  SANTA ANA IN SECOND SUCH CASE IN THE COUNTY THIS MONTH.  </P> <P> The premature baby looked warm and secure enough Wednesday, swaddled in a  blanket with a blue knit cap covering his brown hair, as he lay in the Infant  Special Care Unit at UCI Medical Center.  </P> <P> But just hours earlier, the newborn was discovered barely breathing, naked,  blue with cold, and lying face down on the asphalt behind a dumpster in one of  Santa Ana's worst drug-infested neighborhoods. He was the second baby found  abandoned in Orange County this month.  </P> <P> Nicknamed "Adam," the baby -- weighing only 4 pounds, 4 1/2 ounces -- has  captured the hearts of doctors and nurses at the medical center, where the  infant was rushed after a police officer rescued him about 11 p.m. Tuesday.  Doctors believe he was only 4 1/2 hours old and was born about five weeks  prematurely.  </P> <P> "Every single person who has seen him wants to take him home," said nurse  Patricia Hanson, who gave the infant his nickname. "He'll be all right here.  We'll take care of him right."  </P> <P> Police Officer Michael Buelna, who was investigating an unrelated stabbing in  the 1200 block of West Brook Street, found the infant between a concrete wall  and a metal dumpster after neighbors waved him down. The neighbors told him  that they had heard a baby crying and moaning for several minutes, police said.  </P> <P> When Buelna found him, the baby was blue from the cold and did not seemed to be  breathing, said police investigator Alan Caddell. Buelna performed  cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the infant. After the baby began to cry --  indicating that his lungs were working -- the officer ran back to his patrol  car with the infant and wrapped him in a blanket provided by the neighbors.  Paramedics then rushed the infant to the hospital.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt that Mike had a big impact on whether the baby was going to  live or die. He saved the baby," Caddell said.  </P> <P> Police believe the baby was born elsewhere and then left at the dumpster off  Brook Street, Caddell said.  </P> <P> Brook Street is a notorious drug-selling area in Santa Ana. Police blocked off  the street to traffic two years ago because of the high number of car chases  for drug arrests.  </P> <P> Ruby Olivares, one of several neighbors who found the baby, said residents in  the area were stunned.  </P> <P> "We were all saying, 'My God, who can do this?' " Olivares said. "He was so  tiny and helpless. I wanted to pick him up and hold him tight."  </P> <P> Investigators are now searching for the mother of the infant, who could face  charges of child abandonment. But Caddell said the police are more interested  in reuniting the baby with his mother. Neighbors told police they saw a woman  near the dumpster minutes before the baby was found. Police described the woman  as being in her early 30s, with brown hair and an average build.  </P> <P> When the baby was brought to the emergency room, he was covered with bits of  paper and food, said Denise Bamrick, a UCI clinical social worker.  </P> <P> "He was so cold and it was so traumatic for him," Bamrick said.  </P> <P> By Wednesday morning, "Adam Doe" was in good condition -- pink-skinned and  dressed in a UCI T-shirt, diapers, white socks and a blue knit cap that he  tugged at every once in a while.  </P> <P> The infant looked even tinier than the other babies staying at the special care  unit. Nurses say his biggest challenge now is to gain weight, maintain his  temperature and learn how to suckle.  </P> <P> For now, Patricia Hanson is the infant's personal nurse and she stands by him  like a doting mother. She named him "Adam" after her first glimpse of him.  </P> <P> "You look at the babies and some name pops into your mind like that. He's an  Adam all right," said Hanson, who has four grown children.  </P> <P> She admits she felt anger when she had learned that Adam had been abandoned.  </P> <P> "I couldn't help feeling a little angry at the mother for doing that to him.  But I don't know the circumstances or why he was left behind. For now, I'm just  thankful he's alive," Hanson said.  </P> <P> "Adam" will stay at the medical center until the Orange County Social Services  Agency takes custody of him.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, another baby had been found abandoned, wrapped in a brown  paper bag, on West Ball Road in Anaheim. After he was taken to Humana  Hospital-West Anaheim, well-wishers showered the infant, nicknamed "Timmy,"  with toys and other gifts. Timmy is now living in an emergency foster home and  is in good condition, a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P></p>

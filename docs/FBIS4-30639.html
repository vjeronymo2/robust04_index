			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Chea Sim, acting head of state and chairman of </F> National Assembly and of the Cambodian People's Party Central  committee, at a ceremony to mark the party's 43d founding  anniversary held on 28 June at the party's office in Phnom Penh  -- recorded]    [Text] My respects to the Supreme Patriarchs and all  venerable monks; my respects to all beloved samdechs, princes,  excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen; my respects to their  excellencies representing the embassies and international  organizations; my respects to all beloved and distinguished  guests:    This is an auspicious day for us to get together to mark the  43d founding anniversary of the Cambodian People's Party [CPP],  at a time when our beloved land of Angkor is entering a new  historic period. This is a period where the CPP and the various  political forces pledge jointly and resolutely to defend their  independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and rebuild  Cambodia toward a glorious future. At the same time, the  Cambodian people nationwide and the international community have  paid and are paying keen attention to the efforts of the  government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, as it braves all big and  small obstacles in all areas, political, military, public order,  economic, and social affairs, to rebuild Cambodia.    On this excellent occasion, on behalf of the CPP, I would  like to extend best wishes to His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk  Varaman. May His Majesty recover from illness quickly so as to  speedily return to the motherland and may he enjoy a long life  of over 100 years so as to continue being the cool shade for his  children, grand children, and great-grandchildren. May Her  Majesty Queen Norodom Monineat Sihanouk enjoy the five blessings  of Lord Buddha on her 58th birthday.    Also from this podium, I would like to most sincerely thank  all venerable monks, CPP members, and beloved compatriots for  all their sacrifices for the cause of the nation and people. At  the same time, I bow my head in homage to the souls of millions  of our people who lost their lives in a most pitiful manner  under the genocidal regime and to the souls of those killed in  preventing the return of this regime. May all those souls rest  in peace. I also beg those souls to help the Cambodian people  in their efforts for peace and survival.    Beloved samdechs, princes, excellencies, ladies, and  gentlemen, in the past 43 years, the CPP has valiantly gone  through historic stages of struggle and a thousand and one  difficulties and achieved many big victories in Cambodian  history.    Looking back on CPP's record, all of us will never forget  that from the day it was born to the present, the CPP has always  adhered firmly to its ideals of standing with the people,  sharing their weal and woe, and maintaining close links with  them in all circumstances in order to serve the supreme interest  of the people and nation, and defend national independence,  territorial integrity, and culture.    For example, for three years, eight months, and 20 days the  country was plunged in the peril caused by the Pol Pot genocidal  regime -- the most cruel and barbarous in the history of  Cambodia and mankind. During this time, the CPP was the only  party that dared to rise up and struggle and make lofty  sacrifices against this wicked regime by leading the great  united movement of the entire national forces in the rank of the  Kampuchean National United Front for National Salvation, and to  topple it on 7 January 1979m, ushering in a new era of  independence, freedom, and democracy.    In the past 14 years, 1979-93, the CPP has continued to lead  the movement to defend and build the country bare-handedly.  While preventing the return of the genocidal regime, our party  has proceeded with the restoration of the country from the heaps  of ashes left by the genocidal regime, and thus enabling our  country to revive gradually. The history of our Cambodian  nation has recorded the big achievements of our CPP of the past  over a decade, that is:    1. It has rescued our motherland and people from the  genocidal peril and prevented the return of this wicked regime.    2. It has enabled our national society to revive and develop  in all fields with national independence and sovereignty.    3. It has brought back and enhanced the people's democratic  rights and freedoms and the nation's honor, pride, and prestige  lost during the Pol Pot regime.    4. It is the decisive factor bringing about national  reunification and peace to the motherland and people.    For example, since 1987, while inciting the movement for  national defense and construction, the CPP has actively  implemented, through several negotiating forums, its national  reunification policy with the sincere assistance of the  international community and the contribution of various  Cambodian parties, particularly its successive concessions,  until the Paris Agreements were signed on 23 October 1991.    In implementing the Paris accords, our CPP braved many tense  and complex situations and closely cooperated with the United  Nations and the various political parties to enable the process  to succeed. After the elections, the CPP continued to implement  everything strictly by putting aside some of the problems that  arose out of the elections. This was in cooperation with the  political parties which won seats in the National Assembly,  until a democratic constitution was drafted as the foundation  for national reunification, democracy, and national development  in the future.    Now, our country has a coalition government formed between  our CPP and the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an  Independent, Neutral Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party  and the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party [BLDP]. This is the  legal and internationally recognized Royal Government that  responds to the sacred interest of the nation and people.    All in all, in its historic mission, the CPP has learned  from  its valuable experiences. The CPP has a correct leadership line  which is neither left or right, but which is mainly in keeping  with the realities of the country, the people's aspiration, and  the world trend of each period.    The CPP always has close links with the people and shares  their weal and woe for the supreme interest of the nation and  people. The CPP forever upholds the front's banner to rally the  national union and all patriotic forces, regardless of their  past, to jointly build the country. The CPP firmly adheres to  the genuine patriotism, maintains close links with the broad  international solidarity, and wishes to have good ties with all  countries for the cause of peace, stability, and cooperation on  the basis of peaceful coexistence. The CPP always remembers and  inscribes in history the support and assistance given by the  fraternal parties and peoples and friends near and far to the  Cambodian people in their just and correct struggle.    Beloved samdech, princes, excellencies, ladies, and  gentlemen, the present mission of the CPP is to join various  political forces in Cambodia to bring about national  reconciliation, to consolidate political stability, and build a  liberal democracy in line with the Constitution of the Kingdom  of Cambodia [KoC], which will serve as a firm foundation for  national reconstruction and development. In this connection,  the CPP continues to maintain and expand its alliance with the  FUNCINPEC headed by Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, that  serves as the core of national unity and social stability to  mobilize the combined forces of the entire nation against all  complex problems, to move toward successfully implementing the  Royal Government's political program.    But the threat of the genocidal regime's return still  exists.  The Khmer Rouge, which has refused to implement the Paris  Agreement and rejected the present legal Royal Government is  continuing with its destructive activities against the innocent,  harming them and their property and wrecking national property.    Recently, the Royal Government had displayed its goodwill by  taking part in the roundtable negotiations with the Khmer Rouge  held under the king's advice and the lofty chairmanship of His  Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of the Kingdom of  Cambodia, to urgently seek an unconditional and permanent  cease-fire in the land of the Kingdom of Cambodia. But the two  roundtable negotiations have failed due to the preconditions set  by the Khmer Rouge.    At the same time, there has been news and the exploitation  of  this news by a group of individuals. This has been done with  the aim of (?misleading) public opinion, upsetting political  stability, sabotaging the achievements and success made so far  in seeking a solution to the Cambodian problem, and particularly  destroying the KoC Constitution, -- the excellent achievement  made through the efforts of the entire nation and international  community.    All this news might cause some misunderstanding concerning  the CPP and its leaders. The CPP has emphasized its stand to  the national and international opinion through its 23 June 1994  statement. It says the CPP regards the KoC Constitution as the  excellent achievement of the entire Cambodian nation and the  international community, which has given immense and sincere  assistance to our nation. Truly, this excellent achievement  could be realized because of the excellent leadership of the  esteemed His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, under whose  leadership our nation has already achieved success [words  indistinct]. This is reflected, for example, by the activities  of the present three-party Royal Government. The parties are  cooperating more closely each passing day in managing national  affairs. For this reason, the CPP pledges to resolutely oppose  all Khmer Rouge attempts to sabotage the KoC Constitution by  demanding the dismantling of the National Assembly and the Royal  Government born of the elections and the formation of a new  government that includes the Khmer Rouge.    If we yield to such a demand by the genocidal elements who  sabotaged the Paris Agreements, who boycotted and vandalized the  elections, and who are continuing to destroy the nation, it  would be tantamount showing serious contempt of the Cambodian  people nationwide and a heavy blow to the outcome of the UN  operations in Cambodia.    In this connection, the CPP would like to stress that as in  the past, its present and future stand is to always to respect  the KoC Constitution, which the Cambodian people of all  generations to come are duty-bound to strengthen and expand on  all its achievements in order to lead the country toward  prosperity. Therefore, the solution to all the present  problems, including the problems arising from misleading news,  must be in line with the KoC Constitution.    The CPP would like to express its active support for the  prominent initiative of the U.S. Government and other  governments and circles across the world in deciding to set up  an office to study and compile data on the genocidal crimes of  the Khmer Rouge against the Cambodian people and other  nationalities in order to bring them to trial. The CPP regards  this decision as a most valuable search for justice for the  Cambodian nation and all mankind.    Availing myself of this auspicious occasion, I would like  to express, on behalf of the CPP, My deepest thanks to all  countries near and far and the international community for  supporting the Cambodian people's just cause.    On the CPP's 43d founding anniversary, from 28 June 1951 to  28 June 1994, I would like to appeal to all members and  compatriots to continue striving to successfully fulfill all  tasks assigned by the people and motherland, in particular, to  contribute actively to implementing the Royal Government's  political program; to effectively solve the people's requests  and grievances; to mobilize forces to firmly defend localities,  villages, and communes; and vigorously stimulate the  rainy-season production drive in a timely manner.    As for the party members who are officials in all state  institutions, mass organizations, and non-government  organizations, you must closely cooperate with the officials of  the other parties, and surmount inertia by upholding creative  ingenuity and setting good examples on work and lifestyles for  the people.    Also on this occasion, I would like to appeal to the  officers  and men in the ranks of the Khmer Rouge to think of the interest  of the nation and people because the policy of the Khmer Rouge  leaders only bring tragedy to the people, religion, and nation.  Therefore, you should quickly return to the national society  and to your families. The quicker the better, so as to jointly  build and make our beloved motherland prosperous as quickly as  possible.    In conclusion, I would like to extend my best wishes to  samdechs, princes, Supreme Patriarchs, all venerable monks,  excellencies, ladies, gentlemen, and all international guests.  May you enjoy the five blessings of Lord Buddha for longevity,  social prestige, happiness, strength, and enlightenment. Thank  you. [applause]</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UNREAD MAIL  </P> <P> How many times are we told to "write your congressman -- they care about what  you say"?  </P> <P> Even though we scoff, I do write.  </P> <P> For the second time, I received a letter back from state Rep. Dana Rohrabacher  (R-Lomita), thanking me for my letter, BUT, once again, he thanks me for a  letter about something I didn't write. A case in point: I wrote him to stop  sending military aid to El Salvador. His letter explained about how he voted  "no" on his new salary raise.  </P> <P> I say, "Don't answer your mail if you don't read it."  </P> <P> EILEEN MURPHY  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

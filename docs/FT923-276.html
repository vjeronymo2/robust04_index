			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Letter: Mellor episode exposes odd news values Sir, On a day when 6,000 job losses are announced in the already decimated manufacturing industry, all the tabloids and TV news programmes are concerned about is the ministerial resignation of Mr David Mellor who remains an MP. On the same day, Parliament was reconvened especially to debate the country's current economic plight. Is society going mad or only the media? Ask any unemployed person which is the more important: Mr Mellor's future or their own?If one is cynical - and it is difficult not to be, given politicians' current standing - then was it not rather fortunate for Mr Major that the spotlight should be directed elsewhere at such a crucial moment? No doubt the favour will be repaid. Derek Dobson, 173 Widmore Road, Bromley, Kent BR1 3AX</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Japan moves up foreign investors' league JAPAN overtook the UK in 1992 as the world's second largest national source of foreign investment, despite a steep slowdown in the growth of international direct investment since 1990, according to a study by the US Department of Commerce. The US remains the leading source of investment. The study says a surge in foreign investment like that seen in the 1980s - with annual increases averaging 19.4 per cent - is unlikely to occur 'without a further liberalisation of investment barriers'. Foreign direct investment grew last year by just 5.5 per cent to Dollars 1,900bn (Pounds 1,270bn). Stimulus could come from liberalisation of investment rules due to successful completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks; from removal of investment restraints at the sub-national level and in such regulated industries as telecommunications, airlines, utilities, and natural resources; from a surge in privatisation of state-owned companies; and from agreement on harmonising national competition policies. At the end of 1992, the stock of US outward investment amounted to Dollars 489bn. The UK, with a stock of Dollars 243bn after two years of negligible growth, was overtaken by Japan, with Dollars 248bn. This follows a five-year surge to 1990, during which Japan's foreign direct investment grew at an annual rate of almost 37 per cent. Growth has since slowed, amounting to just 7 per cent last year. Investment into the US has plummeted, the report shows, with the US falling behind the UK, France and the Netherlands in 1992 as the single largest host to foreign deirect investment. After inflows had grown by an annual average of 19 per cent in the second half of the 1980s, growth slowed to a mere 1.2 per cent last year. 'A chief factor was. . . a stagnant US economy, which lowered the perceived need for new investment, as well as potential future earnings for foreign investors,' said Mr John Rutter, the report's author. Other factors included high start-up costs, large interest payments for new operations, and severe liquidity and excess capacity problems in sectors such as banking, finance, property and retailing. By last year, Japan had become the largest single source of foreign investment in the US, with a stock of Dollars 96.7bn. This amounted to 23 per cent of all foreign investment in the US, compared with just 6 per cent in 1980, the study says. Japan has become the largest investor in the Asia region, with the stock of planned investment up from Dollars 19bn in 1985 to Dollars 60bn last year.

They said the men, all Thais, were hiding on the 8,854-ton  Thai-registered cargo ship Jutha-Pariyanat, which docked at  Miike Port in Omuta, Fukuoka Prefecture, at 8 P.M. Thursday.  None of the 24 were crew members, the officials said.    The ship is owned by the same Thai company whose cargo ship  the Jutha-Jessica brought 19 Thais illegally to a port in  Kumamoto, south of Fukuoka, without proper visas on January 5,  they said.    The 19 were arrested at a railroad station in Kumamoto early  Thursday morning for not having passports with them, along with  two crew members suspected of helping them get ashore.    The officials said they are investigating the 24 found  hiding  on the Jutha-Pariyanat, which left Bangkok on January 4, on  suspicion of trying to enter Japan in violation of the  immigration law.</p>

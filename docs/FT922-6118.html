			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: HK, Canadian groups to buy Novatel assets NORTHERN TELECOM, the Canadian telephone equipment maker, and Hong Kong's Techtronic International are expanding their cellular business by separately buying most of the assets of Novatel Communications, the troubled group owned by the province of Alberta. Novatel, which is one of North America's leading cellular equipment suppliers, has been a heavy burden on Alberta taxpayers. The two buyers will pay a total of CDollars 66.8m (Dollars 56m) but the provincial government estimates its total investment in Novatel at CDollars 566m. Northern Telecom will pay CDollars 38m for Novatel's cellular radio systems division, including installations in North and South America, and the Caribbean. The company has also promised to convert one of Novatel's two factories into a wireless research centre in Calgary.</p>

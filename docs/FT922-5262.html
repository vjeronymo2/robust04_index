			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / University decides to stick to the federation trail: The row over department mergers at Manchester MANCHESTER University is expected to go ahead with a plan to federate the separate management research and education activities of Manchester Business School, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist) and the university's department of accounting unless Mr John Patten, the education secretary, intervenes. The move will be in spite of the resignation of 14 senior business leaders of the business school's council. They allege that the university does not understand the nature of the partnership needed for successful management education between business and academic skills. The 14 executives are led by Sir Dennis Landau, chief executive of the Co-operative Wholesale Society. They include Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment bank, and a former Treasury permanent secretary. The 14 have asked Mr Patten to step in. They want Manchester Business School to enjoy similar autonomy from its parent university as London Business School, which was set up at the same time in the mid 1960s after the Franks report had called for management education to be improved. The council would govern it. Manchester University, however, wants to pull together the three disparate strands of business and management education and research and try to create a world-class institution with about 150 staff. The proposed institution would build on existing and extensive links and collaboration with industry. The present row has surfaced after 10 years of growing tension. 'Someone should have knocked all the heads together about five years ago,' one former member of the business school faculty said yesterday. There have been two sources of tension - one between the university and the business school, and the other within the school itself. The latter lies in a clash between academic and vocational views of management education and research. Some staff are highly qualified academics with strings of publications to their names, while others are more practical in their approach, with less of an academic background but contributing their experience to the job. The depth of the split in the school is shown by the faculty's vote on whether to support the plan for federation. The university has emphasised that 'a majority' favoured its plan, but voting was 29 to 28, with some of the more vocationally based staff worried about their career prospects if more emphasis were placed on academic rather than practical achievement. The split between the academic and vocational approaches is mirrored in the tension between the school and the university. Another academic involved says the university is jealous of its reputation as the 'Oxford of the north'. 'There is a lot of snootiness about the backgrounds of some members of the school's staff,' he says. The annual research ratings of the government's Universities Funding Council have intensified the conflict, with the business school scoring only three out of five, based on such criteria as quality of research and international publications. Umist has scored four or five out of five in recent assessments, while the department of accounting - part of the university's faculty of economics and social science - has also been doing better than the business school. Umist, which grew out the 19th-century Manchester Mechanics' Institute and has a self-governing status separate from the university which the business school covets, is also understood to be not entirely happy with the university's plans because its own management school is a principal pillar of Umist's structure. However, it has already agreed to offer joint engineering degrees with its university departmental counterparts and appears to have bowed to the inevitable, with the federation idea an uneasy compromise short of full integration. Tensions in the business school have affected morale. Professor Roy Payne, who is widely respected for his work on organisational structure and behaviour, grew weary of the politics and resigned as dean last year. He now has a chair at Sheffield University. The future of Professor Tom Cannon, the school's director, is in doubt. University insiders say he will announce his departure when he returns from study leave this week. He has two years of a five-year contract still to run and has managed the school profitably. Prof Cannon, a well-known researcher on small business, was originally expected to come down on the academic side of the argument and support integration. He fought instead for more autonomy and the right to appoint any staff he felt were needed. 'He has done nothing wrong, so he can't be sacked,' one insider said yesterday. 'If he goes, it will be because they have come to an arrangement to buy him out so the university can have its way.'</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Soviet legislature rejected the government's nominee to head the state  railway system, the second incumbent minister to be given the boot in as many  days. The Supreme Soviet approved four government appointees but blocked the  nomination of Nikolai S. Konarev, railroad boss since 1982, a day after  throwing out the nation's chief of foreign trade. By a vote of 204 to 130, with  40 abstentions, deputies rejected Konarev, 62, after criticism of the rail  system's safety record and passenger services, the official Tass news agency  said. On Tuesday, the Supreme Soviet voted down the nomination of Vladimir M.  Kamentsev, 61, who had directed foreign trade since it was revamped by Kremlin  chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1987.  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Public-sector pay freeze extended MPs were slowly waking up last night to a hidden bombshell in the Budget - the extension of next year's public-sector freeze in the pay bill for an extra two years to 1997. The announcement, which will affect up to 5m public-sector workers, triggered an angry response from union leaders, who forecast substantial job cuts. But it prompted no reaction from opposition MPs, who appeared not to have grasped the full implications of the chancellor's announcement. It was also misunderstood by some Conservative MPs, who thought the pay-bill freeze applied only to about 400,000 civil servants. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, failed to mention the freeze in his response to the Budget, in spite of his anger at the chancellor's other tax and spending measures. The announcement, extending a pay-bill freeze announced earlier this year, is the first attempt by any government to freeze public-sector pay for three consecutive years. It was glossed over in the chancellor's speech and hidden in the details of the Budget red book, where the wording appeared to be ambiguous. Mr Clarke told MPs: 'Central government running costs, including pay bills, will be frozen at this year's cash level. Pay increases for public-sector staff will therefore have to be paid for by greater efficiency or savings in the cost of running government.' The red book, which gives fuller details of the chancellor's decisions, says that central government running costs will be frozen until 1996-97 at the 1993-94 level of Pounds 20.1bn. It adds: 'Provision for pay throughout the rest of the public sector has been set on a comparable basis. The general government pay bill is not therefore expected to change much next year, except where major workload changes are projected.' The Treasury confirmed that the wording means all public-sector pay bills will be frozen until 1997. However, officials said this did not mean that pay would necessarily be frozen. Few MPs on either side of the House appeared to grasp the chancellor's meaning while he was speaking, and most were still in the dark several hours later.</p>

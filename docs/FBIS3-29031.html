Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Head of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. Born 1935. Joined  Odakyu Bus Co. after graduating from Seijo University. First  elected to Diet in 1969. Has held posts of minister of  agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; minister of finance.    [Kanamori] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ],  which  was negative toward security and the Self-Defense Forces, joined  the coalition government. Isn't it difficult to manage the  coalition government's foreign policy?    [Hata] When forming the coalition government following the  general election, we agreed, before starting, to take over such  basic things as foreign policy and security. But we did not say  it was all right to take over everything. Time passes. We must  seize the opportunity, and, while holding proper consultations,  go on building a Japan which connects with the world. It is  probably healthier if there are all sorts of debates during that  process. By having all sorts of debates, the problem points will  begin to be visible to the public. There were some who worried  about whether a coalition government would be safe, but has it  not, conversely, progressed in a good direction because the  process can be seen?    [Kanamori] But there are dissenting views even within the  coalition government concerning Japan becoming a permanent  member of the UN Security Council, and it appears that Prime  Minister Hosokawa, too, has become negative since the time of  the Miyazawa government, saying "a reform of the United Nations  is necessary as a precondition for that." Would you care to  comment on that?    [Hata] There are all sorts of opinions regarding the fact  that Japan has become a major power. One holds that it is better  for Japan to live modestly, without trying to do something  beyond its power, and one holds that the world would not  recognize Japan if it did that.    When I was minister of finance, I also had various meetings  with presidents and prime ministers of various countries. I was  often told "Japan should address the world in a more active  manner." The role of Japan has begun to be given more attention  than Japan thinks.    Even looking at the conflicts in various regions of the  world, most are not so much ideological rivalries as they are  conflicts with a historical background, such as ethnic or  religious rivalries. What has begun to be necessary in order to  deal with them is not strength, but very delicate consideration  and attention. I think Japan is a master of that aspect.    A good example is that UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in  Cambodia] head Yasushi Akashi, in Cambodia often did such things  as appeal to people by radio, saying "putting the election into  operation is the beginning of democracy."    [Kanamori] What are the benefits of becoming a permanent  member of the Security Council?    [Hata] It is not a matter of benefit, it is that we are  being  asked to do so by the world. It is not a matter of looking good,  or of saying that it is natural to become a permanent member of  the Security Council because Japan has become a major power.    [Kanamori] What about disadvantages?    [Hata] It is probably feared that Japan might be forced to  shoulder a military role in PKO [UN peacekeeping operations] if  it became a permanent member of the Security Council, but there  are any number of roles for Japan to play. Some people  immediately let their imagination run in that direction, and shy  away, but conversely, one can also propose that the United  Nations get along without using military means. When I visited  the United States in September to attend the UN General  Assembly, expectations for Japan were so strong that there were  requests for meetings from some 60 countries.    [Kanamori] They were from the economic side, were they not?    [Hata] Some were from that side, but others wanted to join  forces with Japan and work to solve conflicts within regions.  And there was also talk of wanting to use Japan's power in the  economic development of neighboring countries.  <H5>  "Taboos Are Bad" </H5>   [Kanamori] Did the situation which divided public opinion  end  because the SDPJ joined the coalition?    [Hata] In such things as (then) chairman Yamahana visiting  the Republic of Korea, the SDPJ has also begun to change after  becoming a governing party. And though it is criticized this way  and that, the one that has contacts with North Korea is the  SDPJ, so I think the SDPJ will have a big role to play in  improving relations with North Korea, which have now reached an  impasse.    [Kanamori] One hears that one impediment to deregulation of  rice has also been removed.    [Hata] People often say that taboos are bad. But,  particularly in regard to rice, there is a strong aspect in  which the media have gone and made it into a political and  symbolic issue. It has begun to become clear that if the Uruguay  Round reaches a showdown, actually not only Japan, but every  country will have problems. Diplomacy is speaking frankly with  each other during a clash between the egos of various countries.    [Kanamori] Secretary General Ozawa of Shinseito, who has  great influence with the Hosokawa government, favors accepting  tariffication of rice, so there are also many who are  apprehensive, suspecting that it will probably happen. Would you  care to comment on that?    [Hata] Ozawa has said for a long time that "it is better to  protect what should be protected by a high tariff." But I fear  that, even if it is initially a 70-percent tariff, Japan will  probably be pressed repeatedly to make concessions by countries  saying "Japan has a surplus, so concede more." I intend to  develop foreign policy by seeking the best way to solve it, not  a masochistic policy of saying that Japan will become isolated  if it does not deregulate rice.</p>

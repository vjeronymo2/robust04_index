			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Alpha Airports maiden interim on rise to Pounds 11.3m Alpha Airports Group, the airline catering company floated by Forte in February, is paying a maiden interim dividend of 1.6p a share. Earnings moved ahead from 4.71p to 5.31p in the six months to the end of July. Pre-tax profits were 6.6 per cent higher at Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 10.6m) on sales 11.9 per cent ahead at Pounds 232m (Pounds 208m). The shares, priced at 140p for the flotation, eased 4p yesterday to close at 158p. Mr Paul Harrison, chief executive, said the dividend reflected group confidence in the full-year outcome and 'a very sound performance.' The sales increase was driven by the retail trading division, which operates shops at airports and now accounts for more than half group turnover. The division's sales rose from Pounds 102m to Pounds 124m, mainly on the back of a new contract at Gatwick and good growth at provincial airports. However, margins were tighter and operating profits were only just ahead at Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 3.2m). The in-flight catering division lifted sales from Pounds 105m to Pounds 109m. Overall margins were unchanged at 7.7 per cent, while operating profits were ahead at Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 8.1m). In the UK the charter market accounted for 30 per cent of sales, up from 26 per cent previously. Cost cutting on scheduled short haul and domestic flights was reflected in a reduction in the catering spend per passenger. UK operating profits eased from Pounds 6.6m to Pounds 6.4m. Operating profits were ahead in Europe from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 1.9m, while in the US they fell from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 100,000, mainly reflecting a shortfall at a new kitchen in Newark that is not yet covering its fixed costs. The results include a contribution of Pounds 200,000 from joint ventures in Trinidad and Australia. Capital investment, excluding the joint ventures, was Pounds 10m. It is expected to reach Pounds 13m for the full year - a figure seen as exceptional following completion of several facilities. Net interest payable fell from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 600,000. Borrowings were reduced from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 18.4m, cutting gearing to 49 per cent from 82 per cent at the time of the float.</p>

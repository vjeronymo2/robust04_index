			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 12 May (EFE) -- Political sources have  reported here today that the U.S. Government has asserted to  Brazilian Socialist presidential candidate Luis Inacio "Lula" da  Silva this week in Washington that it will remain neutral  regarding the 3 October general elections to be held in Brazil.    Workers Party (PT) leader Lula da Silva, 48, is the favorite  in the upcoming presidential elections.    After meeting Alexander Watson, the U.S. assistant secretary  of state for inter-American affairs, in Washington on 11 May, Da  Silva said: "It is very important that a country such as the  United States maintain the impartial position President Bill  Clinton has been postulating regarding the Brazilian elections."    The Socialist presidential candidate will return to Brazil  today, after a five-day visit to Washington, New York, and  Boston. During the trip he met officials of the U.S. executive  branch and Congress, and gave several lectures at Harvard and  other universities.    Da Silva told Watson that he opposes the U.S. embargo  against  Cuba because it punishes the Cuban people. He added that he  also opposes the choice of Miami -- where most anti-Castro  Cubans live -- as the venue for the summit of American chiefs of  state convened by Bill Clinton for 9 and 10 December.    The PT leader has defended the idea that Cuban President  Fidel Castro, who has not been invited, should participate in  the summit.</p>

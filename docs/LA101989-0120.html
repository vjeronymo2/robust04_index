			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 49ERS MAY PLAY NEW ENGLAND SUNDAY AT CANDLESTICK AFTER ALL  </P> <P> Officials of the San Francisco 49ers will meet today with structural engineers  to determine if their National Football League game Sunday against the New  England Patriots can be played at Candlestick Park.  </P> <P> John McVay, 49er vice president, said Candlestick is the first choice for the  game Sunday, but Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto is the second choice and a third  alternative is to switch the game to Sullivan Stadium in Foxboro, Mass., the  Patriots' home field.  </P> <P> It was announced Wednesday night that an inspection by 17 structural engineers  and two architects determined that Candlestick did not sustained any major  structural damage and needs only minor repairs and a cleanup.  </P> <P> The 49ers already switched a home date this season because of baseball. A game  with the New Orleans Saints was moved to the Louisiana Superdome because the  Giants needed the field for the National League playoffs.  </P></p>

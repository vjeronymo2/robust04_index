			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Good start to Streisand sale: Saleroom Barbra Streisand, the entertainer, is simplifying her life by disposing of the collection of 20th-century decorative arts that she has assembled over the past 30 years. Christie's sold 178 lots yesterday in New York for Dollars 5.77m (Pounds 3.88m), with just one item unsold. The auction is completed today. The top price was Dollars 1.98m (est Dollars 600,000-Dollars 800,000) paid for a painting by Tamara de Lempicka, the leading female exponent of the art deco style. 'Adam and Eve', featuring two nudes, was completed in 1932. The model for the male figure was a policeman who Tamara called up from the street near her Paris studio. The price was a record for the artist. The most highly estimated lot was a Tiffany Cowbeb lamp, one of only a dozen in this style made by the American art nouveau master. It was bought in 1979 and occupied the prime position in the actress's Beverly Hills Sun Room. It sold for Dollars 717,500, below forecasts. A rare Tiffany Peony lamp, around which Streisand had planned her living room, made Dollars 332,000, within forecasts, while a Cartier clock of 1927 in the form of a Shinto gate doubled its estimate at Dollars 316,000.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Nikkei surges ahead on hopes of package HOPES that a Japanese government package of stimulatory measures, due to be unveiled today, will inject as much as Y9,000bn (Pounds 36bn) into the country's anaemic economy sent Tokyo share prices soaring 6.1 per cent yesterday. The Nikkei average of the market's 225 leading issues, in its first thousand-point gain since April, finished 1,013.35 higher at 17,555.00. Some 620m shares changed hands in the busiest session for two-and-a-half months. This left the market 3,245 points, or 22.7 per cent, above the six-year low it plumbed just 10 days ago. In initial trading early today - before the package was to be announced - the Nikkei was down about 150 points as profit-taking eroded some of the previous day's gains. The more hopeful mood accompanied increased expectations of the size of today's package, which officials and politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had earlier suggested would be at most Y8,000bn. Measures thought likely include a boost in spending on public works, and aid to lift property prices through the purchase of land for government use. But LDP members were quoted yesterday as saying that a proposal to set aside funds to assist the country's big banks - by buying land held as collateral for loans which have gone sour - had lost favour. Instead, the banking sector would reportedly be offered tax incentives to make writing off bad loans less painful. Tax credits for industry, taking effect from October, were also said to be in prospect to encourage capital spending. As a more direct help to the stock market - still nearly 55 per cent below its December 1989 peak - state-administered institutions such as the postal savings system may also be steered into investing more surplus funds in equities. The package will be formalised in an autumn supplementary budget. The authorities harbour residual hopes that it will allow the country to meet its 3.5 per cent growth forecast for the current year to next March, in the face of private sector belief that growth may emerge at little more than half that rate. The market was encouraged by signs that the government, after lengthy indecision, had set aside Finance Ministry qualms that extra spending would erode Japan's budget surplus. Mr Russell Jones, economist at UBS Phillips and Drew, described the delay in substantial official response to the slowdown as 'the economic policy equivalent of Emperor Nero'. Cautious recovery in demand would probably already be under way by the time today's measures came into force, he said, while the macroeconomic effect of the package would be rather less than the Y9,000bn headline figure. Economic data yesterday indicated that the Japanese economy continues to consolidate. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said industrial production for July was a bare 0.3 per cent ahead of the previous month and 6.2 per cent below the level of a year earlier. Destocking by manufacturers made no headway, with inventories up 0.6 per cent in the month and 5.1 per cent higher than July 1991. As a proportion of sales they rose 0.1 per cent on the month and 8.3 per cent year-on-year. But Miti's forecast for manufacturing activity did show a 5.5 per cent rise in September from this month, when output is expected to fall 4.5 per cent. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said, meanwhile, that July vehicle production was down 7.2 per cent from the year before in unit terms, with passenger car output off 5.6 per cent. Cautious consumer spending was reflected in Miti figures for sales at the country's large retail chains in July. Total sales were 0.6 per cent down from the same month of last year, although clothing showed a 0.5 per cent rise, joining foods and beverages which were up 1.6 per cent.

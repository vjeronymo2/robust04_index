			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- The presidium of the  ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) voiced its satisfaction  in Budapest today that most political parties conduct their  election campaigns according to European norms, disproving fears  of the campaign becoming dirty, MDF spokesman Karoly Herenyi  told a news conference after the presidium session. Answering  questions from the press, Herenyi denied that his party is  carrying on a negative campaign.    Herenyi also said the MDF is "deeply indignant" at attempts  to revive the fascist arrow-cross and Hungarist movement. The  MDF presidium has called upon the state prosecutors office to do  all it can to ban these organizations. At the same time, the  presidium also cautioned against the resurgence of the extreme  left.    Herenyi said the presidium has learnt from local MDF  organizations that groupings even more extreme than the Workers'  Party, such as members of the former Workers' Militia, hold  regular meetings, disturbing and intimidating people in many  places.</p>

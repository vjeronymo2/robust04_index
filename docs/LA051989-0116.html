			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROUND ONE OF HAL WALLIS CASE;  </P> <P> LACMA LOSES PLEA FOR HOLD ON SALE FUNDS  </P> <P> A state judge in New York has denied the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's  request for a court order freezing the $39.6 million sale proceeds from an art  auction last week until a legal dispute over the funds can be resolved.  </P> <P> The museum contends that eight Impressionist paintings on permanent loan to the  museum were fraudulently reclaimed by a foundation set up by the late film  producer Hal B. Wallis. It had asked for a temporary restraining order blocking  transfer of auction sale proceeds.  </P> <P> Justice William Davis, of the state Supreme Court -- the trial level comparable  to Los Angeles County Superior Court -- denied the museum's request at a  Thursday morning hearing. However, Davis agreed to a second hearing to  determine how the money will be held until the museum's suit is settled.  </P> <P> Davis scheduled another hearing in the case for June 6 after attorneys for the  museum, the Wallis foundation and Christie's agreed late Thursday to establish  a formal escrow account in which the sale proceeds will be held pending  disposition of the case.  </P> <P> The museum had sought the restraining order to impound money generated by the  May 10 auction sale of eight Impressionist paintings from Wallis's collection  that were removed from the museum in early January by the Wallis Foundation,  headed by Wallis' son, Brent.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Museum of Art filed its suit Wednesday in New York  demanding award of the sale proceeds, commissions earned at the sale by  Christie's and a sum equal to the future appreciation of the artworks while the  litigation is in progress. In New York, an attorney representing the Wallis  Foundation said the organization would seek to have the county museum's action  dismissed on grounds that New York state courts have no jurisdiction.  </P> <P> The dispute centers on a document the museum contends is a binding set of  written instructions by Wallis to his foundation's trustees, signed two weeks  before his death in October, 1986, stipulating that the paintings in question  be turned over to the museum on permanent loan.  </P> <P> The document adds that, if the paintings are withdrawn, they must be displayed  permanently at another publicly owned museum.  </P> <P> Jeff Glassman, a Los Angeles lawyer who is secretary of the Wallis Foundation,  said Thursday that the signed letter of instruction was not legally binding on  the foundation board. Glassman said the "museum understood that the loan of the  paintings was not a gift and would be for an indefinite period of time."  </P> <P> But, said Glassman, "there always remained the possibility that if the  circumstances were such that, if the foundation believed it would be in the  best interests of its charitable purposes to sell the paintings, it had that  right." Much of the dispute between the museum and foundation may depend on  seven words in the instruction letter saying the loan was for "a definite or  indefinite period of time."  </P> <P> Loss of the Wallis collection was the second recent major blow to the Los  Angeles County museum. In January, 1988, industrialist Armand Hammer withdrew  an earlier commitment to donate $250 million worth of his own art collection  and announced a plan to build his own museum in Westwood to house it.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, court documents emerged in a related case in federal court in New  York that indicate that many of the same paintings from the Wallis collection  figured in a bizarre series of events in 1980 and 1981. The episode was largely  kept out of public view at the time, according to Jeremy Epstein, an attorney  for Wildenstein &amp; Co., Inc., a New York gallery that has emerged as a  central figure in the new dispute.  </P> <P> According to court records in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Wallis' wife,  former actress Martha Hyer, was allegedly fleeced by three "confidence men" in  Los Angeles who eventually offered for sale to a gallery in New York City two  of the paintings that figure most prominently in the new dispute.  </P> <P> The court pleadings identify the trio as Harold Pruett, Gerhard Whiffin and  Rory Keegan. Harold Pruett eventually emerged, in 1986, as a central figure in  a $5-million Los Angeles ponzi scheme and was convicted on fraud charges.  </P> <P> Martha Wallis, whom Hal Wallis wed in 1966, was the film producer's second  wife. His first wife, the mother of Brent Wallis, was actress Louise Fazenda,  who died in 1962.  </P> <P> Wildenstein, the court filing contends, subsequently sold the pictures back to  Wallis in exchange for a contract -- now the subject of the federal court  litigation in question -- in which Wallis allegedly agreed to allow Wildenstein  to sell off his art collection after his death.  </P> <P> Eventually, it was Wildenstein that learned of the existence of the disputed  letter of instructions signed by Wallis and informed the museum of the  document's existence.  </P> <P> The Wildenstein court documents allege that, in 1980, Martha Wallis sought to  borrow $1 million for purposes that were not stated at the time. Other court  documents indicate that Mrs. Wallis had occasional financial problems. Wallis's  initial instructions setting up a trust in his name specify that, in the event  of his death, any outstanding debts incurred by Martha Wallis be satisfied.  </P> <P> Martha Wallis, according to an attorney who has represented the Wallis family,  resides in Santa Fe, N.M. Attempts to reach her were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> The Wildenstein court documents say that, in December, 1980, Mrs. Wallis turned  over paintings, including works by Monet and Gauguin, to the three men and that  the works were later used as collateral for loans without the knowledge of Hal  Wallis.  </P> <P> Two paintings by Frederick Remington were eventually sold, the court documents  indicate, but were later recovered by the FBI.  </P> <P> In January, 1981, the documents contend, two works that are involved in the new  dispute were offered to Wildenstein by two men who claimed to represent Martha  Wallis. The works are Claude Monet's "Le Parlement, Coucher de Soleil" and Paul  Gauguin's "The Field of Derout-Lollichon," a Brittany landscape. The Monet was  sold in the Christie's auction for $14.3 million. The Gauguin was given to the  Los Angeles County museum in a separate transaction by the foundation in 1987  and remains on display there.  </P> <P> The Christie's auction also included such works as Mary Cassatt's "Mother, Sara  and the Baby," which went for $3.85 million, Monet's "Asters," which went for  $9.35 million, Edgar Degas' "Sur la Scene," sold for $6.6 million, and a river  view by Camille Pissarro, which brought $2.31 million.  </P> <P> Wallis, the court filings indicate, did not learn of the 1981 sale of the Monet  and Gauguin works until after it had been completed, at which point the film  producer tried to regain possession.  </P> <P> The Wildenstein court filings contend that it was in the confusion after the  gallery purchased the two works in 1981 -- for $650,000 -- that the Wildenstein  organization agreed to sell them back to Wallis in return for the agreement  that Wildenstein would be the selling agent if the works were ever sold.  </P> <P> The gallery's own filings indicate that Wildenstein held out in an attempt to  keep the disputed artworks in a tug-of-war with the late film producer, who is  perhaps best known as the producer of the 1943 classic "Casablanca."  </P> <P> The status of that agreement eventually led Wildenstein to attempt  unsuccessfully to block the May 10 Christie's auction on grounds it had  exclusive rights to act as selling agent for the Wallis collection.  </P> <P> Times researcher Charles Hirshberg in New York contributed to the reporting of  this story.  </P> <P> </P></p>

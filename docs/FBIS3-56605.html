			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 18, BNS -- Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas bowed to pressure of the people who surround  him and returned the law on income declaration by officials and  civil servants to the parliament for reconsideration, MP [member  of parliament] Rimantas Dagys said at a press conference Tuesday  [18 January].    Social democrat Dagys said the motives for rejecting income  declaration were the same as in the case when a law on illegally  acquired money during the introduction of the litas was vetoed.  The lawmaker said the president's step may be regarded as  concessions to financial groups that evade taxes and fear that  the true, "as if social democratic," nature of state authorities  would be revealed.    In Dagys' words, the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor  Party  "no longer follows social democratic principles." He said the  fact is exposed by attempts to push through an amendment to the  law on collective conflicts that would ban strikes in the  systems of interior affairs, state defense, public transport,  energy and health care.    Dagys said he participated as a guest in a conference of  Nordic social democratic parties and the governing committee of  labor unions. The conference discussed preparations for a long  instability period in Russia, he said. The lawmaker told  reporters that Nordic social democrats seek to implement the  idea of cooperation in the Baltic sea region. "This would be a  possibility to protect our interests if a threat from the East  appears."</p>

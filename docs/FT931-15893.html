			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Books: Front line socialists LOST COMRADES: SOCIALISTS OF THEFRONT GENERATION by Dan S. White Harvard Pounds 27.95, 255 pages DAN WHITE has found an original and exciting theme and has written a compelling exploration of it. He has taken a group of men, Hendrik de Mann in Belgium, Oswald Mosley in Britain, Marcel Deat in France, and Carlo Meirendorff and Theodor Haubach in Germany, and used their intellectual-political biographies to create a composite portrait of a generation of socialists, all of whom served at the front in the Great War. All emerged determined to reject the rule of 'old men' in favour of a new form of socialist politics. De Mann, the most intellectually interesting of the group, and Deat became fascist sympathisers and collaborationists after 1940. Mosley was imprisoned for his fascist activities. The two Germans ended as martyrs in the anti-Nazi resistance. White has done a masterly job in weaving together their disparate yet connected stories, highlighting their common generational experiences without minimising the importance of the national settings which determined their eventual fates. These are all studies in failure. None of these men left any mark on the post-1945 socialist movements. In each case, the experience of the trenches shaped the thinking of these 'front line socialists'. The men of the left became pacifists and political activists after 1918, re-thinking the socialist doctrines of their early youth in terms of a tragedy which none wanted to see repeated. The ex-combatants looked for something more vibrant and exciting than the theories of the past. They sought to create new movements that would go beyond working-class ideologies, Marxism and existing parliamentary forms. All strongly believed in national planning but sought a new economic order that would embrace Europe. They were committed to action, to the cult of leadership, and to the use of propaganda that would energise the passive majority. To the lessons of the trenches was added the new challenge of the fascists with their successful mobilisation of the masses. Yet none of these ex-soldiers succeeded in overcoming the inertia of the socialist parties to which they belonged. Nor could they match the popular appeal of national socialism. Having failed to prevent war in 1939, the more disillusioned chose the path of collaboration hoping that Hitler's New Order might provide a final chance. The more resilient or, perhaps, the truly idealist, joined the Resistance. Even as he traces the wartime careers of de Mann and Deat, White continues to stress the utopian elements in their thought, under-playing, in my view, the moral weaknesses in their arguments which military defeat exposed but did not create. Neither man found himself welcomed either by the German officials or the Occupation governments. Disillusionment came quickly. White has used the generational concept to excellent effect. If the author has treated his subjects too sympathetically, he has provided good reasons for re-examining their roles.</p>

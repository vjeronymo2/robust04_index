			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F> Itay Engel and Mikhal Gazit; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Engel] We would like to speak with the prime  minister on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Rabin  government. Good morning, Mr. Yitzhaq Rabin.    [Rabin] Good morning to you and to the listeners.    [Engel] Sir, two years ago you spoke about the need to  change the national order of priorities. If not a top priority,  at least the most talked about issue at the moment is Syria.  You warned yesterday about what might befall us if a peace  agreement is not reached with the Syrians. We would like to  hear from you this morning about what is happening in reality  rather than about what might happen. Do you foresee a  development on the Syrian channel in the next few weeks?    [Rabin] I believe the dialogue with Syria will continue. I  am sorry, though, that it will continue indirectly, through the  Americans, in a bid to reach a direct dialogue. I doubt that  the Syrians are currently ready for any other form of contacts,  which would be the best way to advance the political process.    [Gazit] Sir, having said that, you uttered very harsh words  yesterday about Syria and the possibility of war within a few  years if there is no change in the situation. Should we infer  from it that the Syrian channel is still stuck and going nowhere?    [Rabin] The problem is not that we want war. We want peace,  and in order to attain it, we are prepared to make painful  compromises. At the same time, I am sorry to hear that in an  address to the Zionist Executive, a Likud leader asserted that  the Arab world no longer has a military option. This is an  illusion. We had better learn from our bitter experience: Three  months before the Six-Day War, nobody thought there would be a  war in 1967; two weeks before the Yom Kippur War, nobody thought  there would be a war. Those who think a military option no  longer exists have no right to apply for the generous U.S. aid  and should not put everything into building up the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] in order to have a strong army. Although we  must first and foremost prevent a war, if it is forced on us, we  must win it.    The government's policy, therefore, is to search for any  possible way to attain peace from a position of strength and by  nurturing Israel's military might, which is a condition for its  existence and the security of its population. This is also the  condition for peace, because nobody will negotiate with a  militarily weak Israel. That is why we act on both levels.    Two years ago today, Labor emerged from the elections to the  13th Knesset as the largest party in Israel. The factions  affiliated with it in the Knesset constitute a buffer against  the establishment of another government, even if all the  right-wing and religious parties were to unite. Moreover, we  changed the national order of priorities. We stopped throwing  money away on the political settlements in the territories and  transferred it to education. The education budget was augmented  by an amount unprecedented in the past 15 years, because  education is the key to the future of our sons, the future of  the young generation, and the future of the State of Israel. We  invested in the transportation infrastructure in order to make  up for 25 years of neglect. Israel lagged behind every modern  country in terms of its transportation infrastructure. Without  such an infrastructure, it will be impossible to bring the Negev  and the Galilee closer to the center of the country. The  problem is not bringing Ari'el closer to the center of Israel,  because it is already close geographically. The issue is  expanding and developing the Galilee and the Negev.    We fought unemployment. When we assumed power two years ago,  the rate of unemployment among Soviet immigrants stood at 29  percent, while in May 1994 it was 14 percent. General  unemployment in Israel totaled 11.2 percent two years ago and  8.2 percent in May 1994 -- a 3-percent decrease. We are almost  back to the level that existed prior to the wave of immigration  that started in 1989.    [Engel] Sir, is there anything you regret, any  disappointing moments in the past two years?    [Rabin] There always are unpleasant moments, but when I look  at the general picture, I would say that we scored many  achievements. This does not mean that we achieved everything.  If there is anything I regret, it is the enormous gap between  what has actually been achieved by the government and the way  this is being perceived by the people, either through the media  or the feeling among various sectors of the population. I think  this government will bring about reforms, new approaches, and an  organizational restructuring of many spheres of life in Israel.    [Gazit] Sir, you may be reaping the fruit of the I-will-lead  government [alluding to Rabin's victory speech in June 1992] in  the political sphere, but you are paying a very high price in  the domestic arena. Your party is experiencing a very serious  crisis. Do you think there is room for reaching any conclusions?  Should we expect a more serene and reconciled second half?    [Rabin] I hope so. I am not blaming anybody, except some of  our institutions, which worked in a certain way for many years;  I am primarily referring to the Histadrut labor federation. By  not voting for us as they did in the past, the people seemingly  wanted to teach us a very painful lesson. Lessons must be  learned from such a blow. It is a pity that instead of  everybody learning their lesson, there is bickering. We will  learn our lesson and rectify what can be rectified.    [Engel] Your party colleagues talk about an erosion in your  standing and a drop in the government's popularity. What is  your response to this?    [Rabin] I was given a mandate in the Knesset elections. I  have no doubt that the results of the Labor's primaries, which  determined that I should lead the list, brought about a result  Labor was not able to obtain in 17 years. I will not judge our  policy and its implementation according to weekly, monthly, or  bimonthly public opinion polls. My criteria is what we will  achieve in our term, in our full four years in power, and not  the transient moods reflected in public opinion polls. The  voters will test us in the next scheduled elections. We will be  judged in the next Knesset elections, which will be held as  scheduled.    [Engel] Sir, thank you very much for this interview.    [Rabin] Thank you.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The leadership of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front  of Liberia] has expressed serious disgust over a publication by  Nigeria related to the cost of their peacekeeping operation in  Liberia.    Recently, a local daily reported that Nigeria has revealed  spending some $4 billion [figure as received] on what they call  peacekeeping activities in Liberia. President Taylor said he  views the pronouncement seriously, noting that this may be one  of the reasons why Nigeria does not want to leave Liberia.    The NPFL leader reminded Nigeria and the international  community that Liberia is not for sale, and if Nigeria claims to  have spent $4 billion here, and did not use the money wisely to  bring about peace, Liberia should not be seen as a Nigerian  savings bond for their continued perpetuation in this country.    President Taylor said Nigerian reference to spending $4  billion here is sufficient cause to believe why the Nigerian  ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group] soldiers are behaving arrogantly and carrying  acts of treachery in Liberia. Are the Nigerians saying they  will not leave Liberia until we pay back the $4 billion --  president Taylor asked -- stressing that Liberia is not for sale.    The NPFL leader said the statement by the former Nigerian  vice president, that Liberia has lost its sovereignty in the  war, is manifesting itself by the attitude of the Nigerians, who  have commercialized efforts to return peace to Liberia through  arms sales, drug trafficking, and support for armed groups to  delay the Liberian peace process. President Taylor said the  NPFL, through its vision, with Almighty God, will continue to  fight, watch, and die, if necessary, in the continued  preservation of the sovereignty of Liberia.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: European markets retreat as Bundesbank remains firm EUROPE'S government bond markets fell yesterday as the Bundesbank reiterated its determination to quell inflation by keeping German interest rates high. The news came against a background of further currency turbulence as Norway decided to cut the krone's link to the Ecu, sparking further speculative pressure against the weaker European exchange rate mechanism currencies such as the Danish krone and the French franc. GERMAN government bonds dropped as the Bundesbank said it would stick to its restrictive policies to try to bring inflation under control and left interest rates unchanged. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said there was no room for an easing in interest rates, and the central bank left its discount rate at 8.25 per cent while its Lombard rate remained at 9.5 per cent. The Bundesbank added its money supply target for 1993 would be raised to a range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent, from 3.5 to 5.5 per cent. The bund market had expected the money supply target range to be raised. Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member, said German M3 money supply growth slowed in November, and was quoted as saying it would be below 10 per cent. The provisional figure of 10.2 per cent for annualised growth for October was revised to 10.3 per cent. The Liffe bund futures contract fell from a high of 91.74 to 91.40 on the Bundesbank's statements, ending the day at around 91.45. THE Dutch and Belgian central banks cut their key interest rates yesterday, but the moves were a reflection of their relative currency strength against the D-Mark rather than an indication of monetary policy. The Dutch central bank cut two of its three key official interest rates by 25 basis points while the special advances rate, the main money market rate, was cut to 8.60 per cent from 8.70 per cent. Dutch government bonds edged lower with the market focusing on the possibility of a new state bond issue in the 10 or 15-year area expected to be launched shortly. FRENCH government bonds fell on disappointment at the Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged and as the French franc came under renewed pressure in the foreign exchange market. The decision by Norway to sever the Norwegian krone's link to the Ecu yesterday put pressure on the weaker members of the European exchange rate mechanism. Dealers said they believed the Bank of France was forced to intervene in order to support the franc. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 moved from 8.20 per cent to 8.17 per cent. UK government bonds dropped half a point at the long end, dragged down by the a fall in the European bond markets, sterling weakness and disappointment over yesterday's Treasury report. The Liffe gilt future contract slipped from 99.25 to 99.06 in relatively thin volume, while in the cash market the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 dropped from 109 1/32 to 108 19/32 . Dealers noted some profit-taking at the long end following the lengthening trades seen recently. Gilt prices ended lower across the curve after the Bundesbank indicated there was no room for a cut in German interest rates. JAPANESE government bonds closed firmer after the benchmark cash bond reached a new high for the year. The yield on the No 145 moved from 4.59 per cent to 4.57 per cent before backtracking to end at 4.58 per cent. March bond futures ended at 107.86 against Wednesday's close of 107.84, and traded in a range of 107.78-107.92. LONGER-dated US Treasuries firmed on good inflation news yesterday, although prices at the short end of the market remained flat. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 102 7/16 , yielding 7.415 per cent. The two-year note was slightly weaker, down 3/32 at 99 15/16 , yielding 4.641 per cent. The eagerly-awaited inflation data was better than anticipated, with the November producer price index falling 0.2 per cent, compared with an expected 0.1 per cent rise. The news cheered the long end of the market, which is traditionally sensitive to inflation fears. The short end of the market failed to post any gains, partly because of the presence in the market of a large seller of two-year notes. Shorter-dated paper was also troubled by news of a 38,000 decline in jobless claims during the last week of November.</p>

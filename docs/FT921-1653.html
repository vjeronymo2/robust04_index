			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Biggest retailing chains increase joint market share THE RECESSION has speeded up the concentration of retailing power in the UK, according to a report from Corporate Intelligence Group, the retail consultants. The 10 biggest retailers now account for more than a third of all sales, and have added 2 percentage points to their combined market share over the past year. The top 500 retailers account for 70 per cent of all sales, leaving 240,000 independent companies with the remainder. The report says this level of concentration suggests that many sectors have oligopolies, in which trading is dominated by a small number of companies rather than one, as in a monopoly. The top six grocery retailers account for 75 per cent of food sales, the top three DIY chains command 48.5 per cent of the home-improvement market, and the leading four off-licence groups control 57 per cent of sales of alcoholic drinks. The report supports a widespread view in the industry that the big multiple retailers, many of which are publicly quoted, are polarising between the strong and the weak. Although the 10 top retailers increased their sales by 55.3 per cent between 1986 and last year, the next 90 biggest retailers saw their sales increase by only 19.1 per cent over the same period. The average growth rate for all retailers was 34.2 per cent. The report suggests that middle-ranking multiple chains are being squeezed between the bigger efficiencies and economies of scale enjoyed by the biggest chains and the greater flexibility of the smaller chains. However, the report accepts that such figures are to some extent affected by the large number of big chains which traditionally enjoy resilient sales, even in recessions. The top 10 retailers include seven companies which sell food. In order of sales they are J. Sainsbury, Tesco, Marks and Spencer, Asda, Argyll (which owns Safeway), Isosceles (which owns Gateway) and the John Lewis Partnership (which owns Waitrose). In comparison, the next 90 companies include many retailers selling clothing and household goods. Such items are more exposed to volatile discretionary spending and have been squeezed harder in the downturn. The severity of the recession on retailers' profitability is borne out by the report, which shows that in 1987-88 only 50 retailers with sales of more than Pounds 3m made losses that year. By 1990-91 that figure had trebled to 140. However, the frenetic pace of mergers and acquisitions that characterised the retail sector in the 1980s has abated. In 1989 the value of acquisitions in the sector amounted to Pounds 5.3bn. This fell sharply to Pounds 621.8m in the following year, and grew only marginally to Pounds 706.4m last year.

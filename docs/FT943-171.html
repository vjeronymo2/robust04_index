			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / IMF offers Dollars 360m to support Ukraine reforms The International Monetary Fund agreed yesterday to provide Ukraine with Dollars 360m (Pounds 227.8m) in financial support and held out the prospect of further funding, as long as the Kiev government introduces economic reforms. Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, said the loan, from the IMF's systemic transformation facility to help former communist countries, had 'all the potential to be the long awaited breakthrough' in bringing order to Ukraine's economy. But for it to succeed, Kiev would have to implement a 'strong package of measures upfront' to restructure the economy and would need substantial international financial support. The IMF managing director said the agreement with Ukraine was a 'strong first step' in the direction of economic reform. It involved a comprehensive programme including price and exchange-rate stabilisation, a 'major effort' to reduce the budget deficit, continuation of a tight monetary policy, a pick-up in privatisation and restructuring of Ukraine's welfare system to protect the most vulnerable groups. The Dollars 360m will be handed to Ukraine once the programme has been approved by the IMF board, probably next month. Mr Camdessus said 'considerably more assistance' would be available from the IMF in 1995 with the Fund expecting to negotiate a stand-by credit agreement with Kiev early next year. However, IMF support would not be enough, Mr Camdessus said. He called on other countries to pledge support to Ukraine during next week's annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Madrid. This was an 'opportunity not to be missed', he said. But it is unclear how far other countries will take up Mr Camdessus's suggestion. A Ukraine official said that Kiev is hoping for Dollars 1.5bn from the industrialised countries as part of Dollars 4bn in support over two years that was discussed by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries at the July economic summit.

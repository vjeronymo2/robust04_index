			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Officials 'defeatist' on Rosyth THE Scottish Office was accused yesterday of taking a defeatist attitude to the possible closure of the Rosyth naval dockyard when it emerged that Scottish Enterprise, the development body, is drawing up contingency plans for alternative uses of the facility. Scottish Enterprise and the local enterprise companies have been considering alternative uses for the Rosyth dockyard site, including a business park and an industrial estate. A plan for building a roll-on roll-off ferry terminal on land next to the naval base and adjoining the dockyard is also being examined, although that could be set up even if the dockyard stays open. The government should decide shortly whether work on maintaining the new Trident submarines should go to Rosyth, operated by the Babcock-Thorn consortium, or to the larger naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. Some Pounds 120m has already been spent preparing Rosyth as a repair facility for the submarines. It is thought that whichever yard loses the Trident work would have to close. In Rosyth's case, that would involve the loss of 4,000 jobs. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor and Labour MP for Dunfermline East which includes Rosyth, said the Scottish Office should step up its fight to persuade the Ministry of Defence to keep Rosyth open, rather than plan for the aftermath of closure. It was doing things in the wrong order. He also rejected as unacceptable suggestions in the Scottish press that if Rosyth closed as a dockyard it could still be used for the dismantling of the navy's nuclear-powered submarines. Three decommissioned hunter-killer submarines and one Polaris submarine are already moored in the dockyard. For Rosyth both to lose its dockyard and become a 'nuclear graveyard' was unacceptable to Scotland, he said. Scottish Enterprise said contingency planning for 'a variety of eventualities' was sensible in the light of 'recent press speculation'.</p>

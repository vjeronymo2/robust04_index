			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Manila at a record high as Australia retreats WITH Tokyo remaining closed until Thursday for the Golden Week holiday, markets in the region moved in various directions yesterday on domestic issues. Bangkok was also shut for a holiday. MANILA climbed to a new high in quiet trading, breaking last week's record as demand for equities outpaced supply. Some analysts noted that the market continues to benefit from the increasing liquidity brought about by the reduction of banks' reserve requirement last Friday to 23 per cent from 24 per cent. The composite index closed 11.13 up at 1,615.46. It has risen 28 per cent since the start of the year. Gains led declines by 34 to 13, while 25 issues were unchanged. Volume fell to 584m shares valued at 218m pesos from Friday's 2.1bn shares worth 1.6bn pesos. AUSTRALIA ended at its lowest level since April 7 as profit-taking took hold. The All Ordinaries index shed 17.0 to 1,664.5 in volume of 246m shares worth ADollars 252.3m. The All Industrials index fell 23.6 to 2,592.0 and All Resources weakened 12.0 to 955.9. Gold shares receded from recent highs and the sector's index dropped 23.9 to 1,432.1. Newcrest eased a cent to ADollars 3.14, Poseidon Gold fell 13 cents to ADollars 2.67 and Placer Pacific lost 4 cents to ADollars 1.84. Banking issues held up well on hopes of a further reduction in interest rates. National Australia firmed a cent to ADollars 9.03, Westpac eased a cent to ADollars 3.32, ANZ dipped 3 cents to ADollars 3.40 and Commonwealth Bank shed 4 cents to ADollars 8.14. Elsewhere, BHP slipped 18 cents to ADollars 14.26 and Brambles was down 22 cents at ADollars 14.50. HONG KONG finished easier, but well off the day's lows, helped by late bargain hunting. The Hang Seng index lost 40.40 at 6,790.11, having initially touched 6,727.64. Turnover shrank to HKDollars 3.15bn from Friday's HKDollars 4.56bn. Blue chips, which bore the brunt of early profit-taking, recovered lost ground, with Cheung Kong unchanged at HKDollars 26.10 after bouncing from a low of HKDollars 25.60. Actively traded HSBC was down HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 70.50, but after HKDollars 70. Profit-taking was also outweighed by switching to market laggards, particularly second and third liners, including Seabase International, up 30 cents at HKDollars 4.125, and Conic Investment, 62 cents stronger at HKDollars 4.175. BOMBAY fell back, sentiment affected by disappointing full year results from Reliance Industries. The BSE index slipped 19 to 2,081. Although Reliance reported 1992 profits of Rp3.2bn (Dollars 103m) against Rp1.6bn last year, the market had been expecting a figure in excess of Rp3.5bn. The shares finished Rp5 cheaper at Rp177.50. KARACHI gained ground as investors brushed aside news of political uncertainty and gave fresh buying orders. The KSE index put on 3.86 at 1,098.45 and rises led falls by 155 to 126. Volume improved to 2.1m shares from 1.9m. JAKARTA closed slightly softer in moderate trade. The official index eased 0.32 to 313.69. Trafindo lost Rp300 to Rp2,800 after a number of brokers downgraded the stock. TAIWAN saw some late buying that pulled the market up from early lows but turnover contracted to its lowest level since February. The weighted index was off 27.20 at 4,473.80, after earlier dropping more than 40 points. Turnover declined to TDollars 21.28bn from Saturday's TDollars 23.2bn. The mood was soured by falls on Saturday and news that villagers protesting against pollution were blockading the Tashe Petrochemical Industrial Zone in southern Taiwan. SEOUL ended a lethargic session a shade firmer in what brokers described as a technical improvement centred on blue chip manufacturing shares. The market index added 0.91 at 718.59. Late institutional bargain hunting helped the market higher, although many remain cautious after recent steep rises. SINGAPORE was higher, with last-hour demand for blue chips pushing the market up. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 7.27 ahead at 1,790.90 in volume that dipped to 247.54m shares. KUALA LUMPUR declined on profit-taking after an early sharp advance as investors turned cautious. The composite index ended 2.24 down on balance at 717.37, mainly due to a 60-cent drop in Telekom Malaysia to MDollars 15.60. The index initially set a new all-time peak of 724.16. NEW ZEALAND continued to be affected by weakness in Carter Holt Harvey and Fletcher Challenge, the former losing 5 cents to NZDollars 3.02 and the latter 7 cents to NZDollars 2.74. The NZSE-40 index fell 17.39 to 1,594.35 in turnover of NZDollars 23m.</p>

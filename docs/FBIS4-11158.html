			<p>BFN     [Text] At the instigation of the Cuban Workers Federation,  CTC, the Council of State presented the Order of Lazaro Pena,  First Degree, to Louis Vianet, secretary general of the General  Confederation of Labor, CGT, and a member of the Politburo of  the French Communist Party. As an expression of the  acknowledgement by Cuba's workers and people of his  contributions within the CGT toward friendship and solidarity  with the Cuban Revolution, said Pedro Ross Leal, member of the  Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba and secretary general  of the CTC, may this order be proof of our friendship and our  respect.    This morning, Vianet and the delegation of French labor  leaders accompanying him toured economic centers in Guines  Municipality, Havana Province. At the Blas Roca Calderio UBPC  [Basic Cooperative Production Unit], they donated 120,000 francs  to the needs of Cuba's workers. With the check, they presented  the CGT emblem, explaining that its two hands represent unity,  also, in the French and Cuban workers' struggle against the  Yankee blockade.    The delegation attended the ceremony on Lenin Hill in Regla  Municipality, Havana City Province, on the occasion of the  anniversary of Lenin's birth -- the first ceremony to be held in  the city of Havana in commemoration of 1 May.    Vianet is at this moment holding a news conference on the  situation of workers in France and on the international workers  movement.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Arts: Stockhausen and Parker - Queen Elizabeth Hall Markus Stockhausen, the eldest of the composer Karlheinz's assorted offspring, is a highly expert and musical trumpeter, and several of his father's works contain prominent parts designed for him. But he has also taken up jazz-based improvisation, which is something out of the senior Stockhausen's range; and on Saturday he chose to share a concert with Evan Parker, a renowned improviser on the saxophone. On the original plan, Parker was to improvise alone throughout the first half, and Markus (plus electronics) to fill the second half with extracts from Karlheinz's music and improvisations thereon. In the event they decided to play turnabout all evening: better programme-planning, no doubt, but bemusing in the absence of a corrected programme-leaflet. Except for the opening and the 'Farewell' from Donnerstag, one of the composer's projected seven-day cycle of operas, which duly began the concert and ended it, we rarely knew exactly where we were. Certainly the famous Gesang der Junglinge, widely held to be a (perhaps the) masterpiece of electronic music, came late instead of early, as printed. The audience was reduced to guessing which other items were which, and which ones might be pure Markus improvisations. Perhaps it didn't matter. For all his jazz leanings, Markus has been steeped in the hieratic manner of his mystagogical parent, and he delivered every note and phrase as if there were an aura around them, fraught with gnomic meaning. One could go along with that: the Markus trumpet is like a clarion human voice, individual, appealingly open and persuasively confident, and it compels a sympathetic response. Evan Parker's virtuoso improvisations have a quite different stamp. He sustains near-orchestral textures on his solo sax, with continuous torrents of patterned notes defining two or three different bands at once - and in distinct timbres, too] It is astonishing to hear (obviously he must exploit a 'circular breathing' technique of a very advanced order), not least because a palpable musical impulse guides the free development of his sumptuous material. 'Personal expression' hardly comes into it: Parker's elaborate constructions carry their own speaking but untranslatable force. In the spirit of old Carl Ruggles' Angels, the Donnerstag close, for multiple soft brass, is gravely beautiful. (Since his 'Zodiac' pieces, Stockhausen has often gone in for quasi-chorales in this restrained style.) Young Markus added his poignant trumpet-voice to the taped ensemble, whilst Parker took up a soprano sax - or was it a sopranino? - to warble a gentle descant. Even the crustiest, most shell-backed ear would have been struck by how lovely it sounded, on and on and on.</p>

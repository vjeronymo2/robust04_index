			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Stena Line lifted by strong UK division STENA Line, the world's biggest ferry operator, yesterday announced higher profits for the first eight months as a stronger performance from its UK operations helped to offset the impact of weaker results in Scandinavia. Profits after financial items were SKr271m (Dollars 34.3m), SKr16m higher than in the same period in 1992. The group predicts full-year profits of SKr250m, up from SKr212m in 1992. Results in the final four months are weak because of seasonal factors. Turnover was up 16 per cent to SKr6.23bn, due to currency factors and volume growth. Passenger numbers rose 2 per cent to 10.3m, while freight volumes increased 5 per cent to 542,000 units. A combination of UK economic recovery, rationalisation and lower financing costs has brought a turnround within Stena Sealink, the company's UK unit. The group's international operations, which are based round Stena Sealink, saw passenger numbers rise 11 per cent to 6.5m and freight traffic increase 10 per cent. The group's Scandinavian activities are profitable, but their performance has worsened. Passenger numbers fell 11 per cent to 3.8m in the first eight months, with freight volumes down 5 per cent. The group has introduced a rationalisation programme to shed 700 jobs and save SKr200m a year. It took an eight-month charge of SKr55m for redundancy costs, and it has allowed for a further SKr25m charge in the final four months when making its full-year forecast.</p>

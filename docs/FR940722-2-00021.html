			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Terry then filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education on January 6, 1989, requesting arbitration. The arbitration panel was convened, and the hearing was held in Knoxville, Tennessee, on September 21, 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Arbitration Panel Decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the substantive issues in this case, the panel agreed that Mr. Terry was harmed by the competing commissary and cigarette machine established by the Sheriff, thereby diverting sales previously enjoyed by Mr. Terry. The panel also concluded that Mr. Terry was partly responsible for the circumstances leading to his license termination because he was consistently delinquent in filing his reports and in paying his fees. This conduct began prior to the Sheriff's actions. The panel found that the adverse impact on Mr. Terry's facility was relevant to his inability to pay set-aside fees and to some extent to the quality of his operations. Because of this adverse impact, the panel found that there was good cause for the failure of Mr. Terry to pay the required set-aside fees. In determining damages due Mr. Terry, the panel took into consideration the fact that Mr. Terry contributed to the circumstances that led to the termination of his license.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Terry claimed he was due damages in the amount of $400.00 per month from January 1987 through April 1988 (the month of the termination of his license) or $6,400, and $1,500 for each month since the termination of his license or $49,500. Because Mr. Terry's losses were caused in part by his own delinquencies, the panel ordered the SLA to pay Mr. Terry the sum of $30,000, less set-aside fees he owes the agency in full and less his interim earnings in full. The arbitration panel also ordered that Mr. Terry be reinstated in the program at a facility reasonably equivalent to the Public Safety Building. The panel concluded that attorney's fees were allowable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The panel member selected by the SLA filed a dissenting opinion in which he maintained that the State was entitled to the sovereign immunity embodied in the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. In his opinion, the State did not waive this immunity by participating in the Randolph-Sheppard program and did not have to pay monetary damages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The views and opinions expressed by the panel do not necessarily represent the views and opinions of the U.S. Department of Education.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 18, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Thomas Hehir,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17837 Filed 7&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4000&hyph;01&hyph;P  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

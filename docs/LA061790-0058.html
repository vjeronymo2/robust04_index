			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: RUNNING THE AMAZON BY JOE KANE (VINTAGE: $9.95,  ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> A lively chronicle of the first expedition to follow the entire 4,200-mile  course of the Amazon by water, from the barren highlands of southern Peru to  the oppressively lush jungles of Brazil. Joe Kane and his fellow explorers had  to contend with impassable rapids, "Shining Path" guerrillas, cocaine  traffickers and plagues of insects.  </P> <P> What sets this book apart from conventional travelogues is the insightful  reporting of the psychological tensions that ultimately split the expedition.  One group followed the obsessive, ineffectual Francois Odendaal who, like  Gilbert and Sullivan's Duke of Plaza-Toro, lead from behind. Kane and two  others preferred the leadership of the indomitable Polish kayaker, Piotr  Chmielinski, who successfully guided them to the delta at Belem. The author  provides an entertaining account of becoming a river rafter in spite of  himself, but he fails to explain why anyone would attempt this damnfool stunt  in the first place.  </P></p>

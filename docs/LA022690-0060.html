			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DREXEL OWES MILLIONS IN LEGAL FEES  </P> <P> Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. owes millions of dollars to lawyers who helped  defend the collapsed Wall Street firm and its employees during the government's  lengthy insider trading investigation.  </P> <P> Atop the list is Drexel's main outside counsel, which has claims to $2.1  million in back fees, and attorneys for indicted junk bond ex-king Michael  Milken, whose monthly allowance of about $1 million wound down when Drexel went  belly up.  </P> <P> "There are outstanding fees they haven't paid and they're not going to pay  anything going forward," said a Milken associate who asked not to be named.  </P> <P> When Drexel became entangled in the largest Wall Street criminal probe ever,  the firm promised to pick up the tab for all current or former employees who  became involved.  </P> <P> In addition, the demise of the firm that dominated Wall Street's junk bond deal  making is affecting big law firms that derived a large amount of work from  Drexel's criminal woes and its day-to-day securities business.  </P> <P> A slowdown on Wall Street -- investment banking firms need lawyers for  activities from underwriting stocks to completing mergers -- hasn't helped  either.  </P> <P> Roger Meltzer, a partner with Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel, which has  represented Drexel for 10 years, conceded that Drexel's demise would hurt, but  added that the firm has a "substantial and diverse client base." The firm  reportedly did about $10 million in Drexel business a year. Cahill Gordon said  in court papers that it is owed $2.1 million.  </P> <P> "This firm is not based on the financial health of one client," Meltzer  asserted.  </P> <P> Drexel said it spent $75 million on legal fees associated with its criminal and  civil troubles last year, when it pleaded guilty to six felonies and paid $500  million of $650 million owed in government penalties. A mountain of litigation  spawned by Drexel's behavior still is outstanding.  </P> <P> Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said backed-up legal bills "will be dealt with  in due course" but he didn't know how much was owed. Anreder said Drexel had  for the time stopped paying for individuals' new legal expenses.  </P> <P> Drexel reportedly owes Milken attorneys -- mostly at the New York firm Paul,  Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison -- back pay for three or four months,  consistent with what other firms representing Drexel people claim is due.  </P></p>

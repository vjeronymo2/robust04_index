			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Recession unhinges Bush's election game-plan: As the US primaries get under way the president has a real battle on his hands SHORTLY before Christmas, one of President George Bush's closest advisers offered a glimpse of the game-plan for halting the president's slide in popularity and laying the groundwork for winning the 1992 election. First, Mr John Sununu, the abrasive White House chief of staff, would be dumped; second, the president would unveil an economic recovery plan in his State of the Union address in late January; third, Mr Bush would steal the Democrats' clothing by outlining plans for health care reform. 'We have a plan,' said the adviser, 'and it is a good one.' Today, the White House plan looks threadbare. Mr Bush's popularity is more than 40 points lower than a year ago during the Gulf war. The president sounds defensive. And the presidential election campaign is about to begin, in earnest. On Monday, in the mid-west farm state of Iowa, several thousand registered voters, Republican and Democrat, will gather in schools, churches and other public places to select delegates for their parties' conventions which in turn nominate the presidential candidates. These meetings - called caucuses  -mark the official opening of the 1992 campaign. In many senses, 1992 is a landmark election. It is the first of the post-Cold War era: anti-communism, which has defined the political terrain in every election since 1948, has seen its enemy vanquished in its own citadel. Almost four out of five voters say domestic issues matter more to them than foreign policy. After the vacuous 1988 campaign - where Mr Bush missed a chance to win a mandate for change - there may be some hope of a serious debate about the future of the country. Certainly, voters worried about the recession and the security of their jobs are looking for more than empty slogans. Democratic candidates such as Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, each of whom can spell out a five-point plan faster than one can say 'Mike Dukakis', are attracting attention and support. Mr Bush, singularly unadventurous on the domestic front, has been forced to respond. In previous years, Iowa held the attention of the rest of the nation. Mr Jimmy Carter's surprisingly strong showing in 1976 turned him into a serious presidential contender overnight; then-Vice President George Bush suffered a humiliating third-place finish in 1988, tempting some commentors to write him off until his spectacular come-from-behind win in New Hampshire. This year, Mr Bush faces a challenge from Mr Patrick Buchanan, the TV commentator and former speechwriter to presidents Nixon and Reagan. Mr Buchanan mixes tax-cutting conservatism with neo-isolationist 'America First' rhetoric. No one believes he will deprive Mr Bush of the Republican nomination; but if he could gain 30 per cent of the vote in the February 18 primary election in New Hampshire, he would increase the impression that the president is vulnerable, if not beatable, in November. On the Democratic side, the presence of Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa native, has rendered the Iowa caucus politically irrelevant. All eyes, therefore, have turned to New Hampshire. A strong win for Mr Clinton would dispel, at least temporarily, suggestions that he has been irreparably damaged by accusations of adultery; he would instantly regain the mantle of front-runner. By some calculations, Mr Clinton, riding a tide of southern votes mixed with support in the heavy industrial states of Ilinois and Michigan, could wrap up the presidential nomination by early April, just after the New York primary. But the path to the nomination - and the White House - is rarely so smooth. If Mr Clinton were to finish a poor second in New Hampshire to, say, Mr Tsongas, it would fundamentally change the dynamics of the Democratic race. At the very least, it might provoke an even closer look at Mr Tsongas, a cancer survivor whose big pitch is US competitiveness and the need for a recovery in manufacturing; but Mr Tsongas' appeal outside his native north-east looks limited. A second possibility is that a new candidate could enter the race. The obstacles are formidable: by the end of January, filing deadlines passed in 18 states, which produce 40 per cent of the pledged delegates to the convention. After New Hampshire, filing deadlines will have passed in 27 states, covering almost 60 per cent of the pledged delegates. Yet unless Mr Tsongas, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska (Vietnam war hero), Mr Harkin, or former Governor Jerry Brown of California 'catch fire', a nationally known figure such as Congressman Dick Gephardt, House majority leader, would be sorely tempted to run. The Democrats desperately want to win in 1992. Having lost five out of the last six presidential campaigns, the party look at the White House as a coveted, but remote prize. In the 1980s, the party focused too much energy on maintaining a legislative majority in the House and Senate - only to discover at the end of the decade that voters were deeply hostile to Congress, angry about the perks and privileges of incumbency, and worried about the apparent paralysis of national government. The November election, which also includes the wholesale re-election of the House of Representatives and one-third of the US Senate, will be a testing ground for a voter reaction against incumbents. The political process in the US has always been a slow-moving affair; the Founding Fathers wanted it so. But in recent years, the inertia has become more serious because Americans have tended to vote increasingly for 'divided government', where Democratic majorities in Congress counter-balance Republican presidents. The formula seemed simple: leave Republicans to handle foreign affairs and national security and let the Democrats dole out the money for domestic programmes at home. A year ago, a complacent Mr Bush believed that this formula would hold good in 1992. The crushing victory in the Gulf war seemed to guarantee him re-election; certainly, it was enough to scare off heavyweight Democratic challengers, leaving the field to a handful of candidates who remain little known on the national stage. The stubborn US recession has forced Mr Bush to recalculate; like his advisers, he senses that it will not be enough to simply defend the status quo. That is why he offered his national health care plan yesterday, and why Americans will be hearing a good deal more talk about the 'caring President' who is interested in domestic - rather than foreign affairs - in the coming months. In reality, Mr Bush is banking on an economic recovery by late spring or early summer. Without an obvious upturn, Mr Bush could be vulnerable to a Democratic challenger. The problem for the Democrats is that no single candidate currently in the field, with the possible exception of Mr Clinton, looks capable of bridging the 'stature gap' with the president.  -------------------------------------- US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES  -------------------------------------- William Clinton (Democrat)  Governor of Arkansas.

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Strong arguments for mutual ownership (1) Sir, I read with interest Alison Smith's article 'Mutual destruction' (September 5). While I can only write on the subject of mutual life assurance companies, I would, with authority, venture to suggest that there is a very strong argument for the continuation of this class of financial institution. Although a large number of mutuals will have far fewer owners than would result in them enjoying 'a one-in-a-million say' in strategy, I would suggest that this is irrelevant, since the same is undoubtedly true of the majority of proprietary institutions where, however wide may be the ownership, control invariably vests with a small number of highly influential investors, many of whom will themselves be financial institutions. Smith dismisses the value-for-money arguments which justify mutual ownership. Take for example, however, the case of a 25-year endowment assurance. Typically, the shareholders, in a proprietary office, take out more money over the term than does the life office, to cover expenses, and the sales outlet, for commission, put together. Should the Treasury encourage de-mutualisation, this would hold no terror for us. But there would be a clear loss to future policyholders and, indeed, the UK economy.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Hostile Policy Toward Korea Will Fail" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- World public bitterly  condemned the anti-DPRK nuclear racket of the United States and  its followers.    The Malian paper AURORE May 19 said that since the DPRK-U.S.  talks for a solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula broke up, the situation in the peninsula has become  extremely acute. It charged that Washington and Seoul were  stepping up nuclear war preparations, crying for "sanctions"  against North Korea.    The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it noted, can be  resolved only through negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S.    A radio of Iran May 31 said the United States is claiming  pressure and "sanctions" against the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea only, while failing to throw into question  Israel that has many nuclear weapons.    The U.S. hostile policy vis-a-vis Korea will fail in face of  the resistance from the world people, it said.    The May issue of the Dutch magazine INTERNATIONAL LIBERATION  said the question of guaranteeing peace on the Korean peninsula  in the future depends on the U.S. attitude.    Noting that the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea are  equipped with nuclear weapons and extensively staging war  exercises against the DPRK, the magazine said the DPRK has its  independent right to protect itself from a U.S. nuclear attack.</p>

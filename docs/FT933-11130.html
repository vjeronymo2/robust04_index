			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (8): Telecottaging as a way of life - How rural areas are coping with change Every rural area in Europe has had to come to terms with big changes to the structure of agriculture and the serious impact this has had on jobs and income levels. The signs are that rural Wales is beginning to cope better than most. There has recently been a slow but steady expansion of population in the region - which stretches from Snowdonia, in the north, the Brecon Beacons, in the south, and from the coast of Cardigan Bay to the English border - following a century of decline in agricultural employment. In the past decade, population has grown by 7.5 per cent compared with 2.4 per cent for Wales as a whole, although the exodus of young people is still a big worry. The attractions of the rural heartland of Wales, which covers 40 per cent of the principality's land area, include low commercial rents and housing costs, a high quality of life, a good workforce and financial assistance and business advice from the Development Board for Rural Wales (DBRW), established by the government in 1977 to tackle the problems of depopulation. The area's big drawback is the widespread perception of remoteness and isolation, even though this has been alleviated by recent improvements in road, rail and telecommunications links, plus the assumption that industrial activity is inappropriate so far from big population centres. Nonetheless, progress has been impressive. In the 12-month period ending in March this year, private sector companies announced more than 100 investment projects worth a total of Pounds 25.7m, supporting 1,300 jobs. These capital programmes were stimulated by a record level of Pounds 3.6m of financial assistance from the DBRW. The level of investment by business looks set to continue in 1993-94. In the first quarter of the current financial year, approval has been given for grant assistance of Pounds 1.1m for 24 private sector projects, stimulating investment of more than Pounds 7.3m and producing 450 jobs. Mr Glyn Davies, chairman of the DBRW, says: 'We have managed to achieve record-breaking investment during very lean years. 'We believe even greater prosperity will be created in the years ahead.' Another indication of the expansion of the economy of rural Wales, with its widening manufacturing base, is the decision of the board this year to construct only pre-let and bespoke premises rather than advance factories. 'We need to raise the quality of employment and all our current and planned construction is for companies which meet these wider objectives. There will be no speculative building at all,' Mr Davies says. Projects announced in recent months include an Pounds 8.5m expansion programme by Control Techniques, a leading producer of electronic drives and controls, at Newtown, the completion of the new European headquarters of Fisher Gauge, Canadian-owned specialist engineers, at Welshpool, and the construction of a high-specification factory for Labtech, a subsidiary of Aerospace Engineering, at Presteigne. Mid-Wales companies have developed so successfully that 85 per cent of the DBRW's financial assistance in the past year has gone to locally-established businesses - 'a healthy sign for long-term rural prosperity,' says Mr Davies. Nevertheless, attracting inward investment remains an important part of the board's work. In the past year, one in three of all new projects going to Wales from the rest of the UK has decided to locate in rural Wales. This trend should be continued through the current development of eight small, attractively-located business parks, including ones near Snowdonia, Cardigan, Welshpool and Brecon. Predictably, because of ease of access and better communications, progress has been greater in the east of the region than in the far west, and added emphasis is now being placed on attracting more jobs to Cardiganshire and Merioneth, where agriculture has been particularly dominant. Farm diversification projects have received help and advice and the DBRW is seeking to develop a variety of locally-based activities, either divorced from agriculture or giving added value to agricultural products. Many small-scale industrial, high-tech and advisory activities can be placed in rural areas, providing more varied employment opportunities and helping to retain a working population across a full range of age and ability. A potentially-important provider of employment is telecottaging, which offers training and equipment to enable people to work in or close to their rural base. In essence, a telecottage is a workplace and trading centre in a village, filled with computer and communications equipment that can be used by local people, businesses and community groups. As well as providing low-cost training in high-tech equipment, the telecottage offers electronic office services to small businesses and teleworkers, including accounting, spread-sheeting, desk-top publishing, electronic mail, fax and photo-copiers. Mr David Rowland, chairman of Telecottages Wales and an organiser of a telecottage at Llangedwyn, an old mill complex on the borders of Powys and Clwyd, believes the potential for local rural employment is considerable, particularly when proper quality standards are set, so that employers have confidence in the system. 'The cost of work here must be a twentieth of what it would be in a big city,' he says. Mr Davies does not regard telecottaging as a significant factor in boosting local employment yet, but he believes this will change. 'The benefits of telecottaging are going to come in the longer term by ensuring that the rural population, particularly the young, have complete familiarity with new technology,' he says.</p>

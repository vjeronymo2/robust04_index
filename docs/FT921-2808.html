			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Indian group in engine deal with Mercedes-Benz TELCO, India's biggest vehicle maker and a Tata group subsidiary, is to manufacture truck engines and components for Mercedes-Benz, in a move making it part of the German company's international production chain. Mr Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (Telco) and Tata group head, said his company would make engines for use by the German company, part of the Daimler-Benz industrial concern. Mercedes' decision to buy components from the Indian company is part of its strategy of widening its supply source to cut costs when world competition is growing. Mr Helmut Werner, a Mercedes director, said recently Mercedes intended to 'put new life' into its co-operation with Tata. Mercedes will use the parts supplied by Telco for its truck production in south-east Asia. Telco will make Mercedes engines for trucks exported under its own name to the Middle East. It will also make gear boxes, clutches, front and rear axles for the German company. This week, Telco widens its product range in India with the launch of its first car, the Tata estate car. Ariane Genillard reports from Prague: AEG, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary, is poised to take a stake in CKD, Czechoslovakia's biggest transport and engineering company, for a joint venture making transport vehicles. AEG intends to diversify CKD's production capacity of 1,200 tramcars and 550 locomotives a year, focusing on making subway cars and suburban trains.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Incentive plans to re-list part of Cardo group Incentive, the Swedish industrial and investment company controlled by the Wallenberg family, plans to re-list part of the newly-acquired Cardo investment group early next year, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. Incentive bought Cardo for SKr8.4bn (Dollars 1.14bn) in May because it wanted to acquire its controlling 58 per cent voting stake in the medical equipment specialist Gambro. The new Cardo will comprise most of the investment group's other industrial operations, based on doors, pumps and railway breaking systems. It has manufacturing and sales companies in 21 countries and 5,600 employees. Sales in 1994 are projected to reach SKr5.4bn. Mr Lennart Nilsson, president of Cardo, said: 'The new Cardo is a streamlined industrial group with strong market positions within its respective product areas. This creates a favourable base for further expansion.' Holders of shares and warrants in the old Cardo will have preferential rights to subscribe for shares in the new company, and will gain a discount. Incentive said it may retain an ownership interest.</p>

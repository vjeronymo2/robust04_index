			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Zeneca shunned Investors continued to shun Zeneca, the bioscience side of the soon to be demerged ICI. However, at least one leading securities house was arguing that Zeneca offered good value. Agency broker James Capel believes that the ICI new shares have been overvalued and, although there are some long-term worries with Zeneca, it may not be receiving the sector rating it deserves. Williams de Broe has also told clients it believes the Zeneca price is too low. Nevertheless, the majority view held sway yesterday and ICI new gained 14 at 623p while Zeneca ex-rights lost 16 to 648p and the nil-paid shed 13 1/2 to 52 1/2 p. Existing ICI fell 5 1/2 to 1279p.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / ID card warning for California All Californians would have to carry identification cards to prove their citizenship if voters pass a proposition to cut services to illegal immigrants, Governor Pete Wilson says. In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle yesterday, Mr Wilson rejected the idea that people born in the US might resent having to carry an ID card. 'If you are a legal resident you have absolutely nothing to fear,' Mr Wilson told the newspaper. 'It has nothing whatsoever to do with eye or skin colour. You are reasonably suspect if you cannot provide documentation that you are in the country legally.' The card is not part of Proposition 187, a measure on the November 8 ballot that would deny illegal immigrants in the state public schooling and most health and welfare benefits. However, Mr Wilson said he believed it would be needed to enforce Proposition 187 if the measure were approved by voters. Mr Wilson, who has emphasised Proposition 187 would not affect emergency healthcare, has made support for the proposition a plank in his re-election platform. His Democratic opponent, Ms Kathleen Brown, opposes it. Mexico has protested over the proposition, saying its implementation would damage US-Mexican relations.</p>

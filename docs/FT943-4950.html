			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: China reveals its gold production at 90m tonnes China yesterday puzzled western analysts by revealing its annual gold production. It was the first time since 1949 this statistic had been given by China which previously insisted that gold output was a state secret. Mr Song Ruixiang, Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources, told Reuter that last year China produced 90 tonnes of gold. This was well below the 127 tonnes estimated by the Gold Field Minerals Services research group in its annual review of the market, regarded as one of the most authoritative available. Mr Kevin Crisp at GFMS said his organisation's estimate included unofficial gold production while the minister obviously was referring only to official output. Gold producers were required to sell all their gold to the People's Bank of China, the central bank. As the bank did not vary its price in line with western bullion markets, there was a big incentive for miners to dispose of their gold elsewhere when prices rose. 'I think a production figure between 120 and 130 tonnes is more realistic,' said Mr Crisp. This still left the question of why China had suddenly broken with tradition. Usually it simply reveals a percentage change. Official newspapers previously reported that China's 1993 production rose by 7.5 per cent from the 1992 level. One analyst suggested that it possibly was significant the revelation came from the Ministry of Geology and not the State Gold Bureau. 'The Ministry is keen to attract foreigners into China's gold business and knows that foreign companies want an indication of the official figure,' the analyst said.</p>

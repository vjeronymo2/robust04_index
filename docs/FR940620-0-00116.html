However, this requirement does not specify the amount or percentage that must be provided in each category or security level. Dispersion is not required to be proportionate to the total number of cells in each category or security level. Thus, at facilities with multiple levels of security, at least one accessible cell or room must be located in each security level. For example, a 300-cell prison that is evenly divided into three categories or levels of security would be required to have three percent or nine of its cells accessible with at least one accessible cell, not necessarily three, in each security level; one cell could be provided in maximum security while the remaining eight could be distributed among the other two security levels. However, this flexibility would not extend to those facilities comprised of only one security level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Regarding local detention and correctional facilities, several commenters were concerned about the effect of dispersion on small facilities. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice supported an exception based not on security factors, but on facility size for temporary holding facilities in local jails. In Nebraska, three housing separations are mandated for county facilities by code: male/female, adult/juvenile, and intoxicated/non-intoxicated. In small holding facilities, dispersion among each holding category or classification would in many instances require 100 percent accessibility among cells, thus causing a disproportionate impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The requirement for the dispersion of accessible cells or rooms among all ``categories and types'' in ADAAG 12.4.1(2) is required only to the extent possible under the minimum percentage required to be accessible for the facility overall. The provision states that dispersion does not require an increase in the minimum three percent scoping specified for the facility overall. For example, if a small jail is required under the three percent specification to have one accessible cell, but has four holding classifications or ``types,'' only one accessible cell is required. An appendix note clarifies that the minimum number required for the facility overall overrides the requirement for dispersion among all categories or types of holding or housing cells.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM asked whether accessible cells should be required to be dispersed throughout individual housing units or buildings that are of the same housing category or security level. A majority of responses to this question were against dispersion of cells within a unit or building. This includes comments from individuals with disabilities, State and local government agencies, correctional authorities, the Bureau of Prisons, several designers and associations. Reasons given by commenters for not dispersing cells and allowing them to be clustered within a unit or building included: safety of inmates with disabilities especially during emergency evacuation, more effective supervision of inmates with disabilities, more efficient provision of programs and services including proximity of accessible cells to certain common use areas, as well as cost and administrative benefits for prison operators. One correctional agency noted that the inmates with disabilities interviewed preferred being housed in the same area as inmates with similar disabilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several disability groups argued against an exception to dispersion. The Paralyzed Veterans of America, while urging safety considerations over dispersion, also felt that there should be a firm test for an exception so that it functions as an exception, not the rule. Otherwise, inmates with disabilities would be ``located in one cluster of cells or on a designated tier, thereby effectively segregating them from the rest of the prisoner/inmate population.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The reasons outlined by commenters for clustering cells make a compelling case for not requiring dispersion of accessible cells among a building or housing unit. Unlike cells in different housing categories or security levels, those within the same category or housing unit would most likely all share the same amenities or features. Consequently, a requirement for the dispersion of accessible cells or rooms within buildings or housing units of the same category or security level has not been included. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12.4.2&blank;Special Holding and Housing Cells or Rooms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Detention and correctional facilities typically have cells used for special purposes such as protective custody, disciplinary detention, detoxification, and medical isolation. Since inmates with disabilities might require or need the services provided in these cells, it is essential that some of each type be accessible. The NPRM requested additional information on these cells, including whether special housing cells should be held to the same level of scoping as general housing cells. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A majority of commenters recommended using the same level of scoping as specified for general housing cells. Other commenters recommended at least one of each type or one percent should be accessible. The Bureau of Prisons indicated that it rarely places inmates with disabilities in such cells and recommended that only one such cell per institution be required to be adaptable, not fully accessible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The number of special housing cells required to be accessible is in addition to the three percent required for general housing cells. In view of this and the fact that special housing cells are occupied for shorter periods of time, ADAAG 12.4.2 specifies that at least one special holding or housing cell serving each purpose be accessible in a facility. However, constructing more than one of each type to be accessible will facilitate access at large facilities which may have a number of each type serving different holding areas or housing units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM asked whether space and cost impacts of accessibility could be limited if one accessible cell served a variety of special purposes. Some commenters, including a few prison operators and several disability groups, supported the use of one cell for multiple purposes. One commenter indicated that small jail facilities usually have one cell serving different uses such as protective custody, administrative segregation, and detoxification. However, a majority of the comments, most from the operators of State correctional systems and designers, considered the idea impractical if not infeasible. In some cases, for example, special housing cells may be located in different locations of the facility according to their use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is clear from the comments that using special housing cells for different uses may not be practical at all facilities, especially those in State correctional systems. Since this may be a viable alternative in other facilities, and since the period of stay in these cells is limited, ADAAG 12.4.2 notes that accessible special housing or holding cells may serve more than one purpose. Where multiple use is not feasible, then at least one special housing or holding cell serving each purpose is required to be accessible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12.4.3&blank;Accessible Cells or Rooms for Persons with Hearing Impairments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that, where applicable, a minimum percentage of cells or rooms be accessible to persons with hearing impairments and comply with 12.6 (Visible Alarms and Telephones). ADAAG 12.6 includes specifications for visible alarms and telephone volume controls where alarm systems and permanently installed telephones are provided to serve inmates of holding or housing cells. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

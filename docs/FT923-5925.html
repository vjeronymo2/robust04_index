			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Pioneer Intl up 9% to ADollars 179m PIONEER International, the Australian building materials and petroleum group, yesterday announced a 9 per cent increase in net profits to a record ADollars 179m (USDollars 127m) for the year to the end of June. Turnover was down 6 per cent to ADollars 5.1bn. The result was in spite of difficult trading caused by recession in its main markets in Australia, the UK and included a net abnormal profit of ADollars 5.7m. This was created by a ADollars 63.7m profit on the sale of the group's shareholdings in the Ampolex and Oil Search exploration companies, offset by a ADollars 58m write-down of non-current assets. Pioneer said this year was likely to be 'one of the most challenging we will experience'. There was evidence of an end to the recession, but tangible signs of recovery were elusive.</p>

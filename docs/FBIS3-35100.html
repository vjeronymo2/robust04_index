			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By M.K. Dhar] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 13 -- Russia has assured India that  the emergence of ultra-nationalist forces in its newly elected  Parliament will not affect the India factor in its foreign  policy.    It has also sought an early visit by Prime Minister P.V.  Narasimha Rao to Moscow to review implementation of the  agreements signed during President Boris Yeltsin's New Delhi  visit last year and to discuss more areas of cooperation.    As a result of the exchange of communications between  President Yeltsin and Mr Rao and other exchanges through  diplomatic channels, it is likely that the Prime Minister will  visit Moscow in June for extensive talks on international issues  and bilateral matters. The Indian factor in Russia's Asian  policy plays an important role and Moscow is now getting more  conscious of the importance of strengthening stability and  security in South Asia and the Asia- Pacific region as a whole  in view of the growing fundamentalist and ethnic pressures on  the Central Asian republics and the need for friendly and  peaceful neighbours.    Moscow has assured New Delhi that the bottlenecks to trade  and supply of defence equipment and spares have now been removed  and economic interaction between the two countries will  increase. The backlog of supplies of equipment and spares for  the Indian Air Force will be cleared in the next few weeks, as  more Russian ships will dock in Indian ports. As regards the  Navy and the Army, supplies will be speeded up after the visits  of Russian Naval Chief Admiral Felix Nikolacvich here next week  and of Indian Army Chief Gen. B.C. Joshi to Moscow later this  month.    India has been informed that President Yeltsin has  constituted a special department to expedite arms exports.  Earlier, Indian defence teams were expected to negotiate  directly with the enterprises spread all over the Commonwealth  of Independent States, which was a frustrating experience.  After receiving frantic Indian requests, the Russian Defence  Ministry shipped to India small consignments of spares from the  inventory of its own armed forces until firm arrangements for  supply were made. But considering that nearly 60 per cent of  the arsenal of the Indian defence forces is of Soviet origin,  the supplies were extremely inadequate.    However, there is little progress on the cryogenic rocket  engine front since the agreement between ISRO [Indian Space  Research Organization] and Glavcosmos was annulled by Moscow  under US pressure. Up to the time of cancellation of the pact,  some technology transfer had taken place, but it had not reached  the stage of handing over design, drawings and actual components  of the engine, as well as fuel. The Russians are now willing to  honour the financial component of the deal by supplying more  finished engines than envisaged in the contract, but the Indian  side is still undecided.    However, other agreements regarding exchange of scientists  and technicians under the umbrella of the science and technology  cooperation are being implemented as per schedule. Recently, an  agreement was signed between the National Aerospace Laboratories  (NAL) and Myasischev Design Bureau (MDB) for joint design and  production of a nine to 14 seater light transport aircraft  (LTA). The project is worth Rs [rupees] 80 crore (with MDB  investing Rs 40 crore) and the first prototype is expected to be  ready by 1995-96.    Indo-Russian trade, too, is showing signs of revival after a  massive disruption following disintegration of the former Soviet  Union, though actually a large component of Indian exports are  accounted for by debt repayments. Indian imports from Russia in  the first half of last year rose by 25 per cent, mainly on  account of deliveries of newsprint and non-ferrous metals.  Since a proper administrative machinery for recoveries and  settlement of debt did not exist in Russia, several lobbies came  into operation. The Finance Ministry, which is supposed to  affect recoveries, is one such lobby, with the Ministries of  Foreign Economic Affairs and Industry-cum-Trade the others. Of  the Rs 1,300 crore available to Russia last year as instalment  of debt repayment, Moscow has been able to order imports worth  Rs 700 crore only because of disagreement among Ministers on the  list of commodities to be imported. The Russian Prime Minister,  Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin is supposed to draw up an indicative list  of items to be imported from India.</p>

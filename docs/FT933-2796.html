			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Government to revoke export licences to Iraq BRITISH companies exporting goods to Iraq which are exempt from the United Nations trade embargo are to have their licences revoked by the government following the discovery of fraudulent UN and Department of Trade and Industry documents. British officials at the UN have confirmed that UK registered companies are among a number from various countries which have been brought to the attention of the UN sanctions committee because of the alleged doctoring of UN documents. The doctoring involves false statements of export volumes on goods classified as humanitarian aid, which may have resulted in some companies breaching UN trade restrictions. UK officials say that they have been left with no option but to revoke all export licences in order to prevent the fraud from spreading. The DTI is understood to be investigating at least one British-based company after receiving information from US and UK intelligence. Under the sanctions regime, which was imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990, humanitarian aid includes medicines and baby food. However, the fraud is believed to involve borderline cases, where the aid could have a defence-related application, such as vehicle spare parts and concrete. These cases are subject to UN scrutiny and require a UN letter of authorisation. At least 1,200 licences to export humanitarian-related goods have been granted by the DTI to UK companies since sanctions were imposed. A further 270 supply licences, which allow UK companies to arrange for the supply of humanitarian-related aid to Iraq through third countries, have been issued. An estimated 300 of these licence applications have been approved by the UN sanctions committee. Under existing procedures, a UK company wishing to supply Iraq with humanitarian aid in borderline cases applies for an export licence to the DTI, which applies to the UN sanctions committee for a letter of authorisation. This letter, which details the company, the goods, and the volumes involved, is sent back to the DTI via the Foreign Office. According to senior Whitehall officials, goods which have been identified on the forged documents are not military equipment. Nevertheless, the fraud related to larger quantities of goods than those permitted under UN restrictions. The UK move follows a UN sanctions committee decision in the summer to set an end of year expiry date on all approved export applications. The applications previously had no time limit. However, some fraud cases have involved the same licence being used more than once. British companies will be told they can apply for new licences. But the documentation will be on a different paper which officials say is less susceptible to fraud. The DTI, sensitive about not undermining UK commercial interests, was planning to revoke the licencing procedures discretely, contacting companies before making any kind of public announcement. The DTI said yesterday it could neither confirm nor deny that it was about to change its licensing procedures.</p>

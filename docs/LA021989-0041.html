			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GASTRIC BALLOON CURBS THE APPETITE;  </P> <P> RATIONALE IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL FEEL FULL, EAT LESS  </P> <P> Question: I was interested in reading in your column about the use of a balloon  that goes into a person's stomach so that he doesn't feel like eating so much.  What I don't quite understand is how the balloon gets into the stomach. How big  is it? Am I right in assuming that it cannot be swallowed?  </P> <P> Answer: The gastric balloon is placed in the patient's stomach through a  narrow, flexible tube that passes down the throat and the esophagus. The  balloon is deflated when inserted, and then blown up to about the size of a  grapefruit. The entire procedure can be accomplished within a few minutes.  </P> <P> Use of the gastric balloon avoids the need for surgery. The rationale behind  its use is that the person will feel full and therefore tend to eat less.  </P> <P> Q: I had always been under the impression that syphilis was a curable disease,  but I saw some figures recently about the number of cases that are found each  year. If syphilis is curable, why should so many people be getting it? It would  seem to me that it would have been wiped out by now.  </P> <P> A: Penicillin can cure all stages of syphilis, but not unless the patient makes  himself or herself available for treatment. The later a person is treated, the  larger the dose that will be needed and the longer the duration of treatment.  Those who are allergic to penicillin may be treated with tetracycline or  erythromycin; however, tetracycline should not be used by pregnant women  because it causes permanent discoloration of the baby's teeth.  </P> <P> Q: Does myocardial infarction and heart attack mean the same thing? I have even  heard both expressions used in the same sentence, so I'm beginning to think  that they are actually the same thing.  </P> <P> A: Myocardial infarction is the medical term for heart attack. "Myocardial"  refers to the heart muscle, and "infarction" refers to tissue death. Other  terms used to refer to a heart attack are coronary occlusion, coronary  thrombosis, or just plain coronary. In general, they all mean the same thing.  </P> <P> Q: If a man has an ostomy will that make him impotent? I know there are some  operations that do have this effect.  </P> <P> A: Ostomy surgery may cause impotence or sterility in some patients, but this  does not occur in all cases. In one study of more than 300 patients, 12%  reported that they experienced such problems.  </P> <P> Q: I am a teacher and occasionally there is a child in one of my classes who is  on insulin. I would appreciate some information about the symptoms of an  insulin reaction. How may I recognize one? I would like to be prepared.  </P> <P> A: The early symptoms of an insulin reaction include hunger, sweating,  irritability, headache, an increased pulse rate and increased blood pressure.  Later, the patient may show confusion and bizarre behavior. And, still later,  convulsions and coma may occur.  </P> <P>  Dr. Neil Solomon is a specialist in endocrinology and metabolism and an  authority on obesity. He also holds a doctorate in psychology.

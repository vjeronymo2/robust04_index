			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (25): Five challenges ahead - The banks want a level playing field Few industries are better placed to cope with the challenges of post-apartheid economics than the financial services sector. 'We are in the top 1 per cent in world banking in terms of systems, instruments and performance' says Mr Barry Swart, First National Bank's chief executive. Services generally, and financial services in particular, form one sector where South Africa has an international competitive advantage, although this does not mean that it will escape the pressures of global competition, already manifested in the arrival of several international commercial and investment banks. This is something of a sore point on two counts. The new arrivals, and the return of banks that divested in the 1980s, are unlikely to improve services and enhance competition in the bottom half of the market, where arguably the country is underbanked and where millions of consumers and thousands of small-scale enterprises offer new opportunities and challenges. Instead, groups such as Citibank. Morgan Guaranty and Standard Chartered are setting up representative offices targeting high-profile businesses, focusing on trade finance, raising offshore loans and corporate finance services in the realm of cross-border mergers and alliances. While accepting the inevitability of such new competition, South African banks want the government to insist on a level playing field, forcing the newcomers to put capital on the table and open up branches - 'just as we had to do in the UK', says one banker. No one expects the foreign banks to risk the enormous capital needed to open retail networks in South Africa. 'There is no way,' says one, 'that Barclays or Standard Chartered will return to retail banking. The entry barriers are just too high and returns on assets of 1 per cent unattractive.' It's a similar story in the investment field, where South African brokers have set up joint ventures with international merchant banks. S G Warburg has taken a 50 per cent stake in the Ivor Jones Roy broking house in a deal which is bound to impact on the investment banking business and aspirations of South African banks. Predictably, the foreigners are eyeing the high margin operations which, politicians and industrialists say, are not the top priorities. The banks see themselves up against five main challenges: At the top of their list is the need to retain and strengthen their image as world-class players. This means adherence to Basle capital ratios; greater transparency, which ANC politicians are demanding; closer central bank supervision; and deregulation of the markets. Capital requirements have been raised significantly to satisfy Basle standards - from next year, banks will have to meet the 8 per cent risk-based capital adequacy requirement. All the leading groups are already there. The second is coping with the new international competition. Dr Conrad Strauss, chairman of Standard Bank Investment Corp (Stanbic), says South African banks must become larger, pointing out that, ranked by assets, 240 banks around the world are bigger than the largest South African bank. On 1993 numbers, the top four banks accounted for nearly 80 per cent of total bank assets. Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa) ranked first, with a 28 per cent market share, followed by followed by Standard Bank (20 per cent), First National (17.5 per cent) and Nedcor with 13.5 per cent. The third, and politically most pressing, is relevance - the need to ensure that the banks are meeting the demands of the new South Africa in terms of providing services for the small man and the small enterprise. In a capital-scarce economy, it is not surprising that some politicians should see the banks as a source of low-cost funding for social projects, while simultaneously advocating directed credit to ensure that people and businesses without collateral can get access to bank loans. ANC politicians are calling for 'transparent' reporting by banks, requiring them to report their loan portfolios by race and gender, giving reasons why loan requests are rejected. The banks have long been conscious of the opportunities available in the fast-growing mass consumer market. Automatic telling machines, smart cards and debit cards are being used to provide quick, efficient and low-cost services to the millions of users seeking basic banking services. Standard Bank is opening a new division, E-Bank, which is a network of terminal-based branches catering for people wishing to deposit and withdraw cash. More challenging is the need to fund home purchasing and black business. The Nedcor group, through its 1989 purchase of the Perm, bought a large black customer base. Its experience with black home-buyers, who have good repayment records, will stand it in good stead as the mass consumption market expands. It stands to benefit too from donor funds, such as the Dollars 15m package from USAID, to be channelled to low-income households. In 1991, it established NedEnterprise which makes loans of between R50,000 and R1m to small and medium-scale businesses. Some 55 per cent to 60 per cent of its lending is to black, asian and coloured-owned enterprise, with about 60 per cent going to franchise-holders. NedEnterprise offers three types of loans - traditional overdrafts for working capital, instalment finance for asset purchasing and three- to five-year term loans. Bad debt ratios are low, especially in the franchise business where they are below 5 per cent. It is not as high risk an operation as might be anticipated because two organisations, the Small Business Development Corporation and USAID provide guarantees for many loans, while franchising is a low-risk operation anyway. The fourth challenge is that of servicing corporate clients offshore. Stanbic earned 2.5 per cent of its R844m net income in Europe, while a further 4.8 per cent came from its acquisition of the former ANZ Grindlays African network. First National Bank has opened operations in the UK and Hong Kong, while Nedcor has struck strategic alliances in Africa with leading European banks  -BNP of France, Dresdner of Germany and Banque Bruxelles Lambert of Belgium. It recently opened an office in Beijing and reopened in New York. Increasingly, the banks see southern Africa as the logical extension of their domestic market, with Stanbic, FNB and Nedcor all expanding their regional business in the past two years. High on the challenge list, too, is affirmative action. This is going to be a difficult, controversial area. Experience elsewhere in Africa highlights the dangers of falling standards of service and increasing losses through fraud. The sheer sophistication and technological superiority of the South African banks means that they should manage to minimise this threat, but investment in training and an element of affirmative action in promotion policies will have to be a core part of future manpower strategies.</p>

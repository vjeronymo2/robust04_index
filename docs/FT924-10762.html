			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar demand is restrained THE DOLLAR edged higher against the D-Mark in late European trading yesterday, but its progress was undermined by another hint from the Bundesbank that official interest rates will be left unchanged at today's council meeting, writes James Blitz. The US currency is being bought by investors who believe that it will rise sharply once the US election is over, the political uncertainties in the US disappear and the Mr Bill Clinton, if elected, embarks on a policy of fiscal expansion. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips and Drew, has a very striking view of the possible upturn. He believes that the US currency is on the verge of one of the three great strategic moves of the free-floating era. The first two were the dollar's rise and fall in the 1980s. Now, he says, the currency could be on the verge of a long-term move upwards, as the US economy is fiscally boosted and the Bundesbank cuts rates as the German economy stagnates. However, Germany's rate-cutting is coming more slowly than the market expects. For the second time this week, the Bundesbank left dealers believing that a cut in official rates was unlikely to take place at its council meeting today, after injecting funds into the German money market at the prevailing rate of 8.75 per cent. Now that the direction of German rate moves appears to be on the downside, the market's focus is on the official rate floor, the Discount rate, currently at 8.25 per cent. Market rates remain a good 50 basis points above that level, and that is not deemed a small enough gap to pressure a reduction in the lower official rate. Mr Chertkow points out that the Bundesbank's last experience of rate-cutting came in the recession of 1981-2, when the discount rate lost 350 basis points in the space of 8 months. However, that was at a time when the fiscal deficit was at around 3 1/2 per cent of GDP, compared to today's level of around 6 per cent - and the policy easing may take longer this time round. Lingering worries about the US economy may also delay the great dollar turn. September's US durable goods orders compounded short-term uncertainty yesterday, falling 0.4 percentage points, against forecasts of a 0.3 percentage point gain. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, says that the Federal Reserve is still biased towrads easing policy rather than tightening it. In the thick of these events, the dollar edged higher in late European trade, closing at Dollars 1.5390, up  1/2 a pfennig on the day. Short-term profit taking pushed sterling up to a high of DM2.4355, but the currency slid back to a London close of DM2.4280, a net rise of 1/2 a pfennig on the day.</p>

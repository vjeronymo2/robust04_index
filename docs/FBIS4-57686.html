			<p>BFN     [Text] Contadora Island, Panama, 21 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The  island paradise of Contadora, which saw the birth of the first  peace-keeping group in Central America, was the backdrop for the  inauguration of the Colombian-Panamanian Neighborhood Commission  meeting.    Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio and Jose  Raul  Mulino, her Panamanian counterpart, gave speeches noting the  "historic" opportunity of this meeting. In view of the change  of governments in their respective countries, this will be the  ministers' last joint effort within the framework of the  Contadora Group, an organization named after the island and  founded in the eighties by Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, and  Mexico as part of the peace-keeping efforts on the isthmus.    Agreements are expected to be signed on cultural issues,  procedures for common border delimitation, the desolate Darien  Gap, and a revision of terms for a ferry service to cross the  Caribbean Sea and link the two countries.    Sanin praised Contadora saying Panama wrote "some of the  most  important pages of its integration and sovereignty" here. Mulino  said: "We have now redeemed" its name because "the Panamanian  dictatorship once spoke here of taking democracy to other  nations."    According to the Colombian foreign minister, the  Colombian-Panamanian Neighborhood Commission has gone beyond  mere words and has contributed to a positive change in bilateral  relations. She said Panamanian President-elect Ernesto Perez  Balladares has guaranteed the continuity of the bilateral  integration process and commercial opening.    Sanin hopes Panama will "quickly" join the Group of Three  (Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela) through the integration clause  after its members sign the commercial agreement on 13 June.    The meeting will also serve to review regulations on the  status of illegal immigrants in each country and the expansion  of national parks for the protection of the environment.    Representatives of the banking and financial sectors also  attended the meeting, a move that was greeted with enthusiasm by  Sanin and Mulino, who head the commission.    The meeting participants will study the bilateral "open  skies" policy and a proposal to recognize the dual nationality  of Indians in border areas. Sanin stated: "We cannot deny it to  them. They have always lived it and exercised it."    For his part, Mulino said the common border delimitation  will  become a reality before his term ends on 1 September.    The ferry that will link Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) and  Colon (Panama) on the Caribbean Sea will begin operating on 4  December, it was explained today during the bilateral meeting in  which private business delegations participated.    During its 16-hour transit, the ferry will be able to  transport 400 passengers in 150 comfortable cabins, 20 trucks or  buses, and 100 private vehicles. The ferry tickets will cost  $85 to $150 per person per day, including all expenses, and $200  to $1000 per vehicle, according to its size.    Sanin was accompanied by Jorge Bendeck, public works and  transportation minister; Communications Minister William  Jaramillo; and Gustavo Gaviria, Colombian private sector  representative. Mulino was accompanied by Panamanian Vice  President Guillermo Ford and business leader Ricardo Aleman.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Chinese cling to share rollercoaster - Market gyrations are not helping confidence An official in Beijing responsible for regulating the stock market was this week reported to have said that recent market turmoil was 'tugging at the hearts of hundreds of millions of Chinese'. Something of an exaggeration perhaps, but share indices have been rising and falling 5 per cent to 10 per cent almost daily in recent months, and such volatility in China's infant markets is hardly engendering confidence among investors. The Shanghai index for A-shares (reserved for local investors) hit a low-point of 328.85 on July 29, prompting panicky government intervention to halt the slide. The market then jumped to a heady peak of 1,057.31 on September 12 before subsiding like a punctured balloon, to fall by about 40 per cent in ensuing days. Yesterday, it finished at 703.72, compared with 686.31 the day before. One factor creating the market's gyrations are continuing rumours about the health of Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader. The Shanghai market plummeted by about 40 per cent earlier this month on reports that Mr Deng was near death, before recovering most of the lost ground after an official denial. Mr John Crossman of Jardine Fleming brokers in Shanghai likens the Shanghai A-share market to a casino. 'It is completely driven by small local investors trying to guess what the big investors (local securities houses) are doing and vice versa.' Mr Crossman believes the A-share index will bounce between 500-800 until liquidity improves. He notes that while the market capitalisation of A-share companies is about UDollars 40bn, only about UDollars 8.1bn of stock is tradeable. These are shares held by individual investors, and amount to about one-third of a listed companies' shares. The remainder are vested in the state or held by so-called 'legal persons', such as institutions, corporations and quasi-government bodies. The August jump in China's fledgling stock markets followed a government announcement that it was suspending all new listings. It also said it was considering allowing the establishment of joint venture security houses to trade in A-shares. This announcement galvanised a market starved of positive news, but it seems the benefits of government intervention are diminishing in the absence of further developments. 'They ramped the (A-share) market to unsustainable levels, but now it's run out of juice,' says Mr Crossman. Western stock analysts in Shanghai say among problems facing the A-share market is the lack of supply of newly-listed stock. They believe it was a mistake for the authorities to halt new listings. Instead, they say, the government should have announced a schedule for newly-listed stock, which would have provided a clear guide to the future instead of the previous haphazard approach which gave no real guidance of the timing of new issues. The Shanghai Securities News reported an (unnamed) official of the Securities Commission in Beijing, one of several securities regulatory bodies under State Council or cabinet, as saying the authorities were investigating the establishment 'as soon as possible' of investment funds to stabilise the market. Chinese officials have been trumpeting the need for mutual-type funds to bring weight to the market. However, such a development is being held up because of delays in promulgating a new National Securities Law. After going through multiple drafts, the measure is lodged with the standing committee of the National People's Congress, China's parliament. Small closed-end funds are active in China's markets, but these can hardly be said to contribute to stability since they are speculative vehicles. About 70 of these funds are operating in the Shanghai market. While the behaviour of A-shares has been marked by extreme volatility, B-shares, traded in US and Hong Kong dollars, are languishing, with the index finishing yesterday at 77.28, little changed from the day before. Mr Richard Graham, chief representative in Shanghai of Baring Securities, said managers of China funds were preoccupied with negative economic news from China, including bad inflation figures. An adverse tax ruling denying foreign invested companies tax rebates had also depressed sentiment. 'Fund managers these days are looking at actual earnings growth,' he said. Local Chinese investors appear to have paused in their purchases of B-shares. With the stabilisation of the yuan (the local currency has appreciated this year against the US dollar), there is much less incentive for locals to dabble in B-shares. Among the few bright spots has been the increased activity of Japanese securities houses, following the Japanese share dealers' association's decision in March to allow investments in the Shanghai market. Increased, albeit cautious, Japanese activity is reflected in the increasing share of trading in the B-share market of Japanese securities houses, with Nomura leading the way. Western analysts in Shanghai expect the B-share market to continue to be subdued for the rest of the year and predictions that the B-index would reach 100 by the end of the year have been set aside.</p>

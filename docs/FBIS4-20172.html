			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sune Olofson: "Bildt Irritated by Supreme </F> Commander's Remarks"]    [Text] Prime Minister Carl Bildt has tired of Supreme  Commander Bengt Gustafsson's repeated remarks in support of a  Nordic military alliance. At a meeting with the press in Kalmar  yesterday Carl Bildt called on the supreme commander to find out  what decisions the Riksdag has come to in this respect.    "Military alliances are not on the agenda. This is a clear  message to the supreme commander who should stick to the  Riksdag's well founded decisions. The supreme commander is a  civil servant in a sensitive field and should be aware of the  Riksdag's decisions regarding military nonalignment," Carl Bildt  said.    Bengt Gustafsson thinks that membership of the EU [European  Union] opens up possibilities of military alliances and in the  long term even for cooperation between the Nordic defense  forces. Gustafsson has also pointed out that the politicians  "are not sufficiently mature" to pursue this discussion.    According to information received by SVENSKA DAGBLADET,  behind Bildt's comments there is a growing irritation in the  Prime Minister's Office with Bengt Gustafsson's frankness which  has not decreased as he approaches retirement. Gustafsson  retires in June and is to be succeeded by General Owe Wiktorin.    "The supreme commander should not push his agenda in the  field of security policy," said Carl Bildt's press chief, Lars  Christiansson, who on two previous occasions has been forced to  rebuff the supreme commander's remarks about a Nordic defense  league.    Bengt Gustafsson's recurrent remarks have given rise to  surprise at the Prime Minister's Office and at the Defense  Ministry since the content of these initiatives is in conflict  with Sweden's official security policy.    A Defense Ministry official told SVENSKA DAGBLADET that "the  supreme commander can be seen as unpredictable, like an unsafe  antitank rifle."    "The supreme commander's remarks have also given rise to  recurrent questions and comments abroad where people have  naturally been wondering what is happening in Sweden. It is  regrettable that the supreme commander is continuing in the same  vein, despite the fact that the government has corrected his  statements in the past," Lars Christiansson pointed out.    Gustafsson made his latest thrust last Friday in an  interview  with the Finnish newspaper, HELSINGIN SANOMAT. In the past the  supreme commander has spoken in pretty general terms about the  importance of a joint Nordic defense alliance. This time he  went one step further:    "We could begin, for example, with joint surveillance over  the Baltic Sea and link up air surveillance systems. We would  then be able to see together what was happening around us."    Bengt Gustafsson went on:    "Any possible new military threat would not affect only one  or two countries in the Nordic area -- it would affect all of  them because the Nordic area is a strategic region. We might  just as well use taxpayers' money as efficiently as possible and  unite our defenses."    In the interview Bengt Gustafsson complained about the  immaturity of politicians and their lack of interest in Nordic  defense cooperation.    However, in the past Bengt Gustafsson has received the  support of several of the Nordic countries' generals. But  Finland's General Gustav Hagglund -- Bengt Gustafsson's  counterpart -- pointed out in a speech in Stockholm in December  last year that a Nordic defense league would probably bring with  it greater risks for Sweden, and better prospects of military  assistance for Finland.    At the heart of this whole problem is what future path the  Nordic area should follow in respect to the defense alliances of  NATO and the WEU [Western European Union]. Officially, the EU  [European Union] countries will discuss defense and security  policy in 1996. Only then will the countries of the Nordic area  -- if they are members of the EU by then -- need to make up  their minds about the question of military alliances.</p>

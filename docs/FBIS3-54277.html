Those arrested came from both the ruling Democratic and Social  Republican Party (PRDS) and opposition groupings and will be  charged for making use of forged identity papers to enable  people to vote twice, the ministry said. Such fraud undermined  the "rigorous procedures" employed in drawing up the voters'  rolls and indelible ink will be used during the January 28  elections to prevent double-voting, a ministry statement added.    Two parties are taking on the PRDS, which is presenting 189  lists of candidates at the polls. The main opposition Union of  Democratic Forces (UFD) is presenting 60 lists and the Union for  Democracy and Progress (UDP), 19. Independent candidates are  standing on 57 lists.    During the campaign, which began this week, a magistrate's  office was burned down at Akjout in the west of the country,  fighting broke out between party activists at Aleg in the south,  and a district administrator resigned at Kiffa, 600 kilometres  (370 miles) south of Nouakchott, to protest against what he  called attempts at fraud by the PRDS.    Observers here expect a close race in the capital and have  not ruled out a run-off round of voting. In the provinces,  strong support for Hamdy Ould Moukhnass's UDP has been reported  from the large eastern towns of Aioun and Tintane, while the UFD  has widespread backing among the non-Moorish black peoples of  the south.</p>

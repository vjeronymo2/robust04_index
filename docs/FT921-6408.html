			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: US court rules against tax claim THE US Supreme Court has quashed corporate America's hopes of getting tax deductions for the investment banking and legal fees companies incur during a friendly takeover. Its ruling could also embolden the Internal Revenue Service, which apparently wants to make it much harder for companies to deduct from taxes the cost of defending hostile bids - a move which could mean large tax bills for many companies involved in the 1980s takeover wave. The Supreme Court's decision involved the friendly 1978 takeover of Indopoco, formerly called National Starch, by Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant. National Starch subsequently claimed tax deductions as ordinary business expenses for Dollars 2.9m in fees paid to its investment bankers and lawyers. The IRS disputed the claim, arguing the costs should not be deductible because they produce a significant long-term benefit for the company. The tax court and a federal appeals court both ruled in the IRS's favour and yesterday the Supreme Court added its weight as well. Last autumn, the IRS sought to extend the 'long-term benefit' argument to a company involved in a contested takeover, an action widely interpreted by tax lawyers as part of a move to clamp down on hostile bid deductions generally.</p>

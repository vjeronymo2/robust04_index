			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Questions raised on D-Mark THE D-MARK'S weakness in the wake of Denmark's ratification of the Maastricht treaty was the dominant issue in foreign exchange markets yesterday, raising speculation that the German currency is on the verge of a sharp move downwards, writes James Blitz. Dealers continued to unwind long D-Mark positions in the wake of the Yes vote in Denmark, pushing the German currency to an historic low against the Japanese yen, and helping sterling to break through the DM2.50 barrier for only the second time this year. Newfound confidence in European monetary union was always bound to weaken the German currency, which investors had used as a vehicle for hedging against another crisis in the exchange rate mechanism. But the surprising aspect of the German currency's weakness yesterday was that it came on a day when the Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged. This was contrary to the expectations of many dealers, who had priced a cut of  1/4 percentage point in the discount rate into their operations. The yen closed at Y68.04 against the D-Mark from a previous Y68.65, while sterling appreciated 1 1/2 pfennigs to DM2.5025 in spite of retail sales figures which raised speculation about a cut in UK base rates this autumn. There were other hints that the D-Mark's role in fund managers' portfolios was being reassessed. A rise in German bond yields to 6.85 per cent implied that there were sharp flows out of the German currency. Some analysts suggested that zero spreads between French and German bonds were not inconceivable. The dollar managed to hold steady against the German currency, in spite of a day which brought the worst US trade data in four years. The March trade deficit ballooned by 29 per cent to Dollars 10.2bn, and the deficit with Japan leaped to a five-year peak. However, the dollar ended in London little changed at DM1.6235. In New York it closed at DM1.6230. The German currency gained no strength against the Dutch guilder, in spite of a 10 basis-point cut in the Dutch central bank's advances rate. At the close of trading in the exchange rate mechanism, the guilder was 48 basis points above the D-Mark in the currency grid, almost at the self-imposed limit of 50 basis points set by the Dutch authorities. Worse than expected figures for German M3 money supply growth were a strong factor behind bearishness towards the currency. On an annualised basis, Germany's M3 money supply grew 7.3 per cent in April, compared to a 3.4 per cent rise in March. Mr Steve Hannah of IBJ International in London said there was a clear message in yesterday's events that the D-Mark was weakening: 'We may be beginning to see an acceleration of a malaise that will characterise the D-Mark for the rest of this year.'</p>

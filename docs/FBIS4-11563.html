			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of communique issued by the Institutional </F> Revolutionary Party Central Executive Committee; place and date  not given -- first two paragraphs are LA JORNADA introduction]    [Text] The Central Executive Committee [CEN] of the  Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] has announced that  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon "has decided to postpone campaign  events and activities planned for the first days of the week,  due to the importance that he gives the idea of debating his  ideas and political program."    In a communique, the PRI leadership reiterates that Zedillo  is willing to debate over radio and television with Diego  Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate of the National  Action Party [PAN] on Tuesday 3 May and rules out the proposal  by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential candidate of the Party  of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] to hold the debates at a  later date. Herewith follows the complete text:    "The PRI CEN reports the following regarding the invitation  made by presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo to the PAN and  PRD candidates to debate as soon as possible:    ``1. In a message published on 24 April, Ernesto Zedillo  expressed his confidence that `throughout the campaign there  will be opportunities to compare our positions with the  candidates of all parties.'    ``2. On 25 April, Engineer Cardenas, in a letter  addressed to our candidate Ernesto Zedillo, without clearly  agreeing to take part in the debate, said: `We plan to hold  several debates, among which you and I could hold one more on  our own, in view of the objective fact that this campaign's  confrontation really represents what both of us believe in and  is what voters will have to decide upon.'    ``That same day, our candidate clearly replied: `I do not  agree with your plan to disqualify other candidacies registered  within the law, nor can I agree with your attempt to rule out  other parties that represent ideological pluralism and diversity  in the country's political life. I reiterate to you that in my  invitation I pointed out my confidence that there will be  opportunities to compare positions with the candidates of all  the parties throughout the campaign.    ``3. In his invitation, Ernesto Zedillo proposed clear  conditions: That the debate be broadcast live on television and  over the radio and managed in an unquestionably impartial,  honest, and equal format.    ``4. PAN Presidential Candidate Diego Fernandez de  Cevallos has accepted the invitation. He suggested the event  take place on 3 May.    ``5. Candidate Ernesto Zedillo has accepted this proposal  for 3 May.    ``6. In light of the above, our candidate has decided to  postpone his activities and campaign events for the first few  days of the week. He did so because of the significance he has  attached to debating his ideas and political program before the  nation.    ``7. He also accepted Diego Fernandez de Cevallos's  suggestion that the event take place at the National Chamber of  Television and Radio Industries. This means that the Chamber  will provide the necessary technical support to guarantee that  all stations who want to pick up the signal can do so and  provide whatever the press may need to cover the event.    ``8. Cardenas has already advised the media that he  accepts the debate, but at a much later date.    ``9. In an effort to ensure unquestionable integrity and  equality, our party will present a format proposal for the  debate tomorrow. This format will provide time for opening and  closing remarks by each candidate and the same amount of time  for each contender to present his ideas. The proposal will also  include a moderator whose absolute integrity and renowned  impartiality qualify him or her to direct the debate and ensure  that all candidates stick to the agreed times and scope.    ``10. The three parties will discuss their points of view  and agree upon all these issues, pursuant to the organization  and completion of the debate, in the shortest possible time.    ``11. The PRI and its presidential candidate are aware  that the direct exchange of ideas is an enriching element within  our country's democratic process. It will be an opportunity for  the Mexicans to see where they really and truly agree and  disagree with each candidate to the Presidency of the republic.''</p>

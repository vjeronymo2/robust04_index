			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Bombay fears fresh share slide AUTHORITIES at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) fear a renewed slide in share prices as investors liquidate holdings ahead of Mangalore Refinery's offering of Rs11.5bn worth of convertible bonds, the largest ever. Several rights issues are also expected during the next five weeks. The BSE recovered 213.31 to 3,887.72 on Thursday after plunging 17.7 per cent in two days to an eight-week low of 3,674.60 on Wednesday. The market was closed yesterday. The market has been unsettled by a strike by brokers to protest against new registration requirements and by a scandal in the gilt-edged market. Brokers have since returned to work, in the hope that the government will resolve the issue by May 21, the deadline laid down by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, requiring BSE brokers to register with it.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Belgian collection exceeds estimate: Saleroom A WELL-TRAVELLED collection of work by the Belgian poet-turned-artist Marcel Broodthaers caused a sensation at Christie's yesterday. The nine objects of 1965-66 were all acquired directly from the artist by the vendor and are witness to Broodthaers' highly developed sense of the absurd. Elements of everyday life - mussels and egg shells are particular favourites  -are combined as puns or ironic comments on the economic and political life of the period. Lot after lot soared way over its estimate, realising a total of Pounds 1.28m. 'Armoire Blanche et Table Blanche', which presents a kitchen table covered in egg shells and the cabinet above packed full of them, achieved the top price of Pounds 396,000, paid by dealers Berggruen &amp; Zevi on behalf of a private client. It was estimated at Pounds 80,000-120,000. The company also secured a 'Panneau de Moules' for Pounds 88,000, while a punning moule casserole fetched Pounds 176,000 (estimate Pounds 15,000-Pounds 20,000). Various bidders had hoped to secure the entire collection to keep it intact. British contemporary art fared less well during the day. Lucien Freud's painting of a naked girl asleep was bought in at Sotheby's at Pounds 300,000. In the afternoon at Christie's, his portrait of a man in a sports shirt tipped the bottom estimate, realising Pounds 275,000. His 'Woman in Profile' also failed to reach the reserve. The sale's star lot, a small Francis Bacon portrait, did sell - but substantially below target. London dealer Thomas Gibson bought it for Pounds 110,000. It was Bacon's last portrait of Isabel Rawsthorne, a favourite model who had also sat for the likes of Picasso, Epstein and Giacometti. Sotheby's top price of Pounds 319,000 came from Lucio Fontana's pierced egg-shape 'La Fine di Dio'.</p>

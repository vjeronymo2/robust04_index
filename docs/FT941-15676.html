			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Georgia near deal on rebel province Georgian government officials and representatives of the breakaway province of Abkhazia were yesterday edging towards an agreement on deployment of international peacekeeping forces while negotiations on Abkhazia's long-term political status continue. The talks, mediated by UN special envoy Edouard Brunner with Mr Boris Pastukhov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, acting as 'facilitator', began in Geneva on Tuesday and are due to end today. The two sides have observed a de facto ceasefire since last September when Abkhaz forces, in violation of a Russian-brokered ceasefire, seized control of the territory. In that brief but bloody show of force, 250,000 people, mostly Georgian, were forced to flee their homes. On December 1, following a first round of talks in Geneva, the Georgian government and Abkhaz representatives signed a memorandum of understanding, which included a pledge not to use force during the period of negotiations, an exchange of prisoners and the creation of conditions for refugees to return. The two sides also appealed to the UN to increase the number of international observers and to send peacekeeping troops to the conflict area. The UN security council responded last month by agreeing to send 50 observers. This week's negotiations have focused largely on where UN troops should be deployed. The Abkhaz delegation is pressing for them to be confined to the Inguri river separating the two sides, while the Georgian government wants them stationed within Abkhazia. Also under discussion is a plan for refugees to return to a small part of Abkhazia where the authorities can guarantee their safety. Abkhaz representatives admit that this is not yet possible throughout the province. Relatively little progress has been made on the future political status of Abkhazia. The Abkhaz side wants either full independence or a high degree of autonomy within a confederal Georgia, despite the fact that before the war Abkhazians made up only 18 per cent of the region's population. The Georgian government of Mr Eduard Shevardnadze is pushing for more limited autonomy within a unitary Georgian state.</p>

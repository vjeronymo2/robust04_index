			<p>BFN     [Text] Having returned from NATO headquarters in Brussels,  Ukraine Defense Minister Army General Vitaliy Radetskiy, who had  been taking part in the work of his foreign counterparts,  immediately left to visit the troops. During an inspection of  the 6th Army Corps of the Odessa Military District he granted an  exclusive interview to our correspondent Marat Pohorelov.    [Begin Radetskiy recording] In the first instance we handed  a  presentation document Partnership for Peace which clearly  stipulates our stand at the current stage. This presentation  document, if one has a close look at it [pauses], and this  testifies to the fact that we will still be revising it and,  along with the improvement of the economic situation in the  state, our views of our participation in the Partnership for  Peace will be changing.    I met the acting secretary [as heard], and we had an  approximately 30-minute talk with him. He listened to me very  attentively, and questioned me about the situation in the state  as a whole and about the state of affairs in the armed forces.  He paid special attention to the current situation in Crimea  and shared our views, our thoughts, and our concern over this  issue.    I met Secretary of Defense Perry. I had meetings with 12  defense ministers. We were discussing issues of military  cooperation, all of them being directly related to the state of  affairs in our country as a whole, its economic and political  state.    Information supplied about Crimea seems to be one-sided. It  mostly comes from the Russian Federation, and the Russian  Federation is expressing thoughts which are useful to them,  which are of interest to them today, which are to their  advantage. As far as the real state of affairs is concerned,  what is being done, who is providing Crimea economically, what  is the situation there, what kind of troops are there. By the  way, nobody was dispatching any troops there, we did not send  even a single extra soldier there, not a single armored vehicle,  not a single tank, not a single submachinegun was dispatched  there [sentence as heard].    And I would express a wish that Ukraine should supply more  comprehensive information: Television, radio, the Ukrainian  press should supply more clear-cut information about what is  being done in our state and pay special attention to the Crimean  issue.

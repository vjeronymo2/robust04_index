			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / DTB and Matif in co-operation agreement TWO OF Europe's largest futures exchanges, Germany's Deutsche Terminborse and France's Matif, have agreed to link their markets, in the most significant co-operation pact yet between exchanges. Under the agreement, members of the DTB will be able to trade the Matif's Ecu contracts, while Matif members will have access to the DTB's important D-Mark interest rate contracts. The link between the French and German market could help to draw business away from the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe), which last year was Europe's most active futures market. The agreement offers the DTB an opportunity to increase its market share in German bund future trading, which is dominated by Liffe with around 70 per cent of the market. The Matif will also acquire the DTB's computerised trading system, which will initially be used for trading its Ecu products. Faced with increasing competition from over-the-counter products developed by banks, futures exchanges have become increasingly keen to co-operate. Technological advances have enabled traders around the world to come together on screen-based systems, while the breakdown of barriers between markets has spurred investor demand for a broader range of products. Last year, four other European exchanges formed an alliance, First European Exchanges (FEX), to extend the customer base for their contracts. Liffe is continuing discussions with the Chicago Board of Trade to list some of each others' products. The Matif's decision to move products on to the DTB's computerised system was influenced by the cost of trading less active contracts using the traditional open-outcry method. New products may later be launched jointly, or existing products added to the agreement. The Matif said the link will have no impact on its agreement to join Globex, the international after-hours trading system developed by the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters. The DTB is still in discussions with Globex. The Matif/DTB agreement is potentially open to other exchanges, of which the Netherlands' European Options Exchange is believed to be the most likely candidate. Lex, Page 20</p>

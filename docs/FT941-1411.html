			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Cellnet rise underlines phone surge Cellnet, the second largest mobile phone operator, has passed the million subscriber mark, with net new connections growing at twice the rate of a year ago. After record growth in the run-up to Christmas, Cellnet had expected a sharp slow-down in new connections. But it is projecting a gross 70,000 new subscribers for this month, only a small decline from 84,000 in December. By the end of this month Cellnet, a joint venture between British Telecommunications and Securicor, will have added a net 110,000 subscribers to its network since the beginning of January compared with 56,000 in the first three months of last year. Vodafone - the largest cellular mobile operator, with more than 1.1m subscribers - is reporting similar growth. Last month it made 58,000 gross new connections. Mr Bob Warner, Cellnet managing director, predicted that total UK cellular subscriber numbers would reach 3m by the end of the year, up from 2m at the end of 1993. 'Two years ago we were adding cellular customers at the rate of 2,000 a month; now it is 2,000 a day,' he said. Most analysts attributed the rapid growth in cellular subscribers at the end of last year to sharp tariff cuts, a fall in the price of handsets, a pre-Christmas rush and the launch in September of Mercury One-2-One, a third cellular operator offering free calls at evenings and weekends inside the M25 area. The continued boom points to strong underlying growth, however, in particular from the entry of the mobile phone into the consumer market. The UK's cellular market is growing in line with that in the US and on the Continent. According to the FT's mobile communications newsletter, the number of western European subscribers grew 53 per cent in the year to February 1, with new networks exposing former monopolies to competition in most of the European Union's larger countries. The UK now has about 3.5 cellular subscribers per 100 people, ahead of Germany (2.3) and France (one), but behind the Scandinavian countries, which have between seven and 10 subscribers per 100 people. The launch next month of Orange, the UK's fourth cellular network, is expected to boost the market further. Orange, a joint venture between Hutchison Whampoa and British Aerospace, will cover 90 per cent of the British population by the middle of next year.</p>

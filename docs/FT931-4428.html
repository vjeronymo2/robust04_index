			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Code on directors' pay 'not followed' ONLY 16 of Britain's 100 largest companies meet the code of best practice on disclosure of directors' pay spelled out last December in the Cadbury committee report on corporate governance, a study published today shows. The study by pay specialists Monks Partnership of the most recent annual reports of FT-SE 100 companies shows that significant changes will be needed to meet the code when it comes into force in June. Although the code is voluntary, the study says companies are taking it seriously and intend to change practices by June. Mr Simon Rodwell, a director at Monks, said it was in companies' interests to follow the code as compliance is to become a condition for listing of companies on the Stock Exchange. Companies must now disclose the aggregate of all directors' pay, and the total pay of the chairman and of the highest paid director (when different). The code requires them to separate out the level of bonus in total directors' pay and in that of the chairman or highest paid director. They will also have to explain the basis on which incentive pay is calculated and disclose details of the committee that sets directors' pay. The study finds most reluctance in declaring the bonus element in the chairman's salary, with just 28 per cent complying. Only 46 per cent offered any explanation for the calculation of bonus pay. According to the report companies not complying with any of the code's recommendations in their last annual report include Abbey National, BTR, Lloyds Bank and Unilever. Companies that complied fully include Boots, British Telecom, Tesco and TSB. Disclosing Board Earnings. Monks Partnership, Debden Green, Saffron Walden, Essex CB11 3LX. Pounds 125.</p>

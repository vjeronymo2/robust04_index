			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ECONOMY;  </P> <P> SALES OF NEW HOMES SURGE 10.9% IN APRIL  </P> <P> Sales of new homes were up a strong 10.9% in April, the Commerce Department  said Tuesday, but housing economists say the industry will remain sluggish at  least into summer because of high interest rates.  </P> <P> The increase in sales to 620,000 units on a seasonally adjusted annual basis  was due to an aberration in sales in February and March, when sales dropped  10.9% and 10.4% respectively, the economists said.  </P> <P> The April increase was the steepest since a 13.9% jump in February, 1988.  </P> <P> Analysts were divided over how soon the housing market would pick up.  </P> <P> "We view the market tone as generally weakening," said David Seiders, chief  economist for the National Assn. of Home Builders.  </P> <P> "We're looking for further weakening in certainly the third quarter, perhaps  the fourth as well," he said.  </P> <P> But Richard Peach, deputy chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Assn., said  although the industry "still is in a slowing trend," the second quarter will be  the "trough."  </P> <P> "As lower interest rates kick in, sales will increase as the summer goes on,"  Peach said.  </P> <P> Fixed-rate mortgage interest reached a peak of 11.22% in March and began to  drop in April, averaging between 10.99% and 11.11%, according to a weekly  national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expects More Activity  </P> <P> Rates had been rising for more than a year as the Federal Reserve tightened  credit in an attempt to stem inflation.  </P> <P> David W. Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Assn., said  he thinks that housing activity will increase if mortgage rates continue to  fall.  </P> <P> "We don't expect a tremendous surge in housing activity, but we do expect it to  bounce back a little bit from the levels we saw in February and March," he  said. "We're likely to see new home sales between 600,000 and 650,000 (on a  seasonally adjusted annual basis) over the next several months."  </P> <P> The April sales level compares to new home purchases totaling 676,000 in 1988  and 671,000 in 1987.  </P> <P> John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Assn. of Realtors, also sees a  slight pickup in sales activity later this year.  </P> <P> "We anticipate new home sales will pick up slightly during the second half of  1989, ending the year with a sales total of about 640,000," he said.  </P> <P> The West paced the April rebound with a 31.3% increase in sales to 193,000. It  was followed by a 21.2% jump to 234,000 units in the South.  </P> <P> Sales fell 6.8% to 96,000 homes in the Midwest and 17.2%, also to 96,000, in  the Northeast.  </P> <P> The decline in sales in the Northeast, where housing costs generally are  highest, was the major cause for a $9,000 drop in the median price of homes to  $117,000 last month, the analysts said.  </P> <P> It was the first median-price decline since a $2,500 decrease last November.  The median price represents the level where half of the homes cost more and  half less.  </P> <P> The average price, which is affected by sales of expensive homes, totaled  $145,700 in April, down $4,800 from the previous month.  </P> <P> NEW HOME SALES  </P> <P> April '89; 620,000, up 10.9%  </P> <P> Seasonally adjusted rates, in thousands; Source: Commerce Department  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zakariya Nil] </F>   [Excerpts] Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat  'Abd-al-Majid has urged the Arab countries to let the Arab  League start immediately to prepare to confront the challenges  posed for them by the major economic blocs, foremost of which  are the free trade agreement "GATT" and the so-called Middle  East market.    He also called on the Arabs to set up an Arab Free Trade  Area  (AFTA) similar to the U.S.-Canadian-Mexican one (NAFTA), the  other economic blocs (GATT), and the Asian bloc.    He stressed that peace is not a gift or a present given by  Israel to the Arabs, but rather the opposite, adding that the  Arab boycott of Israel will continue as long as the latter  continues to occupy Arab territories. He noted that the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement has given more hope than contained  in its clauses.    These remarks were made during Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid's dialogue  at a seminar held by the al-Jizah Rotary Club with businessmen  and intellectuals who are Rotarians.    In a reply to a question, the Arab League secretary general  said: What we should focus on now is the global economic  struggle going on around us. Globalism might be a source of  hope for some, but it is a source of anxiety for others.  Today's world is one of major economic blocs or groupings in  which there is no place for individual countries. Our Arab  world cannot live on the margin. [passage omitted]    In reply to another question, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: The  application of the GATT agreement's clauses will result in the  liberalization of international trade in many commodities and  services; it will lead to the elimination of subsidies for  agricultural exports and for farmers and the elimination of the  textiles agreement so that it will become part of GATT in 10  years. This is in addition to all the other GATT clauses.    Responding to another question, the Arab League secretary  general said: It is evident from the above that Arab  agricultural products will suffer too much due to the high cost  of Arab agricultural production when compared with imports from  countries that enjoy a very high level of economic efficiency,  particularly as the Arab countries import more than 60 percent  of their food requirements. This is bound to affect the Arab  countries' exports due to the factors of quality and  competition. It is also bound to subject the Arab markets to an  intensive invasion by competing products, especially when  conditions for preventing commodity subsidies are imposed. The  same will apply to the services trade and government purchases  sectors. In return, the Arab countries will benefit from the  liberalization of the building equipment, agricultural  machinery, and medical equipment trade.    If we look at the list of countries that will annually  benefit from GATT, we will notice that the European Union [EU]  will be the first beneficiary, followed by North America, China,  the Asian countries, and Japan. The last group to benefit from  GATT will be the Gulf countries (their share of international  trade will be $3.1 billion compared to the $80.7 billion that  the EU will attain).    Thus, this agreement imposes on us as many challenges as  benefits. This requires us to start preparing for it starting  right now throughout the years of grace, some lasting up to 10  years, allowed by GATT to the developing countries so that they  can reorganize their economic infrastructures in line with the  requirements of the new phase of global economy.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid went on to say: I personally heard about  the so-called Middle East market in 1988 from a senior Israeli  official, who added to it a new Marshall plan for the Middle  East where Israel would be one of the principal links. The call  for this market intensified following the signing of the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles on 13 September  1993. The region is being prepared for the post-peace-talks era  and the envisioned future; and the future relations between its  countries are being prepared for. We are facing a new epoch in  the history of the region that requires a radical and  comprehensive change in line with efforts for achieving a  comprehensive and just settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict.  In this context, Israel is aiming to establish the so-called  Middle East market and this makes us ask: Where do we stand in  all this? How do we prepare for dealing with it?    Israel's objectives depend on Arab acceptance, because  Israel cannot impose its objectives on the Arab world regardless  of the form this market takes. If such a market is set up, our  dealings with it will proceed from certain facts, which I  summarize as the following:    -- The Arabs are a huge force with a variety of resources  and  potentials. They are widespread and have many  markets--something that guarantees their ability to set up a  huge economic grouping capable of securing the unity of the Arab  region and preserving its identity, apart from its ability to  affect things rather than be affected.    -- There is nothing that frightens this huge force, because  Israel is no more than a small area restricted by limited  resources in the midst of a vast Arab ocean that has great  potentials and resources. Israel will not have any distinctive  economic advantage, but one can deal with it in accordance with  specific standards and measures, which each Arab country will  set according to its own national interests and within the  framework of its full sovereignty over its territory and  national resources.    -- The Arabs need to formulate a comprehensive strategic  concept specifying higher Arab interests and a united Arab stand  regarding the challenges of peace, regional cooperation, and its  limits.    -- Efforts toward Arab reconciliation should continue  preparing to mobilize Arab integration efforts. The latter will  be turned into a pillar of Arab potential when confronting the  coming challenges.    Answering a question, the secretary general said that the  Palestinian-Israeli declaration of principles provided great  hope, much greater than what was actually written into the text.  (We do not have time to discuss this agreement or analyze its  articles). But evidence shows that the road to the expected  peace gave Israel the impression and feeling that the Arab  world's market, which contains over 150 million consumers, could  compensate for what it might have to relinquish regionally or  diplomatically. The greatest compensation for the shattering of  Israel's dream of becoming Greater Israel from the Nile to the  Euphrates has been the alternative dream of becoming the  economic superpower that can invade the Arab markets as it  pleases. It believes that it has an economic advantage that  enables it to invade Arab markets, since the net domestic  product per capita in Israel is seven times greater than that on  the West Bank and 14 times that in the Gaza Strip. The net  national product per capita in Israel amounts to nearly $11,000,  whereas in the West Bank it amounts to $2,000 and in the Gaza  Strip, $1,300.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: This is the way Israel looks at the  other Arab countries when contemplating the peace. I believe it  is useful to keep in mind on this occasion that peace with Egypt  did not allow Israel to enter the Arab world. This was because  Egypt was greatly concerned about not establishing relations  with Israel at the expense of its relations with the Arab world.  This leads me reiterate my earlier statement that peace is not  a gift or present from Israel to the Arabs. In fact, the  contrary is true; Israel is the one that desperately needs peace  and cooperation, which will not be realized except through its  comprehensive and full withdrawal from all occupied Arab  territories.    Answering a question, the secretary general affirmed that  the  Israeli boycott will continue as long as Israel occupies any  part of Arab territory.    He added that the peace process, which the Arab League  supports in accordance with international resolutions, still has  many obstacles and difficulties to overcome, and this is only to  be expected. However, insistence on attaining the objective and  preserving cohesion are two basic issues for realizing the  desired goals.    The secretary general called on the Arabs to seriously  consider establishing an Arab Free Trade Area (AFTA), along the  lines of NAFTA and the rest of the big economic groupings. He  said: I believe that the time periods provided by the GATT  treaty allow us to set up this area with the objective of  determining the best ways to market our Arab products in view of  the international competition that is characteristic of the 21st  century.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW  </P> <P> A young college student, raped by an acquaintance, says of her attacker, "He  doesn't see himself as a rapist. He's kind of 'Joe Average.' "  </P> <P> She is one of many victims who talk about their experiences in "Against Her  Will" (tonight at 9 p.m. on the Lifetime cable channel), a documentary about  campus rape, a crime that has reached epidemic proportions across the country.  </P> <P> Kelly McGillis hosts this sober, informative hour, quietly announcing that she  herself is a rape survivor. Divided into five segments, the program, produced  by Jorn Winther, begins by defining rape -- it is sex against a woman's will,  no matter what the circumstances. It then defines the rapist: He is usually  personable and friendly -- and he can be anyone.  </P> <P> Next, we're told how sluggish official response continues to help men get away  with the act and then we're shown new, on-campus rape education programs. The  last segment offers a list of "do's and don'ts" for women, to help them avoid  becoming victims.  </P> <P> "Men have learned not to listen to a woman's reality," says a USC psychologist.  He speaks of the need for men to develop empathy and stop "objectifying" women.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most vivid illustration of the need to change societal messages  comes from informal, on-camera interviews with several pleasant-looking male  students who earnestly explain that "women like men who are in control," that  "they dress to attract a lot of men" and that a woman can expect rape "if she  is drunk at a party."  </P> <P> The program repeats Saturday at 9 p.m., June 3 and June 8, both at 1 p.m.  </P></p>

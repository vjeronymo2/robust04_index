			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Midland sells Australian offshoot MIDLAND BANK is selling Dominguez Barry Samuel Montagu, its Australian merchant banking business, to Swiss Bank Corporation. Swiss Bank will buy a 60 per cent interest, with the re-mainder being bought by DBSM management and employees. The Australian bank employs 260 people and has total assets of ADollars 409m (Pounds 183.41m). It made ADollars 13.4m before tax in 1990. No price was revealed for the sale, but it is believed to have brought Midland a premium over DBSM's net asset value, which was ADollars 24m at the end of 1989. Midland stressed that DBSM is a successful business, but the sale was part of its strategy of divesting itself of non-core activities outside Europe. Swiss Bank Corporation said that the acquisition would enable it to expand its international investment banking presence. Midland is combining its French corporate finance activities in a company, Samuel Montagu France, with a capital of FFr2.25m (Pounds 225,027). The activities were previously separated into Samuel Montagu and the Midland Bank.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAFE STREETS  </P> <P> I feel President Bush should be commended for using the military as a police  force in Panama to make the streets safe for people to come out of their homes.  </P> <P> If we (in the U.S.) are going to use the military as a police force (spend  taxpayers dollars) to make streets safe in a foreign country, what about the  streets in America such as Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Detroit, etc? We have  more crime and killings in American cities on a weekend than Panama has in a  year.  </P> <P> It is time we take back the streets and parks of America.  </P> <P> President Bush, we have Noriegas in most cities of America who are also common  criminals and need to be brought to justice.  </P> <P> MILT BURDICK  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

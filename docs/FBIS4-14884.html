			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev  answered a question from our correspondent and gave his  assessment of the Georgian-Abkhaz documents signed today.    [Begin Grachev recording] The fact that Georgia and Abkhazia  have now signed inspires optimism, because the Georgian  leadership has started acknowledging that the Abkhaz leadership  does exist.    But, once again, one can sign as many documents as one  wants,  provided there is enough paper. But the important thing is  practical implementation. I personally have occasionally acted  as a peace-broker at the request of Armenia's and Azerbaijan's  defense ministers, to settle the Karabakh problem. While they  are at the negotiating table, everything looks fine: I bring  them together, they kiss and shake hands, have lunch together --  but when they get back to their countries, everything starts  anew. I have tried three times, and I have told them not to  expect me to do it the fourth time round. After all, I am not a  peace-maker, I am a defense minister. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LATINOS TELL OF RISING NORTH COUNTY HARASSMENT;  </P> <P> MIGRANTS: SOME U.S. TEEN-AGERS HAVE TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO VERBALLY AND  PHYSICALLY ABUSE THE WORKERS AS THEY LOOK FOR DAY JOBS ALONG THE STREETS OF THE  RAPIDLY GROWING AREA.  </P> <P> Incarnacion Gomez Paredes said he has become accustomed to the taunts from  passing motorists who feel an urge to shout racial epithets and occasionally  toss debris at the job-seeking migrant workers who man the early-morning street  corners of northern San Diego County.  </P> <P> "I don't really pay attention," Gomez said early Friday as he and other men  from Mexico gathered in the Rancho Penasquitos area in search of day labor.  </P> <P> Sometimes, though, the harassment, normally a low-level phenomenon, escalates  and cannot be ignored, migrants say.  </P> <P> On Wednesday a group of activists alleged that the migrants, mostly from  Mexico, are increasingly coming under attack from American youths wielding an  array of weapons, from fists and boards to pellet guns and real rifles.  </P> <P> The advocates also reported a rise in assaults by teen-age thieves and gangs  that prey on the immigrant workers in North County, where thousands of mostly  Mexican day laborers live in crude camps, often alongside prosperous suburban  developments.  </P> <P> Among the reported incidents cited in what is characterized as an escalating  pattern of aggression: shootings, beatings, robberies, destruction of property  and verbal harassment.  </P> <P> The immigrant advocates see the violence as an outgrowth of a growing  anti-migrant sentiment in the fast-growing area, where tension between the  migrants and other residents has occasionally erupted.  </P> <P> "Some of these kids see themselves providing a public service by running (the  migrants) out at gunpoint," said Roberto Martinez, border representative in San  Diego for the American Friends Service Committee, the social action arm of the  Quaker Church.  </P> <P> More police patrols are needed in areas frequented by the day laborers, said  the Rev. Rafael V. Martinez, who runs the Encinitas-based North County  Chaplaincy, which works with migrant workers.  </P> <P> "We want authorities to be aware of the seriousness of the problem, and we want  to urge them to take some preventive measures before we have another incident  like the one we had on Black Mountain Road," he said.  </P> <P> On the evening of Nov. 9, two Mexican field hands -- Hilario Castaneda Salgado,  22, and Matilde Macedo de la Sancha, 19 -- were shot to death as they walked  along an isolated stretch of Black Mountain Road in San Diego, which abuts a  number of farm nurseries and migrant camps. Police said the slayings were  racially motivated. On Wednesday, a San Diego teen-ager who authorities say was  the triggerman pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder. An alleged  accomplice is awaiting trial.  </P> <P> Authorities contend that police investigate crimes against migrants, whether  the migrants are in the United States legally or illegally, as thoroughly as  they look into any reported criminal activity.  </P> <P> "I certainly wouldn't tolerate someone harassing anybody, I don't care who they  are," said Capt. Jay Lasuer, who commands the Sheriff's Department substation  in Poway, which provides police protection in the city to the north and east of  San Diego.  </P> <P> Some claim there is a double standard. Roberto Martinez, the church activist,  said a victim of recent pellet-gun shootings -- the projectiles contained paint  -- reported the incident to a deputy in Poway more than a week ago but nothing  was done. (Lasuer said that his office had not been informed of the pellet-gun  incidents until the Wednesday press conference and that authorities now plan to  investigate.)  </P> <P> During the past three weeks, Martinez said, at least seven migrants have been  hit by the paint-filled pellets in the Poway area; most were hit while walking  on streets, he said.  </P> <P> "We're demanding a thorough investigation," Martinez said. "These can no longer  be considered isolated incidents. These kinds of things are probably occurring  somewhere in the county on a daily basis."  </P> <P> The Poway sheriff's office, Martinez noted, acted quickly in April, 1988, when  an American girl reported that she had been raped by a group of migrants. More  than 80 Latinos were detained within 24 hours of the incident; six were held  for up to two months. All charges were ultimately dropped; the six arrestees  have filed a multimillion-dollar wrongful-arrest suit in federal court against  the Sheriff's Department, among others.  </P> <P> Lasuer said crimes against migrants are not reported that frequently in Poway.  He estimated that fewer than 50 have been reported in the past year. In one  recent case, he noted, three white youths were arrested and charged with  robbing an immigrant worker.  </P> <P> Many of the crimes may go unreported, authorities acknowledge, because some  victims are hesitant to come forward. That stems from an inherent distrust of  police -- a feeling imported from Mexico and Central America -- as well as a  fear among the undocumented that they may be turned over to U.S. immigration  authorities.  </P> <P> On Friday, a number of migrants interviewed on street corners in North County  described the harassment as usually non-threatening -- most commonly insults  shouted from a passing vehicle, or sometimes objects tossed from a car. Many  were quick to tell a reporter that they have never had any problems with  Americans; others downplayed the harassment and expressed considerably more  concern about being underpaid or being cheated out of their salaries by  unscrupulous employers.  </P> <P> "Sometimes people yell things at us, but mostly it's in English, and I don't  know what it means," Manuel Aguayo, a 44-year-old native of the Mexican state  of Jalisco, said as he stood in a shopping center near the northern city limits  of San Diego.  </P> <P> Some observers are troubled by the seeming equanimity that the migrants display  toward the verbal harassment.  </P> <P> "They've accepted that they get yelled at; I hope it doesn't come to the point  where they feel it's OK to get beat up, too," said Gina Velazquez, who works  with the immigrant community in North County. She has urged victims to report  crimes.  </P> <P> Ernesto Alvaran, who was also interviewed while looking for work Friday, said  he has never been physically threatened during his four years in the United  States. But he is cautious; during the past year, he has avoided walking in the  dark on isolated roads. He apparently has good reason: He was a good friend of  Matilde Macedo de la Sancha, one of the two Mexican men killed in the November  hate slayings.  </P> <P> Incarnacion Gomez Paredes, 21, said he and two other migrants were robbed at  gunpoint in August by three Americans who had given them a ride and promised  them work -- apparently a ruse. Otherwise, Gomez said, he and others have  become accustomed to verbal abuse, particularly in San Diego.  </P> <P> "I've lived in New York and Canada," said Gomez, who also said he has lived  outside of Mexico for the better part of 13 years, "but San Diego is the most  racist place that I've been. Here, everyone tries to take advantage of you if  you're Mexican."  </P></p>

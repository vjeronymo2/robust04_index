			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Motor adverts criticised THE LATEST report of the Advertising Standards Authority, published yesterday, found particular cause for complaint with the motor industry. The authority upheld complaints received in November against Citroen UK for inaccurately suggesting the superiority of some aspects of a Citroen 1.4-litre Avantage to a Ford Escort 1.4LX. Complaints were upheld against Peugeot Talbot for a claim concerning the environmentally 'clean' nature of diesel engines against conventional petrol engines fitted with catalytic converters, and against Seat UK for a newspaper advertisement that combined a slogan featuring a car costing Pounds 5,444 with a photograph showing a model costing Pounds 8,099. Complaints against BT, Thomas Cook/P&amp;O European Ferries, the Royal Mint and Cardiff Development Corporation - which ran a poster campaign featuring architectural improvements to the Cardiff Bay area that had not yet been built - were also upheld.</p>

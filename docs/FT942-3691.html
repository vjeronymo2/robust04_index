			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Right avenges domestic defeat - Spain Spain's political landscape has changed with the European election results. After almost 12 years in power, Mr Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists have lost their position as the country's leading party. Hit by economic discontent, still rife despite signs that the country is pulling out of recession, and by a series of acutely embarrassing corruption affairs involving former senior officials, the party has slumped to barely 30 per cent of the vote, its level when it was in opposition 15 years ago. Mr Gonzalez said he would consider putting his government to the test in a confidence motion - which it would have to win or face a snap general election. The jubilant street party in Madrid on Sunday night for the conservatives of the Popular party marked revenge after a frustrating failure in general elections a year ago. It was the PP's first victory at national level. Breaking through the 40 per cent mark, it also shattered a psychological barrier - the stigma attached to the right in post-Franco Spain. The PP gained from the demise of the centrists loyal to former prime minister Mr Adolfo Suarez, who lost all five of their European parliament seats. The Socialists' record as the party that took Spain into the EU clearly counted for little. Insofar as European issues had any influence, the PP appears to have scored more through its criticism of the way Spanish interests have been managed in Europe. But even if it translated Sunday's results into a national election victory, the PP would still, like the Socialists, need to look for support from regionalist groups, with the prospect of a potentially unstable relationship. For Mr Jordi Pujol, the Catalan nationalist leader, his policy of providing parliamentary support to keep the Socialists in power appears so far to have paid off. Far from losing votes to the PP, his party headed the ballot in Catalonia, the first time it has done so in a national election. The Socialists took second place to the main regionalist parties in both Catalonia and the Basque country, although in the second case by a narrow margin over the PP. Elsewhere they lost in every region except Extremadura and Andalucia - including former strongholds such as Valencia, Murcia, Castile-La Mancha and the mining area of Asturias. In Andalucia, where regional elections were held at the same time, they lost their majority in the regional parliament and now have little choice there but to rely on support from the Communist-led United Left. In both election contests, it was the United Left that scored proportionately the biggest gains. Socialist hardliners who want to push party policy back towards the left will see the loss of votes to the United Left as reinforcing their arguments.  ------------------------------------------- Population: 39.1m Seats: 64  ------------------------------------------- Results (Turnout 59.6%; 1989, 54.8%)  ------------------------------------------- Party*    Parliament    % vote       Seats             group     '94    '89   '94   '89  ------------------------------------------- PP            EPP    40.2   21.7    28    15 PSOE          PES    30.6   40.2    22    27 IU             NA    13.4    6.2     9     4 CIU       EPP/LDR     4.6    4.3     3     2 CN        EPP/RBW     2.8    1.9     2     1 PEP           RBW     1.2    1.5     0     1 CDS           LDR     0.9    7.2     0     5 HB             NA     0.9    1.7     0     1 IP         Greens       -    1.9     -     1 Capa          RBW     0.7    1.9     0     1 Mateos         NA     0.4    3.9     0     2  ------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Interior  ------------------------------------------- *Abbreviations: Capa = Andalucian; CDS = Democrat and Social Centre; HB = Herri Batasuna; CIU = Convergence and Union; CN = Nationalist Coalition; IP = Regional Left party; IU = United Left; Mateos = Supporters of Ruiz Mateos; PEP = European People's Coalition; PP = Popular Party; PSOE = Socialist Workers' party;  ------------------------------------------- Parliamentary group abbreviations: see bottom front page this section  ------------------------------------------- Electoral system:  ------------------------------------------- Proportional from national lists Compulsory voting: No  ------------------------------------------- MEPs  ------------------------------------------- PSOE  ------------------------------------------- Fernando Moran Lopez, Francisca Sauquillo Perez del Arco, Enrique Baron Crespo, Ludivina Garcia Aria, Josep Verde i Aldea, Ana Clara Maria Miranda de Lage, Pedro Aparicio Sanchez, Jose Maria Mendiluce Pereiro, Manuel Medina Ortega, Maria Izquierdo Rojo, Josep Enrique Pons Grau, Joan Colom i Naval, Juan Luis Colino Salamanca, Carmen Diez de Rivera Icaza, Juan de Dios Izquierdo Colado, Jesus Cabezon Alonso, Barbara Duhrkop Duhrkop, Antonio Gonzalez Trivino, Francisco Javier Sanz Fernandez, Manuela de Frutos Gama, Fernando Perez Royo, Ana Terron i Cusi  ------------------------------------------- CiU  ------------------------------------------- Carles Alfred Gasoliba i Bohm, Concepcio Ferrer i Casals, Joan Maria Vallve i Rivera  ------------------------------------------- PP  ------------------------------------------- Abel Matutes Juan, Celia Villalobos Talero, Mercedes de la Merced Monge, Jose Maria Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, Miguel Arias Canete, Maria Teresa Estevan Bolea, Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo Marfil, Maria Carmen Fraga Estevez, Luis Campoy Zueco, Ana Isabel Palacio Vallelersundi, Carlos Robles Picquer, Juan Manuel Fabra Valles, Gerardo Fernandez Albor, Fernando Fernandez Martin, Jaime Valdivieso de Cue, Encarnacion Redondo Jimenez, Inigo Mendez de Vigo, Javier Areitio Toledo, Joaquin Siso Cruellas, Laura Elena Esteban Martin, Daniel Luis Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, Jose Gerardo Galeote Quecede, Jose Ignacio Salafranca Sanchez-Neyra, Jose Antonio Escudero Lopez, Francisca Bennasar Tous, Jose Luis Valverde Lopez, Salvador Garriga Polledo, Julio Anoveras Trias de Bes  ------------------------------------------- IU  ------------------------------------------- Alonso Puerta Gutierrez, Antoni Gutierrez Diaz, Laura Gonzalez Alvarez, Maria Sornosa Martinez, Maria Jesus Aramburu del Rio, Salvador Jose Peres, Carlos Carnero Gonzalez, Angela del Carmen Sierra Gonzalez, Pedro Marset Campos  ------------------------------------------- CN  ------------------------------------------- Josu Jon Imaz San Miguel, Isidoro Sanchez Garcia  ------------------------------------------- Based on preliminary results issued by the European Parliament.

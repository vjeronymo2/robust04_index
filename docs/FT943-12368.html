			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Imported beers boost market share in Japan  -Heatwave increases sales - but foreigners are benefiting Demand for beer in Japan has surged in recent weeks thanks to a prolonged heatwave. However, officials at the country's leading beer companies are not so sunny, as an increasing number of Japanese consumers are quenching their thirst with imported beer rather than domestic brands. Cheap imported beers are challenging the leading domestic manufacturers which have long dominated the Japanese market. The yen's strength and bulk purchasing power are helping big retail chains offer customers foreign beers at half the price of the domestic brews. Cutting out the middlemen through direct imports from manufacturers has also allowed retailers to lower prices. Foreign beer imports increased fivefold during the first four months of this year, and some analysts expect sales of foreign beers, now 2 per cent of the market, to rise to 4 per cent by the end of this year. Even Daiei, the nation's largest supermarket operator, which triggered the recent boom in imported beer by offering cheap Belgian beer, has been surprised by the popularity. The retailer began selling 330ml cans at Y128 (Dollars 1.29) a can alongside domestic beer at Y220 late last year. It initially expected to sell around 70,000 cases of imported beer this year, but achieved that target in the first month. It now expects to sell 2m cases, thanks to the heatwave, and sees import brands accounting for over half its total beer sales this year. Other discount liquor stores and retail chains have followed suit, and are also experiencing high demand. The widespread discounting of beer comes four years after anti-trust regulations concerning beer pricing were put into place. In 1990, the Fair Trade Commission pushed leading beer companies to advertise in mainstream dailies that retailers and wholesalers were allowed to set their own prices. Some beer company officials, however, regard the recent froth in import beer sales as likely to subside. 'People are attracted to the prices but it doesn't mean that they will continue to store their cupboards with cheap imports,' said Asahi Breweries. Domestic brewers still regard the taste of their own brands as superior to that of imports and so far, while prices of foreign brands have been reduced, domestic beer prices have not been discounted aggressively. But analysts point out that this will change soon. 'It's a crack that will lead to the dam's downfall,' says Mr Paul Heaton, retail analyst at brokers Baring Securities in Tokyo. He expects the domestic beer companies will need to start rationalising their complicated distribution system to reduce costs and maintain their market share.</p>

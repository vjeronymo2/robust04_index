			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Xiaosi (7115 1420 0934) and Wan Laiyou </F> (8001 0171 0645), affiliated with the Huanggang branch of the  PBOC in Hubei Province: "Five Issues Regarding State Bond System  Reform"]    [Text] State bonds (national treasury bonds) are a national  liability based on the credit principle obtained through  borrowing from domestic citizens and units in the form of bond  sales. While China's resumption of state bond sales in 1981 has  raised a lot of funds for the state, playing an important role  in supplementing fiscal deficits, supporting economic  development, and balancing revenues with expenditures, our state  bond system went into effect rather late, so that it still  contains certain practical and theoretical issues and weak links  that are in urgent need of study and resolution.  <H5>  An Appropriate State Bond Sales Volume </H5>   The sale of state bonds certainly does not directly increase  the overall amount of social funds, rather only temporarily  changing the flow of some social funds, shifting financial  resources not under government control to government control,  and making it essentially a redistribution of social funds. So  premised on a set overall amount of social funds, state bonds  should be sold in a rational volume, which if too low could not  ease our current fiscal problems, and if too high might create  repayment problems for state revenue. China's state bond sales  are now too arbitrary and high in volume. In the decade from  1981 through 1990 alone, China's state bond sales volume grew at  an average rate of 25.86 percent a year, exceeding our average  state revenue growth rate of 15.09 percent a year, and far  surpassing our average social gross output value growth rate of  16.22 percent a year, making it out of line with our economic  growth. Since 1988, we have repeatedly postponed the repayment  of capital with interest on matured state bonds purchased by  units, leaving our debt burden growing larger each year.  Meanwhile, as our national balance of revenue and expenditure  has seen constant deficits in recent years, these excessive bond  sales have affected our repayment capability and our national  prestige. So the setting of a state bond sales volume should  arouse much attention.    Based on the experiences of advanced nations throughout the  world combined with China's realities, our state bond sales  volume should be subject to the following three limiting  factors: 1) Our national economy's growth rates. Our state  bond sales volume growth should be consistent with that of our  social gross product, national income, and revenues, with this  optimum-balance effect being used to determine whether sales  volume is appropriate. 2) Our debt subject's operating  capability. As our state bond debt subject is the government,  this means that we must first learn the overall amount of  government debt, on which basis to calculate the ratio scale of  overall debt to the state's tangible funds and capital. 3)  Social sustainability. Our state bond sales scale must consider  social sustainability, including funding, material, and social  sustainability. Based on China's existing debt burden and  possible state revenue sustainability, China's annual state bond  sales volume in recent years should have made up about 10  percent of the year's fiscal spending.  <H5>  Manipulating Our State Bond Sales Term Structure </H5>   State bond sales terms come in long, medium, and short, with  the ratio of long-, medium-, and short-term state bonds to state  bond sales or accumulated overall volume being called the state  bond term structure, which directly determines the length of the  state's period of use of state bond revenue. All social funds,  when idle, also come in long-, medium-, and short-term. While  state bonds, as an effective means of attracting funds, should  also be adapted to this feature, with a diversified  term-structure policy, since China resumed state bond sales in  1981, they have been generally limited to only medium-term ones  in the three grades of five to nine years, three years, and two  years, meaning that we obviously lack long- and short-term state  bonds. This irrational state bond term structure is a minus for  the state on one hand, creating bond-repayment peaks, and even  higher bond repayments than the year's bond sales, sapping the  significance for the state of selling state bonds in the first  place; on the other, it is also unsuited to a diversified social  fund structure, making it hard to meet the needs of all  purchasers. So, in order to suit our state bond sales term  structure to China's national conditions, we should consider the  following two aspects: 1) State bond term adjustment  flexibility. In selling state bonds to raise funds, while  medium- and long-term state bonds are naturally better,  short-term ones are also indispensable, with the three types  generally needing to be compatible. If it is said that the  impact of selling medium- and long-term state bonds is to  achieve revenue balance for the whole budget year, then selling  short-term ones can make up for the various seasonal revenue  differences within the year. More state bond categories with  better options is undoubtedly attractive to investors, not only  promoting state bond sales success, but also being a great plus  in raising the use efficiency of treasury funds. 2. State bond  category proportion-determination rationality. A) State bond  sales terms ought to be suited to the needs of economic  conditions. During economic depressions, we should expand as  much as possible our sales of short-term state bonds that are  economically expansionary. But during periods of inflation, we  must increase as much as possible our sales of medium-and  long-term state bonds that have a deflationary impact on the  economy. B) State bond interest costs should be minimized. When  money market interest rates are higher, we should sell more  short-term state bonds; and when they are lower, we should  appropriately sell more medium- and long-term ones. C) During  state bond redemption peaks, we should sell short-term state  bonds to repay old debts with new ones. At other times, we  should sell medium- and long-term ones to postpone such peaks.  <H5>  Our Choice of State Bond Sales Method </H5>   Our decade of state bond sales shows that almost all of  China's state bond sales use the method of administrative  apportionment, with mostly organized sales promotions through  the diversified channels of banks, state revenue, and post  offices, supplemented with free subscription by individuals.  While this sales method was objectively more effective and  practical under the market conditions of the time, both ensuring  state bond sales success, and raising public awareness about  securities investment, it severely violated the autonomy  principle of financial asset transactions. For purchasers,  mandated apportionment meant fiscal weakness and state credit  crisis, thus shaking investor confidence in state bonds. On the  other hand, setting subscription amounts based on employee wages  did not consider differences in employee subsistence burdens and  investor's inclinations. In light of China's national  conditions, while continuing to employ administrative means, we  should gradually try out economic ones, by expanding financing  channels, and practicing comprehensive sales promotion methods,  in order to pave the way for a gradual transition to economic  means. This could be done by instituting a policy of free  investment choice, to evolve a contract relationship between the  state and investors based on creditor-liability relations, thus  changing the state bond apportionment sales method, to change  direct sales by state revenue to an indirect method of  competitive group bidding for exclusive selling rights. That is,  we would first sell state bonds through the method of  competitive bidding by purchasing groups for exclusive sales  rights, which would then sell them directly on markets in the  form of voluntary transactions. The greatest plus of this method  is that it would bring market forces to state bond sales. The  state's first purchase of exclusive treasury bill selling rights  by financial institutions in 1991 was a valuable try at this.  <H5>  Setting Rational State Bond Sales Interest Rates </H5>   While interest rates are a key means of leverage for  regulating bond market capital flow and volume, China's use of  this method still contains certain problems. 1) It is  overcentralized, with the authority to set and adjust interest  rates completely controlled by the revenue sector, leaving  markets with no leeway for spontaneous adjustment. 2) There is  only one category, with unit and individual subscriptions,  without regard for amounts or terms, all at a uniform price. 3)  It has remained unchanged for too long, with state bond interest  rates, once set, remaining unchanged for years. Thus, in order  both to lower sales costs to lighten fiscal burdens and to  complete bond sales promptly, we must pay attention to setting  rational state bond interest rates, with the right criteria for  setting them having a great impact on state bond efficiency and  competitiveness. Generally, state bond interest rates should be  set based on the following three considerations: 1) State bond  interest rates must move in the same direction as money market  ones. When setting state bond interest rates, we need to  reference money market interest rates and project interest rate  changes during state bond sale terms, in order to keep interest  rate fluctuations moving in the same direction for both state  bonds and money markets. 2) We need to combine fixed with  floating interest rates. As short-term bond sales generally  adapt to money market interest rate changes, they should use the  fixed interest rate method. But as medium- and long-term bonds  do not adapt well to money market interest rate changes due to  their longer terms, they should use the floating interest rate  method. That is, based on money market interest rates for the  term of issue, fixed interest rates based on average market  rates, and floating interest rates in consideration of  investment stimulus and rational cost burdens, should be  combined to make up the year's state bond sales interest rates.  In successive years, as money market interest rates change and  are affected by domestic policies, the fixed interest rates will  remain constant, while the floating ones can rise or fall with  the markets. This will enable state bond investors to both  ensure their capital and make their anticipated and nominal  compensation consistent, while reducing cost spending for the  state. 3. The setting of state bond interest rates must also  consider national economic policy needs. State bond sale  interest rate control needs to be coordinated with government  economic reforms during various periods. When the state is  tightening money, state bond interest rates need to be  appropriately higher; and when the state is expanding credit,  its bond interest rates should be relatively lower.  <H5>  The Choice of State Bond Repayment Methods </H5>   The state generally has three debt discharge methods; i.e.,  direct repayment, market transaction, and paying old debts with  new ones. At various times and under varying economic  conditions, the debt discharge method also varies. In light of  China's state bond market status quo, it would be rational for  us to use in the short-term a mixture of the two methods of  direct repayment and payment of old debts with new ones. 1. In  the direct repayment method, the state repays bonds as they  mature in lump sums or payments. It requires the state to have a  stronger discharge capability, with more abundant discharge fund  sources. China's immediate fiscal condition is that revenues are  growing slowly on one hand, while spending is pressing on. If we  had maintained our state bond scale of 1989 for the two years of  1991 and 1992, we would not only have had to use all bond  revenue to repay capital with interest, but we would also have  had to take some revenue each year from our routine budget to  make up the difference. As this would make fiscal balance  difficult for the year, this method should now be applied only  to the redemption of mature individual bonds. 2) In the method  of paying old debts with new ones, we turn old bonds, where the  government sale of bonds under varying terms and economic  climates touched off bond type, repayment deadline, and payment  method chaos, into new bonds in set percentages, as well as  restudying bond terms and interest rates, in order to postpone  the average bond repayment deadline. Since 1990, the state has  used this redemption method. Under China's current bond  structure status quo, this is a feasible way of solving state  bond repayment problems during repayment peaks. This not only  enables the state to acquire some repayment fund sources, but  also adjusts old debt repayment terms to coordinate them with  new state bond sale repayment terms, for a rational disposition  and even distribution, to promote normal state bond sales. Of  course, this method can be regarded as only a special means for  one-time use and, in consideration of the political factor, can  be used only for unit-purchased mature bonds.</p>

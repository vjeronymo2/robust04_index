			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICY DISPUTE ON GORBACHEV'S REFORMS GOES PUBLIC;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: THE ADMINISTRATION IS STRUGGLING TO CONCEAL DOUBTS THAT PERESTROIKA  WILL SUCCEED.  </P> <P> A long-simmering dispute within the Bush Administration over how to deal with  the Soviet reform effort erupted Friday as the White House confirmed that  Secretary of State James A. Baker III had killed a pessimistic speech about  perestroika that a senior White House official had planned.  </P> <P> At the center of the dispute, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater  said, are differing views over whether Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev can  succeed with perestroika, or restructuring of Soviet society.  </P> <P> "There are opinions all over the lot" on that issue, Fitzwater said. "The  policy is clear about our wanting to support glasnost (openness) and  perestroika," he added, but officials have "widely varying differences" over  the "durability" of Gorbachev's reform plan.  </P> <P> Taken at face value, Fitzwater's remarks suggest that Baker is more optimistic  about Gorbachev's chances for success than is the official whose speech he  quashed -- Robert M. Gates, the President's deputy national security adviser.  </P> <P> The reality, however, may be more complex: According to some sources, Baker's  objection to the proposed Gates speech was that it represented a public  expression of no confidence in Gorbachev at a time when U.S. policy is to  support his reform efforts.  </P> <P> "The concern was that a down-beat analysis about the prospects would have  looked like we're assuming Gorbachev is doomed and we're planning accordingly,"  said one official. "No one assumes he faces favorable odds, but we're out to  advance U.S. interests, whoever is in charge there, not discuss Gorbachev's  survivability prospects."  </P> <P> The Administration's public view of perestroika's chances has important  political implications at this time, several officials said.  </P> <P> Recently, the Administration has been under fire from Democrats for being too  timid and unimaginative in responding to the Gorbachev revolution. Baker helped  sidetrack those allegations with two speeches on U.S.-Soviet relations that  were clearly upbeat in their outlook, emphasizing opportunities for potential  progress. But a new, negative evaluation could have fueled more charges that  the Administration speaks with two voices on Soviet policy.  </P> <P> "The White House was sensitive to this matter, too," said one senior official.  "That's why they sent it (Gates' speech text) around" for State Department  comments.  </P> <P> Fitzwater, responding to a New York Times report Friday on Baker's blocking of  the speech, said that the question of perestroika's chances is one of  "analysis, of interpretation of events that the State Department felt better  left unsaid at this point."  </P> <P> In his public comments on perestroika, Baker has not addressed directly whether  he believes the reforms will succeed or fail. He deflects such questions by  saying that only the Soviets can make the reforms work and that their success  is in the U.S. interest.  </P> <P> Gates, a former deputy director of the CIA, has long taken a skeptical view.  The speech he planned to deliver to the National Collegiate Security Conference  in Bethesda, Md., was understood to focus more on the obstacles to reform, such  as the labor strikes and nationality conflicts in the Soviet Union, than on its  limited successes.  </P> <P> The conflict over the speech was the most open airing to date of foreign policy  disagreements within the Administration. It was a major departure from the  Administration's usual approach, which strongly discourages public discussion  of such disputes.  </P> <P> Officials confirmed that National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, in  particular, was upset by the public squabble, in which he was forced to mediate  between his chief deputy and Baker.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the State Department issued a 64-page report accusing the Soviet  Union of maintaining its propaganda and "disinformation" programs aimed at the  United States despite the relaxation of tensions between the superpowers. The  report displayed a Cold War tone that has been notably absent from Baker's  recent speeches.  </P> <P> The report said Moscow last year ended a three-year-old effort to convince the  world that the AIDS epidemic was the product of a bungled U.S. germ-warfare  program. But the State Department said the Soviets were behind a rumor campaign  this year claiming that U.S. hospitals were bringing Latin American orphans to  the United States for use as organ donors for transplants.  </P> <P> The report also asserts that Moscow has used forged letters and bogus books to  spread stories intended to damage U.S. policies. It said Moscow relies on  Soviet employees of the United Nations to perform propaganda and intelligence  work. "Approximately one-fourth of the Soviets in the U.N. secretariat are  intelligence officers," the report said.  </P> <P> Toth reported from Washington and Lauter from San Jose, Costa Rica.

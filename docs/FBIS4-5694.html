			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Letter" to South Korean authorities, political parties, </F> individual figures, and overseas compatriots adopted at a joint  meeting of DPRK Government, political parties, social  organizations held in Pyongyang on 11 April]    [Text] The letter to South Korean authorities, political  parties, individual figures, and overseas compatriots reads:    Compatriots at home and abroad:    Today, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the  publication of the 10-point program of the great unity of the  whole nation for the reunification of the fatherland presented  by respected and beloved Comrade President Kim Il-song, we held  a joint meeting of the republic's government, political parties,  and social organizations to seriously discuss [chinjihage toui]  measures for promoting the fatherland's independent and peaceful  reunification by thoroughly implementing the 10-point program of  the great unity of the whole nation.    We participants in the joint meeting send this letter to  South Korean authorities, political parties, individual figures,  and overseas compatriots from a sheer desire to jointly open the  nation's way [chillo] with the strength of the united 70 million  compatriots under the grave situation in which the nation's  well-being [annyong] and the country's reunification cause are  faced with a severe threat [omjunghi wihyop tanghago innun].    It is the 70 million compatriots' firm will and a solemn  request by the national history to realize reunification in the  nineties by achieving the great unity of the whole nation.    Today, when the 49th annual layer is being added to the  history of national division, what is coming closer to our  people is not the reunification of the country, but the danger  of war, nuclear war.    War would only bring a disaster to both the North and the  South, giving no advantage to either side. It is too late to  regard war, which is coming closer to the people, as just a  danger, and we have no time to only worry about the situation  without doing nothing.    Today's grave situation was derived by the nuclear commotion  by outside forces and the bellicose forces following them, and  has reached a more dangerous phase because of their worthless  maneuver of stepping it up gradually [mumohan kyedansik hwaktae  chaektong].    We presented the 10-point program of the great unity of the  whole nation, a milestone of reconciliation and unity, in April  1993 to prevent the creation of this situation and have made all  sincere efforts to realize the program.    The danger of war, which will make outside forces gain the  third party's profit and will result in the ruin of the whole  nation, would not have come to our country if the South Korean  authorities had responded to [houng] our program of the great  national unity and held our hands, their fellow countrymen.    All compatriots cannot forget the bitter historic lesson  from  illustrious officials of our country who brought the ruin of the  country by betraying fellow countrymen to collude with outside  forces in the past. The South Korean authorities, however, are  going to revive [chaehyon] the history. This is intolerable.    We must prevent war, a national disaster, in any way. The  way to prevent it can be seen only in achieving the great unity  of the whole nation. The great unity of the whole nation is  indeed the best way [kajang hullyunghan chillo] of the nation,  which enables us to break through today's difficult situation,  to maintain peace of the country, and to open the road to the  fatherland's reunification.    The 10-point program of great unity of the whole country  for national reunification put forward by the respected  President Kim Il-song shows such an excellent solution for our  fellow countrymen.    With its great tractive force and just and fair nature, the  10-point program of great unity of the whole country is enjoying  more active support and sympathy from all Korean compatriots  with each passing day.    There is no reason that one cannot support the program  today,  which is being supported by all Korean compatriots in the North,  the South, and overseas, even if one ignored it in the past.    The position toward the 10-point program of great unity of  the whole country will be a touchstone distinguishing between  unity and confrontation in our country, between peace and war,  and between reunification and division.    Today when the danger of war--the nuclear war--is near at  hand before the nation, if one denies the great unity of the  country by presenting differences in ideologies, ideals, and  systems, it will be a grave antinational crime of seeking  confrontation, war, and division.    The 10-point program of great unity of the whole country is  a  common national guideline and chapter which gives unity, peace,  and reunification to our people. Proceeding from the desire to  achieve this program, we earnestly propose that a national  conference be held in Pyongyang or Seoul on the occasion of the  15 August national liberation anniversary this year, one year  before its 50th anniversary.    Representatives of the authorities, political parties, and  public organizations, as well as individual figures, in the  North and the South, who can reflect the will of the whole  country in conformity with the nature and purpose of the  conference, as well as representatives of overseas compatriots,  can participate in the national meeting with equal standings,  irrespective of differences in their political views, religion,  affiliated organizations, and positions.    The national conference can frankly discuss various issues  for the nation's peace and reunification, including practical  measures to promote great unity of the whole country.    If the national conference is convened, the people and  figures from all walks of life in the North and the South,  opening up their hearts, can confirm that they are the same  people who share the same blood, and can promote great unity.  Thus, they can seek a shortcut for expeditiously achieving  reunification in the nineties by uniting the nation's wisdom and  will and by transcending differences in ideologies, ideals,  political views, and religion.    With a view to successfully ensuring the national  conference,  we recognize that formation of a preparatory committee for the  national conference, made up of five representatives  respectively from the North, the South and overseas, is  necessary.    The preparatory committee for the national conference can  hold its first meeting in Pyongyang or Seoul in May; can decide  on the date and place of the national meeting, as well as the  method of the meeting; and can discuss other working-level  matters concerning convocation and operation of the conference.    We also believe it is good to have bilateral and  multilateral  contacts between compatriots in the North, the South, and  overseas in order to adjust their opinions before convocation of  the historic national conference.    We express the hope that the compatriots in the South and  overseas will actively respond to our proposal for convening the  national conference, which proceeded from a position of lofty  patriotism.    [Signed] The joint conference of the government, political  parties, and public organizations in the DPRK for expediting the  independent and peaceful reunification of the nation by  thoroughly accomplishing the 10-point program of great unity of  the whole country for national reunification.    [Date] 11 April 1994, Pyongyang</p>

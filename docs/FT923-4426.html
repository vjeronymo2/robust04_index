			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Letter: Uneven pattern in pay restraint by top directors Sir, Your report on a recent study by PIRC on the pay of top directors in the FT-SE 100 companies ('Salary restraint hits top earners', September 2) suggested that the average pay rise for the best-paid director in 94 of the companies was 2 per cent for companies reporting in the past 12 months. While our research supports the conclusion that companies have exercised commendable restraints, our analysis of pay increases in the annual reports of some 90 FT-SE 100 companies shows somewhat higher figures. A quarter of the companies reported a reduction in the earnings of best-paid directors, the biggest reduction being 22 per cent. The median increase, when the percentage increases are ranked in order of magnitude, was 8.5 per cent. A quarter received increases of 22 per cent or more. It should be noted that decisions on base pay increases now being reported in company accounts were often made as long ago as October 1990, when average earnings were rising at around 9 per cent to 10 per cent. At that time we were encouraged to believe the recession would be short term. Our figures show that bonuses are removed when performance deteriorates. We should also be encouraged that, in spite of the recession, some companies continue to make good profits and can justify high bonuses.

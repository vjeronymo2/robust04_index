			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ST. PAUL BANS PLASTIC PACKAGING  </P> <P> The City Council approved an ordinance today that would ban plastic packaging,  despite an effort in the Legislature to block the local restriction.  </P> <P> Council Member Thomas Dimond said community concern about the city's waste  disposal problems led to the 6-1 vote. "When you see that groundswell, we're  certainly headed in the right direction," he said.  </P> <P> The council voted to ban non-degradable, non-returnable, non-recyclable  packaging. The local ordinance, identical to one approved last month in the  twin city of Minneapolis, would become effective in July, 1990.  </P> <P> A state Senate Tax Committee refused Tuesday to remove from a recycling bill a  provision that would block such local plastics bans.  </P></p>

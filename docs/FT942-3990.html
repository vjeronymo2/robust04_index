			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Travel: Do not miss Marple, an old Spaghetti Junction - The Manchester canal network is a cascade of inventiveness on a scale not seen in Britain since the Romans left Had Steven Spielberg lived in England 200 years ago, he might have been a canal builder. These people used wit, technology and imagination to build transport systems that - judged by what had gone before - must have seemed out of this world. The thought hits you as you stroll along a remarkable stretch of inland waterway near Marple, a small town on the south-eastern edge of Manchester's urban sprawl, sited just as the land climbs towards the Pennines. There is nothing elegant or notable about Marple, the birthplace of dramatist Christopher Isherwood. Or so you think until you encounter, near an undistinguished shopping centre, the meeting place, 500ft above sea level, of three important lengths of canal constructed during the industrial revolution. Curving south-east from Marple is the upper branch of the Peak Forest Canal connecting with the limestone quarries near Buxworth, Derbyshire, four miles away. The second length is the lower branch of the same canal stretching north through the Manchester conurbation, while leading off to the south-west is the Macclesfield Canal linking, eventually, with Stoke-on-Trent and the Midlands. In the early 19th century, when the canal system was at its busiest, Marple must have taken on the character of a watery Spaghetti Junction. Today, with holiday barges constituting the main traffic, the town's canal area is quietly picturesque. From Marple, an attractive walk runs along the towpath of the northern branch of the Peak Forest canal, past an impressive sequence of 16 locks that brings the water down 200ft through a horizontal distance of about a mile. A little after this is the famous Marple aqueduct, built, like the rest of the Peak Forest system, by Benjamin Outram, who also operated an ironworks in Derbyshire. The aqueduct is a test for anyone with vertigo. It takes the canal and towpath across three arches spanning a gorge above the River Goyt 100ft below. Notable features are the three circular 'shoulders' pierced above each arch which reduce the weight of the structure and add decoration. A similarly pleasant touch is the use of two different colours of gritstone, yellow and pink, in the upper part of the aqueduct. After the aqueduct, the route takes you past the occasional mill building through a wooded, semi-rural setting before the canal hits Romily. Here, next to the watercourse, you can buy a home-cooked hot meal amazingly cheaply at the unpretentious Bridge Cafe. Marple is one stop on a 100-mile network of canals around Manchester mainly built in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in a cascade of inventiveness that ended a 1,500-year blight in transport planning. With railways only a gleam in the eye and most roads little better than dirt tracks, nothing like the canals had been seen since the Romans left. The canal building, which reached a peak in the 1790s, was driven by a strong economic imperative: the need for reliable transport systems to ferry the goods turned out by the world's first large-scale factories. Today, the Manchester network, known as the 'Cheshire ring', is largely intact. It sketches out a rough triangle, linking Manchester in the north, Hardings Wood near Congleton in the south, and Runcorn in the west. In hillier parts of the region, the watercourses reduce the need for locks by following contours, so that on maps they are barely distinguishable from rivers. While canal aficionados might insist on hiring a boat to explore the system, most people will probably not want to go to this trouble. Anyhow, walking along discrete parts of the network gives you a better idea as to how the canals fit into their localities. Anyone interested in the ring will probably want to spend some time in the centre of Manchester, where public and private money has financed the cleaning of a large section of waterway, including parts of the Bridgewater, Rochdale and Ashton canals. The remains of the Castlefields Roman fort near the new G-Mex exhibition centre may look a little spoiled - and are very hard to make sense of - but on the whole the area adds up to an impressive example of urban regeneration. Particularly recommended is a one-mile walk along the Rochdale canal through central Manchester. Taking in a sequence of warehouses and lock keepers' cottages, it gives an inside-out view to the city which cannot have changed much over two centuries. Slightly further to the west is Britain's first length of modern man-made waterway. A section of the Bridgewater canal, it was opened in 1761 and connected the coal mines at Worsley, owned by the young Duke of Bridgewater, to Manchester's city centre. The construction expertise came from the engineer James Brindley and the surveyor John Gilbert. Anyone wanting something more rural will probably head for the 20-mile section of the Bridgewater canal further south, including the route through pleasant countryside around Dunham and Lymm. Ancient Lymm, virtually sliced in half by the canal, which cuts through the town square, is especially worth a visit. Pleasant modern houses have their gardens gently extending to the canal bank, and some old canal buildings have been converted to a cruising club. A little further to the west, the late 20th century intrudes. A massive bridge takes the M6 motorway over the Bridgewater canal, the River Mersey, the Manchester ship canal and the A56 road. Unless you are really interested in concrete technology, you will turn around and head for home.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 31 (CTK) -- The Czech Army does not as  yet have any official contacts with Chile as regards possible  cooperation, Defence Minister Antonin Baudys told CTK today. He  said that with its security in mind, the Czech Republic had to  cooperate not only with its neighbours, but with countries where  possible cooperation was of both a military and industrial  nature, such as Israel, China and other countries.    The Czech Defence Ministry had as yet not even considered  the  thought of possible cooperation with Chile, he said, adding that  it was not planning to meet with former dictator Augusto  Pinochet, now head of the Chilean ground forces, who arrived in  Prague yesterday. Baudys stressed that the visit was private.  Baudys was unable to say if the Czech Republic had exported any  arms to Chile since 1989.</p>

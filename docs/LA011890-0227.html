			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CZECH PREMIER LEAVES PARTY IN BLOW TO COMMUNIST PRESTIGE  </P> <P> Premier Marian Calfa resigned from the Communist Party today, thus becoming the  first non-Communist head of government in Czechoslovakia in 41 years, the  official CTK news agency said.  </P> <P> Calfa, who announced his decision at a news conference, was the third Communist  member of the Cabinet to quit the party in less than two weeks.  </P> <P> Only seven Communists now remain in the 21-member Cabinet.  </P> <P> No explanation for the move was given.  </P> <P> Calfa's resignation was seen as yet another blow to the prestige of the once  all-powerful Communist Party. More than 200,000 of its 1.7 million members have  quit the party since the former hard-line leadership was swept from power by  massive pro-democracy demonstrations in November.  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia now joins Poland and Romania as the only East Bloc countries  with a non-Communist head of government.  </P></p>

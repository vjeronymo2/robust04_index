			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Zedillo faces fallout from Mexican row Mexico's opposition has demanded that a cabinet minister be investigated for using public funds to support Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the governing party's presidential candidate, in what may be the first test of the government's willingness to abide by new electoral laws that outlaw such activity. The opposition demand follows reports that Mr Carlos Hank Gonzalez, the agriculture minister, arranged the publication of a newspaper advertisement in which 57 current and former ministers expressed their support for Mr Zedillo. The advertisement, which was published on April 12, has been much criticised, in part because signatories included ambassadors and a supposedly non-partisan electoral official. The accusation - backed by a photocopy of a letter to the 57 signatories, signed by Mr Hank Gonzalez's private secretary - is that the agricultural minister used official telephones, faxes and secretarial time in rallying support for Mr Zedillo. Mexico's new electoral law forbids such activities, and punishment could include a prison sentence. The opposition demand is particularly embarrassing for Mr Zedillo, as Mr Hank Gonzalez is his most powerful ally among the party's old guard. If any action was taken against Mr Hank Gonzalez the fragile coalition in the Institutional Revolutionary party that supports Mr Zedillo would come under strain. In an interview Mr Zedillo was defensive. 'It is not proved. A photocopy of something is not proof in either this country (or) yours,' he said. The PRI has also been criticised for apparently backing down on its promise to publish its spending in the election campaign. Mr Zedillo said last week he would inform the public just once of the spending in his campaign before August's election, and refused to disclose how much the governing party had spent to date.</p>

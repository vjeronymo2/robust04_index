			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of the work report of the Heilongjiang </F> Provincial People's Procuratorate made by Yu Wanling, chief  procurator of the provincial people's procuratorate, at the  second session of the eighth provincial people's congress--date  not given]    [Text] Fellow deputies:    Now, I am going to deliver a report on the 1993 work  situation of the procuratorial organs across the province and  the 1994 work arrangements to the session for examinations.  <H5>  1. The Basic Procuratorial Work Situation in 1993 </H5>   Under the leadership of the supreme procuratorate and the  provincial party committee, under the supervision of the  people's congress standing committees at various levels, and  with the support of the governments, in 1993, the procuratorial  organs at various levels conscientiously implemented the  guidelines of the 14th party congress, the third plenary session  of the 14th party Central Committee, the party Central  Committee's instructions on waging the anticorruption struggle,  and the resolutions on the work report of the provincial  procuratorate as adopted at the first session of the eighth  provincial people's congress; positively engaged themselves in  the anticorruption struggle; dealt strict blows to the corrosive  elements who were indulged in corruption and malpractice and  serious criminal offenders; strengthened the self-construction  of the procurator contingents; better fulfilled the  anticorruption tasks; and made new progress in the procuratorial  work in other aspects.    A. Major Achievements in Procuratorial Work    a. The procuratorial organs sternly punished the economic  criminals, including those engaged in corruption and bribery;  and forcefully promoted the deep progress of the anticorruption  struggle. The procuratorial organs across the province accepted  and handled 6,039 economic cases of various categories, put  3,777 cases on file, and investigated and concluded 3,478 cases  or 82.2 percent. A total of 95.448 million yuan of economic  losses were retrieved, an increase of 33,588,600 yuan over the  previous year.    We resolutely implemented the party Central Committee's  unified arrangement for waging the anticorruption struggle;  constantly focused our efforts on investigating and handling  cases of corruption and bribery, the criminal cases of four  major departments, and major and appalling cases; and made  noticeable achievements. Of the economic criminal cases that  were put on file for investigation, 1,877 were cases of  corruption and bribery, accounting for 49.69 percent of the  total. A total of 1,818 cases each involving 10,000 yuan or  more were put on file for investigation, an increase of 46.97  percent. Of this, nine were extraordinarily serious cases each  involving more than 1 million yuan (six were cases of diverting  public funds for other use and three were cases of corruption.)  Sixty-three cases involving the cadres at or above the county  and section level were put on file for investigation (three were  cases involving the cadres at or above the department level), an  increase of 57.5 percent over the previous year. A total of 158  criminal cases involving the four key departments were put on  file for investigation.    We conscientiously implemented the central policy decision  on  strengthening the macroeconomic regulation and control and  consolidating the financial order and dealt strict blows to the  economic criminal offenders who disturbed and damaged the  socialist market economic order. A total of 700 cases of tax  evasion and tax resistance were put on file for investigation  and 14,851,900 yuan of evaded taxes were withdrawn. Seventy-six  cases of fake trademarks were placed on file for investigation,  an increase of 22.58 percent over the previous year. A total of  1,058 cases of diverting public funds for other uses were placed  on file for investigation, an increase of 15.13 percent over the  previous year. Sixty-two economic criminal cases of corruption,  bribery, and diverting public funds for other uses were exposed  on the monetary front and were placed on file for investigation.  Simultaneously, we also paid attention to exposing some  new-typed economic criminal activities. Simultaneously, we  investigated and handled a number of cases of manufacturing and  marketing fake and low-quality commodities, gaining export  drawback by cheating, using public funds to "engage in stock  speculation," and gaining huge property of unknown origin.    After the central authorities arranged the anticorruption  struggle, the procuratorial organs at various levels across the  province strengthened the dynamics of attacking the economic  criminal activities of corruption and bribery and made  contributions to opposing the corruption. The number of cases  that had been handled increased rapidly. From September to  December, 1,436 economic criminal cases of various categories  were placed on file for investigation, equal to 61.34 percent of  the total figures in the previous eight months. Of this, 724  were cases each involving over 10,000 yuan, equal to 66.18  percent of the total figures in the previous eight months.  Thirty-three cases were cases involving the cadres at or above  the county and section level, equal to 110 percent of the total  figures in the previous eight months. The procuratorial organs  timely brought suits against and punished a number of corrosive  elements. From September to December, the procuratorial organs  brought actions against 351 economic criminals, equal to 36.79  percent of the total figures in the previous eight months.    b. The procuratorial organs dealt strict blows to serious  criminal activities and continued to maintain the prestige and  effect of "strict blows." The procuratorial organs across the  province accepted the reports on arresting 22,424 criminals and  approved the arrest of 19,333 persons through examinations. We  accepted the reports on bringing and canceling suits against  28,030 persons and brought suits against 19,273 persons through  examinations.    We prominently dealt blows to serious activities;  persistently got involved in advance; resolutely dealt blows to  the violent criminal cases that seriously jeopardized social  order and the lives and property of the people, habitual  offenders, recidivist, and gangs of criminals with underworld  nature. A total of 7,233 serious and extraordinarily serious  criminals were arrested throughout the province and suits were  brought against 4,380 persons. Cases relating to 6,703 persons  were investigated before approvals for arrests and prosecution,  accounting for 55.57 percent of the total serious and  extraordinarily serious cases.    We positively participated in such special struggles as  "spring offensive," "100-day fortified battle," "antithefts,"  and encirclement and elimination of "train marauding and  waylaying." The procuratorial organs conscientiously implemented  various overall examination measures and brought into play their  roles in safeguarding the stability of social order.    We strengthened investigation, judgment, and supervision;  timely set forth opinions on correcting such unlawful situations  as not investigating the crimes and substituting fines for  penalty; and protested, according to laws, the activities of  leniently sentencing those who were guilty of serious crimes and  pronouncing criminals not guilty. Decisions on not arresting  1,731 persons and not bringing actions against 197 criminals  were made. Corrections were made on the decisions that 162  persons should have been arrested and suits should have been  brought against 109 persons. The procuratorial organs protested  48 cases that had been judged wrongly.    c. We further strengthened the examinations of the  enforcement of laws and disciplines. The procuratorial organs  across the province accepted 1,847 cases of violating laws and  disciplines; and placed 978 cases on file for investigations,  including 149 major and extraordinarily serious cases and  showing an increase of 21.14 percent over the previous year. A  total of 923 cases or 84.9 percent were concluded.    With the focus on investigating and handling cases of "five  categories" and by regarding the cases of engaging in  malpractice to seek private gains as the most serious cases,  last year, we made the best achievements in history. A total of  852 cases of engaging in malpractice to seek private gains,  exacting confession by means of torture, unlawfully taking into  custody, neglecting duties, and creating accidents due to  negligence were placed on file for investigations, accounting  for 87.12 percent of the total cases that had been placed on  file and showing an increase of 6.54 percentage point over the  previous year. Of this, 26 were cases of seeking private gains  by ill means, an increase of 62.5 percent over the previous year.    By eliminating interference and obstacles, we cracked a  group  of criminal cases relating to security and judicial personnel  that the masses had strong complaints about. A total of 148  cases were placed on file, an increase of 64.44 percent over the  previous year.    d. The supervision over the work of jails was strengthened.  Various jails were supervised according to laws. A total of  3,654 unlawful cases that took place in reformatories were  corrected, and the correction rate reached 81.4 percent. Of  this, we corrected 128 cases of illegally reducing penalty and  unlawfully releasing on probation, 59 cases of relieving  reform-through-education sentences and reducing set terms of  sentences, 43 cases of seeking medical advice on bail, and more  than 10 cases of wantonly collecting charges. We concentrated  efforts to solve the problems that criminals were still detained  after completion of their fixed terms of imprisonment; 1,639 of  these kinds of cases were corrected. Thus, the number of the  province's criminals that were detained after expiration of  sentences was lower than the national average figure by 10.9  percentage point. Cases of 160 prisoners committing crimes  again and 182 cases of prisoners and their families appealing to  the higher levels and filing charges were handled. Twenty  economic criminal and unlawful and undisciplined cases relating  to cadres and policemen of supervisory centers and reformatories  were investigated and handled.    e. The accusation and report work was strengthened. The  accusation and supervisory departments and the report centers  brought into full play their roles as a "window" and a "bridge,"  accepted and handled 14,307 visitors and incoming letters from  the amasses, handled 64 visiting groups, accepted and handled  1,509 accusation cases, reexamined 31 cases, and changed the  original decisions on 52 cases. We accepted and handled 12,984  cases whose clues were reported by the masses, an increase of  50.89 percent over the previous year. Of this, clues for 9,055  cases of corruption and bribery were accepted, an increase of  53.71 percent; and clues for 622 cases involving personnel at or  above the county and section level were accepted, an increase of  181 percent over the previous year.    f. The inspection of the civil and administrative work was  strengthened. This was a new task and greatly helped promote  the handling of cases. We accepted and handled 404 accusation  cases, placed 131 cases on file, lodged protests against 23  cases, respectively, increasing by 134 percent, 208 percent, and  667 percent over the previous year; and made 58 suggestions on  further inspections and changes of judgment, 10.6 times over the  previous year's figure.    Our province made new achievements in the procuratorial work  techniques and the procuratorial work in the agricultural,  forestry, and railway aspects. Other overall departments also  positively brought their roles into play in ensuring and  promoting the progress of their professional work.    B. Main Methods for Carrying Out the Procuratorial Work in  1993    a. The procuratorial organs persisted in the accurate  political orientation and ceaselessly deepened the guiding  ideology of making the procuratorial work serve the economic  construction.    Over the past year, we constantly stressed that the  procuratorial organs at various levels must maintain an accurate  political orientation, persisted in the basic line of "one  center and two basic points," and served the central work of the  party. After the 14th party congress, setting up and developing  the socialist market economic system becomes the central task of  the party. Under such a situation, according to the  requirements of the supreme procuratorate, the provincial  procuratorate persistently used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm  their brains; focused the service of economic construction on  strictly enforcing laws, firmly handling cases, and intensifying  the functions for legal supervision; and ceaselessly deepened  and developed the guiding ideology of the procuratorial work in  practice. The procuratorial organs at various levels paid  attention to accurately handling relations between attacks and  service, between the enforcement of laws and the implementation  of policies, and between putting work priorities in a prominent  position and making a unified arrangement; firmly attended to  the link of handling cases; and better brought into play their  functions.    b. The procuratorial organs strictly enforced laws, firmly  attended to the principle of handling cases, and intensified  their functions for legal supervision.    According to the Supreme Procuratorate's requirements and in  line with the general ideologies of "strictly enforcing laws,  firmly handling cases, and intensifying legal supervision," the  procuratorial organs persistently regarded the handling of cases  as the primary task and penetrated supervision into the entire  process of the procuratorial work. Thus, there emerged a good  situation where the procuratorial work was comprehensively  developed. The procuratorial organs made the focal points stand  out and firmly attended to handling cases. First, they grasped  focal points. Second, they grasped the sources of the cases.  Third, they attended to investigations. Fourth, they firmly  attended to the system of responsibility for handling affairs.  Fifth, they attended to giving guidance. Sixth, they grasped  service and the guarantee for rear service. The procuratorial  organs strictly enforced laws and intensified supervision.  First, they strengthened the awareness of supervision. Second,  they intensified the functions for conducting supervision  according to laws. Third, they intensified the supervision over  security and judicial personnel. Fourth, they intensified the  setup of the supervisory system. Fifth, they intensified the  internal restriction; and focused their efforts on grasping the  links of placing cases on files, exempting from lawsuits, and  withdrawing cases. So, the number of cases exempting from  lawsuits was greatly reduced. A total of 510 criminals engaged  in corruption and bribery exempted from lawsuits, accounting for  34.65 percent of the total people and showing a decrease of  11.48 percent from the previous year.    c. The procuratorial organs persisted in the policy of  taking a "two-hand" approach and strived to upgrade the quality  of cadres and policemen.    In regard to the work arrangements and the leadership  forces,  we constantly persisted in the ideology of taking a two-hand  approach and attended to both professional work tasks and the  construction of the workers contingents. On the one hand, we  attended to investigating and handling major and appalling  economic criminal cases of corruption and bribery; on the other  hand, we opposed corruption and advocated administrative  honesty. So, our worker contingents experienced new tests and  made new improvements. In regard to the construction of the  leading bodies, we mainly strengthened the ideological  construction and further improved the theoretical understanding  and application abilities of the leading bodies. In regard to  the improvement of the work style of the leading bodies, we  conducted self-investigation and self-correction in line with  the 13 prohibitions as set forth by the central authorities and  the provincial party committee, also conscientiously made  rectification and correction, and played an exemplary vanguard  role. We strengthened the organizational construction,  resolutely readjusted the leading bodies that were not unified,  ensured to make decisions on major issues through democratic  discussions and collective study, and strengthened the unity and  combat effectiveness of the leading bodies. In regard to the  construction of the leading bodies, we attended to the following  four tasks: First, we strengthened the ideological and political  work. Second, we attended to the training of cadres. Third, we  paid attention to the consolidation of discipline. We strictly  investigated and handled the small number of cadres and  policemen violating laws and disciplines and corrected and  straightened out the problems of wantonly collecting charges,  wantonly imposing fines, and wantonly collecting funds. Fourth,  we positively launched the activities of striving to create new  achievements. The organs under the provincial procuratorate  launched the activities of striving for the best, creating  first-grade achievements, making contributions and promoting the  progress of the provincewide "double-emulation and  double-comparison" activities and the spiritual civilization. A  large group of advanced units and individuals emerged.  Sixty-one institutions were commended as units advanced in  spiritual civilization.    d. Procuratorial organs strengthened investigation and study  and upgraded the quality of policy decisions    We regarded the investigation and study work as a basic  work,  went deep to reality to seek truth from facts, timely discovered  and solved the new situation and new work problems, and made the  policy decisions more scientific and democratic on the basis of  investigation and study. Before making major work arrangement,  the provincial procuratorate and the city procuratorial organs  timely organized relevant departments to conduct investigation  and study and make analysis and then worked out measures to  arrange and guide the progress of the work.    e. Procuratorial organs strengthened leadership and gained  the initiative in work    The procuratorial organs at various levels carried out the  procuratorial work firmly under the leadership of the party,  ceaselessly strengthened the sense of the party in waging the  struggle against corruption, and conscientiously carried out the  system of delivering work reports to the party committees at  various levels and the system of reporting major cases. These  organs persisted in the system of delivering work reports to the  people's congresses and their standing committees,  conscientiously made fiscal work reports and special work  reports, timely reported on the major issues relating to the  procuratorial work, resolutely implemented the resolutions of  the people's congresses and their standing committees,  conscientiously accepted supervision, prudently listened to the  deputies' opinions on their inspection and assessment of the  procuratorial work, and ceaselessly improved their work.    In 1993, the provincial procuratorial work situation was  generally good. The province made greater achievements in the  procuratorial work. However, some problems that could not be  ignored still existed. Some procuratorial workers did not have  correct law enforcement ideas, did not have a strong sense of  service, were afraid of difficulties, failed to emancipate the  mind, and did not have the awareness of doing pioneering work  and blazing new trails. Some weak links still existed. The  quality of cadres and policemen did not suit the requirements of  the situation. Some violated laws and disciplines and gained  private gains when handling cases, thus producing extremely bad  influence. The basic construction of the procuratorial work was  comparatively weak. The communications and telecommunications  facilities and the technological equipment were comparatively  backward. All these restricted, to a certain extent, the  progress of the procuratorial work.  <H5>  2. General Arrangements for 1994 Procuratorial Work </H5>   Fellow deputies: The implementation of the "decision"  adopted at the third plenary session of the 14th party Central  Committee will produce a profound impact on the political,  economic, and social activities and create some new  contradictions and problems. The procuratorial workers are  confronted with an extremely grim situation and more arduous  tasks in the new situation. The procuratorial organs must fully  understand the heavy historical tasks that they are taking on,  work closely in line with the central link of economic  construction, regard the investigation and handling of cases as  the most important means to directly serve economic  construction, and strive to make new development and improvement  on the basis of the procuratorial work achievements made in the  previous year. According to the arrangements of the Supreme  Procuratorate, we will focus our efforts to attend to the work  in the following four aspects:    A. We should deeply study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building a socialism with Chinese characteristics and arm the  heads of the entire cadres and policemen with this theory.    We should organize the broad masses of cadres and policemen  to conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building a socialism with Chinese characteristics, put the study  of the theory in an important position of the ideological  construction and the political and theoretical education, regard  it as a key link of the ideological and political work. We  should emphatically study and grasp the policy of taking "a  two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough," the  ideology on democracy and legal system, and a series of  expositions of opposing corruption; enable the broad masses of  cadres and policemen to have a firm determination to oppose  corruption and deeply promote the improvement of administrative  honesty. In line with the study of the "decision" of the third  plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, we should  understand and grasp the essential special features, operational  mechanisms, and policy measures of the socialist market economy;  and make the procuratorial work better serve economic  construction.    B. We should strictly enforce laws, firmly attend to the  principles of handling cases, and further intensify the  functions for legal supervision    We should concentrate energy to investigate and handle major  and appalling cases and deeply and constantly wage the struggle  against corruption. We should further upgrade the understanding  about the importance of the anticorruption struggle and foster  the idea of waging a long-term struggle. We should concentrate  energy to investigate and handle major and appalling cases with  the focus on the criminal cases relating to the working  personnel of the party and political leading organs, judicial  departments, administrative and law enforcement departments, and  economic management departments. We should make a new  breakthrough in investigating and handling major cases and  resolutely investigate and handle, if discovered, the major  cases involving the leading organs and the leading cadres at or  above the county and section level. We should select typical  cases and make key breakthroughs in dealing blows to the  criminal activities of organs, organizations, enterprises, and  institutions giving and accepting bribes and evading, resisting,  and swindling taxes. We should continue to strengthen the  dynamics of the propaganda on reporting criminal activities,  timely achieve the report feedback work, and implement the  encouragement policies. We should strengthen the coordinate  command and coordination of the investigation work, strengthen  the setup of information networks, and achieve the work of  guarding against and pursuing and capturing those who commit  crimes and abscond with public funds.    We should strictly deal blows to serious criminal activities  and safeguard the social stability. We should implement the  principle of strictly and rapidly dealing blows to criminal  activities, persist in the "two basic" principles, get involved  in the serious and extraordinarily serious criminal cases ahead  of time, and timely approve to arrest and bring actions against  criminals so as to stop the rising tendency of serious and  extraordinarily serious cases. Under the leadership of the party  committees, we should positively participate in the special  struggles and conscientiously implement various measures for  comprehensively improving the procuratorial work.    We should strengthen the supervision over the enforcement of  laws and ensure the unified and accurate enforcement of laws.  We should expand the investigation and supervision to the link  of placing cases on file, strengthen the supervision over the  activities of not listing cases or not appropriately listing  cases, timely pursue to arrest and bring actions against  criminal offenders, and realistically stop making mistakes or  escaping unpunished.    We should pay prominent attention to the work of lodging  protests and ensure the quality of the protests to be lodged.  We should regard the inspections of the enforcement of laws and  disciplines as an important task for waging the anticorruption  struggle and promoting the strict enforcement of laws and  prominently investigate and handle the cases of judicial  personnel and administrative and law enforcement personnel  abusing power to engage in malpractice, seeking private gains,  and perverting justice for bribes. We should conscientiously  solve the problems involving criminals who are still detained  after completion of their set terms of imprisonments, not  enforcing laws and regulations, and substituting money for  penalty. We should persist in the principle of correcting all  the mistakes and conscientiously investigate and handle the  cases of not being submitted to the courts' judgments and  rulings and the procuratorial organs' decisions on canceling  lawsuits.    C. We should strengthen the construction of the leading body  contingents and upgrade the overall quality of the contingents    It is necessary to realistically strengthen the construction  of the leading bodies. The provincial procuratorate and various  city branches should support the local party committees to  readjust and strengthen the leading bodies so as to install  well-organized and professionally competent leading bodies at  various levels. We should strengthen the study among the  central group of the leading party groups of the procuratorates  at various levels and ceaselessly upgrade the political and  theoretical levels of the leading bodies.    We should strengthen the construction of the reserve cadre  contingents and upgrade the ability of the reserve cadres.    We should make efforts to upgrade the procuratorial worker  contingents' quality and their law enforcement levels. The  procuratorial organs are units where the organizational reform  is strengthened. When adding new personnel, the procuratorial  organs should persist in principles to ensure the quality of  newly added personnel. We should persistently regard the  training of cadres as a long-term strategic task, pay attention  to cultivating cadres and having them temper themselves in the  course of practice, and cultivate a group of specialized talents  in the course of handling cases.    We should further upgrade the understanding about the  importance of the anticorruption struggle, strengthen the  awareness of cadres and policemen's administrative honesty and  self-discipline, pay attention to sorting out and correcting  such unhealthy trends within trades as "seeking private gains in  handling cases" and "stressing personnel relationship in  handling cases," strictly investigate and handle the unlawful  and undisciplined phenomena that a small number of cadres and  policemen violate laws and disciplines, and also investigate the  wrongly handled cases by conscientiously implementing the system  of being honest and diligent in performing official duties.    It is necessary to vigorously advocate the spiritual  civilization. By 1996, the procuratorial departments across the  province should strive to stand among the province's advanced  departments emerging from the construction of civilized units.  We should positively launch the activities of creating quality  achievements as well as the "double-advanced" and assessment and  comparison activities; and vigorously cultivate and foster  advanced examples. We should achieve the basic construction,  positively improve the communications and telecommunications  facilities and investigation technical equipment to suit the  procuratorial organs' demands for investigating and handling  cases, and strengthen the guarantee for the supply of materials  and the reserve service work.    D. We should realistically strengthen leadership to suit the  demands for setting up the socialist market economic system    We should positively and actively accept the leadership of  the party committees and the people's congress. Under the  leadership of the party committees, we should independently  exercise the procuratorial rights according to laws, positively  and actively gain the leadership of the local party committees,  and rely on the party committees to eliminate various obstacles.  We should further consciously accept the supervision by the  people's congresses; set up, perfect, and also conscientiously  implement the report system; positively accept the inspections  on enforcement of laws by the people's congress standing  committees; and conscientiously handle the affairs handed over  by the people's congresses. We should strive to gain the  support and cooperation of the governments and the departments  concerned and positively and effectively carry out the  procuratorial work. The procuratorial organs at higher levels  should strengthen the leadership over the organs at lower  levels, assume responsibility to help the lower-level  procuratorial organs solve their professional work problems,  particularly the difficulties that come across when handling  cases; support the lower-level procuratorial organs to justly  enforce laws, and ensure to conduct the legal supervision in a  constant and step-by-step manner.    Fellow deputies: In the new situation, the tasks we are  taking on are heavy and arduous. We are determined to  conscientiously implement the resolutions of this session,  strive to suit the requirements in the new situation and the new  tasks, go all out, keep forging ahead, and make new  contributions to setting up and developing the socialist market  economic system.</p>

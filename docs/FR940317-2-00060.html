			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Addendum II identifies previous  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  documents that contain a description of all previously published HCFA Medicare and Medicaid manuals and memoranda.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Addendum III of this notice lists, for each of our manuals or Program Memoranda, a HCFA transmittal number unique to that instruction and its subject matter. A transmittal may consist of a single instruction or many. Often it is necessary to use information in a transmittal in conjunction with information currently in the manuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Addendum IV lists all substantive and interpretive Medicare and Medicaid regulations and general notices published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  during the quarter covered by this notice. For each item, we list the date published, the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  citation, the title of the regulation, and the Parts of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) which have changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Addendum V sets forth the revisions to the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual that were published during the quarter covered by this notice. For the revisions, we give a brief synopsis of the revisions as they appear on the transmittal sheet, the manual section number, and the title of the section. We present a complete copy of the revised material, no matter how minor the revision, and identify the revisions by printing in italics the text that was changed. If the transmittal includes material unrelated to the revised section, for example, when the addition of revised material causes other sections to be repaginated, we do not reprint the unrelated material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers seek stronger rubber pact THE INTERNATIONAL Natural Rubber Organisation convenes for a two-day special council session in Kuala Lumpur today faced with producer demands for a more effective defence of prices. Producer members meeting last week in Hatyai, south Thailand, agreed a common strategy aimed at preventing rubber prices falling below the International Rubber Agreement's lower intervention, or 'must buy' level of 166 Malaysia/Singapore cents a lb. Since the last Inro meeting, in October, producer members, led by Malaysia, have been urging on consumer members the need for reform of the agreement to enable it to keep prices within the agreed range through the operation of its buffer stock system. But they have met with stiff resistance from consumer members, especially the US. Some argue that market realities demand lower support bands. The present agreement, Inra II, has less than two years to run, and producers are anxious for serious negotiations to begin on its successor, especially in view of the recent slide in prices and what they see as an inadequate response from the buffer stock manager. The buffer stock now stands at about 100,000 tonnes, less than a fifth of the maximum level. Late last year Inro's Kuala Lumpur-based secretariat promised that the organisation would enter the market in a 'pretty aggressive' fashion after the new year holidays. But a dip below the 'must buy' level earlier this month resulted in only modest buffer stock purchases before prices bounced by a couple of cents - to the surprise of some traders. The agenda for this week's council meeting includes a review of the options available to cope with the market's realities: for example by revising its support prices - whether upwards or downwards would depend as much on politics and the availability of financial backing as on the secretariat's recommendations.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Kodak profits warning takes Dow lower Wall Street In a session dominated by a big sell-off in Eastman Kodak shares, US equity markets were broadly lower yesterday, as stocks failed to benefit from further evidence of economic expansion, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 25.71 at 3,716.92, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.22 easier at 461.84. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite lost 1.89 at 459.94 but the Nasdaq composite rose 1.50 to 752.97. New York SE volume was heavy, with 332m shares traded. The Dow dropped at the opening, largely because of a plunge in Kodak's share price. After the photographic products company said its 1994 earnings would be 'quite modest', the shares weakened Dollars 7 1/4 , or about 11 per cent, to Dollars 55 1/2 in turnover of 11.7m shares. The announcement led at least two Wall Street analysts to downgrade the stock. The market attempted a rally near midday, with fresh evidence of growth in the manufacturing sector gener-ating interest in other Dow components. Caterpillar gained Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 85 5/8 and 3M Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 111 3/4 after the Federal Reserve issued its strongest report of the year on industrial production. It showed a 0.9 per cent increase in November, after a revised 0.8 per cent rise the previous month. Capacity utilisation also exceeded forecasts, climbing 0.6 percentage point to 83 per cent, the highest level since August 1989. But the blue chips retreated again as the US Treasury market, which had virtually ignored the stronger than expected economic data, seesawed in a volatile session influenced by a sharp turnround in gold bullion prices. In late trading, the inflation-sensitive 30-year government issue was unchanged at 99 15/16 . By the close, Procter &amp; Gamble was down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 55 3/4 and Mobil Dollars 2 at Dollars 74 1/2 . Alcoa lost Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 70 5/8 , with market commentators concerned that recent advances in its share price had been unwarranted. Although reaction to the completion of world trade talks was muted, defence-related and aerospace issues were mostly stronger on the Gatt treaty announcement. General Electric rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 103 3/8 and Boeing Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 42 3/4 . McDonnell Douglas slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 109 1/2 on news of an unfavourable settlement over compensation claims related to the C-17 military aircraft programme. In the agricultural sector, which is expected to benefit from the Gatt deal, Archer Daniels Midland added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 23 5/8 . A newly announced Clinton smog-control plan would increase the use of corn-derived ethanol, a market dominated by ADM. Fruit of the Loom declined Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 27 7/8 after Prudential Securities lowered its earnings estimate for the company. In other textile issues, VF Corp retreated Dollars 1 to Dollars 45. Canada Toronto continued Tuesday's sharp retreat yesterday in heavy trading. The TSE 300 index fell 18.8 to 4,225.6 for a two-day drop of 67 points. Losses led rises by 482 to 339 after volume of 83.3m shares. Nine of the 14 sub-indices ended lower, with mining, off 1.97 per cent, and energy, down 1.25 per cent, leading the way.</p>

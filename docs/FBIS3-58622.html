			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Considering that the idea of abandoning  the former Yugoslavia and removing UN forces stationed there is  now openly debated, this first important test of a Europe on its  way to unity is proof of "inconsistency," Gerard Dupuy  editorializes in the 7 January left-of-center Paris daily  LIBERATION. A "last and ironic example" of this is the appeal  for help to President Clinton and the Americans by France, the  European government most favorable to an active policy in the  former Yugoslavia. This is a clever way to "pass the buck,"  Dupuy comments, since Paris is well aware that the Americans  have no intention of picking it up, after their experience of  "warring without making war" in Somalia quickly led them to  "look for the exit." This is also why the only choice left for  Europeans is to continue "the make-believe task of doing  something" while letting their soldiers be ridiculed, perform  "humanitarian" tasks that may well, in the end, turn against the  civilian populations themselves, and wait for fires to die down  while praying they do not start again in the neighbor's  apartment," Dupuy concludes.</p>

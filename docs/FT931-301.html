			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / French premier gives key posts to free-market partner THE UDF, the more free-market partner in France's new coalition government, gained most of the economic posts in the new cabinet announced last night, with the more nationalist RPR Gaullist party securing responsibility for the interior and foreign ministries. President Francois Mitterrand raised no objection to the ministerial list presented by his new premier, Mr Edouard Balladur, the RPR politician. Mr Edmond Alphandery, an economics professor turned UDF politician, is France's finance minister, with the difficult task of maintaining a strong exchange rate and reducing unemployment, which has now risen above the 3m level. Gaining the finance ministry and 15 other ministerial posts in a slimmed-down 30-member cabinet, the UDF party has obtained ample compensation for the premier's post going to the RPR. The UDF has also gained responsibility for external security, with Mr Francois Leotard becoming defence minister. Mr Alain Juppe is France's new foreign minister. This is the RPR secretary-general's reward for his party's success in winning 247 seats in the new parliament. His opposite number in the UDF, Mr Francois Bayrou, gets the education portfolio. Mr Charles Pasqua, a hardline RPR Gaullist with strong views on immigration, law and order, has returned to the interior ministry which he held in the last cohabitation government of 1986-88, but he has added planning to his portfolio. He had sought the defence ministry. But Mr Leotard's nomination for that job may have been a deliberate ploy by Mr Balladur to show that the new government means to exercise its rights more vigorously than the centre-right did when it was last in power under Mr Mitterrand. In 1986 Mr Leotard's nomination as defence minister was withdrawn after Mr Mitterrand expressed a preference for a technocrat to fill that job. In addition to the finance ministry, the UDF holds most other economic jobs. Mr Gerard Longuet becomes industry minister, and Mr Alain Madelin, a genuine free-market liberal, is given charge of policy towards small and medium sized companies. While Mrs Simone Veil, the veteran UDF politician and Euro-MP, returns to government for the first time since 1979 to take charge of social policy, fully half the cabinet have never held ministerial rank before. Among them is Mr Jean Puech, a relatively unknown centrist senator who takes on the key portfolio of agriculture. Another newcomer is Mr Philippe Douste-Blazy, mayor of Lourdes, who has become health minister. The fact that he is also mayor of Lourdes may be read by some as an indication of how determined the government is to cut costs in the public sector. Ministerial profiles, Page 3</p>

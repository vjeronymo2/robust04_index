			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Markets: Dow carried upwards by a tide of cash - Wall Street FORGET THE economy, corporate profits and election-year politics, the stock market is being propped up by sheer weight of money. Share prices have been on a record-breaking spree since New Year because investors have been pouring money into stocks, creating a pool of buyers that is supporting prices irrespective of the fundamentals of the market. Look at the numbers supplied this week by the Investment Company Institute, the trade group for US mutual funds. In December investors handed over a record Dollars 7.4bn (Pounds 4.22bn) to stock mutual funds. January was not far behind, as another Dollars 6.7bn, the second-largest inflow ever, was put in stock funds. February, by all accounts, could come close to matching both. The money managers have not stopped to think about what to do with it all. They have taken the money and put it straight in the market. In fact, they have done more than that. The data shows that in January the funds invested a net Dollars 7.8bn in common stocks. This means that the professional investment managers invested all the money given to them in January, plus an additional Dollars 1.1bn from their stock of cash. By the end of last month, the percentage of assets stock-funds held as cash stood at 7.9 per cent, the lowest level in eight years. Superficially, the key factor behind cash flows appears to be interest rates. The money that has been going into stock funds and the market has primarily come from assets such as bank certificates of deposit, savings accounts and short-term money market funds which yield less as interest rates fall. Interest rates were on a downward path throughout 1991, but the final straw for yield-sensitive investors appears to have been the Federal Reserve's one percentage point cut in the discount rate on December 20. This prompted a big switch into equities by investors unhappy with the low yields on alternative short-term assets. Yet the rush into stocks may be about more than just interest rates and relative returns on financial assets. Some observers believe investors' new-found appetite for equities may reflect a secular, rather than a cyclical, trend. It can be argued that investors are putting money in stocks for the long-term, and not just punting on interest rates or betting on a short-term rebound in the economy and corporate earnings. In particular, the baby-boom generation - people born in the 1950s and 1960s who have careers and families - may view equities as an important element in their long-term savings plans. The financial services industry is certainly keen to encourage such thinking. A recent spate of television commercials by broker-managers such as PaineWebber, Dean Witter, and Merrill Lynch, and by traditional fund groups such as Fidelity, have been aimed at persuading the heads of young families to prepare for their childrens' future and their own retirement by investing in long-term stock funds now. Thus, in spite of the well-known risks of investing in equities, investors are being told that the market offers long-term protection for savings capital. There is some evidence to suggest that investors are swallowing this. According to Strategic Insight, a New York-based mutual fund consultancy, 80 per cent of the money put into stock funds this year has been invested with just 56 funds, the majority having built their success and reputation providing investors with a healthy return over the long-term. Another 530 stock funds have suffered net outflows of cash during the same period. If attitudes to equities are genuinely changing, and more investors settling in for the long-haul, the market may become less sensitive to the short-term external influences that disrupts sentiment and feeds volatility. There was plenty of volatility in the market this week, however, as the Dow index reached a record high on twice only to fall back sharply the following day. The uncertainty was created by conflicting economic news. On Tuesday, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence fell in January to the lowest level since 1974. The next day the Commerce department reported that factor orders for durable goods rose 1.5 per cent in January, a bigger rise than expected. On Thursday weekly jobless claims showed a rise in unemployment. Yesterday brought a rise in the University of Michigan's survey of consumer confidence and an unexpectedly large upward revision in fourth-quarter GDP growth. Amid all this confusing data, no wonder more investors seem happy to leave their money in the market for the long-term.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Monday      3282.42  +  2.23 Tuesday     3257.83  - 24.56 Wednesday   3283.32  + 25.49 Thursday    3269.45  - 13.87 Friday      3267.67  -  1.78  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

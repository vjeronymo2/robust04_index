			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> POST-PUNK AVATAR PLAYS MUSIC TO FEEL  </P> <P> It didn't take Bob Mould long to figure out Saturday that the reserved-seating  Embassy Theatre downtown was the wrong place for him to play. Fans sitting  calmly in their seats? Couldn't have that.  </P> <P> So after just two songs, the former Husker Dude stopped the show and insisted  that all on hand come down the aisles and rock.  </P> <P> They did, and Mould responded with a performance that exceeded even his own  pressure-cooked standards. Expanding on the monsoon of emotional rage and  anguish of the recent "Black Sheets of Rain" album, the music made by  singer-guitarist Mould, bassist Tony Maimone and drummer Anton Fier rivaled  that of Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse and Sonic Youth for sheer fury. This was  music to feel -- literally -- as much as hear.  </P> <P> Of course, that's pretty much expected from post-punk avatar Mould. What made  this a great show was the unexpected -- not just a closing version of Cheap  Trick's lighthearted "Surrender," but the formerly stocky-and-stock-still  Minnesotan's lean, animated, even chatty manner. It brought new dimensions to  his songs and encouragement to those who feared that Mould's solo route would  turn into a dead end. Judging by this show, he's just started his journey.  Mould also appears tonight at San Diego State University's Montezuma Hall.  STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

Turkin, All-Union Scientific Research Institute of  Opticophysical Measurements, Moscow; UDC  621.372.833+621.373.2:621.372.2]    [Abstract] The main problem in building powerful  electromagnetic pulse generators is the construction of the  wideband transition from the coaxial generator channel, which is  filled with an electric insulation medium, to an asymmetric  bandline with air insulation. The transition between the  symmetric and asymmetric sections has the minimum possible cross  section while retaining electric stability. This insures minimal  distortion of the leading edge of the pulse between the  symmetric and asymmetric portions. The wave channel of the  generator was studied using pulse reflectometry. Local  distortions were found to be no greater than 15%. The  band line  has an amplitude of up to 500 kV/m (1.3 kA/m) and a edge length  of no greater than 0.5 ns. As a comparison,the Swiss GTEM 1500  installation forms pulses with a edge length of 1.5 ns and an  amplitude of 24 kV/m (24/377 kA/m). Figures 3; references 8: 7  Russian, 1 Western.</p>

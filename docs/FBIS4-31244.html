			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Union of Labor Chairman Ryszard Bugaj by </F> correspondent Henryk Sroczynski; place and date not given]    [Text] [Sroczynski] What place would you designate for  your group on Poland's political stage?    [Bugaj] Our place on that stage has remained unchanged for a  long time now. On the other hand, the Democratic Union [UD],  which used to occupy the center position, has now clearly moved  to the right, while the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] has moved  at least to a center position.    [Sroczynski] Are you trying to say that you are now the most  left-oriented party?    [Bugaj] Indeed, that is what we are. With one reservation,  however: that the political scene in Poland is, as a whole,  somewhat right-oriented.    [Sroczynski] There was a time when you hoped to win over a  proportion of the National Trade Union Alliance [OPZZ] deputies  who were members of the Democratic Left Alliance Parliamentary  Caucus. These calculations did not materialize....    [Bugaj] The SLD leadership is firm and, as you saw for  yourself during the budget vote, it decided to expel from their  parliamentary club anyone who dares to vote against their  instructions. However, there are many people there who  articulate the issues which were on the agenda during the  election campaign. On the other hand, there are also the Social  Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] activists delegated to  operate in the trade unions. I do not know what their  proportional numbers are.    [Sroczynski] The differences which already existed between  you, Waldemar Pawlak, and Aleksander Kwasniewski have deepened  since the time when you negotiated with them the possibility of  your joining the parliamentary coalition. Why is that?    [Bugaj] We have not noticed any marked changes in their  stand on social and economic issues. Nor do we conclude from  Mr. Kolodko's public statements that such changes are about to  take place. The second area in which we have reservations about  their positions concerns questions of personnel appointments:  An increasing number of figures from the past have been  appearing on the scene. The third bloc of contentious issues  entails relations with the President's Office. The president's  actions can hardly be defined as constructive. Why was the  situation allowed whereby certain ministries come directly under  the president's decisions? Why was the concept of a  "presidential ministry" created at all? There are also certain  matters on which, it seemed, there were no appreciable  differences between ourselves on the one hand and the SLD-PSL  bloc on the other. I am thinking here of our proposal for a  constitutional referendum. By now it is more and more often  that we can hear them say: We do not know.... Let us wait and  see....    [Sroczynski] How do you assess the opposition in the Sejm?  Do you not think that it is weak and contributes very little?    [Bugaj] Indeed, it is weak. There are two reasons for its  weakness. First, the coalition is far stronger because it  commands a large number of seats in parliament; second, despite  the many accusations being leveled against it, the coalition is  relatively well consolidated. On the other hand, the  opposition, which is to be found both on the left and the right  side (although I do not quite know where to place the  Confederation for an Independent Poland), is certainly rather  weak. That is why it has a very limited chances of standing up  successfully to the government and opposing its plans.    [Sroczynski] Perhaps the Sejm itself is too weak?    [Bugaj] If you are referring to the political elites' level  of competence in discharging their brief, I would agree with  that proposition. It is equally true of the parliamentary  parties representing the government coalition and the opposition.    [Sroczynski] We will soon see the launch of the presidential  election campaign. Consequently, we can surely assume that  there is much discussion in your party on your future candidate  for the president's office. In your opinion, who should run for  the presidency from your group?    [Bugaj] I would like to see a candidate representing a  center-left orientation, and, most importantly, offering a  guarantee of a serious attitude to the discharge of his duties  and an unconditional respect for the constitution. So far, a  candidate combining these qualities has not materialized.  However, I am still hopeful that we will find him.    [Sroczynski] What do you think of the chances of candidates  proposed by the right wing? The right is, after all, about to  become consolidated and create a united confederation.    [Bugaj] I have become accustomed to situations whereby, if  you hear a public statement from the right-wing camp on a  Monday, you can be certain that it will be disclaimed on  Tuesday, that something entirely new will be announced on  Wednesday, and that by Thursday it will be back to the original  Monday statement again. Consequently, I cannot tell with any  certainty what will happen in the right-wing camp in the near  future and, to tell the truth, I am not particularly interested.    [Sroczynski] But let us assume that every major political  group nominates its own candidates to the office of president.  Who will stand the best chance then?    [Bugaj] I believe that in the first round the chances will  be even, and by the second round the presidential election will  become a lottery.    [Sroczynski] In other words, you believe that certain  related political groups should come to an agreement and  nominate their presidential candidate jointly? Would your party  be willing to participate in such an agreement?    [Bugaj] I hope so.</p>

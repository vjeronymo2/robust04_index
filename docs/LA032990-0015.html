			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRACK BABIES  </P> <P> It is terrible how unborn babies can be so mistreated ("Crack Babies: The  Numbers Mount," editorial, March 17).  </P> <P> How could a mother deliberately and knowingly hurt her baby?  </P> <P> We need to emphasize the ill effects that crack causes, and maybe some of these  mothers will think twice before they decide to take drugs. Babies that are born  addicted to crack will just add to the drug problem that is already out of  control.  </P> <P> CHRISTINE JOOS  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

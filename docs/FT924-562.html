			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: K mart plans 100 stores for Mexico K MART, the big US retail group, plans to open some 100 discount stores in Mexico, through a joint venture with Grupo Liverpool, a Mexican department store chain. The two companies intend to invest Dollars 250m each in the discount stores, which will be similar to K mart's stores in the US, selling food and general goods. The project will start with two or three pilot stores in Mexico City next year. The 100 stores will employ about 35,000 people. K mart is following the steps of both Walmart and Price Club, the US store groups which last year opened membership-only discount stores in joint ventures with Mexican retail companies, Cifra and Comercial Mexicana. The stores have proved successful, with 45-minute queues regularly forming outside their car parks. Grupo Liverpool owns 17 department stores in Mexico, and has annual sales of over Dollars 1bn. The company was keen to point out that the discount stores would not compete or overlap with its existing stores, which target the upper and upper-middle levels of the market. Liverpool hopes K mart's huge buying power will enable it to obtain lower wholesale prices than Mexican rivals. K mart said it was attracted to Mexico by the rapid development of a market of 80m people, and political stability.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY BOARD  </P> <P> In the latest edition of Time magazine, it states that in the 115-year history  of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, there has been only white men  elected to it.  </P> <P> Can you imagine that? This is the most multiracial county in the nation and yet  we have the most enduring bastion of white supremacy in the country.  </P> <P> It is also the most undemocratic political entity since it has broad  legislative, executive and semi-judicial powers unlike any in the nation.  </P> <P> Why do we allow this to go on? We need at least nine members to constitute the  board instead of the present five, to make it more representative of the  people.  </P> <P> These five are the most power-hungry politicians in Southern California. Even  the "liberals," Kenneth Hahn and Edmund Edelman, cling to power tenaciously and  unyieldingly.  </P> <P> Enlarge the board!  </P> <P> JOHN F. MENDEZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

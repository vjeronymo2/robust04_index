			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Observer: Snow kitty It's an ill snow-blizzard which blows nobody any good. Despite the Arctic conditions in the US, at least one industry is thriving. Kitty litter has become such a hot commodity that even America's non-cat lovers can no longer do without it. People are buying the stuff to spread over slippery sidewalks; apparently it's an environmentally friendly alternative to the more traditional rock salt, itself in short supply. Drivers are loading up with 50lb sacks of the versatile granules to give their cars better traction in snow. Grocery chains are shifting twice as much litter as normal, according to Supermarket News. And of course, cats are staying indoors.</p>

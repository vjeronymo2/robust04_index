Ramsey  Clark said Tuesday after concluding an independent peace mission to Baghdad.  </P> <P> "I was told that two were going to be released today (Tuesday) and apparently  did not make it on the plane and that they will be out on the next plane  whenever that is," Clark told reporters on arrival in Amman from Baghdad.  </P> <P> "I think it will be tomorrow, and there will be two more after that," said  Clark.  </P> <P> Clark, a peace activist who traveled to Hanoi during the Vietnam War, is the  second prominent American to go to Baghdad since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.  Former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson was there in August.  </P></p>

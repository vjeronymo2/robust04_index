			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Pentagon poised to reveal cuts in weapon production THE PENTAGON is expected tomorrow to unveil far-reaching plans to scale back production of new weapons systems, including nuclear warheads, in response to the collapse of the Soviet Union, writes Lionel Barber. The plans are intended to save billions of dollars in military spending, but could face stiff opposition from Congress and US defence contractors. In their most radical form, the plans would halt production of most new weapons systems once a prototype was ready. The aim would be to restrict the Defence Department's costs to research and development - which typically represents about a quarter of the cost of an advanced weapons system. Big defence contractors argue that this would saddle industry with the cost of research without the security of future earnings through mass production. A further objection is that mass production irons out defects in advanced weapons systems, and also helps to sustain the country's defence industrial base. Separately, the administration is reported ready to announce a halt in production of the W-88 nuclear warhead. This would fit earlier steps to reduce the US nuclear bomb-building capability in line with cuts in nuclear warheads agreed with the former Soviet Union.</p>

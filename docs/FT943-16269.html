			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Funds take a fresh look at cash management - The pressure is on fund managers to make their large cash positions work harder When negative sentiment takes a grip of markets in the way it has done for most of this year, that old adage 'Cash is King' could not be a wiser investment strategy. The recent slide in bond and equity prices has prompted many investors, professional and private alike, to run for cover. Those who have decided to take their losses on the chin have sold their positions and placed the proceeds in the safety of short-term bank deposits. Some fund managers are also holding back from investing the fresh funds which flow in at regular intervals. As a result, they are sitting on historically large cash positions in their equity or bond portfolios, in some instances as high as 100 per cent. The norm is around 5 per cent for pension funds and 10 per cent for low-risk private client portfolios. Since they are only meant to be in cash on a temporary basis, fund managers tend to opt for the best overnight rate to ensure capital preservation and allow immediate withdrawal for a quick return to the markets when they think the time is right. Mr Peter Flynn, director of fixed income at Fleming Investment Management, says it would be inappropriate to manage such cash positions too actively. 'You want to be flexible, you are only in cash pending re-investment,' he says. 'Anyway, cash benchmarks such as three-month sterling Libor (the London interbank offered rate) would have been tough to beat since the beginning of the year.' But with markets remaining volatile, the pressure is on fund managers to make these cash positions work harder. Mr Tim Easun, managing director at Union Fund Management, estimates that there is at least Pounds 12bn of pension fund money which could be getting better returns than overnight rates. The amount would be even greater if it included cash piles in the corporate and public authority sectors. 'It is accidental money which is not being invested properly,' says Mr Easun, adding that in the UK, fund managers tend to have a 'loose change' attitude towards cash. 'Cash should be an asset class in its own right, like in the US.' In the US, pension funds, companies and even hospitals are seeking a better return on their excess cash than the yields which they could get from rolling over overnight bank positions. Although the cash is often deposited with a custodian bank, the decision on how it is invested is taken by cash management specialists. Mr John Isaacson, chief investment officer and executive vice-president at Payden &amp; Rygel in Los Angeles, says his philosophy is to look at cash on a total return basis. For example, buying a liquid two-year bond and holding it for three months could well be more profitable than a three-month deposit because of the likely capital gain. Founded 11 years ago, Payden and Rygel now has Dollars 16bn under management, reflecting the demand in the US for cash management expertise. Mr Isaacson says that, although the emphasis on yield is ingrained among European investors, he believes low interest rates will prompt them to want more from their cash. But he has found that European investors still associate investments maturing in more than one year with a risk of making losses on the principal, as value fluctuates. Mr Easun detects an increasing trend among UK institutional investors to farm out the management of their cash positions. 'We now have more than Pounds 1bn under management. Such economies of scale allow us to get better rates than the corporate treasurer who rings up the bank every day at 10.30,' he says. Meanwhile, some UK fund managers are starting to copy their American cousins. Mr Paul Meader, head of fixed-income management at Matheson Investment Management, says he constantly monitors short-dated instruments to find the best return for his cash position. 'Yields are inconsistent at the short end of the yield curve, you can find anomalies which allow you to get rates of 5 per cent rather than 3 per cent,' he says. Mr Meader points to the Bank of England's latest auction of floating-rate notes as an example. 'On the new gilt FRN it will be possible to get a yield of 5.75 per cent provided the FRN goes to par by the next coupon fixing,' he says. This compares favourably with overnight rates, where it is sometimes difficult to get 4 per cent.</p>

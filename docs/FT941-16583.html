			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / As They say in Europe: Good fortune brings pain Once 1994 got under way I felt a sense of relief. After the (largely miserable) mass-contemplation of its advent, the new year eventually arrived, and no new ghastly event had hit the world scene. So I turned to the French press to see how it received a flood of good news, as well as news of good floods. This was because, apart from meteorological phenomena, there were a number of rather jolly events that normally might have been expected to raise everyone's spirits, even in France. For one thing, the FT had awarded the country's prime minister, Edouard Balladur, the title Man of the Year. All that got, from Sud-Ouest, was a sour rebuff: 'There is at least one point of agreement between us and our British compatriots.' An Alsace daily remarked that although Balladur had become the 'sacre homme de l'annee' it was in a paper which was 'hardly francophile'. Another bit of good news was that an 83-year old widow from the Gard, in the deep south, had won a record FFr60m (Pounds 6.8m) on the national lottery, the biggest sum in loto's history. Enormous interest centred on the family of Marie-Therese Barre ('Granny' to the press) which seemed to be distilled from some daft 1950s black comedy of the French screen. 'Granny' herself had retired years ago from her job at the salt pans of Aigues-Mortes. Then there was her son, Jacques, 41, who is enjoying six months paid medical leave from his job as wayside weed remover for the local council. He had hurt his knee playing football. The daughter-in-law, Sylvie, 35, keeps the books of a small family firm. She had been the first to hear the good news and immediately told the dowager Mme Barre to go ahead and buy the wardrobe she wanted. 'She also wants a new TV,' said Sylvie. 'Granny told me it won't change her life,' Sylvie added menacingly. 'You can't go shopping in a village of 5,050 inhabitants in a mink and pearl necklace.' It was, of course, Jacques and Sylvie who went to Paris to collect the winnings and give the press conference from their suite at the Ritz. 'When I find myself here,' said Jacques, 'I realise that everything has changed. It was my mother who won, but she was tired and asked me to come. I'm sort of the head of the family.' The joy of the media was, to say the least, confined. The Barre's local paper, L'Independant du Midi, was particularly bitter: 'The game (Loto) is only a supplementary tax in disguise into which millions of victims throw themselves, and from among whom the state carefully pulls a few privileged beings. It is certainly necessary to motivate other players, but to win such sums means what? To escape a life that one has fashioned up to now; to move not to a new social level but to a veritable new social planet, to lose old friends and acquaintances, to find oneself confronted by flattery, speculation and crooked threats . . .' But even a real tale of crookery failed to lift the national mood. The Burgundy wine scandal achieved little more than a few examples of savage Schadenfreude. This uplifting tale is based on the iron rule in Burgundy that no wine can be declassified and sold at a bargain price in order to clear stocks. Current economic conditions make this a powerful temptation. Any Burgundy sold at a knock-down price arouses tremendous interest. This customarily becomes sheer avarice among those who believe they are innocently laying their hands on stolen goods. So it was that 750,000 bottles were sold for FFr25 (Pounds 2.85) each on the basis that they were in fact declassified pommard or chablis. The fraud was perpetuated because victims did not complain for fear of exposing themselves as 'mugs'. The wine was in fact from Languedoc and Roussillon, and the regional paper, once again L'Independant du Midi, gloated. Its readers among local wine growers had long been accused of faking claret and now their products had been used in the fabrication of the more prestigious Burgundy crus. 'What a fine revenge for the producers of the Midi,' wrote the paper. 'After all, one lends only to the rich.' This opaque statement reflects a typical regional attitude vis-a-vis those who dwell in other, more privileged, regions. 'Lending' their inferior wines to those others, and trying to swindle the rest of the country, gives greater pleasure than a windfall of FFr60m. The duc de la Rochefoucauld noted 300 years ago in his famous Maxims that the misfortune of others, even friends, gives us a certain pleasure. L'Independant proves that, and the reverse: their good fortune can cause us some pain. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

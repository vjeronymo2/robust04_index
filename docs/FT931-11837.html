			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Observer: Cuckoos in the nest Just as headlines announcing 'England's collapse' are apt to alarm overseas visitors not acquainted with cricket, news of 'a plague of ruddy ducks' will probably set UK cricket fans fearing still worse developments at the Test in India. But the plague in question is striking a different sort of game, perhaps irrecoverably, and much nearer home - in Spain. For 15 years conservationists there have been working to counter the extinction of the white-headed duck. Although the species is also found in North Africa and western Asia, by 1977 the number in Spain had fallen to a mere 22. Alas, just as things were waddling along nicely with numbers up to 790, in came the ruddy ducks, which aren't even native Europeans. They originate in America, and the only reason they are multiplying eastwards is that some imported specimens escaped from wildlife centres four decades ago. That hasn't stopped them from mating like Don Juans with the white-headed Spanish. And the cross-breeding is now undoing the conservationists' good work to the extent that they've taken to shooting the ruddy interlopers. Naturally, Britain's environment department cannot stand idly by in such circumstances. So it has formed a Ruddy Duck Working Group to study the problem, funding research at centres including the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands trust  -which happens to be where the blasted things escaped from in the first place.</p>

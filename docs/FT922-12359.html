			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Slowing of jobless total boosts recovery hopes EXPECTATIONS of a move towards recovery have been strengthened by a broad increase in productivity across the economy and an apparent lull in the upward trend in unemployment. The Department of Employment said output per person in the factory sector in the three months to February rose by 2.9 per cent compared with a year previously, the biggest quarterly rise since 1989. For the economy as a whole, productivity in the fourth quarter of last year was 1.8 per cent higher than a year before, the largest increase for more than four years. Seasonally adjusted unemployment rose by 7,400 in March after a revised 37,800 in February. Although the figure took the total out of work to 2,652,300, the highest for more than four years, it was the smallest monthly increase since unemployment started rising in May 1990. Wages per unit of factory output rose in the three months to February by 4.5 per cent compared with the same period 12 months previously. This was the lowest figure since mid-1989. Across the economy, wages per unit of output rose by 5.7 per cent in the last quarter of last year compared with the same period in 1990, the smallest figure since late 1987. The 23rd consecutive monthly increase in unemployment meant that just over 1m more people are out of work since the recession started. The figure was smaller than the City had forecast. It means the average monthly increase in unemployment in the three months to March is 33,700, compared with 42,400 in the three months to February. Unemployed people as a proportion of the available workforce remained at 9.4 per cent last month, the same as in February. Ignoring seasonal variations, unadjusted unemployment rose by 3,010 in March to 2,707,477. Four regions - the north west, the north, Wales and Scotland - experienced a decline in unemployment in March. The south-east, which has borne the brunt of the recent rise in unemployment, was the worst hit in March. Numbers out of work in the region, including Greater London, rose by an adjusted figure of 7,600, pushing the unemployment rate to 8.8 per cent from 8.7 per cent. In February the index of average earnings across the economy rose by an underlying 7.25 per cent compared with the same month last year. The equivalent figures for manufacturing and services were 7.75 per cent and 7 per cent respectively. In each case the figures did not change from the comparable numbers for the year to January. Other employment-related figures included: Vacancies in Jobcentres rose by a seasonally adjusted 3,200 in March to 127,500. The past six months have seen an average monthly increase of 3,500. The workforce in employment in December last year was 25,597,000, a fall of 226,000 in the final quarter and a reduction of 997,000 for 1991.</p>

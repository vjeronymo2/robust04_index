			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Slaski fracas fails to dent Polish enthusiasm - The Emerging Investor Demand for shares in Bank Slaski remains strong as the Warsaw stock exchange continues to rise despite the running political row over the bank's controversial privatisation. Politicians, roused by a 13.5 times increase on Slaski's public offer price of 500,000 zlotys when first listed last month, have attacked the pricing of the offer, forcing Mr Marek Borowski, the finance minister, to resign. He has yet to be replaced. However, strong demand for the shares has also far outrun the technical possibilities of the country's 40 or so broking houses who have already opened about 400,000 accounts for individual investors and lack the capacity to open many more. This means that many of the 800,000 people who have each bought the 3 shares allocated in the offer are still impatiently waiting to open accounts through which they will be able to sell their stock and take a profit. The Securities Commission, headed by the unbending Mr Leslaw Paga, has meanwhile taken away Slaski's broking licence, accusing the the bank of mismanaging its own privatisation. At the same time the state prosecutor is investigating the possibility that the bank delayed confirming share ownership by outside investors. This favoured its own employees who were in a position to sell their shares on the first days of trading when the price, because of low supply, was so high. Late last week, in a bid to deflect criticism, the Slaski supervisory board replaced the officials responsible for the broking operation. The bank, 26 per cent of whose equity was bought in the privatisation by the Dutch ING group, is also appealing against the decision to take away its licence which means that some 65,000 investors will have to go to other, already overworked, houses. This has not dampened investor enthusiasm for the exchange whose WIG indicator, which reflects the capitalisation of the 23 stocks quoted three time a week on the floor, looks set next week to break through the 20,000 mark compared to only 1040.7 a year ago. The fracas, however, has not affected prospects for rights and new share issues now coming to the market. The Export Development Bank, which has now closed its 500bn zlotys rights issue, saw potential demand strong enough to have raised twice that amount. Similarly, analysts expect the Exbud construction company, despite disappointing 1993 results, to reach its 3m new shares target - raising some 480bn zlotys in an offer underwritten by three banks, including Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The Swarzedz furniture factory is seeking to place 1m shares priced at 280,000 zlotys. The offer is at the head of a queue of companies due to come to the market over the next six months either as a private flotation or a disposal by the state. For example, Sankt Annae Bank, a Danish investment bank, is preparing six companies for a listing and the Securities Commission is presently examining a score of prospectuses. The attitude of foreign investors, who are said to account for a tenth of daily turnover and 25 per cent of capitalisation, is mixed. According to one custodian bank, foreigners mostly took profits in February. Mr John Presland, of ING's Hanseatic Investment Services in Warsaw, agrees up to a point: 'Everyone accepts that the stocks on the WSE with an average p/e of 34 are overpriced and those who invested last year have been taking profits', he says, 'but those investment funds which didn't do anything last year have now noticed the market are now interested in coming in'. This provides an opportunity for Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy, one of the country's largest banks and the next state bank to be privatised. The finance ministry had been hoping to sell the bank by June but the lack of a new minister means that this could be delayed. 'Strategic decisions have to be taken by mid-March if the timetable is to be kept to,' a senior finance official said. Bank management, headed by Mr Janusz Quandt, is in favour of having several leading investors controlling 25 per cent of the bank's equity, with 30 per cent staying in state hands and the remainder being offered to employees and the general public. The finance ministry, which had under previous regimes favoured asking foreign banks to take a strategic stake in each of the banks privatised, could now be forced to change its mind after criticism that ING had paid too little for its Slaski stake. The vexed question of price also has to be decided - should it be fixed by the ministry or an auction conducted through the stock exchange? One thing is certain. Domestic investor interest in the BPH offer is still high. The government has until the summer at least to sell the bank before the market begins to be weighed down by new offers coming to the market.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Week on week change                                           Friday   ------------------- Stock                          Country     close      dollars        %  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Magnun Corporation            Malaysia    2.6224       0.3566    15.74 Hong Leong Credit             Malaysia    8.1790       0.9501    13.14 Amalgamated Steel Mills       Malaysia    1.7972       0.2075    13.06 Technology Resource Ind.

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television THE version of Tosca to be shown between 6.30 and 8.25 on BBC2 is the one originally relayed live from Rome in July. With Domingo as Cavaradossi, Catherine Malfitano as Tosca, and Ruggero Raimondi as Scarpia it was performed on the Rome locations and at the times specified in the script. It can now be seen in one evening without breaks. If Tchaikovsky appeals more than Puccini, Radio 3 is offering Symphonies 1 and 4 in its concert series The Tchaikovsky Symphonies (7.30). The St Petersburg Philharmonic performs under Yuri Temirkanov. The situation comedy about night security men, Nightingales, which begins a new batch on C4 at 10.30, is at its best when the most absurd of fantasies are mixed with reality. The acting is extraordinarily strong with James Ellis (once of 'Z Cars'), Robert Lindsay (so good in 'GBH') and David Threlfall (unforgettable in 'Nicholas Nickleby') playing the security guards. Radio 4's series about radio itself, The Friend In The Corner (11.00), considers 1967 when the Home, Light and Third disappeared and local radio first took to the air.</p>

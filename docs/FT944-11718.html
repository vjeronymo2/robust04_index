			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kwik Save 'comfortable' with Pounds 135.6m at year-end Kwik Save, the UK's biggest discount grocery retailer, reported a better than expected 7.5 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits despite the supermarket price war. However the group, which also announced the planned acquisition of Shoprite's mainly Scottish stores, acknowledged lower like-for-like sales in the first eight weeks of the current year. Pre-tax profits for the 52 weeks to August 27 increased to Pounds 135.6m, compared with Pounds 126.3m last time, on turnover that grew 5.7 per cent to Pounds 3.02bn (Pounds 2.86bn). Mr Graeme Bowler, Kwik Save's chief executive, said the group had continued to make steady progress 'in a period when the UK food retailing industry experienced the most competitive trading conditions for many years'. Mr Bowler brushed aside concerns that Kwik Save faces growing competition from the limited range price discounters on one side and the superstore chains on the other. 'If this is being squeezed,' he said, 'then I am comfortable with it.' The growth in full-year sales mainly reflected the opening of 70 new stores during the year, taking the total to 861. Volumes rose just 1.3 per cent but the combined effects of lower grocery prices and customers trading down meant net like-for-like sales fell 0.3 per cent. Highlighting the continued difficult trading conditions, Mr Derek Pretty, finance director, said that in the eight weeks following August 27 total sales rose by just 2 per cent. Like-for-like volumes, including the effects of trading down, were 2 per cent lower. This, together with selling price deflation of over 3 per cent, meant the like-for-like sales value was down by more than 5 per cent. Even so, Mr Bowler insisted that 'underlying volumes are pretty solid'. For the full year gross margins improved by 0.1 per cent, mainly reflecting a better margin mix and improved buying-in prices. Group operating profits increased 7.3 per cent to Pounds 135.5m (Pounds 126.3m), despite a 25 per cent increase in depreciation charges to Pounds 39.6m, which reflected the introduction of a provision for depreciation on freehold and leasehold property. Rental income from concessions within Kwik Save stores selling fresh foods increased by 15.6 per cent to Pounds 23.7m, while net interest costs were little changed at Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 200,000). Group capital expenditure for the year was Pounds 100.3m (Pounds 103.2m). New store development continuing to account for the bulk of this spending and is projected to rise to Pounds 115m this year. Despite competitive trading conditions, Mr Bower said the group would continue its aggressive store-opening programme, with the target of adding another 80 stores this year. Earnings per share increased 3.2 per to 57.29p (55.49p), held back by a higher effective tax charge which increased from 32.1 to 34.7 per cent. The recommended final dividend is 13.85p (12.9p), bringing the total for the year to 19.25p (18.3p), up 5.2 per cent.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Management: In from the cold - Electrolux is delighted with its Hungarian purchase Electrolux is that rare breed: the contented multinational investor in Hungary. The Swedish white goods producer bought Hungarian refrigerator maker Lehel outright in 1991 and already has results to show for its acquisition. 'We can't complain,' says Anders Scharp, chairman and chief executive of the Electrolux group, which this week reported better-than-expected third-quarter profits. At Lehel, Electrolux managed to boost pre-tax profits by 16.6 per cent to Ft950m (Pounds 6.4m) in 1992 and held sales steady. Production, 665,000 units in 1992, is expected to hit 1m by mid-decade. Each employee produced about one unit a day in April 1991. By October 1993, volume per man-day was 1.8, not far short of a west European worker's daily output of about two. 'The potential for productivity improvement was amazing,' says Heikki Takanen, a senior Electrolux manager and deputy chairman of Lehel. Electrolux agreed in March 1991 to buy state-owned Lehel and its factory complex at Jaszbereny on the Hungarian plain for about Dollars 50m (Pounds 34m). It was part of the Swedish group's effort to be as strong in eastern Europe as in western, where it is the largest producer of white goods. At the most brutal level, Electrolux has improved productivity by cutting the Lehel workforce from 4,800 at the time of the takeover to 3,200. The Swedish company has divested non-core businesses and dismissed employees from the central fridge-making activities, too. Administrators have borne the brunt: Electrolux has reduced its number from 250 to 120. As Lehel's extended hierarchy has shrunk, top managers and shopfloor workers have come into closer contact. Tibor Kertesz, managing director of Lehel, queues with manual workers at the canteen. His predecessor rarely visited the shopfloor. But Electrolux executives must still penetrate a thick layer of distrust accumulated over decades of secretive management. Employees used to learn what the company was up to through speculation and the media. Electrolux has resorted to any means to communicate: newsletters, meetings - and even the truth. Electrolux appreciates that top management, however passionately they communicate, cannot run everything. 'Sometimes you have to tell people that you don't know,' says Kertesz. Electrolux therefore places as much emphasis on 'horizontal' as on 'vertical' communication. 'What we brought here was a culture - a culture of openness and cross-functional communication,' says Takanen. Marketing and production departments now have monthly meetings, for example. Before, in the first quarter of 1992, demand dropped. Sales did not inform production. Lehel's managing director remembers: 'They went on producing without realising what had happened.' Electrolux has delegated, too. Managers, while fewer, have gained more freedom to manage. The company has committed more to training than is customary in its acquisitions. Takanen claims the policy has unlocked potential, particularly among middle management. Electrolux executives privately believe they have managed Lehel's transformation effectively. More so, for example, than General Electric of the US at Tungsram, which experienced something of a culture clash. Outright ownership helped. Electrolux was the first western investor to take 100 per cent of a Hungarian state company. That gave the firm the freedom to tackle restructuring as it saw fit. Takanen is convinced: 'It makes all the difference. I would be very reluctant to enter into a minority position. To make the changes we are making you need to be in full control.' But disguising this iron fist is a velvet glove. Electrolux has grown through takeovers and its experience has taught it one lesson above all. 'Be humble,' Leif Johansson, president of the Electrolux group, advises. 'People do things differently in different countries. One has to be humble to adjust to that - and even like it.' Electrolux's modesty led it to rely heavily on task forces composed of Hungarians and foreigners to decide on restructuring. Electrolux kept expatriates in supportive positions beside Hungarian managers. 'Instead of putting lots of people in from outside, the Swedes that we have added have been in 'shadow' places,' says Johansson. Of 22 top decision makers, all but two are Hungarians. True, Electrolux brought Kertesz, a Swedish executive, to head the Jaszbereny operation. But he is of Hungarian origin, an emigre who fled after the 1956 uprising against communist rule and Soviet occupation. Electrolux focused first on these structural and cultural changes. 'First come the soft investments,' says Takanen. 'You have to get the values in place.' This intangible investment has not always impressed Electrolux's Hungarian employees. They initially doubted Electrolux's commitment. It took the introduction of a facility assembling vacuum cleaners to restore confidence. Skill has been part of Electrolux's success, but it owes much to circumstance. Lehel has supplied the Electrolux group with fridges since 1979. A part of the Hungarian company's exports to the west, which make up two-thirds of production, has therefore been insulated from the decline in Hungary's competitiveness. As the market has recovered Lehel's share has also rebounded. Electrolux has broadened Lehel's range and taken it into new markets. Fridges are doing well and Lehel has kept about two-thirds of the market. Hungarian consumers flirted with imports after they were liberalised. But many have been burnt by fly-by-night operators and have returned to established suppliers whose service can be trusted. The most pleasant surprise has been consumer loyalty to Lehel. Reliance on demanding western markets acted as a healthy discipline even in communist times and Lehel earned a reputation for quality. That is now paying off. Lehel is still in many Hungarian ears synonymous with refrigerator. The badge has proved far more resilient than most Hungarian brands in the face of import competition. 'We have been successful or perhaps just lucky,' says Scharp. Electrolux may be overly modest. Insofar as western investors select what they acquire in eastern Europe, they make their own luck.</p>

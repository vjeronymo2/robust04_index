			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> COLORADO TEAM SEEKS NAME  </P> <P> If Denver is awarded a National League baseball franchise for 1993, the team  will be known as Colorado and a fan contest will determine the nickname.  </P> <P> The use of Denver in the title has been ruled out, and it's not considered  likely that the nickname of Bears will be used because of marketing conflicts  with the NFL's Chicago Bears. Several fan groups, however, have been attempting  to drum up support to keep the Bears' name, which has been associated with  Denver's minor-league baseball teams for most of this century.  </P> <P> Denver was removed as a possibility because the prospective owners want to send  the signal it will be a regional team, not the city's team.  </P></p>

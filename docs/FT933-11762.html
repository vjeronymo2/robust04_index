			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rees-Mogg's legal premise 'false' LORD Rees-Mogg was yesterday accused of attempting to 'frustrate' parliamentary legislation aimed at incorporating provisions of the Maastricht treaty into UK law. On the second day of the legal action by the former editor of The Times to block ratification of the treaty, Mr Sydney Kentridge QC, for Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said he did not dispute Lord Rees-Mogg's legal standing in bringing the case as 'a concerned citizen', but he was under a profound misconception of the constitutional role of the Crown and parliament. Notwithstanding UK membership of the European Community, the Crown retained its prerogative powers to make and ratify treaties, which had no legal force, while parliament retained its powers to decide what changes, if any, were to be made in UK law as a consequence of a treaty being signed. Mr Kentridge said under the British constitution the Crown, by virtue of the royal prerogative, represented the UK in foreign affairs and that the making and ratification of treaties and other international agreements was a power of the Crown within that prerogative. It was an important corollary of this that in the UK treaties did not have the force of law. If performance by the UK of treaty obligations would entail an alteration of existing domestic law, then an act of parliament was required to make the necessary alteration. If parliament was unwilling to make changes in UK law to fulfil its treaty obligations, then the UK might be in breach of its international obligations; but the treaty would not have altered the law of the UK, Mr Kentridge said. Lord Rees-Mogg argued that EC treaties were different, because the 1972 European Communities Act had implicitly removed from the Crown the prerogative power to enter into and ratify treaties which amend existing Community treaties. But both the reasoning and the premises of Lord Rees-Mogg's argument were false, Mr Kentridge said. First there was nothing in the 1972 act which impaired the prerogative of the Crown in its treaty-making power. Second, whereas an amendment to an existing Community treaty might alter Community law as between member states and might place the UK under an international obligation to alter the law of the UK, it did not of itself alter the UK law, he said. Mr Kentridge said it was not for the courts to intervene in matters of purely international agreement involving the Crown. There was no way that ratification of the Maastricht treaty conferred on the European Council a right to conduct the UK's foreign affairs, he said. The case continues today.</p>

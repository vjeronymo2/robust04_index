			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Most Likud leaders oppose Ari'el Sharon's plans  to run for the premiership in the next elections. [passage  omitted]    Interviewed by Qol Yisra'el, Knesset Member [MK] Yitzhaq  Shamir said MK Sharon had better find other occupations more  beneficial to the national interests rather than go on with his  conspiracies to become the Likud's candidate for the  premiership. Shamir added that the actions of Sharon, who  always conspired against his superiors, harm the Likud and  delight the left-wing camp.    Likud chairman Moshe Qatzav opposes the demand to oust  Sharon  from the Likud. MK Qatzav told our correspondent Hayim Hecht  that he supports Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu, but proposes  to him to establish a joint leadership made up of figures such  as Ari'el Sharon and David Levi.    Likud secretariat chairman Yehoshu'a Matza said that through  his announcement Sharon had ousted himself from the Likud's  ranks. According to Matza, Sharon sows dissent and because of  him the Likud was forced out of power.    MK Dan Meridor said Sharon's action was a grave mistake. The  Likud has procedures, he said, and there can be no constant  rivalry.    Moledet leader Rehav'am Ze'evi said that in order to save  Eretz Yisra'el from the PLO's claws the national camp must  present one candidate only: the man elected by the Likud. MK  Ze'evi called on Sharon to put aside his personal ambition for  the sake of Eretz Yisra'el, seeing that he has no chances of  winning and that only the left-wing will profit by the split in  the right-wing camp.    National Religious Party leader Zvulun Hammer said the  squabbling in the Likud has the left-wing camp gloating this  morning. Every possible effort must be made to attain a  dialogue within the nationalist camp, he added.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0700 GMT on 27 May  adds:  "Minister 'Uzi Bar'am said that to date the Likud had only one  candidate unfit to be prime minister, and that from now Likud  voters will have two of them.    ["Minister Ya'ir Tzaban said that one must not forget that  12  years ago Sharon led the country to the Lebanon war, and that we  paid a high price for this adventure."]</p>

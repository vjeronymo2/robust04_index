			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Europa merger delayed until after March 14 The three-way merger first proposed six months ago involving Europa Minerals, a small London-quoted finance house, and Burmine and Austmin Gold, two Australian companies with which it is already closely involved, will not be able to take place until after March 14. Mount Edon Gold, another Australian group which has made a rival bid for Burmine, is appealing against a decision of the Australian Supreme Court and, consequently, the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal has ordered Burmine not to put any resolution to its shareholders to approve the three-way merger until after a hearing on that date. Mount Edon is appealing against an ASC decision preventing Mount Edon from voting its 22.6 per cent stake in Burmine when the three-way merger comes up for shareholder approval. Burmine, for its part, has also appealed against the ASC decision, claiming that the proposed merger should not be conditional on shareholder approval at all. The Mount Edon offer for Burmine is due to expire on January 21. The contest is made even more complex by the fact that Mount Edon also has a 19.9 per cent shareholding in Europa while Europa already owns 38.5 per cent of Burmine and Austmin holds 19.8 per cent of Europa. Henry Ansbacher, the UK merchant bank, owns 12.8 per cent of Europa.</p>

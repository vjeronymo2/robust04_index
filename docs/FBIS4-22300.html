			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eduard Limonov, chief grenade launcher of NOVYY </F> VZGLYAD: "A Hand Grenade for Zhirinovskiy"]    [Text]  <H5>  Zhirinovskiy the Immigrant </H5>   "Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the ultra-nationalist and winner of  the Russian elections, could have been an Israeli citizen."  Baruch Gur, a leader of the Jewish Agency responsible for the  immigration to Israel of Jews from the USSR, declared on Sunday  (26 December) that Zhirinovskiy, who is today considered a  well-known anti-Semite, once took steps to emigrate to Israel.  The leader of the nationalists forwarded papers confirming that  his father, Volf by name, had been a Jew. "It was perfectly  clear that his father was a Jew," Mr. Gur confirmed. "In 1980 V.  Zhirinovskiy was an active member of the Shalom Jewish culture  group and he worked actively in a group of Soviet Zionists up to  1989, that is, two years before offering himself at the Russian  presidential elections in 1991." I came across this piece in the  very popular newspaper LE PARISIEN in the issue for 28 December  last. The piece is headed "ZHIRINOVSKIY WANTED TO EMIGRATE TO  ISRAEL."    On 29 December this same piece (its source is a REUTERS  dispatch: "Interview With Baruch Gur in Israel") was published  by LE MONDE. The LE MONDE version specifies that Zhirinovskiy  "took the first steps toward emigration to the Jewish state in  1983." In the evening of 3 January, in response to the question  put directly by the anchor of French Television's Channel 1:  "Was your father a Jew? You wanted to leave for Israel?"  Zhirinovskiy declined to answer.    This news left French public opinion, the "right,"  thunderstruck. I confess that I myself am catching it now for it  was I who had taken it upon myself to introduce Zhirinovskiy to  the French right and had organized his meeting with Jean-Marie  Le Pen, president of the National Front, in September 1992.  Censure has been rained down on me for the fact that I  introduced to their environment "a Jew posing as a Nazi." While  leaving this definition to the conscience of my accusers, I am  forced to agree that a Jew masquerading as a Russian nationalist  is an extremely unhealthy, pathological phenomenon. How all of  us (the electorate, Russia, Vladimir Volfovich himself included)  will extricate ourselves from this pathological business I  cannot imagine.    Nonetheless, I shall cite several exculpatory facts in my  defense.    I was never a member of the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party].  I  was a member of Vladimir Volfovich's shadow cabinet for just  several months. I left Zhirinovskiy without a scandal and  formed, having united with dissidents of his LDP (they include a  good half of the shadow cabinet: Kurbskiy, Arkhipov, Zharikov,  and even A. Mitrofanov, who is now very close to Zhirinovskiy),  the National Radical Party back on 22 November 1992. Why did I  leave Zhirinovskiy? The LDP is Vladimir Volfovich alone, and the  party members, his mute servants. Back at the time of the joint  trip to Krasnodar Kray and while observing him daily during the  trip to Paris I ascertained little by little that alongside  undoubted political talent there happily reside in Zhirinovskiy  total unscrupulousness and political recklessness. For example,  while promising loudly at a mass meeting in a Cossack village  clubhouse to rid the Cossacks of the Armenian mafia, he swore  the following day in my presence to a representative of the  Armenian mafia to defend Armenian interests in exchange for cash  transactions beneficial to the party. After hundreds of such  instances, I realized that Zhirinovskiy is an adventurer. But we  were all involved in the common struggle against Yeltsin, and I  did not, therefore, consider myself entitled to attack an ally  at that time.  <H5>  Simply Theater! </H5>   An article by Lev Aleynik from Moscow appeared on 15 January  1993 in the newspaper RUSSKAYA MYSL, which is published in  Paris. It adduced information to the effect that Zhirinovskiy  had several years ago been an activist in the Jewish movement.  "Stored at the Shalom Theater," Aleynik concludes his article,  "where the vaad is still billeted, are the archives of the  Jewish movement, which had emerged from the underground. There  is among the multitude of documents the first actual list of  telephone numbers of the board (of the Jewish Culture  Society--E.L.), which had just been elected. There figures on  this list beneath the number 12 the present 'defender of the  Russians' Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy." Aleynik's article  dealt the final blow to my belief that Zhirinovskiy is a  politician. A man who in several years had swapped three  ideologies--and mutually inimical ones at that! (following his  unsuccessful career as an active Zionist, he was for some time a  "democrat" also)--is undoubtedly an adventurer, I said to  myself. And I wrote last February the article "Perversions of  Nationalism," part two being headed "Miscarriage of  Nationalism." The article was devoted entirely to Zhirinovskiy  and my relations with him. Publication of the article against  the "lawyer" in the complex world of patriotic and democratic  newspapers was a difficult business. Many editors refused to  publish it. PRAVDA held up the article all summer. Only toward  the end of summer was it finally carried in NOVYY VZGLYAD No.  117. Unfortunately, NOVYY VZGLYAD is distributed mainly in  Moscow, and the influence of "Perversions of Nationalism" was  limited, therefore. Zhirinovskiy did not fail to respond to me,  carefully skirting his Jewish activism, in NOVYY VZGLYAD also.  <H5>  Point Five </H5>   Today, when the West has itself been preoccupied with  Zhirinovskiy's nationality, no one can censure me for racism,  and it is possible to reflect without encumbrance on the history  of Vladimir Volfovich--shameful for Russia and Russians. Whereas  the nationality of Gaydar is a matter of indifference to me and  it is all the same that he is an exponent of nonnational,  mondialist ideas, the nationality of Vladimir Volfovich and his  papa--Volf--is important. A Jew masquerading as a Russian  nationalist--THIS is a sickness, pathology, THIS IS TOO MUCH. It  is the sickness simultaneously of both Vladimir Volfovich and  Russian society. Each time I see him, reddish-haired and  vulgarly arguing with a small-town accent about "Russians," whom  he will defend and fix up, I am repelled, so unnatural is the  part he is playing (I would like to know how the leaders of the  extreme-right parties of Western countries, whom he has only  just embraced, feel. The Germans?).    But what has happened is by no means an accident but a  tragi-comic normality. If the Ivanovs themselves cannot organize  in a nationalist party, there will always be a adroit native of  Minsk, Pinsk, or Alma-Ata [Almaty] who will conceive a desire to  take advantage of their national passions. It is clear that  Vladimir Volfovich is in a state of panic fear. For he knows  that if the news media pick up on, if they conceive a desire to  pick up on, the information unearthed in Israel and the Shalom  Theater and if they assemble into a single pile the evidence of  his Zionist activism comrades, Russians will understand that  Vladimir Volfovich is a political operator and that he should  not be on the political stage, and he will be swept away  forever. In any event, the saber or the Cossack's pike is the  lot of all false Dmitriys. But Vladimir Volfovich's impudence is  stronger than his fear.    Meanwhile we will see the struggle of Vladimir Volfovich and  Boris Nikolayevich (even if they become allies). Beware,  Vladimir Volfovich, Boris Nikolayevich, he has bested Mikhail  Sergeyich and Aleksandr Vladimirovich (Rutskoy) and even Ruslan  Imranovich, also an eastern individual, like yourself. And Boris  Nikolayevich has tanks....  <H5>  Fire-Breathing Dragon </H5>   The backstage of politics is unknown to the voter. He is not  a frequenter of it, he is not admitted there. A pity, because  the future has already existed in the past and has only been  hiding, undeveloped, here backstage, but it, the future, could  have been seen here at the start of 1992 even. All today's  contradictions have already existed. Even then the moderate-pink  Zyuganov was driving out the bright-red heroic Anpilov from the  meetings of the "respectable" opposition. Even then the shifty  Vladimir Volfovich was receiving his first money from  sympathetic businessmen--boy bankers in colored coats--and those  whom the Yeltsinites had short-changed in the shareout of the  plump pie--Russia.    In order to understand what the future has in store for us  we  need first of all to have a correct view of our present. Those  who are happy with the result of the elections--"Gaydar and his  Yeltsin team really got a faceful!"--are rejoicing in vain. And  the nationalists have to see, despite the clear weakening of the  president's "boys in pink pants," the next disturbing reality:  The antinational forces have increased both in importance and in  power and that this dragon now has three heads. Onto the lisping  and guttural Gaydar-Yavlinskiy-Yeltsin demo-head have adhered  fast on heavy necks two new ones. The boffola physiognomy of the  Zhirinovskiy-Kashpirovskiy self-interested persons bares its  teeth in all its vulgar obscenity: "Zhirinovskiy and Russia  Corporation," the head likes to gorge! The pink, replete,  "weak-communist" head elongated by the tie and gray suit of the  deputy and ex-apparatchik of the CPSU, peaceably dissembles,  yawning, the head of the Communist Party of the Russian  Federation. But there flash in the yawn now and again sharp  little teeth. The fact that the heads fight one another from  time to time means absolutely nothing. These are the heads of a  single beast.    The smashing of parliament was a major defeat for the  nationalists and, consequently, Russia and Russians. We should  not, pouting with hysterical fervor, be trying to prove the  opposite. Yes, a defeat, a rout. Parliament contained an  ill-assorted crowd of fellow travelers united only by a common  opposition to Yeltsin and Company. There was no chief, there  were leaders (and all leaders are, for the most part,  accidental). There were no weapons. There were few--yes,  few--people resolved to fight and capable of fighting. And only  the national radicals were both capable and resolved. The  nationalist youth. The authorities ascertained unerringly who  posed a physical danger to them and, immediately following the  smashing of parliament, banned some of the radical parties.  Another part was captiously sifted through the malicious sieve  of the Central Election Commission.... The result: 13  nationalist parties and associations were not admitted to the  electorate. Yet "our" Zhirinovskiy and the mild slate of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation headed by Zyuganov  were admitted.    For a whole year--from the fall of 1992--Vladimir  Volfovich's  behavior was exemplary. He took part like a well-behaved  schoolboy in the work of Yeltsin's Constitutional Commission. He  did not take part in the events of 21 September-4 October. True  to the instinct of the self-interested person, he attempted on  each occasion to sell himself to both, it is true: He grieved  over "the best officers who died at the White House" and in  another speech justified the actions of the president.  Zhirinovskiy had by the time of the elections arrived wholly as  one of them, a useful ally of Yeltsin for the adoption of the  constitution, and for this reason the Central Election  Commission turned a blind, benevolent eye to the lists of  signatures for nomination of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia].  <H5>  Janus Wolfovich </H5>   Few people have noticed this, but Zhirinovskiy has always  cultivated two images simultaneously. Because there are  two Zhirinovskiys: for the rich and for the poor, if  you like. The LDPR's official program (all versions, including  Zhirinovskiy's draft Constitution of Russia and a concise  exposition of the principles of the LDPR, are dated April 1993)  is a respectable democratic program, which promises both  privatization and the transfer of title to the land. The fact  that "the LDPR is a party that rejects shock therapy" sways no  one today because it, the shock, is rejected now by both  Yavlinskiy and Chernomyrdin himself. The fact that the LDPR "is  for the gradual reconstitution of the Russian state" is also a  trite statement in 1994. It is, on the other hand, very  interesting that clause 2 of the Constitution of Russia of the  LDPR reads: "All power in Russia belongs to the people, which  exercise it...." Which people, Vladimir Volfovich? There is no  place in your constitution, as in Yeltsin's also, for the  Russian people. But Russians constitute 85 percent of the  population of Russia, it is they who created Russian  civilization and the state. How can this be? This, for  comparison, is how the Constitution of the French Republic  begins: "The French people solemnly proclaim...." The point is  that the LDPR program was written not for Untermenschen (let  them sit quietly, they have, after all, been told that they will  be defended by the brokers and second-hand dealers! "Russians  and the small peoples on the territory of Russia and the USSR"  will be defended by the "Zhirinovskiy and Russia Corporation")  but was written for the boy bankers in colored coats. One such  boy, in green, paid for the visit of Zhirinovskiy and his team  to Paris in September 1992. On that visit, incidentally,  Zhirinovskiy called me one morning and expressed a desire to  meet with... Rothschild! "Which one?" I asked. "There are dozens  of Rothschilds...." "The main one, the banker"....    The LDPR program does not encroach on the social reality  engendered by Yeltsin and his "boys." Crowds of poor people and  Mercedes and dying plants, where the workers have not received  their wretched wages for several months, and commercial banks,  which are being built like mushrooms after a bloody rain, will  in the same way coexist. Only the national president will be a  former Jewish activist, not a former secretary of the Central  Committee.    For the Untermenschen, on the other hand, for the people,  who  are not in the constitution even, Zhirinovskiy employs another  program--of stupefaction. Geopolitical daydreams evoked on  television. Russians appear in them, but as... the soldier  Vladimir Volfovich. These soldiers are washing their boots in  the waters of southern seas, avenging Vladimir Volfovich, and  declaring war on Germany. They are threatening Poland, China,  Iran, Turkey.... They are threatening Japan with a repetition of  Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Vladimir Volfovich has for three  years now been promising to slip the Balts radioactive waste.  All these totally impracticable pieces of high-sounding nonsense  (it would be difficult to cope even with Ukraine were matters  really to reach the point of war) are evoking a response in  Russian hearts (they did so both in June 1991 and in  November-December 1993). Humiliated since 1985, the Russian  electorate has with pleasure given itself over to nostalgic  daydreams about lost power, about imperial might. Participating  unwittingly in the performances of television nostalgia  abundantly paid for by the boy bankers, the Russian electorate  generously showed Zhirinovskiy and his corporation its  gratitude. But all this is fraudulent, daydreams for the poor.  Zhirinovskiy is no more the enemy of the West than Yeltsin. One  Samuel Francis writes in THE WASHINGTON POST of 28 December 1993  in the article "We Are Turning Zhirinovskiy Into an Arch-Enemy  Wholly Without Cause": "It is possible that Mr. Zhirinovskiy is  an enemy, and we should then be his enemies, but, his crude  mouth aside, he has up to now done nothing against the United  States or, generally speaking, against anyone else either."  <H5>  Backing the Wrong Horse </H5>   Whereas Zhirinovskiy is today a greater evil for Russia than  Yeltsin, the third head of the beast is less dangerous. It is  dangerous only in that it wants some power and will bite to  death for it! I want to say to Zyuganov: "Gennadiy Andreyevich!  Stop calling yourself a communist! Stop exploiting the communist  voter! The basis of communist doctrine are two fundamental  concepts: proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the  proletariat. You and your party of gray suits, on the other  hand, have long since jettisoned in practice the dictatorship of  the proletariat and proletarian revolution. Without them,  though, you and your hierarchy of former and present  nomenklatura types are, at best, compromisers and social  democrats, at worst, impostors, not communists. And in the Duma  you will logically be accomplices of either Yeltsin or  Zhirinovskiy. Neither is honorable." In November, in the area of  Krasnaya Presnya, I saw traced out on a fence in red letters:  "Zyuganov, where is your brother Anpilov?" This says it all. The  Red Brigades in Italy once went even further. They would  knee-cap professionals of the "red bourgeoisie," crippling them  for life. Considering them bigger enemies than the ruling  Christian Democrats. Since the "red bourgeoisie" had betrayed  the proletariat.    The unsophisticated Russian electorate has backed the wrong  horse repeatedly. After the first clash with the "democratic"  Special Militia on Tverskaya on 23 February 1992, the people's  masses, beaten by democratic nightsticks, poured from the  demonstration and cursed among themselves, admitting that they  had voted in June 1992 [dates as published] for Yeltsin. "We  brought it on ourselves." It had taken the people seven months  to understand their mistake. Watching the small-town bazaar, the  Sholom-Aleykhem play put on in the State Duma by the "defender  of the Russians," possessed with megalomania and having lost his  head at his success, and his team of "ites," how much time will  you need, blind ones, to recover your sight? To understand that  Vladimir Volfovich wants to meet Rothschild.</p>

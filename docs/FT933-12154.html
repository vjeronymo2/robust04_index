			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Cardiff Bay development project Associated British Ports has awarded a Pounds 14m contract to TAYLOR WOODROW CONSTRUCTION SOUTHERN to build a new headquarters and related infrastructure for NCM Credit Insurance at Cardiff Bay. Grosvenor Square Properties Group, the property development subsidiary of Associated British Ports Holdings, won the 119,000 sq ft pre-let for the building against stiff competition last August, following NCM's decision to relocate from Cardiff city centre. The project has been designed by Cardiff-based Holder Mathias Alcock and London architects Nicholas Hare for client Associated British Ports. It is located at Capital Waterside, the former Roath Basin which is to become Cardiff Bay's leading commercial property centre. The NCM building is to be situated on a prime position overlooking the inner harbour at the junction of Harbour Drive and Britannia Quay, and is designed to reflect the maritime setting. A key design feature is the air conditioning system, which is based on the displacement ventilation principle. Completion is scheduled for the end of next year.</p>

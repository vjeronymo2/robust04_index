			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: TV-am at Pounds 9m despite reorganisation charges TV-AM, the breakfast television company that was outbid in last year's tenders for new franchises, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.05m for the six months to June 30. The outcome compared with Pounds 6.72m last time and was achieved despite the depth of recession in the television advertising market. Turnover dipped from Pounds 39.6m to Pounds 37.7m. The profits rise reflected a reduction in Exchequer Levy and cuts in costs as the company slowly runs down towards December 31 when it ceases to be an ITV broadcaster. However, reorganisation costs and the inevitable redundancies led to an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.57m and the company warned that there would be additional costs of a similar nature when it reached the end of the franchise. Mr Bruce Gyngell, chairman, said: 'All our energies over the final months of the franchise are committed to maximising revenue, minimising costs while maintaining our commitment to the audience.' The interim dividend is an unchanged 4p, payable from earnings of 8.2p (6.5p) per share. It is not yet completely clear what TV-am will do in future following the loss of its franchise. It examined the possibility of bidding for the new Channel 5 but decided not to go ahead. It did, however, win the franchise for a new national commercial pop music radio station in a venture with Richard Branson's Virgin group. A number of other possible media investments are being assessed by TV-am, a company that is likely to have a Pounds 50m pot of gold when it says goodbye to the breakfast audience for the last time.</p>

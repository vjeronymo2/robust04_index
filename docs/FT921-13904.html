			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Darts beat the experts THE DIRECTORS are still in front, but it has been a very poor period for our portfolios. In July, we used four methods to construct portfolios for the private investor. After three months, three portfolios were making profits and beating the FT-A All-Share Index. But after six months, all four are losing money and are lagging behind the All-Share, which dropped just 2.7 per cent over the period. To the amateur investor, the most encouraging news must be that the experts' portfolio has now fallen behind the dartboard portfolio, which was chosen by throwing darts at the share price pages of the Financial Times, making a random selection of shares. The dartboard portfolio was the best of the four over the October to January period, despite the presence of TVS Entertainment, the television group which has lost its franchise. The 84 per cent decline in TVS's share price is largely responsible for the decline in the value of this portfolio. A number of investment trusts gave the dartboard portfolio stability and some useful income. However, one change has had to be made. Precious Metals Trust has been wound up and the proceeds were reinvested, at the behest of the darts, in EMAP, the printing and publishing company. The selections of the experts, a mixture of analysts and private client stockbrokers, suffered because of two stocks - Hillsdown and Tarmac. The demerger of Vodafone from Racal Electronics means that there are 11 stocks in this portfolio. The lead of the directors' portfolio has been achieved despite one or two handicaps. The shares were acquired not on the day the directors bought them, but just before the purchases were tabulated by Directus in the Weekend FT. The result was that many of the shares were bought after their prices had already risen in reaction to news of the purchases. Nevertheless, we wanted to buy the shares at the same price as a private investor using the Directus table might do so. Again, losses on two particular stocks, ADT and Albrighton, were largely responsible for the portfolio's decline. However, the October-January period was still disappointing, with the group showing a 15 per cent decline over the period. But the biggest disaster has to be the high yield portfolio, down 18 per cent in six months and 20 per cent over the last three. The fact that a stock has a high yield inevitably means that it carries a high risk - as investors have discovered at the Lep group, Ratners and TVS, all of which have fallen more than 80 per cent. The rationale for choosing a high yield portfolio is based on the hope that the markets will have over-estimated the risks. If companies can maintain their dividends, in spite of market fears, then investors will profit both from the high income and from a capital gain. So far, although the portfolio has the highest income and, in Anglia TV, the single best performing share of the four groups, the losers have far outstripped the winners. It is still early days, but what lessons can be drawn from the performance of the portfolios so far? The first is that avoiding losers is probably more important than picking winners. Even a portfolio of 10 stocks is not widespread enough to safeguard against this risk. The second moral follows on from the first. Given the difficulty of stock selection and the need to amass a substantial portfolio to reduce the effect of single company disasters, most investors are likely to be better off with the built-in diversification of a unit or investment trust.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        DIRECTORS' PORTFOLIO  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company               No of    Original    Current     Gain or                       shares   price (p)   price (p)   loss (pounds)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ADT                    161     623         375          -399.26 Albrighton           3,220      31          12          -611.80 Barry W'miller         769     130         134           -30.76 Evode                 1724      58          56           -34.48 Hunterprin            6250      16          16              nil Linread               1176      85          65          -235.20 Manweb                 382     262         291.5        +112.69 MY Holdings          3,333      30          38          +266.64 Stirling             2,857      35          37           +57.14 Wheway               2,770      36          32          -110.80  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Income Barry W'miller div                                        33.07 Accrued income                                            59.77 Total income                                              92.84 Total gain/loss                                         -892.99 Prices as of Jan 13 close.

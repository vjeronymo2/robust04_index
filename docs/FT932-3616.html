			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Henderson to merge trusts - Touche Remnant takeover leads to major reorganisation HENDERSON Administration is reorganising its unit trust range following its acquisition of Touche Remnant. The combined group will aim to reduce the number of trusts under management from 35 to 21 via a programme of mergers. In the majority of cases, TR trusts will be absorbed by Henderson funds although, in some instances, a TR manager will take over running the trust. All mergers will need to be approved by unitholders. At least 10 per cent must vote on the issue and, of those, 75 per cent must vote in favour. When mergers occur, investors' units are transferred on an offer-to-offer basis. Suppose you owned 100 units in fund A, where the offer price was 100p, making your holding worth Pounds 1,000 (before the cost of the spread). If fund A merges with fund B, where the offer price is 200p, you will receive 500 units. The new range of trusts divides into five sectors: UK Growth. This will consist of three trusts. Best of British, which will absorb TR General Growth, invests in well-known UK companies and will be managed by David Gillott. Special Situations will continue as before. UK Smaller Companies will be formed by merging TR's Smaller Companies and Special Opportunities funds, and will be managed by John Alexander. UK Income. There will be four trusts in this sector. Income &amp; Growth will be formed when Henderson Income and Growth absorbs TR Income and Growth and the manager will be former TR man Gary West. The High Income fund will absorb Henderson Smaller Companies Dividend and will be managed by James Henderson. The remaining trusts, Extra Income and Preference &amp; Gilt, will be run as before. International. A big change here with TR Worldwide Special Situations, TR Overseas Growth &amp; Henderson Global Resources all being merged into Henderson International, run by Rupert Carnegie. The former Henderson Fixed Interest fund is changing its name and objectives to become the Global Bond fund under Ian Dickson. The other two international funds, Global Technology and Family of Funds, are not changing. US. The TR American Growth will be absorbed by the Henderson American Smaller Companies fund, run by Davina Walter. The other fund in the sector, North America (managed by Chris Galleymore) invests in larger US companies. Far East. A big merger in this sector with TR Far East Opportunities, Spirit of the East and Henderson Australian being absorbed by the Asian Enterprise fund. Asian Enterprise, run by Heather Manners invests in Asia, excluding Japan. The TR Japan Growth fund is also merging into Henderson Japan, managed by Michael Wood-Martin. Henderson's other two trusts in the area, Japan Special Situations and Pacific Smaller Companies, will continue as before. Europe. No changes here with four funds remaining in place: European Special Situations, European, European Smaller Companies and European Income. Can investors lose out from the process? Because exchange is taking place at offer prices, one way investors could suffer would be if the bid-offer spread of the new trust was wider than on the existing holding. Another problem would occur if the annual charge on a new fund was higher than on the old fund. But Henderson says the charges on the two groups' products were pretty similar. A fund manager who takes over another's portfolio may want to sell the unwanted stocks, involving the fund in higher than usual dealing costs and affecting performance. Finally, investors also need to be know when the merged fund has different objectives from their old fund - someone who opted specifically for Henderson Australasian, for example, might not want to invest in a more general fund. Having said all that, there are far too many funds in the unit trust industry and rationalisation is inevitable. If funds are too small to be profitable, neither the investor nor the manager is likely to get a good deal. So, provided existing unitholders are aware of the possible dangers, there is little reason to be concerned about the Henderson reorganisation.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / GM wins truck crash verdict General Motors yesterday won a big legal victory when the appeal court in the southern US state of Georgia threw out a jury verdict which had ordered the company to pay Dollars 105m (Pounds 70m) in damages to the parents of a teenager who was killed when his GM truck exploded in a crash. The court decision helps considerably in GM's fight to avoid the recall of more than 4m vehicles similar to the truck which was being driven by 17-year-old Shannon Moseley. The decision will also help to head off dozens of other liability suits. Although the appeal court denied GM's claim that the jury award of Dollars 4.25m for the boy's life and another Dollars 101m of punitive damages was excessive, it ruled that lawyers for the plaintiffs had deliberately and repeatedly referred to 120 other suits involving GM trucks, without presenting evidence to link them to the Moseley case. GM had argued in the original trial that Mr Moseley died instantly when his truck was hit in the side at high speed. However, the plaintiffs maintained that the truck design, by which petrol tanks were mounted 'side-saddle', outside the vehicle frame, was inherently unsafe. GM produced about 6m of the C/K full-sized pick-up truck with side-mounted petrol tanks in 1973-1987. In 1988, it moved the tanks inside the frame, but said that this was for design rather than safety reasons. Last year, GM won an apology from NBC, when it proved that the television network had rigged a film purporting to show that the trucks in question caught fire on impact. The federal government last year asked GM to recall the trucks, but that decision is now being reconsidered. The transportation department is concerned that it would be setting a precedent by ordering the recall of a vehicle that had met relevant safety standards. Many of the trucks in question were sold more than eight years ago and so GM could not legally be forced to pay for their recall.</p>

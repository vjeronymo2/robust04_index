			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi exposure details emerge FERRUZZI, the heavily- indebted Italian industrial group which owes about L6,500bn (Dollars 4.25bn) of its L31,000bn debts to foreign banks, is believed to have outstanding credits of around L100bn to Citibank. Bankers say the US bank is one of Ferruzzi's biggest foreign creditors, following a long-standing credit relationship with the group cemented by personal friendships between Mr Raul Gardini, Ferruzzi's former head, and some leading executives of the bank's Italian subsidiary. It has been assumed that French banks are among the most exposed because of Eridania Beghin-Say, the Paris-based agro-industrial group in which the Ferruzzi Finanziaria holding company is the controlling shareholder. About 110 foreign banks lent money to the Ferruzzi group. The large number reflects the diversity of Ferruzzi's operations, which span farming to commodity trading, chemicals and financial services, and their international range. Apart from its strong presence in Italy and western Europe, Ferruzzi is an active trader on the Chicago commodities and futures markets and also had wide-ranging activities in Latin America. Other foreign banks believed to have lent heavily to Ferruzzi include Chase and Banque National de Paris. Neither bank could be reached for comment yesterday evening. The latest focus on Ferruzzi's borrowing, details of which remain highly secret, comes just as Mr Gardini took the unusual step of sending a lengthy open letter to the Sole 24 Ore business newspaper. In the letter, Mr Gardini seeks to defend himself from mounting criticism that he was largely responsible for the explosive rise in the Ferruzzi group's debts. Mr Gardini, who is married to one of the daughters of the late Mr Serafino Ferruzzi, its founder, was its guiding spirit from Mr Ferruzzi's death in 1979 until a family row triggered his exit in 1991. Mr Gardini, who last year mounted a challenge for the America's Cup yacht race, largely subsidised by Ferruzzi's Montedison subsidiary, claims the group's debts mushroomed only after his departure. He reveals that he was approached recently to help sort out the group's problems, but was unable to accept. Solvay, the Belgian chemical group, faced with an expected loss in the first half of 1993, aims to cut investment to below BFr20bn (Dollars 572m) this year, said Mr Daniel Janssen, the chairman of the executive committee, Reuter reports from Brussels. 'While we had an investment programme of BFr23bn in 1993, we gave ourselves an objective to be below BFr20bn,' Mr Janssen told a Belgian newspaper.</p>

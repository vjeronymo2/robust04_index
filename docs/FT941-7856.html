			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Lords push ministers into courts bill review The government last night bowed to pressure in the Lords for a review of plans for a shake-up of the administration of magistrates' courts. The concession followed further attacks by peers of all parties on the troubled police and magistrates courts bill - a key element of Mr John Major's back to basics campaign. Lord Mackay of Clashfern, Lord Chancellor, announced the review after Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, joined Conservative backbench attacks on the bill. Lord Taylor said that government plans to appoint legally qualified chief justices' clerks to supervise magistrates' clerks posed a 'real danger' to the courts. He said the proposals would blur the distinction between magistrates' clerks' roles as administrators, and their position as legal advisers to magistrates. 'There is a risk that volume throughput and economy may triumph over the interests of justice,' he said. The issue was 'not only fundamental to this bill, but fundamental to the administration of justice in this country'. He was supported by Lord Donaldson, a former Master of the Rolls, who told the Lords: 'We have to defend judicial independence at every stage. A stand has to be taken.' Lord Mackay refused to accept a series of amendments entrenching the separation of the administrative and advisory roles of chief justices' clerks. The amendments were withdrawn after he said he would 'consider carefully' the demands for changes. 'I believe that this issue is one which does merit going over more than once,' he said. Lord McIntosh of Haringey, Labour's chief spokesman on the bill, said the government had made 'a tactical withdrawal' in the face of 'great pressure' from peers on all sides. The government is expected to face more criticism next week, when the bill returns to the Lords for further detailed committee-stage debate. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has yet to decide whether to make further concessions on the contentious issue of government appointments to police authorities. An earlier round of concessions was welcomed by the bill's chief critic, Lord Whitelaw, the former deputy prime minister, but withdrawn after a hostile response from other Conservative peers. The government suffered a defeat on a separate issue earlier this week when peers rejected plans to tighten police disciplinary procedures.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWTH KEY ISSUE IN SEWER PACT REVISIONS  </P> <P> More than two dozen cities and agencies, including a sewer district serving  portions of Pasadena, South Pasadena and Alhambra, are preparing to negotiate  new sewer contracts with the city of Los Angeles that officials predict will  mean higher rates for residential, commercial and industrial users in most of  those areas.  </P> <P> The new contracts, moreover, may give the Los Angeles City Council the power to  monitor -- and perhaps stymie -- planned development in some of its neighbor  communities.  </P> <P> The upcoming negotiations represent the most ambitious effort yet to  standardize and make more equitable Los Angeles' agreements with so-called  contract cities and agencies, some of which have been dumping waste into its  sewer system under contracts that date to the 1920s.  </P> <P> The talks will also give Los Angeles a chance to bring the contracts in line  with federal clean-water regulations that have been hanging over the city's  head for more than a decade. State officials charged with enforcing those  regulations have threatened to withhold sewer-related grants from the city --  estimated at $50 million over the next five years -- if the contracts are not  updated.  </P> <P> The negotiations are not expected to begin before September, but potentially  troublesome issues have emerged in preliminary talks. Key among them is the Los  Angeles City Council's intention to use the new sewer agreements as a  growth-control tool with the contract cities and agencies.  </P> <P> The council, at the request of members Marvin Braude and Ruth Galanter, voted  this month to require all cities and agencies with new sewer contracts to  furnish Los Angeles with regular reports about zoning changes and building  permits. The council also voted to give itself, rather than city staff, control  over contract cities' and agencies' requests for additional capacity in the  sewer system.  </P> <P> Refusing such a request could thwart development in a community covered by a  Los Angeles sewer contract.  </P> <P> "The interest of the city is in controlling the regional decisions that are  made," Braude said at a recent council committee meeting. "Those are going to  be the key decisions in the next decade. . . . If the city had utilized its  power more aggressively (in the past), we could have limited the growth in the  Malibu area and prevented congestion on Pacific Coast Highway, we could have  controlled what goes on in the Marina del Rey area in a much more effective  way, and perhaps other areas, as well."  </P> <P> Los Angeles is already locked into legal disputes with several contract cities  that have refused to comply with similar reporting requirements for zoning  changes and building permits, clauses in a temporary sewer-limitation ordinance  the council passed two years ago.  </P> <P> Officials of El Segundo, Culver City, Burbank, Glendale and others have accused  Los Angeles of trying to exert too much influence over their cities' affairs.  </P> <P> "Our perception is that Los Angeles is using the (federal clean-water  regulations) to change a lot of other things in the contracts," said Ora  Lampman, director of public works in Burbank. "The Los Angeles City Council is  apparently looking for some type of land-use controls of areas outside its city  boundaries. Our position is that Los Angeles doesn't have any authority to do  that."  </P> <P> Galanter said grumbling from the contract cities and agencies is to be  expected.  </P> <P> "I can't criticize them for that," she said at a recent council committee  meeting. "It is their job to maintain as much autonomy and control as they can,  but it is our sewer system, and they are buying into it."  </P> <P> Los Angeles officials predict that the new agreements, to take effect next  summer, will earn the city an additional $80 million over 10 years, mostly from  higher sewer fees.  </P> <P> Los Angeles officials have been unable to say how much the new contracts will  cost each client community, but bills are expected to go up across the board  because the city intends to pass along costs associated with the $3.4-billion  renovation of the Hyperion sewage treatment plant at El Segundo. The expansion  and upgrading project at Hyperion, begun in 1987, is due to be completed in  1998.  </P> <P> For years, sewer users within Los Angeles and some contract areas have been  subsidizing those in other contract areas because many agreements do not  adequately cover the cost of services, officials said. One of the goals of the  contract talks, they said, is to treat all users alike.  </P> <P> "The contracts are so old they are just not reflective of the system that the  city now operates," said Jim Gratteau, head of financial management for the  county Sanitation Districts. Gratteau's agency has several agreements with the  city, including one covering western portions of Pasadena, South Pasadena and  Alhambra.  </P> <P> Representatives of Los Angeles and its contract cities and agencies have been  meeting for more than two years to prepare for the formal contract talks, which  both sides acknowledge are likely to be rocky at times. Several officials have  said privately that they expect to end up in court before the negotiations are  over.  </P> <P> "Everyone is trying to jockey for position," said one negotiator for a contract  city. "Each agency is trying to minimize its costs. The city of Los Angeles is  sitting all alone on the other side of the table."  </P> <P> Negotiations at first were to open late last year, but delays in drafting a  model contract -- to serve as the city's starting point with each of the 29  contract cities and agencies -- have pushed the opening session into September.  The delay means that the city will not be able to keep its promise to state  officials that new contracts would be approved by Dec. 21.  </P> <P> "Obviously, no one knew how complex this would be," said Fred Hoeptner, a  senior civil engineer for Los Angeles who is overseeing the talks. "It is  something you do once in a lifetime.  </P> <P> State officials, increasingly impatient with the slow progress toward talks,  announced last week that they will impose a new deadline for meeting the  federal clean-water regulations after the first round of negotiations is over.  Frank E. Peters of the State Water Resources Control Board said he may "have no  alternative but to stop payments" on grants to the city because "cooperation  seems to be dwindling" between the city and the contract groups.  </P> <P> To meet the federal guidelines, the city must base its charges on both the  volume of sewage flowing into the system and the strength of the flow. Current  charges are based on volume only, so cities that dump particularly strong  effluent requiring extra treatment pay the same rate as cities dumping waste  that is more easily treated.  </P> <P> Under the proposed rate structure, for example, Burbank would have to pay  higher fees than Beverly Hills because Burbank dumps concentrated sludge into  the Los Angeles system, while Beverly Hills dumps mostly residential effluent,  which is less costly to treat. This difference is not considered in the rates  the two cities now pay.  </P> <P> The regulations also require the city to revamp the contracts so that each  agency pays a fair share of construction, operation and maintenance costs of  the system, and that users of the three treatment plants within the Hyperion  system are treated equitably.  </P> <P> Although the contract cities and agencies say they want a more equitable fee  system, Los Angeles city officials predicted that the transition will not be  easy.  </P> <P> "The agencies are going to be most concerned about the bottom line," said  Hoeptner, the Los Angeles engineer overseeing the negotiations. "They are not  going to be too concerned about fairness and consistency.  </P> <P> "It is the dollars. . . . No matter what system is implemented, some will be  winners and some will be losers. There is no way of avoiding that."  </P></p>

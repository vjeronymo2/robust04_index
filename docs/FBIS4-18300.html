			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Kenneth Clarke by David Smith: </F> "Clarke Rejects Tax and Inflation Fears"]    [Text] [Smith] Can I take you back a couple of years and  ask you whether, before the April 1992 election, you ever  thought there might have to be tax increases during this  parliament?    [Clarke] No, I didn't think during the campaign it was  likely  there would be tax increases because I then shared the general  view that the recession was shortly going to come to an end and  we were not far from recovery. I think all three potitical  parties campaigned on the same expectation, which was reinforced  by quite a good proportion of the economic commentary we had.  Also, I didn't actually say anything during the election  campaign that has been held against me, which, given that I  campaigned fairly prominently, shows I was not too misled by my  expectations then of the recovery. But nevertheless I did not  foresee that we'd have to have tax increases as we've had.    [Smith] What was your reaction as a non-Treasury minister  when you first heard of the tax increases Norman Lamont was  planning?    [Clarke] By that time it was beginning to be clear there was  a crisis in the public finances. I believed it was necessary  for Norman to tackle that straight away because if he didn't  tackle it in that budget it would be too late. I was actually a  supporter of the proposition that he should delay the tax  increases as far as possible until April of 1994 because I was  one of those still not certain that the recovery was strong  enough then, in April 1993, to be able to carry it. Politically  that proved to be a mistake but I am not sure that with  hindsight I would necessarily change my mind because it was wise  from the point of view of the economy to delay it for 12 months.    [Smith] Do you think there is any danger that you have  indulged in overkill on tax, in two senses: one in that the  PSBR (public-sector borrowing requirement) looks as though it  may undershoot, and second, in terms of the risk to the recovery?    [Clarke] That's the serious judgment one has to make and  that  I made in preparing the November budget. I believed we needed  to do a little bit more on tax, despite the fact we'd had an  extremely effective autumn spending round. I just felt it was  necessary in November to get completely on top of the problem of  public-sector borrowing. My judgment remains that the increase  in taxation this year is both necessary to sustain the recovery  and also will not itself damage the recovery, which is now very  much stronger than 12 months ago.    You're right, the PSBR may undershoot; I always realised 50  billion pounds was an estimate but it was the best estimate  anybody could make in the summer. At the moment we still don't  know because the last month of the year can produce quite  substantial figures. But it could be a little under 50 billion  pounds. If it undershoots, so much the better. it does not  make me regret the fiscal judgment I made at the time of the  budget.    Next year and beyond? In my opinion, the Treasury has tended  to underestimate the effects of recovery on public finances.  And it could be that the decline in public-sector borrowing  might be rather faster than in the Red Book (the Treasury's  budget report).    [Smith] You were quoted once as saying the tax increases  could check the recovery. That is no longer your belief?    [Clarke] If you increase taxation it will take some of the  edge off consumer spending compared with what it would have been  if you had not raised taxation. In so far as it does take a  little money out of the consumer's pocket, I do not believe it  will damage the recovery. My forecast of 2.5 percent growth in  GDP this year is regarded as completely credible by most of the  commentators and by the markets.    I hope to see a balanced recovery so I would like to see  further improvements in investment and a good strong export  performance alongside the consumer demand we already have --  which is, at the moment, satisfactorily up compared with 12  months ago.    [Smith] Do you see this as a useful side-effect of the  necessary, as you would regard it, fiscal adjustment -- a  rebalancing of the economy away from over-reliance on consumer  spending?    [Clarke] It is a usefull side-effect but it is a  side-eftect.  It was not the principal motive. The principal motive was in  order to get healthy public finances again and to make it quite  clear that the public sector deficit was under control.    You've been suggesting recently that the impact of the tax  increases has been exaggerated, particularly by your political  opponents. Is that purely a political point or does it reflect  a concern that the public may be over-anxious about the impact  of the tax increases, reflected in the fall in consumer  confidence we've seen?    It's largely a political exchange because I do think the  Labour party in particular has been producing figures that cause  serious alarm and obviously do political damage to the governing  party. I also think that people have discounted the effect of  the tax increases to a certain extent already but, plainly, I  don't want over-the-top political campaigning to start  unnecessarily damaging consumer confidence.    I have always thought that surveys of consumer confidence  tend to reflect what people have read in their morning  newspapers. And if you look at consumer behaviour it has been  pretty satisfactory in recent months.    [Smith] You've said you will not make tax cuts for political  reasons. Can you tell me what your criteria will be for tax  cuts? Does the budget have to be back in balance before you  make any tax cuts?    [Clarke] No, we have an aim of balance in the medium term,  which I always supported before I came into office and have  continued to support since. But any further tax cuts will  depend on my judgment of the effects on the public finances, on  confidence and on the markets, and whether they would regard any  further move to improve incentives and reduce marginal rates in  the economy as responsible.    At an uncertain stage like this when a recovery is  beginning to grow, one of the key things is to build up a  reputation for credibility and confidence and, politically, to  retain the government's reputation for competence in economic  affairs.    Going back to tax cuts, I always think the public are more  intelligent than most people give them credit for. They can  judge whether tax cuts are the act of a chancellor who is trying  to win votes, or the act of a chancellor who is pursuing an  economic policy that he actually believes and thinks he is now  able to do something with genuine desirable effects on people's  behaviour. I intend to be in the second category.    [Smith] Is it now your expectation that you will not have to  make further big tax increases during this parliament?    [Clarke] You're asking me to make my fiscal judgment for the  next budget rather a long way in advance. At this stage,  comparatively soon after the last budget, I am quite confident  of the path I set out then. Also, I wouldn't be so unwise as to  be drawn by your understandable interest in what I might do in  the future.    [Smith] You did say then that the budget sorted out the  problem of the public finances once and for all?    [Clarke] That was my aim, yes. My aim was to have one budget  to sort out the problems of the public finances. I hope and I  remain confident that that will not be the dominant issue in  future budgets.    Of course I might have had to decide that I couldn't do  that.  In the autumn of last year, looking at the recovery, I might  have had to decide, well, there would have to be more than one  bite before we get on top of this. But I didn't think so, and I  still don't think so.    Here we are at the beginning of April. The next two or  three months are the critical time, which I believe will confirm  my judgment that the recovery can take it and that we will  continue on course towards our medium-term objectives.    [Smith] What happens if the recovery can't take it?    [Clarke] Given that I don't think that is going to happen,  I'm not going to speculate on what I would do. Chancellors  start earning their money when the economy starts behaving in a  way they did not expect, nor did most other people. There have  been times since I've been chancellor, particularly immediately  after the budget, when there was something dangerously near  consensus that Britain was now set for a period of sustained  recovery. If that dominant body of opinion proves wrong, that's  when the chancellor has to earn his corn, but I see no point in  speculating about it. So far, I have not got a prickly feeling  in my palms that it might happen. I cannot see what is going to  stop the recovery being sustained.    [Smith] Do you see yourself as a long-serving chancellor  and,  if so, what would you like to do?    [Clarke] I would very much like to be a long-serving  chancellor, not least because I think I was reshuffled too  quickly from my last two jobs. What do I see myself as? I would  like to see myself presiding over a sustained period of  recovery, that's obvious, all chancellors would like to. I  think I have a chance as chancellor for a few years where we  regain the strong economic performance of the mid 1980s.    More than that obvious ambition, the other thing I would  really like to do is to be a chancellor in a Treasury that is an  economic department which, alongside the departments of trade  and employment, sees itself as interested in supporting the real  economy, interested in making a positive contribution to  improvements on the supply side in this country.    [Smith] That suggests a more interventionist approach?    [Clarke] No it doesn't. Because I'm generally not in favour  of interventionism or industrial policies of the old-fashioned  kind. The way I would describe it is that it involves a wider  approach to the job. I take a close interest, obviously, in ihe  behaviour of the markets I take a close interest in all those  features of macro- economic policy which are necessary to set  the right climate here, but the real acid test of the economic  policy of the government is: how do you create a combination of  circumstances that enables British industry to become more  competitive and to become more prosperous and thereby, create  jobs and prosperity?    I do tend to judge the impact of what I am doing by thinking  what is this doing to help those people responsible for managing  British industry, selling British goods and services and  creating jobs in this country? Most people in the Treasury are  concerned with the control of public expenditure. This is the  time when they've got to be good at the job.    I have never joined publicly in the criticism of the  Treasury  in the past, so I don't see why I should now. I've done battle  with it often enough. The system of government we have in this  country does lead to a more effective system of public spending  control than most other countries. But no good business is run  solely by its finance director. This department should be  concerned with economic affairs generally.    [Smith] What about some of the issues that past chancellors  have attempted to grapple with, not always successfully; I'm  talking about an integration of tax and social security and a  bigger shift from direct to indirect taxation? Are those the  sort of challenges that appeal to you?    [Clarke] Yes but what I never do is speculate about things I  am looking at, until I've reached the stage where I want to  speculate about them publicly. I've had a long-standing  interest in the relationship between the tax and the benefits  system, and a long- standing interest in work incentives at  every level of society and their effect on people's performance,  so while I am at the Treasury I don't expect my interest to  lessen.    [Smith] Direct to indirect taxation?    [Clarke] Yes, I have always supported that, it is something  we set out and embarked on when we came in in 1979, and we've  made quite considerable advances. My public statements on the  subject I have tended to regard as a reaffirmation of the  long-standing basis of policy.    [Smith] Do you hope to repeat the technique used  successfully  last November, when you ended up with a reduction in the  spending total?    [Clarke] Well, I haven't refined my techniques yet, but we  have until July to set the spending remit again and in the  autumn we'll discover how we're going to hit that remit and  whether it's necessary and possible to beat it again. You  should never revisit the scene of a disaster, which is one rule  of politics.    Another is: never expect success to repeat itself twice in  precisely the same way. Michael (Portillo) and I will hope to  repeat the success of last year but won't just go in for a  straight replay on the assumption that it will work again. But  it was a good operation last autumn and a very necessary  reassertion of proper control over the level of public spending.    What gave me the greatest pleasure was imposing real  constraint over spending plans and at the same time preserving  stated political priorities.    [Smith] Many people in the markets say the government's  political difficulties will impact badly on sterling. You are  very much in favour of a stable exchange rate, so would you be  rather concerned about any substantial weakening?    [Clarke] Stability of exchange rates is preferable.  Political events do have an effect on the markets and if  governments are perceived to have political difficulties we tend  to see, for a day or two, an effect on the markets whatever  country you're in. Personally, I think as far as the  fundamentals are concerned that kind of thing has no lasting  effect. Were we to have any flutter in the markets I'd have to  make a judgment about whether this was just three days' reaction  to perceived political rows or whether it had any likelihood of  lasting.    [Smith] So you wouldn't necessarily respond to something  that  you thought was whatever the opposite of froth is?    [Clarke] I don't think I should. I shouldn't make decisions  on the basis that I wake up one morning, gaze at the Reuters  screen and think: the newspapers have taken the edge off  sterling, what am I going do about it? I do join in the process  of asking why this is happening, is it going to last, and the  key thing that makes it easier to react to events is if the  markets share my feeling that the fundamentals are right.    The markets have grown a little more worried about inflation  in recent weeks.    That's surprising. It comes slightly on the back of the  markets being unsettled anyway by the Fed putting up interest  rates in America, plainly as a precautionary measure against  inflationary pressures there. Then we had a bad reaction to  last week's inflation figures here. I didn't share that  reaction. They were very much in line with what I expected.  One or two commentators rosily expected they'd be even better  than they were and the markets reacted badly. Long-term  (interest) rates were very low before. They'ye now gone up quite  sharply but we wait to see.    [Smith] So you don't think, in the case of Britain, that  inflation fears are justified?    [Clarke] No. If the market has fears about inflation, I see  no cause for that.    [Smith] Can I ask you finally about your relations with the  Bank of England? You said a little while ago that you were  agnostic on the question of full independence. Has anything  happened in the intervening months to shift your opinion?    [Clarke] To change my public agnosticism? I remain on  extremely good terms with the governor and the Bank and I  operate at present so that decisions on monetary policy are in  the end mine, after listening to the Bank, listening to the  Treasury and all the other advice that pours in.    I have tried to introduce step-by-step, slightly more  transparency into the relationship. If you try to retain an air  of total mystery, all that happens is that you get idle  speculation and gossip which unsettles the market. But I'm  genuinely agnostic about the right relationship between  parliament, government and the Bank. A little more transparency  might show that there's nobody infallible in this world.    [Smith] You said you make the decisions, Are there  circumstances when you'd perhaps overrule the Bank's advice?    [Clarke] It seems to be constitutionally my role to do so if  I feel it necessary. I always say I'll take responsibility for  anything that's actually within my control. In the end, you  make your own decisions but not in any impulsive or macho way.  I continue to be more attracted by the idea of a little more  openness in the whole thing.    [Smith] So you've been in full agreement with the Bank? Some  people say that in February you wanted a half-point cut, the  Bank wanted nothing, so you settled on a quarter.    [Clarke] Speculation surrounding that decision has made me  interested in a little more transparency. At the moment we  operate on the basis of total secrecy. Nobody is contemplating  total openness because it is market-sensitive. Last February  there was the kind of half gossip which seemed to me the least  attractive. I think a quarter-point reduction then could hardly  be described as harmful.    [Smith] So if people knew the full story, they would realise  it was genuinely a collective decision?    [Clarke] All politicians believe that, if only people knew  the full story all would be for the best and the best of all  possible worlds. I actually think it was a good decision. In  this job more than most, it's when you look back and see what  actually happened that you can make the best judgment of  decisions, which is usually a fairly frightening prospect for  most chancellors of the exchequer eventually.    The timing was rather strange. If you'd decided it, people  would have said it was a politician who didn't understand the  markets, timing it on that particular day.    Well, the actual timing was decided by the Bank, on a  decision that had been taken a week before. I decided on the  reduction before the Fed increase. To be fair, I did decide  after the Fed increase not to pull it. But as part of the new  spirit of openness I left the exact timing to the governor.</p>

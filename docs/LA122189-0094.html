			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: COMPTON;  </P> <P> TRUCK FIRM GETS 2ND CHANCE TO BID ON AUTO PLAZA LAND  </P> <P> A Mack Truck franchise that wants to locate in the Compton Auto Plaza will get  a second chance to present its case before the Compton City Council on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The council agreed this week, on a motion by Councilwoman Bernice Woods, to let  Universal Mack Sales and Services make a new offer for the approximately 12  acres it wants to buy in the plaza, which is located alongside the Artesia (91)  Freeway.  </P> <P> On a 3-2 vote last week, the council turned down a $3.7-million offer from the  firm, which wants to consolidate its Signal Hill and Los Angeles operations in  Compton. The council said it would not sell the land for under the appraised  value of $4.7 million, nor was it interested, it said, in carrying a mortgage  for Universal Mack. The firm wanted to put down $1 million and pay the balance  over the next 30 years.  </P> <P> The parcel of land in question is the same one on which a community activist  group wants to build about 600 low-cost, owner-occupied townhouses. The South  Central Organizing Committee offered the city $5 million for the undeveloped 24  acres left in the auto plaza. The council, however, has said it wants  commercial development on the land.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, March 30 (XINHUA) -- A wireless  telecommunication network for animal husbandry production has  been set up in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous  Region.    As one of China's five biggest animal husbandry regions,  Xinjiang has vast grasslands with over 100,000 herders leading  nomadic lives.    As they are scattered over a wide area, it used to be  difficult to transmit information about snow, drought and insect  pests to them. In the past local herdsmen usually carried the  information by horse or on foot and that caused losses to  animals and property because of the time wasted.    In 1985 Xinjiang started construction of an animal husbandry  telecommunications network. A total of of 260 wireless radio  stations have been set up, with a total range covering over  48,000 km.    Centered on Urumqi, capital of the region, the four-level  network covers 51 counties and cities in 12 prefectures and part  of townships and farms.    The network plays an important role in reducing natural  disasters and the death rate of animals.    The network also broadcasts economic information, and  knowledge of state policies and regulations.</p>

The FEIS/MP describes the resources and uses of the Sanctuary. The FEIS/MP describes the resource protection, research, education and interpretive programs, and establishes goals and objectives to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished by each program. The FEIS/MP includes a detailed discussion, by program area, of agency roles and responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The goals and objectives for the Sanctuary are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Resource Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The highest priority management goal is to protect the marine environment, resources and qualities of the Sanctuary. The specific objectives of protection efforts are to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Coordinate policies and procedures among agencies sharing responsibility for protection and management of resources;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Encourage participation by interested agencies and organizations in the development of procedures to address specific management concerns (e.g., monitoring and emergency-response programs);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Develop an effective and coordinated program for the enforcement of Sanctuary regulations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Enforce Sanctuary regulations in addition to other regulations already in place;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Promote public awareness of, and voluntary compliance with, Sanctuary regulations and objectives, through an educational/interpretive program stressing resource sensitivity and wise use;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Ensure that the water quality of the coastal and ocean waters off the Olympic Peninsula is maintained at a level consonant with Sanctuary designation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Establish mechanisms for coordination among all the agencies participating in Sanctuary management;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Ensure that the appropriate management agencies incorporate research results and scientific data into effective resource protection strategies; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Reduce threats to Sanctuary resources and qualities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Research Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Effective management of the Sanctuary requires the implementation of a Sanctuary research program. The purpose of Sanctuary research activities is to improve understanding of the marine environment off the Olympic peninsula, its resources and qualities, and to resolve specific management problems, some of which may involve resources common to both the marine and upland freshwater environments. Research results will be used in interpretive programs for visitors, for those living on the Peninsula, and working adjacent to or in the Sanctuary, others interested in the Sanctuary, as well as for protection and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management of resources and qualities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific objectives of the research program are to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Establish a framework and procedures for administering research to ensure that research projects are responsive to management concerns and that results contribute to improve management of the Sanctuary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Incorporate research results into the interpretive/education program in a format useful for the general public;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Focus and coordinate data collection efforts on the physical, chemical, geological and biological oceanography of the Sanctuary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Encourage studies that integrate research from the variety of coastal habitats with nearshore and open ocean processes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Initiate a monitoring program to assess environmental changes as they occur due to natural and human processes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Identify the range of effects on the environment that would result from predicted changes in human activity or natural phenomena; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Encourage information exchange among all the organizations and agencies undertaking management-related research in the Sanctuary to promote more informed management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Education Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The goal for the education program is to improve public awareness and understanding of the significance of the Sanctuary resources and qualities to foster a heightened sense of stewardship for Sanctuary resources and qualities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The management objectives designed to meet this goal are to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Provide the public with information on the Sanctuary and its goals and objectives, with an emphasis on the need to use Sanctuary resources and qualities wisely to ensure their long-term viability;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Broaden support for the Sanctuary management by offering programs suited to visitors with a range of diverse interests;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Foster public involvement by encouraging feedback on the effectiveness of education programs, collaboration with Sanctuary management staff in extension and outreach programs, and participation in other volunteer programs; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Collaborate with other organizations to provide educational services complementary to the Sanctuary program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Visitor Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Sanctuary goal for visitor management is to facilitate, to the extent compatible with the primary objective of resource protection, public and private uses of the resources of the Sanctuary not prohibited pursuant to other authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific management objectives are to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Provide relevant information about Sanctuary regulations, use policies and standards;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Collaborate with public and private organizations in promoting compatible uses of the Sanctuary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Encourage the public who use the Sanctuary to respect sensitive Sanctuary resources and qualities; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Monitor and assess the levels of use to identify and control potential degradation of resources and qualities and minimize potential user conflicts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Sanctuary headquarters will be located in Port Angeles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WA with an initial satellite office near Forks, WA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cairn Energy US arm to make Dollars 34m acquisition Cairn Energy, the Edinburgh-based oil and gas explorer, yesterday announced the proposed acquisition by its American subsidiary of oil and gas assets controlled by Harvard University for Dollars 33.8m (Pounds 22.5m). Cairn also said it would cut its stake in Cairn Energy USA from 60.5 per cent to 26.8 per cent through the sale of 3m shares. At a price of Dollars 7.50 per share, the sale would raise Dollars 22.5m net. CEUSA's acquisition of Smith Offshore Exploration Company 11 from Aeneas Group, controlled by Harvard University, will give it interests in another 25 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore along the Texas Gulf coast. The purchase price, to be satisfied by the issue of 4.5m new CEUSA shares, will be subject to adjustments based on a valuation of the assets before the end of June 1995. Aeneas will also buy 2m of the additional CEUSA shares Cairn is selling, to give it a stake of 38.3 per cent. Cairn will place the other 1m shares which are traded on Nasdaq. Cairn intends to redirect funds raised from the sale to its non-US businesses.</p>

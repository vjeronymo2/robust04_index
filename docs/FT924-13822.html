			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - France (9): Lure of the City - French banks in London STRUGGLING in the recession but still determined to be significant players, France's big banks are having another difficult year in the City of London. The French are busily reducing staff and cutting costs in their UK subsidiaries, which are often at the heart of the international operations. Having increased their London presence on a grand scale in the 1980s, French banks now share the predicament of the rest of the British financial sector. If most think 1992 will not be too bad, it is only by comparison with previous years. The French were hard hit by corporate collapses such as British &amp; Commonwealth, Polly Peck and Brent Walker. Last year, the Maxwell saga proved expensive for Credit Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale. French banks came second only to the British in the list of Maxwell lenders. So far, 1992 has been quieter, but that does not mean results will be much better at the end of the year. 'Twelve months ago we believed that all the firms which would collapse had already done so,' says one French banker in London. 'We were wrong. Some companies that were relatively strong in 1991 are now far weaker.' One problem is the precarious state of the property market. Credit Lyonnais, for one, was a heavy lender to Heron and Mountleigh. It was also a big creditor of Olympia &amp; York, the stricken Canadian property group behind the Canary Wharf development, but this business was not booked in London. In the leisure industry, Mowat's demise hit Banque Indosuez. Some French banks such as BNP, Paribas and Societe Generale expect to make a profit, albeit a modest one, in 1992. Others, like Credit Lyonnais, say they will still be in the red. Unsurprisingly, the banks are now emphasising rigorous management. The days of generous lending are over. 'We do not want to develop relationships with customers based only on credit,' says Mr Denis Antoine, head of Paribas in London. 'It must be part of a broader package, together with other financial products such as swaps.' Management rigour often implies cost-cutting. BNP will employ 300 people in the UK by the end of the year, down from 350 a year ago and from 460 four years previously. Indosuez now has 205 staff, against 330 three years ago. Another common characteristic of rationalisation is a move towards better co-ordination between the banks' traditional branches and their financial market subsidiaries. Banque Paribas and Paribas Capital Markets will be housed under the same roof by December. At Societe Generale, Mr Patrick Pagni, the new chief executive of the branch, was previously in charge of the brokerage subsidiary, Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. Trying to make the most of huge bad debts is viewed as important. 'This group has to take an active role in creditors' committees, saying 'We want our money back,' just like Margaret Thatcher with the European Community,' says Mr Olivier Mas, chief executive of Credit Lyonnais in London. The scenario is not entirely gloomy. Most French bankers in London are trying to invest and develop some activities. Many, such as BNP, put the emphasis on what they see as the strongest market in the City of London: treasury and foreign exchange operations. Similarly, Societe Generale wants to focus on large and medium-sized companies with international operations. Paribas wants to develop its corporate UK client base. 'Until recently we were using London as an international financial centre and neglecting the domestic side,' says Mr Denis Antoine. 'We would like now to be seen more as a British bank.' Credit Lyonnais is more ambitious than its compatriots. In the past two years it has opened 10 branches throughout Britain, aimed at middle-size companies, and more are to come. 'The next step is retail banking,' says Mr Mas. 'We would need several dozen branches by 1995.' The only French bank in Britain with an expanding staff, Credit Lyonnais employed 420 in 1990 and has 500 staff today, with 550 forecast for the end of next year. Yet other French banks are emerging in London. Credit Locale de France has joined forces with Municipal Mutual. Credit Commercial de France is said to be looking at Charterhouse, the merchant bank put up for sale by Royal Bank of Scotland. Next year BNP may raise its 4.5 per cent stake in Kleinwort Benson, in association with Dresdner Bank. For all its present difficulties, the City of London is still a place where France's big banks feel they ought to be.</p>

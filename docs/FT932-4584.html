			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Dockyard row set to erupt again THE POLITICAL row over the Rosyth and Devonport dockyards threatened to erupt again last night as it emerged that Mr John Major will today meet Tory MPs from south-west England who want Devonport to refit Britain's nuclear submarine fleet, Ralph Atkins writes. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, demanded that he should also be able to see the prime minister to put the case for Rosyth, in his Dunfermline east constituency, to win the Ministry of Defence contract. Mr Bill Walker, Tory MP for Tayside North, also said he wanted to meet Mr Major and said Rosyth would prove cheaper. However, south-west Tories are confident the arguement is going their way. MPs believe an announcement - which could cause more divisions in Conservative ranks - is imminent, although Whitehall officials played down suggestions that cabinet would reach a decision as early as this Thursday. The government has said both Royal dockyards will be kept open.</p>

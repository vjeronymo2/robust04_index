			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastriht: Only dealers won in lira support INSTRUMENTAL in the Bundesbank and Bank of Italy's decision that the lira should be devalued was the failure of last week's huge intervention to support the currency. The attempt to prop up the Italian currency appeared to result only in bringing huge profits to interbank speculators. Operators were reported on Friday to be buying the Italian currency when it dropped below the official floor in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and then selling the lira back to the Bundesbank at a guaranteed profit when the lira rose back to the floor of L765.4 against the D-Mark. One interbank dealer said yesterday that the Bundesbank's intervention provided the market with 'a one-off opportunity' to make big profits. 'A lot of Italian corporates, fund managers and pension funds were in on the act,' he said. One European official suggested that the Italian government is the principal loser in the operation because it will probably have to buy back the lire from the Bundesbank at the old rate. The Bundesbank spent more than DM24bn (Pounds 8.6bn) last week buying the lira to keep it above its floor against the D-Mark. 'The intervention was on an extraordinary scale,' said Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London. 'It must rank as the largest intervention in a concentrated period of time by a central bank for two decades. When you consider that the Italian lira is a marginal currency, the scale of last week's operation seems all the greater.' On Friday, the lira barely moved off its floor of L765.40 against the D-Mark, and was below it at several points in European trading. However, the purchase of lire pushed billions of D-Marks into the money system, upsetting the German central bank's strict money supply targets. Analysts said the 7 per cent devaluation of the lira may seem small when the scale of the Bundesbank's intervention is taken into account. The lira was overvalued against the D-Mark by about 20 per cent on a trade-weighted basis before the weekend realignment. The size of the intervention may also worry the Bank of England, which took out a Pounds 1.7bn loan from international banks two weeks ago to support sterling. 'If the Bundesbank's intervention last week failed to support the lira, why should anyone believe that the pound will be supported by a loan of that size,' said Mr Chertkow.</p>

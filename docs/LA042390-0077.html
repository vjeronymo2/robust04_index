			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> A Tomorrow for 'Today's' Norville: Deborah Norville will remain the host of the  "Today" show, NBC officials said, denying a published report that the network  has considered moving her to the weekend evening news. New York Newsday  reported in its Saturday editions that NBC's top executives were planning to  make the change because of the show's poor ratings and network affiliates'  dissatisfaction with Norville's performance. NBC news officials blamed the  report on rumors and speculation. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

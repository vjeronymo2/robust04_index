			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, because of the futility of affording individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by a State-initiated mass change the opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal the effects of that mass change in cases involving no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disputed facts but only a claim, for example, regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propriety or legality of the mass change itself, we believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is appropriate for us to amend our regulations so as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to limit the opportunity to appeal, and the corresponding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> right to continue to receive benefits pending a decision on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the initial appeal, as set forth in &sect;416.1336(b), only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those cases involving disputed facts. We, therefore, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revising our regulations at &sect;416.1401 to define a ``mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change'' as a State initiated change in the level(s) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federally administered State supplementary payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to all recipients of such payments, or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories of such recipients, due, for example, to State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislative or executive action. In addition, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revising our regulations at &sect;416.1402 by adding a paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n) to state that only our calculation of the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change in an individual's State supplementary payment amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which results from a mass change is an initial determination,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to administrative and judicial review, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuation of benefits pursuant to &sect;416.1336(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also are revising our regulations at &sect;416.1403(a) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that a determination to reduce, suspend, or terminate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federally administered State supplementary payments due to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State-initiated mass change in the level of such payments is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not an initial determination, except as is provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;416.1402(n), i.e., only our calculation of the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the change in the State supplementary payment is an initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination. In addition, we are revising &sect;416.1403(a) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarify that the termination of Federal administration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State supplementary payments is not an initial determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The termination of Federal administration of these payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means only that the State has assumed the responsibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the issuance of its supplementary payments. The amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State supplementary payments an individual receives will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change because of the termination of Federal administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only change will be that the State will be making the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments. There will be no adverse impact to the recipients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solely due to the change. Further, we are revising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;416.1403(b) to explain that we will provide to these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipients a notice of the termination of Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration, although the determination will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to administrative or judicial review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Early in the SSI program, which became effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1974, several States terminated Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of their State supplementary payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although there have been no recent terminations, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revising &sect;416.1403 to clearly state our policy on the effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of terminations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 10, 1993, we published proposed rules in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 58 FR 42514 with a 60-day comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We received 3 letters with comments. Following are summaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of those comments and our responses to them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Claimants should not be denied the right to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge a reduction in State supplementary payments below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federally mandated levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal law does not mandate State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplementary payment levels. States are free to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those levels in amounts that they alone determine are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. In certain cases, reduction by a State of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment levels below those established by section 1618 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act may result in the loss of the State's eligibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments pursuant to title XIX. In such cases, SSA has no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to order the State to reinstate its State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplementary payment levels at or above the levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by section 1618. Accordingly, no purpose would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be served by permitting claimants to appeal a reduction in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State supplementary payment levels below those established by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1618.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations should require SSA to afford  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each affected recipient with written notice and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for a hearing, consistent with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Goldberg  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Kelly,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 397 U.S. 254 (1970), before reducing that recipient's State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplementary payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Publication of these regulations will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect SSA's current practice of first sending written notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the recipient informing him or her of the mass change and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its impact on his or her benefit amount or eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before effectuating any reduction, suspension, or termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a result of that mass change. Provision of such written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice is consistent with the requirements of &sect;&sect;416.1402(b),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 416.1404(c), 416.1413b, and 416.1336. Such notice will also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inform the recipient of his or her right to appeal the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination to reduce, suspend or terminate his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment as a result of the mass change. However, that right  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to appeal, and the corresponding right to request benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuation, will be limited only to those cases in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the individual contends that our calculation of the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the change in his or her State supplementary payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from the mass change is incorrect. Individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be informed that there will be no right to appeal the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination on any other grounds. As explained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion under Supplementary Information, we believe these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures to be fully consistent with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Goldberg  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Kelly,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 397  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. 254 (1970).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After a mass change in State supplementary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments, SSA must be prepared to carefully explain to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipients the resulting adjustment in their benefit checks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and be prepared to handle a heavy volume of calls and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests for information from those recipients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We will ensure that our notice language will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly explain the mass change that is occurring; how it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will affect the recipient's monthly payment; and how, and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what instance, the recipient may invoke his or her right to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal our determination. In the event of a mass change, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will prepare our offices to respond to an increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phone-in inquiries and will issue to those offices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructional materials to assist them in responding to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inquiries. We have initiated these actions in prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances of mass change and expect to do so again as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need arises.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Danes again bail out Faroes sinking ship: Loan accord will help stave off economic collapse for the islands DENMARK has guaranteed a DKr1.3bn (Pounds 131m) loan to the Faroe Islands to help the self-governing province bail out its two largest commercial banks. The agreement came after 12 hours of negotiations in Copenhagen between Mr Mogens Lykketoft, Danish finance minister, and Mrs Marita Petersen, Faroese prime minister. Most of the loan will go to Foeroya Banki and Sjovinnubankin, which faced bankruptcy. The accord will help stave off economic collapse for the islands as a whole, according to Mr Lykketoft. 'This step, and others to come, create a basis for putting the Faroes on its feet again. It will take a long time and it will be painful but it can be done,' Mr Lykketoft said yesterday. The windswept North Atlantic islands, part of the Kingdom of Denmark, built up large domestic and foreign debt during a period of rapid expansion in the 1980s. Denmark stepped in earlier this year with DKr1.4bn to rescue the Faroese banks, which had to write off 24 per cent of their loans. The Danes also provided DKr450m to keep the government itself from having to suspend payments. In the mid-1980s, the 47,000 islanders enjoyed one of the highest per capita growth rates in Europe. But little has gone right for the islands since then. The fisheries, which account for 90 per cent of exports, have collapsed. Over-fishing of Faroese waters by a fishing fleet subsidised to the hilt by the Faroese government is partly blamed. The steep fall in the international price of fish over the past year has added to the troubles. The decline of the fisheries industry has taken the rest of the economy with it. In the five years to 1993, gross domestic product has fallen by about 25 per cent (in current prices) and domestic demand was halved. Unemployment is about 20 per cent and would be higher but for the fact that since 1988 about 4,500 islanders, some 9 per cent of the population, have emigrated, many of them to live on social security in Denmark. Much of the islands' debt was built up in the 1980s, when bridges, a tunnel, schools and nurseries were built. Central and local governments alike went heavily into debt as investment boomed and the current account of the balance of payments went deeply into deficit. The islands' net foreign debt soared to its present level of about DKr7.9bn. or Dkr170,000 (some Pounds 17,000) per islander and around 140 per cent of gross domestic product. The government's budget deficit (including capital items), according to a report from the Danish prime minister's office, will this year run to about DKr1.5bn, some 31 per cent of GDP. Next year, the island government will need to borrow about DKr2.3bn, says the report. Some DKr1bn is in foreign loans, mainly Yen and D-Marks, which Denmark will have to refinance. How much of the rest the Danish taxpayers will have to meet is a matter for negotiation, according to an official at the prime minister's office. Until fish stocks are re-established - and fish prices recover - the islands' future looks bleak. The government has raised taxes and slashed spending, including an 8.5 per cent cut in the pay of everyone employed in the government sector this year. More is needed, according to Copenhagen, which has made the loan conditional on the Faroese government cutting spending next year by at least DKr250m. In its report, Copenhagen proposed a a wealth tax to be levied on older islanders, many of whom built up wealth in the good years, and a virtual halt to infrastructure investment. In the longer run, oil and gas from beneath the sea could be the islands' saving. BP made a substantial find in the UK sector close to the dividing line with the Faroese sector earlier this year. But a hunt for hydrocarbons by the Faroese themselves is being held up by a dispute with Britain over economic zone divisions. Even if this dispute is settled quickly, which does not seem likely, it will be a long time before any hydrocarbons in the Faroese sector can be exploited. In the meantime, the islanders will have to tighten their belts and pray for the fish return.</p>

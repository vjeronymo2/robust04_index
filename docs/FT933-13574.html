			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Estonia brushes off Russian vote for autonomy ESTONIA'S Russified north-east corner, smarting over the country's language and citizenship laws, at the weekend voted heavily in favour of regional autonomy. Early results from Narva, the industrial border town, showed 97.2 per cent of voters in favour of territorial autonomy within Estonia, the Russian Itar-Tass news agency reported. Nearby Sillamae counted 98.6 per cent. But the weight of the result may be diluted by the low turnout, reported to be 54 per cent in Narva. The Estonian government issued a statement claiming that less than 50 per cent of registered voters had participated in the referendum. Under Russian law, and former Soviet law, a turnout of less than 50 per cent would make the referendum invalid. But the Estonian government has anyway declared the vote illegal, and vowed to protect its territorial integrity. The referendum was called after the Estonian parliament passed an aliens law which many in the Russian minority consider discriminatory. The law was amended last weekend to meet concerns voiced by the Council of Europe and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, but Russian leaders dismissed the changes as cosmetic. Mr Vladimir Chukhin, chairman of the Narva city council and organiser of the referendum, told Russian radio that the vote would at least force the Estonia government to negotiate with the Russian community, which accounts for 600,000 of Estonia's 1.6m people, over the aliens law. The Russified region has always been part of Estonia. Russia last week cut off oil supplies to Belarus, the former Soviet republic which has kept close ties with Moscow, Lithuania's state news agency, ELTA, reported at the weekend. Belarus owes Russia Rbs72bn, despite a 50 per cent subsidy. Belarus paid Rbs10bn on July 15. Natural gas supplies to the three Baltic countries were cut off last month, but pipelines were opened once the states paid their bill.</p>

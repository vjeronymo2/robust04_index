			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Standards Relating to Component Stocks <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed initial listing and maintenance listing standards require that all component stocks be deemed ``reported securities,'' as that term is defined in Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the Act. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  Upon the initial listing of narrow-based index options approved for trading pursuant to the procedures contained in this order, the underlying index must include at least ten component stocks. Thereafter, the index must contain at least nine component stocks at all times. In addition, the number of component stocks may not increase or decrease by a number exceeding 331/3 percent of the number of stocks comprising the index at the time of its initial listing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 17 CFR 240.11Aa3&hyph;1. A ``reported security'' is defied in paragraph (a)(4) of this rule as ``any listed equity security or Nasdaq security for which transaction reports are required to be made on a real-time basis pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan.'' A ``transaction reporting plan'' is defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this rule as ``any plan for collecting, processing, making available or disseminating transaction reports with respect to transactions in reported securities filed with the Commission pursuant to, and meeting the requirements of, this section.'' Accordingly, a proposed narrow-based index currently can only be comprised of exchange-listed and Nasdaq National Market securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both initial and maintenance listing standards require that the component stocks comprising the top 90 percent of the index, by weight, must have a minimum market capitalization of $75 million. In addition, the component stocks constituting the bottom 10 percent of the index, by weight, must have a minimum market capitalization of $50 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The listing and maintenance listing standards also include trading volume requirements. The component stocks comprising the top 90 percent of the index, by weight, must have a monthly trading volume of at least one million shares per month over the six months preceding the filing of the index with the Commission; thereafter, the component stocks must maintain monthly trading volume of at least 500,000 shares per month. The trading volume for the component stocks constituting the bottom 10 percent of the index, by weight, must have been at least 500,000 shares over the same period; thereafter, they must maintain an average monthly trading volume of at least 400,000 shares per month. If the index is capitalization-weighted, and it contains 15 or more component stocks, the top five weighted component stocks each must have an average monthly trading volume over the six months preceding the filing of the index with the Commission of at least two million shares; thereafter, it must maintain an average monthly trading volume over the prior six months of at least one million shares. If a capitalization-weighted index contains less than 15 component stocks, those component stocks comprising the top 30 percent of the total number of stocks in the index each must have an average monthly trading volume over the six months preceding the filing of the index with the Commission of at least two million shares; thereafter, it must maintain an average monthly trading volume over the prior six months of at least one million shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initially and thereafter, no inidividual component stock in the index may represent more than 25 percent of the weight of the index. In addition, initially and thereafter, where an index is comprised of less than 25 stocks, the top five highest weighted stocks may not constitute more than 60 percent of the weight of the index; and where an index is comprised of 25 stocks or more, the top five highest weighted stocks may not represent more than 50 percent of the weight of the index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At all times, at least 90 percent of the stocks in the index, by weight, and 80 percent of the total number of stocks comprising the index, individually must satisfy the particular Exchange's rules governing the listing and maintenance of listing of options thereon. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both initial and maintenance listing standards require that no more than 20 percent of the securities in the index, by weight, may be comprised of foreign securities or American depositary receipts (``ADRs'') overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the particular U.S. options Exchange and the primary exchange on which the foreign security underlying the ADR is traded. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31529 (November 27, 1992), 57 FR 57248 (December 3, 1992) (``Release No. 34&hyph;31529''). To the extent that at least 50 percent of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying security occurs in the U.S. ADR market, the Commission has permitted the Exchanges to list options thereon without the existence of such a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. Following such initial listing, at least 30 percent of the world-wide trading volume must continue to occur in the U.S. trading market. See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33555 (January 31, 1994), 59 FR 5619 (February 7, 1994) (``Release No. 33555''). Accordingly, because no comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement is required with respect to ADRs satisfying the 50 percent volume requirement, and the 30 percent maintenance volume requirement, such ADRs may be excluded in determining whether the 20 percent restriction has been exceeded. See Release No. 33555, to determine how to calculate the 50 percent and 30 percent world-wide trading volume requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

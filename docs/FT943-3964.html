			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Poll blow for Japanese coalition: By-election defeat raises prospect of creation of New New party Japan's ruling coalition of socialists and conservatives was humiliated in a by-election yesterday, the first measure of its popularity since it seized power in a parliamentary coup 10 weeks ago. The defeat in Aichi, the heartland of the car industry, gives a symbolic boost to attempts by the 10 parties in opposition to merge into a single party, able to rival the Liberal Democratic party for parliamentary clout. Voters had condemned the coalition of the LDP with its long-time enemy, the Social Democratic party, as 'an act of betrayal' and now wanted a progressive new party, maintained Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former prime minister. The LDP joined hands with the SDP to muster enough votes to oust Mr Hata's five-party coalition government in June, so ending the LDP's first spell in opposition for 38 years. The outcome of yesterday's poll poses no immediate threat to the government, since the Aichi seat - in the upper house, the less powerful of the two parliamentary chambers - was already in opposition hands. It does not affect the political situation, said Socialist prime minister Tomiichi Murayama. But if yesterday's result does convince doubters among the opposition to join forces with Mr Hata and his allies, this will, to the relief of many, simplify Japan's convoluted politics. The new grouping has been provisionally named Shin-Shinto (New New party) by the Japanese press. The vote increases the stature of former prime minister Toshiki Kaifu, who led the opposition campaign in Aichi, his home prefecture, and is widely seen as a candidate to lead the new party. The government nominee, a former United Nations official, Mr Jiro Mizuno, was beaten by nearly 384,000 votes by the opposition candidate, a former Labour Ministry bureaucrat, Mr Yuzuru Tsuzuki, who attracted just over 925,000 votes. Mr Mizuno modestly claimed the result was his personal fault and did not represent a judgment against the government. A low turnout in Aichi yesterday testified to apathy among the voters, jaded by three changes of government in the past year. Only 43 per cent of the electorate voted, below the 47 per cent of the previous upper house election two years ago, but slightly ahead of the gloomiest newspaper predictions. The seat became vacant after the incumbent was convicted of lying about his academic qualifications in electoral publicity. The third-placed candidate, a television talk-show hostess, Ms Makiko Suehiro, played to voters' discontent by saying that her adversaries were merely indistinguishable pawns in a Tokyo power game. Mr Hata is reported to have provided evidence of that theory by mixing up candidates' names and mistakenly urging his supporters to vote for the government nominee. The government did no better. Ms Makiko Tanaka, director general of the science and technology agency, called the government's candidate Mr Shimizu instead of Mr Mizuno, at a rally. Despite the elements of tragi-comedy at Aichi, the election was significant in that it took place under conditions similar to those provided by reformed electoral system for the more powerful lower house, due to come into effect next year. This will introduce a mixture of single-seat districts and proportional representation, to replace Japan's unique system of large multi-seat constituencies. The new system aims to encourage politicians to attract voters with policies, rather than cash and construction projects.</p>

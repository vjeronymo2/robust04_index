			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Recovery in Ecu bond prices wiped out A GENTLE recovery in Ecu bond prices in recent weeks was wiped out yesterday after the devaluation of the escudo and the peseta at the weekend undermined a gradual return of confidence. Ecu bond prices fell a point on fears that European markets may have entered a further period of divergence - that is, that the gap between high-yielding and low-yielding markets is set to widen rather than narrow. 'The re-emergence of ERM tensions is a setback for the market: it means the Ecu is less likely to be the new European currency,' said a trader. Until this setback there had been increasing confidence that problems over the Maastricht treaty would be resolved within the framework of the European Monetary System. However, the Ecu bond market has some support, determined by its value relative to theoretical Ecu yields (based on government bond yields denominated in component currencies). Dealers report buying interest when the margin of real Ecu bond yields over theoretical yields widens to about 40 basis points. 'In a sense, (Ecu bonds) are a cheap option on any hardening of the Ecu, as long as they are trading above their theoretical value,' said Mr Robin Bowie, a director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in charge of European bond trading. After narrowing to 15 basis points last week, the spread had increased to 33 basis points by yesterday. Meanwhile, the market's liquidity has failed to return, since the breakdown in the existing market-making system during the summer. The issue will be discussed at the end-of-year meeting of the International Securities Market Association Ecu sub-committee on December 4. 'I expect a strong vote in favour of resumption of market-making with reasonable (bid/offer) spreads,' said Mr David Ovenden, Ecu product manager at JP Morgan, who chairs the committee.</p>

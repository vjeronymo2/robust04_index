			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Golds lead S Africa lower Johannesburg struggled for direction as an initial gold share rally quickly ran out of steam. Most stocks ended weaker in thin volume. Dealers said Wednesday's large gold share gains had been overdone and that a soft bullion price had slowed opening enthusiasm. Industrials remained lacklustre, reflecting uncertainty about Wall Street direction, a mixed performance from London and a lack of fresh factors locally. The overall index lost 15.5 at 5,758.5, industrials fell 19.5 to 6,903.7 and golds slipped 21.1 to 1,950.8. De Beers and Anglos each gave up 50 cents to R92.75 and R228.50 respectively. Gold Fields was R2 down at R120 but Gencor picked up 5 cents to R13.80. Absa extended its recent strong run, adding 15 cents at R12.15, but the rest of the banking sector was quiet.</p>

Raja Mohan: "U.S. Questions Kashmir's Status </F> as Part of India"; italicized words as published]    [Text] Washington, Oct. 29. The entire State of Jammu and  Kashmir is a "disputed" territory and Washington does not  recognise that the State's accession to India in 1947 as meaning  that "Kashmir is forevermore an integral part of India," says a  high level official of the Clinton Administration. The official  was briefing, on background, reporters from the sub-continent  here late on Thursday.    In a series of troubling remarks on Kashmir, the official, a  key decision-maker in the administration on South Asian policy,  declared that the Shimla agreement signed by India and Pakistan  in 1972 may no longer be an effective instrument for resolving  the Kashmir dispute: "It is 21 years old and there have been  very few discussions, if any, under that accord in terms of  resolving the Kashmir dispute." The official argued that "by  definition, ipso facto, it has not been very  effective."    The remarks of the Clinton administration official now  complete the comprehensive reversal of the more even-handed  approach on Kashmir outlined by the Bush administration in 1990.  In a Congressional hearing in 1990, the Bush administration  declared that the Shimla Agreement had superceded the United  Nations resolutions on Kashmir.    Responding to the popular concerns in India about the  remarks  of Mr. Clinton on Kashmir last month at the United Nations, the  official said that "it was not a signal to suggest there is a  secret U.S. diplomatic strategy to insert itself as a mediator  in the Kashmir dispute." Saying that Kashmir is on the American  radar screen along with Yugoslavia, Somalia and the former  Soviet Union, the official pointed out that it is not easy to  overlook the Kashmir problem.  <H5>  Ready to Mediate </H5>   On the question of American role in Kashmir, the official  said although the Clinton Administration is not now putting  itself forward as a mediator, it is willing to do so, "if all  the parties to the dispute want it." The official left the  reporters in no doubt that Washington considers the Kashmiris an  indispensable element of any settlement of the Kashmir dispute.  "There is no way any resolution can be stable and lasting unless  agreed to by the people of Kashmir," said the official.    Confirming the Indian suspicions that Washington is not  averse to internationalising the Kashmir dispute, the official  said the United States is now set to engage Russia in a formal  consultation on South Asia. The senior administration official,  who is visiting Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan next week,  is also travelling to Moscow to consider the development of  joint initiatives with Russia on conflict resolution in South  Asia.    On the question of Pakistani support for terrorism in  Kashmir, Washington had put a lot of pressure on Islamabad to  end such activity, according to the official. "Our view is that  there seems to be less of that going on now." Whatever, the  external support to militancy in Kashmir, according to the  official "there are very strong indigenous elements to that  insurgency." The official also declared the apparently new  American assessment of the insurgency in Kashmir, that it is  "really self-sustaining."    The remarks of the American official suggest that the recent  Indian initiatives to set up a Human Rights Commission and the  offer of the Indian Prime Minister to open a dialogue with  Pakistan on Kashmir have been the result of sustained American  prodding. Washington has pushed the government of India "very  hard to clean up their act."    Washington has demanded that the Government of India needs  to  "make the security forces accountable for their own behaviour."  "Making people disappear, encountered killings, extra-judicial  executions, death in custody, all this stuff, frankly, there is  no excuse for it. Insurgency is not an excuse for that kind of  activity and behaviour on the part of security forces."    On India's offer to discuss issues related to Kashmir with  Pakistan, the official pointed out that Washington had been  encouraging India and Pakistan to engage in a serious discussion  on Kashmir. The administration official revealed that the United  States was "pushing diplomatically" in the run up to the  elections in Pakistan that India "must turn over a new leaf"  when a new Government takes over in Pakistan.    The official regretted that the stand-off at Hazratbal has  come as an unexpected impediment to the renewal of Indo-Pakistan  dialogue on Kashmir. Urging restraint on all sides, the official  said the United States is encouraged by the Indian decision not  to storm the shrine, and called on Pakistan not to exacerbate  the situation by making provocative statements.    Responding to a question on the growing anger in the Indian  public opinion on the American intervention in Kashmir, the  official stated that such public perceptions do not negate the  broadening and deepening of the Indo-U.S. relationship. She  pointed out that "the Indian Government and Parliament have come  to recognise that their own perceptions of the standard of human  rights was not being met" in Kashmir.  <H5>  Solarz's Remarks </H5>   In a related development, the remarks on Kashmir by Mr.  Steven Solarz, the nominee of President Clinton to be the new  Ambassador to India are likely to cause some anguish in India.  At a meeting with a group of Indian parliamentarians organised  by a Washington think-tank, Mr. Solarz raised the hypothetical  question of the impact on India's stability in the event Kashmir  were allowed to secede. He referred to the two alternative  views, one stressing the damaging consequences to Indian unity,  and the other suggesting Kashmir is a unique problem, the  separation of which is unlikely to affect the unity of India.  Although posed in the form of an academic question, it may  provide some clues to the emerging mindset in the Clinton  administration on Kashmir.    The rather sharp presentation of its views on Kashmir by the  Clinton administration leaves no room for fudging and finessing  in New Delhi. New Delhi's belief that incremental concessions to  the United States on key issues could buy a more cooperative  attitude from the Clinton Administration has been, clearly, a  dangerous illusion. India is on its own in Kashmir. The  Government in New Delhi needs to demonstrate that it has the  determination and tenacity to defend India's basic national  interests.</p>

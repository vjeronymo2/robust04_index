			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Smogbuster: Ed Begley Jr., who played a doctor on television's "St. Elsewhere,"  is being called on to try to cure some of the traffic ills that afflict  smog-choked Southern California. This week Begley was named chairman of an  advisory committee to the Southern California Rapid Transit District, which  runs the basin's massive bus service and is building the Metro Rail project.  Begley, who now plays a dad on the new NBC series "Parenthood," will convene  the Citizens Advisory Committee once every three months beginning in December  to make recommendations to the transportation agency.

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Ciampi promises poll reform MR Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's new prime minister, yesterday pledged to introduce electoral reform based on the system of majority voting before the summer parliamentary recess. The former central bank governor, outlining his programme before parliament, said electoral reform was an absolute priority. But he also stressed the importance of introducing corrective measures to the 1993 budget and of drawing up the 1994 budget by July. His commitment to reform and promise of quick legislation looked likely to ensure that his government, finally formed on Tuesday, would gain the necessary support in a vote of confidence due today. Mr Ciampi is counting on the slim majority of the four parties in the outgoing Amato coalition - the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals. The main opposition parties, the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), and the populist Lombard League, said yesterday they would abstain. However, a measure of Mr Ciampi's difficulties was evident in the conflicting demands upon the government. Mr Ciampi talked of his government being 'transitional' and, by seeking to complete electoral reform by the summer recess, a number of deputies assumed that he was aiming for autumn elections. Against this, the economic part of his programme, committed to speeding up privatisation and introducing the 1994 budget, suggested the government could have a longer life. The Christian Democrats in particular urged him not to announce in advance a time-span for the government and they clearly hope he can last until next year, so allowing the party to reorganise. The same applies to the Socialists. There were significant developments in Italy's corruption scandals yesterday. In Naples Mr Antonio and Mr Lucio Cirino Pomicino, brothers of Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicio, the former finance minister and the leading Naples Christian Democrat politician, were arrested on charges of extortion. Rome magistrates arrested Mr Angelo Iacorossi, a leading entrepreneur in the oil and construction business, on corruption charges. Mr Pietro Tradico, a board member of TPL (Technologie Progetti Lavori), a leading civil engineering company, has been arrested on charges of falsification of accounts.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Bulgaria heads for elections Bulgaria appears set for general elections within the next two months following acceptance yesterday by the Bulgarian parliament of the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. Mr Berov took power at the end of 1992, leading a non-party government formed after the collapse of a government led by the Union of Democratic Forces, an anti-communist alliance. The Bulgarian Socialist party, successor to the former communist party, supported the Berov government and is expected to emerge from elections as the largest single party. A caretaker government will be appointed to govern until the elections and the Berov cabinet has been authorised to continue talks with international financial institutions for a promised Dollars 125m loan from the World Bank and Dollars 100m from the IMF.</p>

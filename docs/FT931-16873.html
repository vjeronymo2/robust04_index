			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Europe Today - The two faces of contemporary France The French enter the single market as a nation of extremes. The political agenda is dominated by divisions - between the old and the new, the rural and the urban, the disadvantaged and the advantaged - and also by the struggle of the old, centralised institutions that run the country to resolve these divisions. One face of the country is the chic, educated Parisian, who has prospered after almost a decade of socialism de lux. But there is also France of the underclass - the under-privileged immigrants who are struggling to eke out a living in the suburbs of Marseilles.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KCET TO AIR JAPAN NEWSCAST IN ENGLISH  </P> <P> As part of its growing interest in Pacific Rim programming, KCET Channel 28 on  Monday will begin airing a 30-minute Japanese newscast in English. "Today's  Japan" will air Monday through Thursday nights at 12:05 a.m. throughout the  summer.  </P> <P> The program is produced by the Japanese network NHK for broadcast in that  country. Norio Shimamura, general manager of NHK America, said that the  newscast was conceived for English-speaking foreigners in Japan and for  Japanese who are learning English, but the network found that "the quickly  changing situation in today's Far East" had created other markets for it.  </P> <P> "Today's Japan" also is carried on PBS stations in San Francisco, New York,  Boston, Pittsburgh, Miami, Dallas, Washington and Seattle.  </P></p>

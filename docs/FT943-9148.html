			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Swire Pacific first-half earnings reach HKDollars 2.05bn Swire Pacific, the Hong Kong-based property, aviation and trading group, yesterday reported a 14 per cent rise in first-half net profits to HKDollars 2.05bn (USDollars 265m) from HKDollars 1.8bn in the same period last year, boosted by property sales and steady growth in rental income. Earnings per A share increased to 129.4 cents from 113.5 cents. The interim dividend is raised to 33 cents from 29 cents. The growth in earnings, which was broadly in line with expectations, was signalled on Wednesday with the release of Cathay Pacific's profits. The airline, which is 52 per cent owned by Swire Pacific, disappointed the market with an 18 per cent rise in interim net profits to HKDollars 803m. Although expected, Swire's announcement drove the share price down Dollars 2 to end the day at HKDollars 59.75. The biggest gains came from the property and industries divisions. Swire took a HKDollars 273m profit from the sales of properties under development and HKDollars 1.24bn in net rental income. More than half the 147 apartments in the company's Mid-Levels development have been sold, at an average price of HKDollars 9,784 a square foot, or more than HKDollars 10m for the smallest, 1,094 square foot flat. The flats were put up for sale weeks before the government announced its intention of taking steps to cool the property market and three months before these measures were unveiled. In the industries division, beverages businesses in Hong Kong and the US spurred significantly higher profits. During the first half Swire consolidated its position in this field by acquiring controlling interests in the Taiwan Coca-Cola Bottling Company and BC Development Company, and integrating these with existing soft drink operations in Hong Kong, the US and southern China. Aviation was redeemed by a jump in profits at Hong Kong Dragon Airlines, which specialises in flights to Asian destinations including China. Increased capacity and improved yields at Dragon Airlines were in contrast to the higher costs and lower margins which affected Cathay Pacific and maintenance company Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company. The strong yen had an impact on the balance sheet as long-term unrealised exchange losses on Cathay Pacific's foreign currency borrowing soared to HKDollars 3.3bn at June 30, compared with HKDollars 2.2bn at the end of 1993.</p>

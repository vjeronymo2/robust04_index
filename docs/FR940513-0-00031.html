			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)(1) If the amount of the debt is equal to or is less than 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay, such debt should be collected in one lump-sum deduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the amount of the debt is not collected in one lump-sum deduction, the debt shall be collected in installment deductions over a period of time not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted from any pay period will not exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay for that period, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A deduction exceeding the 15-percent disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Whenever an employee subject to salary offset is separated from the Corporation and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, the Corporation may offset any later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets against current employees of the Corporation or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Corporation, at its discretion, may determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15-percent limitation. Debts owed to the Corporation should generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1408.40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Refunds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) In instances where the Corporation is the creditor agency, it shall promptly refund any amounts deducted under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514 when:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The debt is waived or otherwise found not to be owed to the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulations); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An administrative or judicial order directs the Corporation to make a refund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Unless required or permitted by law or contract, refunds under this section shall not bear interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1408.41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Requesting current paying agency to offset salary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) To request a paying agency to impose a salary offset against amounts owed to the debtor, the Corporation shall provide the paying agency with a claim certification which meets the requirements set forth in &sect;1408.25(a) of this part. The Corporation shall also provide the paying agency with a repayment schedule determined under the provisions of &sect;1408.39 or in accordance with a repayment agreement entered into with the debtor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If the employee separates from the paying agency before the debt is paid in full, the paying agency shall certify the total amount collected on the debt. A copy of this certification shall be sent to the employee and a copy shall be sent to the Corporation. If the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. However, the Corporation must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before the collection can be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) When an employee transfers to another paying agency, the Corporation is not required to repeat the due process procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this part to resume the collection. The Corporation shall, however, review the debt upon receiving the former paying agency's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) If a special review is conducted pursuant to &sect;1408.11 and results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the Corporation shall provide a new claim certification to the paying agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

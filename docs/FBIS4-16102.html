			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Marina Barinova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- "There is no such compound  as `red mercury' in nature, it is not used in the ministry's  atomic energy enterprises, and is not used in the construction  of nuclear weapons", ITAR-TASS was told on Thursday by Georgiy  Kaurov, head of the public relations department of the Russian  Atomic Ministry.    He said that scientists and specialists from the Atomic  Ministry had already made similar statements many times.  Apparently, it would not hurt to make one more: Russia does  carry out research in the field of thermonuclear synthesis of  heavy hydrogen isotopes, however, such research has absolutely  nothing in common with "red mercury".    Kaurov announced that in the ministry's opinion, Wednesday's  report by the REUTER news agency that Russia has a "miniature  neutron bomb", developed by Russian scientists on the basis of  "red mercury", and the English television film about the  "Russians' discovery" are cheap efforts to create a sensation  and have political undertones.</p>

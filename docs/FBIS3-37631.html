This was declared at a news-conference in Almaty on Monday by  Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev.    In his opinion, the main accord -- a charter on democratic  partnership between Kazakhstan and U.S. -- puts bilateral  relations on a new level in terms of quality. It contains  guarantees of the republic's security from U.S. and Kazakhstan's  participation in multilateral cooperation within NATO's program  "Partnership for Peace."    Nazarbayev stressed that the interests of Russia had been  taken into account in the bilateral treaty on the  non-proliferation of missile technologies, signed not only by  American and Kazakh representatives but also by Yuriy Koptev,  the Russian Aero-Space Agency's Director General.    The president reported that his country claimed 10 percent  of  the $12 Bn [billion] package, provided by U.S. to compensate for  the highly enriched uranium from the SS-18 missiles to be pulled  out of the republic for destruction. In his words, Kazakhstan  does not seek strategic missiles control.    He noted that Bill Clinton had announced that aid to  Kazakhstan would be increased a few times over. $311 Mn  [million] have been allocated on top of the $85 Mn, appropriated  for silos dismantlement assistance.    Nazarbayev refuted rumors that while in U.S. he had  disapproved western aid to Russia. He said "stakes should be  made not on persons but on democratic and economic reforms in  Russia," reforms that no one will manage to turn back.    He said that since Anatoliy Chubays and Aleksandr Shokhin  were still in the Russian cabinet, it could not be regarded as  conservative. In his opinion, Yegor Gaydar and other reformists  could influence and help reforms in Russian parliament.</p>

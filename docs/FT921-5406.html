			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Portugal (9): The state prevails - Privatisation BY NEXT winter, Portuguese viewers will be able to choose from four television channels instead of the existing two state-owned networks, following the award of two private broadcasting licences. Choice is also increasing in other walks of life, as the government pursues an ambitious programme of economic liberalisation and privatisation. Thirteen important companies have been wholly or partly privatised since April 1989, raising a total of Es364bn (Dollars 2.6bn). State monopolies or privileges involving gasoline, cereals, alcohol, sugar and other products have been dismantled. Financial markets have been liberalised. State-owned newspapers have been turned over to private enterprise, radio opened to private broadcasters and airline competition freed. In spite of this wave of liberalisation, the state continues to play a dominant role in an economy where the public administrative sector alone generates nearly 50 per cent of gross domestic product. Matters from the price of bread to the cost of a train ticket are still determined by the state. 'After the sweeping nationalisations of 1975, state ownership in Portugal was comparable only with the communist regimes of eastern Europe,' says Alfredo de Sousa, a professor of economics at the Universidade Nova de Lisboa. 'The pendulum has moved a long way, but it still hasn't reached the other side.' Prof de Sousa is one of several critics who believe the government could have moved the privatisation process along faster. He blames indecision, bureaucracy and the setting of specific objectives for each privatisation for what he sees as unnecessary delays. Some analysts say delays in the privatisation of Portugal's steel, oil and cement companies could lead to a substantial reduction in their price, because of a less favourable economic climate in the relevant sectors, loss of market position, sharp falls in profitability and unforecast losses. But others argue that the depressed state of the country's capital markets has held the process back. 'Only by allowing a much bigger participation of foreigners in the privatisation programme would it have been possible to move ahead more quickly,' says Vitor Constancio, a professor of economics and former finance minister. The government has made clear that foreign control of privatised companies will not generally be authorised. In all but two privatisations, foreign participation has been limited to between 2 and 35 per cent. This is naturally unpopular with foreign investors. But what is proving even more unpopular with their Portuguese counterparts is that these limits have rarely been observed. Prof Constancio, a former leader of the opposition Socialist party, also opposes plans to privatise more than 50 per cent of Portucel, a leading pulp and paper company, and two cement companies: 'I would maintain state control over these companies which are important to the economy, use natural resources and are in a position of virtual monopoly, especially the cement companies . . . The only thing that is worse than a public monopoly is a private monopoly.' The government has announced an acceleration of the privatisation programme in 1992, following a suspension for last October's general election. Revenue from privatisations is forecast to reach Es350bn this year, as some of the biggest state-owned companies go on sale. The sale of a remaining 60 per cent of state-owned capital in Banco Espirito Santo Comercial de Lisboa, the second largest commercial bank, was completed on February 25. One of the biggest privatisation attractions this year will be the beginning of the sale of the oil company Petrogal, Portugal's largest commercial enterprise. The first stage of the sale will by public subscription for 19m Es1,000 shares - representing a capital increase of 20 per cent  - together with the sale of 5.2 per cent of existing capital. Bidders must undertake to purchase a further 25 per cent of current capital within a maximum of three years after the close of the initial sale. This will give the winner control of more than 50 per cent of the company. The runner-up in the first phase will be given a chance to raise its offer if it was originally within 2.5 per cent of the top price. Candidates must be 'financially sound' and bid through specifically incorporated holding companies with a minimum capital of Es31bn. Foreign participation must be limited to 40 per cent of the voting capital. The projected price per share is Es1,700 for an expected total cash flow of Es131bn. This is down from an earlier valuation of Es140bn, partly because of 1991 operating losses, the first in five years. A Dollars 300m syndicated loan agreement that Petrogal signed in London last December should help to make the company more attractive. Other companies expected to be at least partially privatised this year include: Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor, with an estimated value of Es60bn; Siderurgia Nacional, a steel company in which the state will retain a 10-per-cent 'golden share'; Mundial Confianca, an insurance company, of which an indivisible block representing 40 per cent of the total capital will be sold; Banco Portugues do Atlantico, the second stage of the sale of Portugal's largest commercial bank; Quimitecnica (chemicals); Imperio (insurance); and Rodoviaria de Algarve (road transport).</p>

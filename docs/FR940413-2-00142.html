			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although competitive bidding traditionally has been used for public financing, <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  in recent years negotiated underwritings have become much more common. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  in 1993, negotiated underwritings accounted for approximately 80% of all long-term municipal bond offerings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> At the time the Exchange Act was enacted, competitive bidding, in one form or another, was the most accepted method of financing used by municipalities and other public entities. L. Loss &amp; J. Seligman,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Securities Regulation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  343 (1989). In competitive offerings, the issuer decides who will underwrite its bonds based almost entirely on price in response to the issuer's ``notice of sale.'' Firms wishing to bid on an issue will include other firms in their syndicates based on their marketing or capital needs and the requirements of the issuer, if any. Some issuers will require the underwriting syndicate to include one or more firms with significant minority participation or specific regional capacity. This requirement usually is stated in the notice of sale. See MSRB,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Glossary of Municipal Terms, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (1985), definition of ``competitive bid'' or ``competitive bidding.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> There can be an element of competition present in negotiated deals. In a negotiated offering, the issuer typically distributes a request for proposals (``RFP'') to provide underwriting services for either a single issue, or more frequently, for a set period of years. Underwriters that are interested then submit their responses and the issuer will select one or more of the respondents to provide underwriting services. Issuers commonly select the entire management group in a negotiated offering, and often select most members of the selling group as well. Often an issuer will use the RFP process to ``prequalify'' a pool of underwriters as eligible to provide services and then select specific underwriters on a transaction by transaction basis. Consequently, the RFP process may not purge the selection process of undue influence. Notwithstanding the use of an RFP, issuers may award the municipal securities business according to existing non-merit based relationships with an underwriter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a large syndicate, one or more firms will serve as senior syndicate managers or co-managers; a second tier of firms will be designated as managers; the remaining syndicate members are the selling group. The issuer will also designate which of the managers will actually ``run the books'' and manage the syndicate. The senior managers and managers bear a risk of loss; members of the selling group do not bear this risk. Some issuers may select all the firms and delineate the position of each; others choose several firms as the management group, and give the senior syndicate managers discretion to choose members of the selling group (or name a few selling group members, and allow the senior managers to choose the remainder); still others will choose a senior manager and no others and the manager may or may not form a selling group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Competitive bidding offers the public some protection against the exertion of inappropriate influence on public officials by municipal underwriters. When bidding is done competitively and publicly, there is less possibility of collusion and political patronage. Because the competitive process offers all potential bidders equal opportunity to be awarded the deal, bidders must compete with one another based on the pricing of the issue and the willingness to accept market risk. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Government Finance Officers Association (``GFOA'') cites three advantages to competitive sales: assurance that the bonds are sold at the lowest cost in the prevailing market; lower gross underwriting spreads than negotiated sales, historically; and promotion of the appearance of an open, fair process. ``Taxpayers have greater assurance that the bonds have been awarded at the lowest possible cost, and not for the benefit of underwriting firms engaged in political activities to support elected officials.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> An Elected Official's Guide to Debt Issuance,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Kurish and Tigue, GFOA, Chicago, IL (1993) (`` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Elected Official's Guide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ''). <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

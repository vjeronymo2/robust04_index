			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Testimony ended in the perjury trial of former Rep. Pat Swindall -- without the  former GOP congressman taking the witness stand. The defense rested on the 17th  day of the trial in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, and prosecutors called only  one rebuttal witness. Attorneys planned to make legal arguments to the judge  today, and the jury was told to return Friday for closing statements. The  former Georgia congressman is accused of nine counts of perjury for lying to a  federal grand jury regarding his 1987 dealings with an undercover agent posing  as a money launderer, and with an associate who was convicted of money  laundering.  </P></p>

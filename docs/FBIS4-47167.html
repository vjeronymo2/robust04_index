Rubets, head of the Plant Protection </F> Administration of the Ukrahrokhim Association, by V. Onenko;  place and date not given: "The Fields Are Sensing a Premonition  of Trouble. M. Rubets, Head of the Plant Protection  Administration of the Ukrahrokhim Association Responds to  Questions from the SILSKI VISTI Correspondent"]    [Text]    [Onenko] Mykola Maksymovych, spring field work is in full  swing. What is the phitosanitary situation in the fields?    [Rubets] Poor. According to our signalling and forecast  service, not many ests died out during the winter. The situation  is greatly complicated by a shortage of fuel and lubricants.  Because these are scarce, many farms have begun to "simplify"  farming techniques. In short, there will be many more weeds,  pests, and pathogenes in the fields than in earlier years.    [Onenko] Are there enough pesticides to combat these pests?    [Rubets] No. There is a shortage of herbicides for applying  to the soil when sowing corn, and many farms have planted sugar  beets without applying herbicides. We do not have enough  fungicides and insecticides to control plant diseases and pests.    [Onenko] Did the Ukrahrokhim services fail to do their job?    [Rubets] Judge for yourself. Last year, our specialists  worked out plans that provided for the production this year of  50,000 metric tons of domestic plant protectants, which would  have allowed us to meet 60 percent of the demand for these  products in agricultural production. There were plans to put  manufacturing lines into operation at Ukrainian chemical  enterprises, where the necessary pesticides could have been made  from imported active agents. But very little has been done. The  Radykal Plant in Kiev started production of copper oxychloride  and [utal]. The Pervomaysk Khimprom Production Association  (Kharkiv Oblast), which specializes in manufacturing fungicides,  is now setting up the production of insecticides and herbicides.  However, this is a mere drop in the ocean; the country's  chemical enterprises are meeting only 20 percent of the demand  for pesticides. We do not expect any improvements in the  situation anytime soon, because most of the projects developed  by our specialists have been shelved due to the meagerness of  the budget allocations for the purchase of the necessary active  agents abroad.    [Onenko] Are we then compelled to use the services of  foreign  companies once again?    [Rubets] We can expect very little from them, although I do  not mean to reproach our foreign partners. Companies in the  United States, England, Switzerland, Germany, and other  countries have plenty of pesticides and are prepared to sell  them. The problem lies elsewhere: the state treasury is empty;  there is no hard currency for centralized purchasing of the  essential plant protectants. The scraps of hard currency that we  receive from time to time from the tender committee of the  Cabinet of Ministers are simply not enough. To buy only the  minimum amount of the plant protectants we need this year, we  need at least 120 million dollars, and 50 million of this sum  before 1 May. Ukrahrokhim has been issued only 15 million  dollars. You cannot buy very much for this sum.    [Onenko] Perhaps the government should make the decision to  sell some resources abroad and use the revenues from this sale  to purchase the necessary pesticides? A similar measure last  year helped to alleviate the situation somewhat.    [Rubets] Yes. But the situation has now changed, and not in  our favor. The price of our metallurgical and chemical products,  which we once sold at a profit on the world market, has now  fallen below its production cost. Who is going to trade at a  loss?    [Onenko] And what about the credit lines promised Ukraine by  the United States for buying products needed in agricultural  production?    [Rubets] Last year, they helped us a great deal. On the  credit lines that had been opened, American firms supplied  Ukraine with 94 million dollars' worth of protectants. If this  were the case today, we would have far fewer problems with our  supplies of pesticides. In addition, the country owes these  companies large sums of money. As a result, our foreign partners  are in no hurry to meet us halfway.    [Onenko] What debts are you talking about?    [Rubets] Ukrahrokhim had nothing to do with them. This is  money owed by Ukrahrobiznes for pesticides delivered to Ukraine  the year before last. The foreign firms are quite justified in  setting the government of our country, which vouched for  Ukrahrobiznes at the time, the following condition: first pay  your bills, and then we can talk about concluding agreements  regarding our selling you new batches of compounds.  Unfortunately, this matter has still not been settled.    [Onenko] The situation is critical. Yet, for some reason,  existing reserves are not being used. One such reserve would be  to inspect and use the plant protectants that have been lying in  storage from past years. Why are these not being used?    [Rubets] Your suggestion is quite proper. We have already  inventoried and recorded these pesticides. We submitted  proposals to the State Interdepartmental Commission for Testing  and Registering Plant Protectants and Growth Regulators and  Fertilizers, which agreed to extend the deadline for the use of  these substances. The commission's decision was supported by the  opinions of more than thirty experts, all respected cientists.  But the Ministry of Public Health has taken a rather odd stand  on this matter. It has refused permission for their use and has  handed over the pesticides to an interdepartmental committee of  experts at the Institute of Labor. I should add that the  pesticides had already been subjected to expert analysis by the  same Public Health Ministry's Institute of Hygiene and  Toxicology. Is it possible that the ministry's top officials do  not trust their own scientific institution, which has a great  eal of experience in this field? While the papers are passed  back and forth between offices, the deadline for using these  vitally needed pesticides will pass.</p>

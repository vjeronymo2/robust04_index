			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> MAYOR FAR OUTPACES FOE IN CONTRIBUTIONS  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Agran, who is seeking reelection, has raised more than twice as  much money as his main rival for the post, according to campaign disclosure  forms filed with the city.  </P> <P> Agran's forms show that he raised $36,654, almost all from small contributions  by local residents, in the last half of 1989.  </P> <P> Those donations brought Agran's war chest to more than $40,000.  </P> <P> His only announced opponent to date, Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, who also  was actively fund-raising, has raised only $16,658. All but $1,370 came from  contributions of $100 or less.  </P> <P> Sheridan is a longtime rival of Agran, who was elected mayor in 1988..  </P> <P> Sheridan concedes that ousting Agran is an uphill battle, and said she expects  to be outspent in the effort.  </P> <P> "Larry's an extremely astute politician," Sheridan said recently. "I don't  underestimate him."  </P> <P> Agran was unavailable for comment Monday, but a recent mailer indicates that  he, too, is taking the race seriously. In it, he states: "The upcoming campaign  is sure to be a difficult one."  </P> <P> In the past seven months, Agran has spent more than $13,000 on the campaign,  most of it on fund-raisers and the mailing.  </P> <P> Neither Agran nor Sheridan has received any direct contributions from the  Irvine Co. Agran has accused the company of working to support Sheridan and a  "slate of candidates," but both she and the company deny the allegation. JIM  NEWTON  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China has extended its dragnet on dissent,  detaining another leading intellectual who was active in the  official Protestant Church and sympathetic towards the free  labour union movement.    Xiao Biguang, a professor of Chinese literature at Beijing  University, was detained by six officers from the ministries of  Public Security and State Security at his home on Tuesday.    His home was searched and several books and manuscripts were  confiscated, a relative said.    Prior to his detention, Professor Xiao, 32, had been under  constant police surveillance for about week.    He is being held under a "shelter and investigation" order  issued by the Beijing Public Security Bureau and has not been  allowed visits from his family.    The police did not say why he was being detained.    The detention order simply stated that he had engaged in  "illegal activities" related to State Council Document No 56,  issued in 1980, an administrative decree on the use of "shelter  and investigation", which technically has no legal basis.    However, Professor Xiao was a friend and colleague of the  well- known jurist and labour activist, Yuan Hongbing, who was  detained last month. It is believed Professor Xiao might have  been detained in connection with Mr Yuan's case and or his work  in the official Protestant Church.    Mr Yuan was detained on March 3 in the southwestern city of  Guizhou and has been kept incommunicado ever since.    His wife has been to the Ministry of State Security in  Beijing four times to inquire about her husband's whereabouts  but officials at the ministry refused to discuss the case.    When she tried to contact the Guizhou State Security Bureau,  officials denied knowledge of Mr Yuan's arrest.    Another labour activist, Zhou Guoqiang, who was detained in  Beijing at the same time as Mr Yuan has also been refused  contact with his relatives.    Meanwhile, a government spokesman has defended the crackdown  on dissent saying all those detained or arrested in the past six  weeks were not democracy activists but "criminals" many of whom  were still on parole.    "While such criminals are on parole, the Chinese judicial  authorities have the right to take action against them," Foreign  Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said yesterday. Mr Shen  criticised Western politicians and journalists for concentrating  on a few famous dissidents such as Wei Jingsheng and not looking  at the wider human rights situation in China.    The case of Mr Wei was not a human rights problem, he said.    "Human rights is not about releasing criminals and other  irrelevant issues."    Mr Shen said many Western journalists did not understand who  Mr Wei really was but when asked if he himself had met the  former Democracy Wall activist, he dodged the issue.    "Just meeting someone is not necessarily the best way to  understand them," he said.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE PITCH WASN'T WORTH MOORE'S LIFE  </P> <P> Donnie Moore's tragic shooting of himself and his wife seemed to stem from his  pitching career -- actually, the negative side of his career.  </P> <P> The fans should not have booed for the over-dramatized home run by Dave  Henderson. Moore threw with a sore arm. He would not have been in that  situation if:  </P> <P> 1. Gary Lucas had not hit Rich Gedman with one pitch.  </P> <P> 2. Mike Witt had not given up a home run to Don Baylor.  </P> <P> 3. The Angels had scored more runs.  </P> <P> The Angels still could have won the game in the bottom half of the inning with  the bases loaded and one out. Moore should have been rewarded for his service  with the Angels. His only reward was a new contract, which was the focus of  Mike Port's criticism of Moore's performance later.  </P> <P> KURT F.

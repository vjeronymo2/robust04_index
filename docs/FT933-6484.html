			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / People: Wm Morrison appoints first female board director Wm Morrison, the Bradford-based superstore chain, has appointed its first female board director. She is Marie Melnyk, Morrison's trading director, who first worked for the company as a sixth-former studying for her A-levels. Now, aged 35, she is filling the board position vacated by Bob Emmott, the former joint deputy managing director who sprung a surprise by leaving to join J Sainsbury, the UK's largest superstore operator. Melnyk, described by a colleague as a 'positive dynamo' decided not to go to university but joined Morrisons straight from school, and worked in the stores before becoming produce buyer in 1981. She became produce director in 1987, responsible for the procurement and buying of the whole produce range, and in 1990 trading director, supervising buying across the complete range of groceries, non-foods, fresh and frozen foods.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Technology: Digital politics - From Monday BBC Radio's Westminster studio will lead a broadcasting revolution BBC Radio is taking a big step into the digital age. From Monday, political news and programmes produced by the BBC's Westminster studio and broadcast throughout the UK will be recorded, processed and edited digitally, without the use of magnetic tapes. The move, which represents the biggest change in radio technology for 40 years, is the first stage in what is likely to be a gradual process of digitisation of radio broadcasting, and eventually television. 'Broadcasting is about to undergo, on the radio side, one of those fundamental changes in technology and working practices that happens only a couple of times in a lifetime,' says Richard Ayre, head of BBC Westminster. The news studio is the first in Europe to install digital technology. Currently, radio programmes are compiled with the use of cassette tapes and quarter-inch magnetic tape - bulky reels about the size of an LP record. In preparing taped sequences for insertion into programmes, a journalist listens to the relevant recordings of Parliamentary proceedings while watching a screen which displays a time code of the hour, minute and second as the recording progresses. When he finds the section of the recording he wants to use, he notes the time code and requests that particular part of the recording from the studio manager. The studio manager then physically cuts that section from the rest of the tape and sticks it on a smaller, individual spool for the journalist to use in his programme. After a programme has been pieced together and recorded on to one tape, it is sent down the telephone line to Broadcasting House in London. There, it is re-recorded and sent to the BBC's regional broadcasting centres where it is again re-taped. This is a time-consuming, laborious process. A long programme can use as many as 20 clips, each of which must be played at the appropriate time. It is also an expensive way to produce programmes because tapes, though not costly themselves, require expensive hardware that needs to be replaced every 15 years or so. BBC Westminster spends Pounds 20,000 a year on magnetic tapes. Replacing the tape recording machines, which are just about reaching the end of their lifetime, could cost as much as Pounds 100,000. The new digital audio storage, retrieval and editing system, known as D-Cart, was developed by ABC, the Australian broadcasting group. The system consists of a black box the size of a refrigerator which is linked up to terminals with a screen and keyboard, much like any computer terminal. The BBC system has two 1.2 gigabyte Winchester hard disk drives capable of storing 50 hours of audio. Recordings can be made directly into the system from phone or broadcast lines, satellite links or conventional tape. The Commons and Lords proceedings, which will be used in the initial stages, come to BBC Westminster on direct lines from the chambers. Because the material is stored in the system on magnetic hard disks rather than tapes there is no danger of damaging the recordings. Furthermore, the quality of digital recordings is better than that of analogue tape which can be marred by sound distortions. But the greatest advantage of the D-Cart system is immediate and random access to all the material by up to 30 people at the same time. The recordings in the system are identified by title and number which appear on the screen. Journalists can access any recording by placing the cursor on the title and hitting the play key. For editing purposes, the track is represented on the screen as a bar along which an arrow moves as the sound progresses. When a journalist comes to the particular section of the recording that he needs, he simply marks the beginning and end of the relevant bit on his screen using edit keys. It is then his to work with, mixing it with his own voice, music or other effects in the studio. 'The system is ideal for fast-moving situations,' says John Williams, a media consultant who is working with BBC Westminster to install the system. D-Cart costs a minimum of Pounds 70,000 and has a life expectancy of seven to 10 years, according to BASYS Automation Systems, which markets the system in Europe. Despite the high cost of the system, BBC Westminster expects to make substantial savings through the introduction of D-Cart. It will eliminate the need for the time- and labour-consuming process of recording and re-recording on tape as a programme is sent from the studio to Broadcasting House and from there to regional studios. The recordings, which will have to be erased from the system after 50 hours, will initially be backed-up on tape until an archiving system is developed. Nine studio management posts are being eliminated in the first phase of installing D-Cart and more are expected to follow during phase two in the first half of next year. D-Cart is widely used by the ABC network in Australia. Broadcasting House, headquarters of BBC Radio, will begin installing D-Cart in November. Elsewhere, the US ABC radio network in New York, CBC in Toronto and Europe-I in France plan to install the system in next few months. Digital editing systems are already used for producing some music programmes but BBC Westminster will be the first in Europe to use it for news programmes. The BBC uses a similar digital editing system for video, but this is not yet up to broadcasting standards and does not provide multi-user access. Digital recording and editing forms one link in a three-way chain of future digital audio broadcasting. Already, transmission of programmes from Broadcasting House to regional transmitters throughout the country is digitised. To complete the chain, transmission from radio studios to Broadcasting House, and from the regional transmitters throughout the UK to individual receivers will have to be digitised. When that happens, CD-quality music and sound will be available on radio, marking another fundamental change in radio broadcasting.</p>

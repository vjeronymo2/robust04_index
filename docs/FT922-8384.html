			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Paper industry seeks boost for recycling BRITAIN'S paper industry risks destruction from imports unless its raw material costs are reduced through increased recycling, the British Paper and Board Industry Federation warned yesterday. It said mill closures, job losses and increased imports of finished paper were inevitable unless the government acted to increase the supply of paper for recycling. The federation called on the government to introduce levies to discourage the disposal of recyclable paper in landfill sites. Similar measures in Germany and France have increased the supply of paper for recycling and have pushed raw material prices down. Mr Dermot Smurfit, president of the federation, said raw material costs in the UK, which account for 55 per cent of the cost of making paper, were between 300 per cent and 400 per cent higher than in Germany. Mr Smurfit is joint deputy chairman of Jefferson Smurfit, the paper and packaging group. The federation said legislation on recycling would be popular in the UK. A Mori poll showed that 89 per cent of the public supported legislation forcing shops and offices to collect and sort waste paper and cardboard for recycling. The federation has launched a campaign to encourage commercial organisations to re-cycle waste paper and cardboard. He added that only 30 per cent of paper in the UK was recycled compared with 60 per cent in Germany - and the UK proportion was falling. Falling continental prices meant that companies in the UK could no longer be expected to pay for their waste paper, Mr Smurfit said. The shortage of recycled paper meant that companies were being forced to import from the Netherlands and Germany, and the UK was the largest importer of finished paper in the world.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Employers urged to end age bias BRITISH employers yesterday were urged to stop discriminating against older workers as a Europe-wide survey revealed that an increasing numbers of employees over 50 were being 'persuaded' to retire early by their companies. The study, by the European pressure group Eurolink Age, said that recruitment policies in most countries start to work against applicants from the age of 40. The Confederation of British Industry yesterday urged employers to tackle discrimination against older workers as part of a campaign to improve work opportunities for women, ethnic minorities and those with disabilities. It warned companies that unless they 'secure the best contribution from all the talent available, they will not compete effectively'. While progress had been made in some areas, there remained glaring examples of under-representation of some groups of workers, it added. Launching a new statement on equal opportunities, the CBI said redundant executives aged over 40 take twice as long to find jobs as those under 35. The CBI also pointed to the fact that more than 40 per cent of the labour force is female, yet only 8 per cent of managers are women; disabled people are four times as likely to be unemployed as those without disabilities; and only 36 per cent of young people of Asian origin are in employment compared with 71 per cent of white young people. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social and employment affairs commissioner, would be invited by the CBI 'to make equal opportunities a central part of the community's social policy'. The Eurolink Age report, published as part of the European Year of Older People, finds that older workers are subjected to early loss of employment, discrimination in recruitment, exclusion from training and enforced retirement throughout the EC. It calls for age limits, for example in job advertisements, to be abolished; employment and training measures for older workers; and action to promote good practice across Europe by governments, employers and trade unions. The study says US age-discrimination legislation has succeeded in protecting older workers' employment rights and eliminated the most blatant forms of discrimination but has not changed underlying attitudes.

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Four Seasons Hotels in deal with EIE CANADA'S Four Seasons Hotels will become the world's largest operator of luxury hotels under an agreement with the Japanese parent of the Regent International chain. EIE International, the financially-troubled Japanese developer, will transfer management of five Regent hotels, including those in New York and Milan, to Four Seasons. The two groups also plan to set up a property partnership to which each will contribute its interests in 10 hotels, all but two of them in North America. EIE will also contribute its interest in Regent. EIE will have an 80 per cent stake in the joint venture, with Four Seasons owning the remaining 20 per cent. Four Seasons will also contribute Dollars 102m in equity. Four Seasons, whose 23 existing properties include The Pierre in New York and London's Inn on the Park, said yesterday the deal accelerated its planned expansion in the Far East by five to 10 years without increasing its exposure to the real estate market. Regent manages 10 hotels, expects to negotiate contracts for five others, and has several projects under development. Four Seasons said it would provide advisory services for various properties still managed by the Japanese group. Separately, EIE International has resort and golf club interests in Asia and the Pacific, and also owns a floating hotel moored at Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Mr Yoichi Shibata, EIE's managing director, said 'the value of our property holdings will be increased by the Four Seasons link because the company is one of the world's most powerful hotel operators'. The Japanese company plans to reduce estimated debts of Y630bn (Dollars 4.7bn) through strategic sales of property holdings over the next two years or so. The Long-Term Credit Bank, the main bank of EIE, and four other Japanese institutions have sent managers to restructure the company, which has already sold off a hotel in Saipan and part of its share in a Hong Kong office complex.</p>

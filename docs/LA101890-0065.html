			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPEALS COURT REVERSES INSURANCE RULING  </P> <P> A state appellate court handed California homeowners a victory Wednesday by  overturning a lower court order that barred a Concord couple from suing their  insurance company.  </P> <P> A lower court had said that Roger and Linda Stanley waited too long to sue Fire  Insurance Exchange Co. after it denied their claim.  </P> <P> The couple's homeowner policy had a clause that said a suit must be brought  within one year of filing a claim, but the Stanleys waited nearly 2 1/2 years.  </P> <P> The 1st District Court of Appeals, in a 3-0 published decision, reversed the  ruling by a Contra Costa County Superior Court judge, saying it was unfair  because the insurance company took more than two years to deny the couple's  claim. That made it impossible to comply with the one-year time limit.  </P></p>

Hu Jintao, Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, Song Jian, Wang  Zhaoguo,  and responsible comrades from relevant departments attended the  tea party.    On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State  Council, Song Jian extended season's greetings and warm regards  to the specialists and scholars attending the tea party, as well  as to the vast numbers of intellectuals across the country.    In his speech, Song Jian said: Over the past year, our  country enjoyed economic development, political stability,  national unity, and social progress. The party and people are  sincerely grateful for the diligent and creative work carried  out by the vast numbers of intellectuals across the country.    Speaking of the work to be carried out in the new year, Song  Jian said: Our tasks will be heavier and more formidable.  There is a wide scope for the vast numbers of intellectuals to  fully display their ability and talent in pursuing the great  cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Song Jian said: The status and role of our country's  intellectuals has become more important with the development of  the situation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important proposition --  "respect intellectuals and talented people," "intellectuals are  members of the working class," and "science and technology are  primary productive forces" -- has fundamentally established the  status of our country's intellectuals. A social climate of  embracing science, and of respecting learning and talent, has  taken shape. The vast numbers of intellectuals are contributing  to building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Their hard  work has gained increasingly widespread recognition and respect  in society. We firmly believe that the vast numbers of  intellectuals will make fresh contributions to our country's  socialist modernization, thus demonstrating a strong sense of  responsibility and urgency toward this era.    Song Jian said emphatically: Giving full rein to the role of  talented people is the key to making our undertakings flourish.  From now on, all competent departments should continue to  implement the party's policy toward intellectuals, study new  circumstances and solve new problems in the course of deepening  institutional reform, and further create a good environment that  is conducive to expanding the role of intellectuals.    Specialists and scholars who attended the tea party -- which  was jointly hosted by the CPC Central Committee's Organization,  Propaganda, and United Front Work Departments; the Ministry of  Personnel, the State Science and Technology Commission, the  Ministry of Culture, and the People's Liberation Army's General  Political Department -- included some Beijing-based academicians  of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS]; young and middle-aged  specialists whose titles have been approved by the Ministry of  Personnel and who have made outstanding contributions;  specialists, scholars, and artists who receive special  government allowances; prominent specialists selected from  various departments; specialists admitted into the "Program for  Cultivating Transcentury Personnel"; winners of awards for young  scientists; and outstanding young and middle-aged scientists who  receive special funds. Professionals from all fronts and  specialists of several generations got together today to  reminisce about the past and to talk about the future. The  spacious banquet hall was filled with joy and laughter.    Zhou Bingkun, CAS academician and professor at Qinghua  University; Li Xueqin, research fellow at the History Institute  of the thinese Academy of Social Sciences; Wu Zuze, CAS  academician and research fellow at the Military Medical Sciences  Academy; Li Delun, art adviser and lead conductor of the Central  Philharmonic Society; and Wang Xuan, CAS academician and  professor at Beijing University, delivered impromptu speeches at  the party.

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Cosalt tumbles 24% to Pounds 1.9m but holds dividend PROFITS OF Cosalt, the Grimsby-based diversified industrial group, fell 24 per cent to Pounds 1.88m pre-tax for the year to August 30. However, the total dividend is maintained at 10.75p, via a final of 6.5p. Earnings per share worked through at 11.1p (15.05p). The shares rose 7p to 143p yesterday. Mr Bill Wood, finance director, said the group was now in a healthy position 'having cut out the loss-making and risky parts of our business'. Nonetheless, a markedly improved performance this year was dependent on economic recovery in the UK. The recession, particularly in the fishing industry, dented profits at the group's fibres and safety equipment divisions. Mr Wood said the group had continued to reduce its exposure to the fishing industry, which now accounted for some 10 per cent of its business compared with more than half five years ago. Loss-making Cosalt Caravans was sold in September, and the group made an extraordinary Pounds 2.06m provision for the disposal of the business.</p>

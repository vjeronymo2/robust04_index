			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages contained within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Text] We have received a report from the press center of  Russia's Navy which says in part: The Ukrainian mass media have  carried a statement from the republic's Foreign Ministry  alleging that Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of the  Russian Navy, called off a meeting which the Ukrainian and  Russian sides were to hold jointly with the command and  officers' corps of the Black Sea Fleet. The press center  describes as not in accord with reality the report that  representatives of the Russian Government had visited Odessa.  In connection with this, the press center of the Russian Navy  states authoritatively that the Russian delegation received a  refusal from all levels of the Foreign Ministry and the Defence  Ministry of Ukraine.    Meanwhile, an extraordinary meeting of the CIS defense  ministers has taken place in Moscow. Taking part were the  military ministers of the states which signed the treaty on  collective security. Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy  Radetskyy was present as an observer. Quite naturally,  journalists asked Radetskyy about the rumors that an act of  force is being prepared against the brigade of Russian river  vessels stationed in Izmail. Here is what he replied:    [Radetskyy] "No such action is being prepared. This report  is not objective. An end should be put to all of this. We are  only giving grounds for the extremists and nationalists to  enflame these passions and this does nothing to improve mutual  relations between the two neighbors."    The Ukrainian defense minister also commented on his own  decree on the resubordination of Division 318.    [Radetskyy] "No such division should exist on the territory  of Ukraine, particularly in Odessa, if the leaders of this  division give the command to use weapons without warning."    After this extraordinary meeting an unofficial meeting took  place between Vitaliy Radetskyy and Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev which, alas, did not produce any particular  results. Here is what Pavel Grachev said:    [Grachev] "It was precisely the Ukrainian authorities which  provoked this action. Its opinion is rather different. It says  in its defense that the decision was made to use weapons. But  no one used any. Therefore, of course, we did not reach mutual  agreement. I pointed out to them that their action was  unilateral and was thus outside the framework of the Yalta  Agreement."</p>

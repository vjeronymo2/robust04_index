The announcement comes after pressure on the  organization by Tanzania and Zimbabwe to abide by the principles  of peaceful negotiation.    Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel has said it's high time  that the PAC and its armed wing, APLA [Azanian People's  Liberation Army], realized that violence and democracy do not  mix.    ANC Spokesman, Carl Niehaus, welcomed the announcement, but  said the organization's executive committee was studying it  before making a full statement.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board's existing AHP regulation also includes as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold requirement the ability of the project to begin using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank assistance within 12 months. See 12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(iv).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since this involves the use of funds after a project has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved for funding, it does not belong as a threshold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement and has been omitted in this section of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. The requirements under the proposed rule for use of funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the AHP within a reasonable period of time after approval of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the application are discussed below in the use and verification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, it has been suggested that a threshold criterion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be added requiring that the project costs set forth in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP application are reasonable and appropriate for the type and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location of the housing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 10(j)(9)(F) of the Act requires the Board to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum subsidy limitations under the AHP. 12 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1430(j)(9)(F). Section 10(j)(9)(D) of the Act also requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board to ensure that a preponderance of assistance provided under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AHP is ultimately received by low- and moderate-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Section 1430(j)(9)(D). Requiring that project costs be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable is one way of controlling the amount of AHP subsidies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that fund a project in order to keep the project from being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over-subsidized, and to ensure that a preponderance of the funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are being received by the ultimate households by lowering their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing costs and not providing undue benefit to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediaries in the development process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A project costs requirement is not explicitly prescribed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold requirements under the Board's existing AHP regulation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although some Banks do currently review project costs to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if they are reasonable under the feasibility requirement in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing regulation. See 12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(ii). The feasibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement as defined in the proposed rule would not incorporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a project costs limit requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board specifically requests comments on how the Banks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently deal with applications with excessive project costs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether the project costs option discussed above should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required as a threshold criterion in approving AHP applications,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and how such a requirement could be implemented by the Banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Scoring of AHP Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.10(a) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall score AHP applications that satisfy all of the threshold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria in proposed &sect;960.9 according to the scoring methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set forth in proposed &sect;960.10, which shall be included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank's approved AHP implementation plan. Section 960.10 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule modifies the existing scoring methodology, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board specifically requests comments on this proposed new scoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Priority treatment and scoring.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.10(b) of the proposed rule provides that each application is first evaluated to determine if it will receive priority treatment. The Board's existing AHP regulation contains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seven priorities: Homeownership projects; rental projects;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects using government properties; projects with a non-profit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or public agency sponsor; projects promoting empowerment; homeless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing projects; and projects meeting a Bank priority. Under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing AHP regulation, an application must meet at least three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the seven priorities to receive priority treatment. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule would contain only five priorities. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule would eliminate the priorities for homeownership and rental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properties because a project must be either a rental or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homeownership project in order to qualify for AHP funding. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule would replace the empowerment and homeless housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priorities with a priority for ``special needs'' housing. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the proposed rule would add a new priority for projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promoting economic mobility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;960.10(b) of the proposed rule, for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining priority, an application can receive a maximum of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eight points for each of the five priority categories described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below. A Bank in its AHP implementation plan shall define more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically each of the five priority categories and explain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically how points will be awarded for satisfying each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category. An application will be deemed to meet a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority category if it is awarded at least four points for that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority category. Applications meeting at least two priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories shall receive priority treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.10(c) of the proposed rule provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications that qualify for such priority treatment shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scored before applications that do not qualify for priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment. The applications that do not qualify for priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment will not be scored unless there are insufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority treatment applications to utilize the total AHP funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount for the funding cycle. Under the proposed rule, the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points available for the priorities would be increased from 25 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40. Section 960.10(d) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall total the points received by each applicant for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining priority for all of the five priority categories and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall award 40 points to the application(s) that receive the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highest number of total points, and the remaining application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scores shall be adjusted and awarded points on a declining scale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The five priority categories are set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Government-owned properties. Applications for projects that finance the purchase or rehabilitation of housing owned or held by the United States Government or any agency or instrumentality of the United States,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including but not limited to HUD, the RTC, Farmers Home Administration, Veterans Administration, Federal National Mortgage Association, or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. (See proposed &sect;960.10(d)(1).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

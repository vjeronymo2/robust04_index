			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> PRICIER HOMES PLANNED BY RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA  </P> <P> Rancho Santa Margarita is going upscale.  </P> <P> The South County planned community -- responsible for much of the affordable  new housing being built in Orange County these days -- has opened nine new  single-family and attached-housing developments around the upper portion of the  Tijeras Creek public golf course set to open in the fall.  </P> <P> Prices start about $140,000, still way down there in affordable territory, but  not all the homes will be that inexpensive.  </P> <P> Units next to the golf course fairways will be priced at more than $400,000 --  the most expensive in the entire community.  </P> <P> The presence of a golf course, however, doesn't mean Rancho Santa Margarita is  abandoning the affordable market.  </P> <P> Just across the street from the golf course homes and scheduled to open in June  is a condominium development by Newport Beach-based Inland Pacific Communities.  It will offer 608-square-foot units with one bedroom, one bath and a single-car  garage for less than $100,000 apiece. The exact price hasn't been set yet.  </P> <P> Top price in the development will be in the mid-$150,000s for a two-bedroom,  two-bath unit, said Gail Zalta, spokeswoman for the 2-year-old firm.  </P> <P> Inland Pacific hasn't opened any models yet, but about 500 would-be home buyers  already have asked to be included on an information list, she said.  </P> <P> The development will have about 250 units, and only 30 or so are to be offered  in the first phase.  </P> <P> By the time they go up for sale, the Inland Pacific homes might carry the only  sub-$100,000 price tags in Rancho Santa Margarita. Currently, one other  attached-home development -- by the William Lyon Co. -- still has a few units  priced at $98,000.  </P></p>

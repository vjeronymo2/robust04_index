			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Shippers compromise on Atlantic routes Shipping lines which have set up a controversial price-fixing agreement on north Atlantic cargo routes yesterday put forward compromise proposals to the European Commission, writes Charles Batchelor, Transport Correspondent. Plans to revise the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (TAA) to meet Commission objections were unveiled in Brussels by Lord Sterling, president of the European Community Shipowners' Associations. The Commission said it could not respond to the new proposals until it had time to study them, but the British Shippers' Council, representing most large UK exporters, said the changes did not go far enough and it would still press for a dismantling of the TAA. The TAA is an accord between 15 large shipping lines accounting for about 85 per cent of sailings between northern Europe and the US, to regulate rates and capacity. Members include large container shipping lines such as P&amp;O, Maersk and Nedlloyd. Exporters claim that the TAA, which came into effect in 1992, has pushed up freight rates by as much as 100 per cent. The shipowners say an agreement, or 'conference,' is necessary to put an end to large losses made on the north Atlantic routes. 'We believe the revised agreement will provide new and welcome flexibility,' Lord Sterling said yesterday. 'It is not a climbdown. It is the result of months of discussions to meet the concerns of the shippers while taking note of where the Commission stands.' The new proposals will make it easier for small shippers to negotiate deals with TAA members. They will also allow shippers to reach agreements with just five of the shipping companies involved in the TAA. Shippers will also be able to negotiate different rates for specific quantities to be moved under general service contracts. On the question of tariffs, shipping lines will be able to take independent action to set rates after only five days' notice instead of 10 at present.</p>

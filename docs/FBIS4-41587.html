			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (June 23) TURAN: Today the press service of  Nakhichevan's Supreme Mejlis issued a statement which reads that  having violated the truce agreement, Armenian troops launched an  attack towards the villages of Yukhary and Ashagy Buzgov in the  Babek region on June 18 and on June 19-20 towards the Sadarak  Region of Nakhichevan.    Earlier on May 28 Armenian troops attacked the village of  Gunnet in the Sadarak Region and moved 1 kilometre further into  Nakhichevani territory. Armenians seized several strategically  important hills and shelled the region centre of Sadarak. As a  result five Azeri soldiers have been wounded and several  housings have been damaged.    However, after that attack the representatives of Armenia  and  Nakhichevan reached the agreement banning escalation of tension  on the border. Resumption of aggressive activities shows that  Armenia's authorities ignore the efforts by the international  organizations aimed at restoration peace in the region.    The press service of Supreme Mejlis of Nakhichevan calls on  the world community to exert pressure in the Republic of Armenia  to stop its aggression against Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic.</p>

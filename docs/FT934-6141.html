			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / CBI steps up warning to Clarke on taxes The Confederation of British Industry yesterday issued a last-ditch plea to Mr Kenneth Clarke to refrain from a tax increase in next week's Budget, arguing that it would jeopardise the recovery. Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's head of economic trends, said any tax increase on Tuesday - coming on top of the Pounds 6.7bn of higher taxes already announced for next April - would put the UK into 'uncharted waters'. In its latest quarterly economic forecast, published today, the employers' body is drastically reducing its estimate of likely UK growth next year because of the effects of the fiscal tightening and weak demand prospects in many overseas markets. It is particularly worried by the outlook for companies whose profits are expected to grow only sluggishly next year after a big jump this year. Underlining the fragile state of the recovery, the CBI said manufacturers' order books for exports are at their weakest since February, even though companies are slightly more optimistic than a month ago about likely levels of overall output. The comments from the CBI illustrate the uncertainties facing the chancellor as he prepares a Budget aimed at reducing the Pounds 50bn fiscal deficit without harming prospects for an upturn. Mr Andrew Sentance, the confederation's head of economics, said many people had not woken up to the extent of the tax increases due at the beginning of the next financial year. The CBI reckons gross domestic product will expand 2.4 per cent next year. It had projected 3 per cent in August. Growth this year is estimated at 1.9 per cent. Manufacturing output is now thought likely to rise 2.8 per cent next year, less than the 3.5 per cent forecast in August. Company profits are expected to increase in real, inflation-adjusted terms by 2.4 per cent next year after a 10.5 per cent rise this year and a 3.9 per cent decline last year. The forecast assumes Mr Clarke will not announce higher taxes in the Budget, but will reduce public spending by Pounds 2bn a year. Underlying inflation is expected by the CBI to stay below the Treasury's 4 per cent ceiling in the next two years. Unit labour costs in manufacturing are projected to show falls of 1 per cent and 0.6 per cent this year and next year respectively, with a modest rise of 1.4 per cent expected in 1995. In the CBI's latest monthly survey of manufacturing trends 28 per cent of companies thought output volumes would rise in the next four months with 16 per cent expecting a fall. The positive balance of 12 percentage points compares with a balance of 8 points last month, but is lower than the results in September and August. The survey of 1,460 manufacturers was conducted between October 26 and November 17. A balance of 23 percentage points of companies said overall order books were below normal, an improvement on the position in October when the balance was 31 points. Only 20 per cent of companies expect to put up prices in the next four months, while 15 per cent expect price cuts. Tricky balancing ACT, Page 21</p>

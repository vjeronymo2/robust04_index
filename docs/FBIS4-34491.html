			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Miguel Lozano: "Faceless `Macetas' </F> who have emerged in the shadow of the economic crisis, the Cuban  nouveau riche, are currently more concerned about concealing  their identity than increasing their capital."]    [Text] Havana -- Surprisingly, at their summer meetings  with their electorates, delegates (councilmen) heard a demand  which, perhaps, many of them deemed incredible: the people  wanted the names of the nouveau riche, which the Cuban  authorities had refused to disclose.    At the end of May, GRANMA blew the whistle when it reported  that early on in the neighborhood assemblies it was widely  requested that the media identify the "macetas" (wealthy people  in popular jargon) affected by a recent decree whereby illicitly  obtained properties would be confiscated.    This request was probably unexpected because the island's  enormous difficulties would seem to have indicated that  participants in the assemblies would have been more interested  in important issues, having been subjected to widespread  shortages, frequent power outages and a chaotic transportation  system.    Now, nevertheless, the authorities believe this reaction is  the result of widespread rejection of individuals who are  profiting from the crisis caused by the loss of the dependable  markets of the defunct socialist countries and the  intensification of the U.S. blockade.    The background of this phenomenon shows that demands for the  confiscation of the "macetas'" properties was widely agreed upon  at the so-called "workers parliaments" held during the first  quarter of this year, which were organized by the labor unions  to find out the people's views concerning ways to deal with the  country's economic problems.    In essence, the "macetas" are people who speculate on  products that are scarce -- most of which are obtained illegally  from state stores -- and have amassed true fortunes, the  dimensions of which are only coming to light now.    The people's demand to confiscate the "macetas" properties  was followed by the National Assembly's approval of guidelines  to reorganize the economy, among them instructions to the  government to adopt "efficient and exemplary" measures against  those who accumulate wealth through the black market, illegal  business deals and even theft.    Decree-Law 149 was approved by the State Council on 4 May,  and 12 days later it went into effect. The decree-law included  research mechanisms and, in many cases, called for cases to be  reviewed before confiscations that would preclude the right to  compensation.    During the first month, the Office of the Prosecutor opened  over 220 files and imposed precautionary measures on almost 200  cars, approximately 100 motorcycles, 50 trucks, several dozen  tractors, over 100 homes, about a dozen boats, and over 3  million pesos (equivalent to dollars).    The "macetas" are usually citizens who cannot justify the  legality of a standard of living which by far exceeds their  incomes.    Upon displaying temporarily seized properties, the  television  stations were careful not to show the faces of the people  involved, based on the principle of not morally harming anyone,  especially since during their trials they will have four  opportunities to prove their innocence with documents.    Nevertheless, certain cases have leaked, such as that of a  retiree who receives a pension of approximately 100 pesos  monthly and who, within a short period, purchased two cars, one  van and one truck, and amassed savings of 100,000 pesos; and  that of an administrator who earns a salary of 117 pesos monthly  and owns four motorboats, one motorcyle, and one truck.    It is obvious that some of the illegally obtained  properties,  including raw materials imported by the state, are being  concealed because the "macetas" had time from the beginning of  the debates to try to evade the measures.    Nevertheless, the issue for the authorities does not seem to  be the success of the operation but the permanent enforcement of  Decree-Law 149 as part of a plan to restore financial order in  the country, including the implementation of a tax system.    One issue the Cuban Government clearly established from the  beginning is that this is not a witch hunt or a frontal attack  on self-employed workers, a sector that has been encouraged over  the past few years as a means of finding a solution to the  crisis and which includes almost 160,000 people throughout the  country.    Instead, the struggle against the "macetas" is part of an  operation to deal with the lack of control and permissiveness  which, to a large extent, make possible the existence of  speculators and the black market.    According to Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, one of  the  first signs of the effectiveness of the plan is the improvement  of social discipline, shown in the sale of cigarettes, which  were deregulated on 1 June. Until then, cigarettes had been  rationed.    Contrary to expectation, when the Cuban people were able to  purchase cigarettes quota-free after such a long time, there was  no avalanche. On the first day, 5.5 million pesos were sold; on  the second day, 3 million pesos; and on the third day, 2.5  million pesos.    Rodriguez believe this was the case because there were no  speculative purchases, but he suspects that it would have been  different if the "macetas" had not been under society's  magnifying glass at the time.    More concerned with concealing their faces than in  increasing  their capital, the nouveau riche had to let the opportunity go  by, and the Cuban people received a brief respite in the middle  of a quite complicated daily life... at any rate, however, they  are waiting to find out who -- paradoxically -- enriched  themselves through the shortage.</p>

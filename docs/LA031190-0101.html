			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE HOUSE: TREATING WATER SPOTS ON FIBERGLASS SURFACES  </P> <P> QUESTION: As a manufacturer of fiberglass and acrylic products, I was  particularly interested in a column you did on removing hard-water spots from  fiberglass or acrylic showers and bathtubs. I have had to deal with this  cleaning problem frequently and recommend to you the following method:  </P> <P> First, get 600-grit wet-or-dry sandpaper from any automotive body shop or parts  store. Thoroughly wet down the entire surface with water and, using a circular  motion, go over the affected area with just a few swipes. The mineral deposits  will sand right off and go right down the drain.  </P> <P> Caution: Do not overdo this process or you could sand right through the gel  coat or color finish. The level of mineral deposits contained in one's water  will vary from community to community, so some fixtures may require more elbow  grease than others.  </P> <P> Once you have removed all of the hard-water or mineral deposits, go over the  complete unit with an auto-body paste wax. This will result in a new car-like  finish, which will help to resist future mineral build-up in the shower or  bathtub. It works every time!  </P> <P> ANSWER: We have seen 600-grit wet-or-dry sandpaper used successfully on  porcelain or china fixtures in the home, but have yet to use it on fiberglass  or acrylic fixtures. We suppose that if it is used sparingly and in accordance  with your instructions that it will do just what you suggest.  </P> <P> We appreciate your information and welcome any of our readers who should elect  to attempt this procedure to share their results with us. We are curious to  know how this works for you.  </P> <P> Treating Drawers to Prevent Scratching  </P> <P> Q: Recently, we remodeled our kitchen, and to expedite matters, I worked with  the carpenters and did the painting of the cabinets, shelves and drawers as  they were finished.  </P> <P> I have always hated the insides of drawers and tops of shelves, which soon  became discolored and scratched by the items put on them. My special gripe was  pans, which really made a mess. The unfinished surface is so hard to keep  clean. I have not seen this solution to finishing drawers and cabinet shelves  in the kitchen used before, but we tried it much to our delight.  </P> <P> I gave each shelf (top only) and the inside of each drawer three coats of  polyurethane with plenty of time to dry between coats.  </P> <P> Now, about eight months later, I can say that this was a great success. Not one  discoloration from pots, pans or cans anywhere. It may be more work to put on  three coats, but it pays off in improved appearance, not to mention ease of  cleanup. And, the best part is, no more shelf paper.  </P> <P> Thought that you might be interested in sharing my experience with your  readers.  </P> <P> A: Thanks. Your adventure prompted us to call the folks at the Flecto Co. in  Oakland, a leading manufacturer of clear wood-finishing products.  </P> <P> Our concern was relative to any potential problems or health hazards that may  be attached to the technique that you are suggesting. And, as a result, we have  some good news for you.  </P> <P> The Flecto Co. applauds your efforts and is especially pleased that you opted  to use three complete coats. They say that this will significantly improve the  longevity of the finish and will provide you with a surface that is not only  impervious to liquids, but will stand up to the kind of abuse that kitchen  cabinet shelves and drawers are likely to sustain.  </P> <P> One caution: Allow the final coat to air dry at least 72 hours or until most of  the unpleasant odor associated with the use of this type of product has  dissipated.  </P></p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Pressure on LDP over cash for faction chief JAPAN'S political leadership is under increasing pressure to respond to public criticism of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the Liberal Democratic party's most powerful faction chief, who last week was fined Y200,000 (Pounds 934) for receiving illegal political donations of Y500m (Pounds 2.33m). Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who has depended heavily on Mr Kanemaru's behind-the-scenes support, said he deeply regretted his colleague had breached the political control funds law. Mr Kanemaru was fined after he admitted receiving money from a scandal-ridden courier company. Mr Miyazawa's first comments, ,at a weekend seminar of LDP members, were widely seen as an attempt to respond to party criticism. Mr Miyazawa said he would devote himself to making detailed political reform proposals to the Diet in November. The LDP leadership has come under pressure for further action and the controversy could trigger a destabilising power struggle within the LDP over the successor to Mr Kanemaru as head of the Takeshita faction, the largest within the LDP. The opposition parties have unanimously called for Mr Kanemaru to testify to the Diet over the case and some have called for his resignation. Also, more than 70 prefectural and city assemblies have passed resolutions criticising Mr Kanemaru or the Tokyo prosecutors for failing to pursue the case to court. It is thought Mr Kanemaru made a written confession to avoid a trial which could have further damaged his standing and risked the exposure of allegations that he has had links with Japan's leading crime syndicate. Mr Miyazawa's handling of the issue has been perceived as weak, reflecting his dependence on Mr Kanemaru. This was underlined by an expression of thanks to Mr Kanemaru for his promotion of party unity.</p>

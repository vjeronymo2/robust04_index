			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, December 13 (KCNA) -- The chairman of the  State Fisheries Commission of the DPRK issued a statement  Monday, condemning Russia and Japan for having polluted to a  great extent the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific by dumping  large quantities of nuclear waste for over 30 years.    Far from lending an ear to criticism from the world public,  Russia has announced that it would continue nuclear waste  dumping in the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific, and Japan  tries to avoid criticism, alleging that the nuclear waste it has  dumped is not dangerous, the statement says, and continues:    It is impudent of Russia and Japan to talk about the DPRK's  "compliance with the nuclear safeguards agreement" while  wantonly violating international accord without an elementary  morality.    Russia and Japan must refrain from their reckless act of  decrying the DPRK, immediately stop dumping nuclear waste in the  East Sea of Korea and the Pacific, apologize to the countries in  the coastal areas, scoop up the dumped nuclear waste out of the  sea at once and punish those responsible for the dumping.    We hope all the international organisations and community  will pay deep attention to the destruction of sea biological  resources by Russia and Japan and its consequences and take  relevant measures.</p>

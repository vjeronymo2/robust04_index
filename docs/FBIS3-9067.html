Whereas it  was expected that the Friday [18 March] session would deal with  documentary testimony and the examination of all the written  evidence in the investigators' file, two different testimonies  shocked the courtroom. These concerned serious threats against  direct or indirect participants in this trial, connected with  the further course of the judgement of Fatos Nano. In a  strongly worded protest, Prosecutor Arben Qeleshi publicly  confirmed the existence of a violent threat against the husband  of expert witness Virgjeresha Shkreli, threatening him with  physical liquidation if his wife were to testify against Nano at  the trial. Immediately after this, Nano's lawyer Perparim  Sanxhaku made public another fact. According to him, a  now-identified individual had threatened him because he is the  Socialist leader's defense lawyer.    "On the afternoon of 17 March, certain people whom the  police  and justice authorities have still not identified used physical  and psychological pressure in the most unscrupulous and inhuman  fashion against the husband of the expert witness Virgjeresha  Shkreli," Prosecutor Qeleshi declared in his protest, "to the  point of pointing a loaded pistol into his mouth and saying  that, if his wife appeared in court, we will physically  eliminate you and hang you." Before the file on the aid scandal  was sent to the court, the expert witness Shkreli and her two  colleagues had worked on calculating the amount of Italian aid  lost, which the prosecutor has claimed were appropriated and  misused. However, according to court rules, the work of the  experts attached to the investigation must also be examined in  court in the final stages of the judicial procedure.    Only a few moments after Prosecutor Qeleshi's protest, the  lawyer Sanxhaku reported another serious threat, this time  against himself. "At 1730 on 15 March, an identified person  driving a car with the license plate TR 2651 A threatened me  personally," Sanxhaku declared, "saying that they would hang me  from a rope." Thus, two very special pieces of evidence have  come to light, joining Prosecutor Qeleshi's statement a few days  before the start of the trial that he too had been personally  threatened.</p>

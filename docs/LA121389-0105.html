			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> IT'S 'SCROOGE,' WITH AND WITHOUT THE MUSIC;  </P> <P> CYPRESS PRODUCTION IS MORE FOR THE YOUNGER SET  </P> <P> Cypress College's "A Christmas Carol: Scrooge and Marley" seems designed  primarily for a youthful audience. Director Mark Majarian has brought in a  bagful of special effects. Bells gong loudly, shrieks and yelps echo; there are  demons with incandescent peepers, and spirits enshrouded in stage fog.  </P> <P> Along these lines, Gil Morales' set has the perspective of a children's  nightmare: The large cut-out scenery is cartoon-like and eerie, all flinty  grays and drained-out colors.  </P> <P> Even the use of Marley as a narrator -- the major innovation in this Israel  Horovitz adaptation of Dickens' venerable tale -- appears intended to guide  children through the story.  </P> <P> Because of these touches, this "Christmas Carol" may succeed at holding some  young kids, but their parents and older siblings are likely to fidget. Despite  all the gee-whiz moments, the production simply doesn't involve as well as it  should.  </P> <P> There are a few central problems. The first revolves around Majarian's decision  to use all of the Campus Theatre's large stage. This makes some sense during  the big crowd scenes. But the more intimate passages, when we're supposed to  grasp Scrooge's personality, are all but lost, swallowed by the expanse. Even  on the big stage, Majarian might have blocked the actors and sets nearer to the  audience. As it is now, though, the action is removed several feet from the  front row.  </P> <P> Another glitch: From where I sat, a gap in the scenery, toward the side,  allowed a distracting view of the cast preparing backstage.  </P> <P> A bigger problem: Too many scenes are allowed to lag. The actors move about  doing this and that, but they don't push the action along. A prime example is  when Scrooge all but cleans house in the long moments before Marley's first  midnight visitation. We grow impatient; let those Christmas ghosts get on with  it!  </P> <P> Timothy D. French's Scrooge looks too young, even with makeup and gray powder  dusted in his hair. A Cypress College student, French does try to lend the  character age and severity through a hobbled gait and biting manner, but it  doesn't always work. It's an impression of Scrooge, not an embodiment.  </P> <P> In some ways, Ernest Jackson has the tougher role as Marley. The character  hovers between a ghostly presence out to frighten (Jackson comes up with a lot  of those maniacal laughs) and a hopeful moralist commenting on Scrooge's  soulful journey. It puts Jackson at a disadvantage, as he has trouble combining  the two.  </P> <P> 'A CHRISTMAS CAROL: SCROOGE AND MARLEY'  </P> <P> A Cypress College production of Israel Horovitz's adaptation of Dickens'  classic story.

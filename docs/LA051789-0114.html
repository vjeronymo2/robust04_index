			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR FORCE FREEZES PAYMENTS TO LORAL; INSIDE BID ALLEGED  </P> <P> The Air Force on Tuesday froze payments to Loral Corp. on an electronics  contract that federal investigators say was based on improperly obtained inside  information.  </P> <P> A day earlier, the head of the General Accounting Office recommended that the  Air Force cancel the Loral contract, potentially worth $2 billion over the next  10 years.  </P> <P> The GAO was acting on a complaint from Litton Industries Inc., Loral's chief  competitor for the work, which charged that New York-based Loral had obtained  sensitive information about Litton's bid from an Air Force official involved in  the program.  </P> <P> Federal law enforcement officials allege -- based on wiretap evidence -- that  the official, former Deputy Assistant Air Force Secretary Victor D. Cohen, was  paid for the information by William M. Galvin, a high-powered defense industry  consultant employed by Loral.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Case Fits Pattern  </P> <P> The case came to light in January as part of the sweeping "Ill Wind"  investigation into corruption in the Pentagon procurement system. The case fits  the pattern established in previous successful prosecutions, in which defense  consultants were found to have bribed Pentagon officials for sensitive bidding  information, which was then sold to companies seeking military business.  </P> <P> Loral won the lucrative contract for F-16 cockpit electronics gear in December,  1988, after underbidding Litton by $100 million, a Loral spokesman said.  </P> <P> "Loral strongly believes that the Air Force's selection process for its  Advanced Radar Warning Receiver was proper," the company said in a statement.  "The findings assumed by the GAO remain unproven allegations which Loral  believes are untrue.  </P> <P> "A delay in the program would be costly to the Air Force and damaging to a  critical defense requirement. Loral supports the Air Force in its efforts and  hopes that the Air Force . . . will continue the program with Loral."  </P> <P> Loral is the nation's 32nd-largest Pentagon contractor, with sales to the  military last year of $670 million.  </P> <P> Litton, the nation's 13th-largest defense contractor, said it is "pleased" by  the GAO recommendation and volunteered to work with the Air Force to "fulfill  the requirement for production of these systems." Litton is based in Beverly  Hills.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reviewing Recommendation  </P> <P> The Air Force said Tuesday that it is reviewing the GAO recommendation to  determine whether it should reopen the contract to bids and punish Loral if it  in fact won the original competition improperly. In the interim, an Air Force  spokesman said, new funds for the program have been frozen and Loral will  receive no additional payments.  </P> <P> William D. Nussbaum, the attorney for consultant Galvin, said his client  "denies any wrongdoing. Mr. Galvin had no inappropriate contacts with anybody."  </P> <P> Cohen's lawyer, Julian Greenspun, said there is "no proof that Victor Cohen  gave Galvin any sensitive information. That is merely an accusation or an  assumption by an FBI agent who wants big headlines."  </P> <P> The Air Force moved to fire Cohen after the case was made public, but Cohen  challenged the dismissal. He has been reassigned away from contracting duties  and is conducting an economic study for the Air Force, Greenspun said.  </P> <P> A federal law enforcement official said Loral, Galvin and Cohen remain under  investigation in connection with this contract and other Pentagon business.  </P></p>

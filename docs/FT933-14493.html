			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Letter: Full picture on Gatt Sir, Your article on winners and losers in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ('World Trade News: Those who stand to win and lose in thewrangling', July 9) sets out most lucidly the principal issues, and those suppliers of goods and services who stand to benefit. Any exposition of the issues at stake in the current negotiations should surely include an analysis of winners and losers among the purchasers of those goods and services - that is consumers around the world. Given that in virtually all cases consumers stand to benefit from progress in the Gatt talks it was most surprising to see the only mention of consumers under the heading of Losers (third world consumers unable to afford expensive pharmaceuticals). It is the focus on protected producers who stand to lose, and the lack of emphasis on benefits to consumers, that has enabled politicians to drag their heels on Gatt talks for the last seven years. While it is not incumbent upon your journal to lobby actively for or against the Uruguay Round, it is at the least incumbent upon you to show a fuller picture than offered by your otherwise most informative article.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "special correspondent" Mario Brigando in Rio </F> Gallegos]    [Excerpt] On 31 May, the Latin American Arbitration Court  will close the so-called "allegations phase" involving Argentina  and Chile, and will be in a position to issue an unappealable  ruling before the end of the year on the final boundary in  Laguna del Desierto, an area where slightly more than 530 square  kilometers are under dispute.    It happens that, without congressional approval on both  sides  of the Andean mountains, the agreements signed in 1991 by  then-Chilean President Patricio Aylwin and Argentine President  Carlos Menem, which resolved 22 points under dispute between the  two countries, but did not manage to untie the "Gordian knots"  involving the lake and the Continental Glaciers, paved the way  for international arbitration.    Some diplomatic researchers speculate about the inexorably  looming shadow of an "arbitration compensation" to settle the  disputes with Chile. The researchers interpret that there are  conditions for the court to recognize Argentine sovereignty in  Laguna del Desierto. Nevertheless, based on the right, following  the 1984 agreements on the Beagle channel, to submit other areas  under dispute to the Arbitration Court, without a right to veto  and with unappealable rulings, the researchers note that it  would be a miracle if Chile does not submit the Continental  Glaciers issue to international courts. This issue has been  bogged down in the Argentine Congress since 1991.    Following a Foreign Ministry request, now that the  arbitration ruling is forthcoming, provincial authorities wisely  chose to remain silent. Nevertheless, the experts note that  Chile keeps the Glaciers card up its sleeve. The experts note  that this alternative would actually allow the approval of the  Aylwin-Menem agreements through some compensation mechanism to  establish the "polygonal line" [not further specified] as the  border between the two countries. Many people in this part of  the country believe such a ruling would involve Argentina's loss  of "the key" to the Continental Glaciers.    As confirmed by maps and geographic charts, the area under  dispute was sovereign Santa Cruz (Argentina) territory between  the 1902 arbitration and 1965. The "official history," which is  very well known by Santa Cruz residents, particularly confirms  this fact.    The 1902 arbitration had an adventurous side: Sir Thomas  Holdrich, a British citizen appointed by His Majesty Edward VII  to establish the borders between Argentina and Chile, buried a  Dutch gin jug as a group of assistants looked on in surprise.  The landmark was established at 72 degrees 47 minutes latitude  west. Henceforth, it was established that from that point,  called landmark 62, to the Fitz Roy Mount the border between  Argentina and Chile would pass through the high Andean mountain  peaks, the local water divide (lines that meet without cutting  across rivers).

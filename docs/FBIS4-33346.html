			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview granted yesterday to O ESTADO by  fax, Joao Pedro Stedile -- one of the most important members of  the National Coordinating Board of the Landless People's  Movement, MST -- said that the target of the SAE [Strategic  Affairs Secretariat] report is not the movement. "People are  afraid of Lula's candidacy," he said. Here are some of  Stedile's answers:    [O ESTADO] How does the MST evaluate the SAE report?    [Stedile] It is a shame. It is an action typical of retired  military spies [araponga]. It must have been a vice acquired  during the days of the military dictatorship. In the last few  months, the MST National Coordinating Board met the president of  the Republic. The president promised to begin a program to  settle 100,000 families. The labor minister visited our  encampment. Minister Mario Flores (of the SAE) does not need to  pay the retired military to watch us. We invite them to visit.  We will show them all of our very Brazilian weapons, such as  hunger, unproductive farms, children without schools, and a  great desire to work.    [O ESTADO] What is the MST's ideological trend?    [Stedile] The MST was born from the workers' need to ensure  the implementation of the agrarian reform. The Constitution  establishes that all unproductive land must be expropriated. No  ideological motivation is required.    [O ESTADO] What about guerrilla training at Ipojuca, which  was mentioned in the SAE report, and the objectives of the armed  fight at Bico do Papagaio [a region in the northern part of  Tocantins State]?    [Stedile] This is nonsense. The Ipojuca settlement was  established by the Liberal Front Party government. In Tocantins  State, the MST does not even exist.    [O ESTADO] Does the MST have members from other countries?    [Stedile] That is another myth. The SNI [National  Intelligence Service] (the organization that preceded the SAE)  should know about international politics. With all the misery  reigning in the country, we do not need foreigners to explain  our reality to us.    [O ESTADO] What relation does the movement have with similar  groups in South America, such as the Paraguayan MST?    [Stedile] Latin America has the Peasant and Indigenous  Popular Movement of the 500 Years of Resistance. The MST, CUT  [Sole Workers Center], indigenous groups, and black groups  participate in this movement on Brazil's behalf.    [O ESTADO] What is role of CUT and the PT [Workers Party] in  the movement?    [Stedile] We identify ourselves with CUT, and some MST  militants and leaders are affiliated to the PT. People,  however, support all parties. Some deputies, such as Mauro  Bragato of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], are  Sao Paulo Governor Fleury's leaders in the Assembly.    [O ESTADO] And the MST resources?    [Stedile] They basically come from our own grassroots. It is  an illusion to think that our resources come from abroad. In  many cases we receive support from the Church, and most of our  encampments receive food from the government.</p>

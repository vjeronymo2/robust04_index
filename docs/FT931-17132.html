			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / US warns Somali clans as Bush visits interior US-led forces yesterday warned warring factions in Somalia against any further use of heavy weapons after two clans exchanged artillery, mortar and heavy machine-gun fire for three hours on New Year's Eve, Agencies report from Mogadishu. The clashes on the outskirts of Mogadishu - which came on President George Bush's first night in Somalia - left at least 17 people dead on one side alone, according to US Marine officials. The fighting was a minor clan's attempt to become a participant in peace talks, a United Nations official said. The UN also said one of Somalia's two main warlords was dragging his feet on attending a peace conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, next week. The fighting and threat of a conference boycott gave Mr Bush a glimpse of the rivalries and bloodshed that have plunged Somalia into humanitarian crisis, clan warfare, looting and famine. Mr Bush saw the devastated interior of the country yesterday when he visited Baidoa, 190km west of Mogadishu, where he was greeted by cheering youngsters and foreign relief workers at an orphanage. He thanked US troops for their relief efforts in Somalia but warned that he and President-elect Bill Clinton agreed America should not act as the world's watchdog. Asked by a Marine if the US would take similar action in the future, Mr Bush shook his head. 'I would have to say to you it would be a special case because of the enormity of it,' he said. The New Year's Eve fighting, which lit up the night sky and resumed briefly yesterday morning, broke out when the Murursade clan, led by Mohamed Kanyare, tried to seize a barracks belonging to one of the main warlords, Gen Mohamed Farrah Aidid. US Marine Col Michael Hagee said Mr Aidid's forces lost 17 fighters, with 25 wounded. He did not have figures for the other side. Hospital doctors said up to 35 people, including several children, were wounded.</p>

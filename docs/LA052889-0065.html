			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> LIGHT AT THE END OF GOPHER TUNNELS;  </P> <P> THIS OLD-TIME FARM METHOD USES TWO WOODEN TRAPS TO CATCH THE LITTLE CRITTERS.  </P> <P> You say you have a gopher problem. You have tried trapping, gassing, poisoning,  clubbing, drowning and shooting the poor devil with no results. Here is a  method that, while it is not 100% sure-fire, is close to it. The method was  taught to me by an old-time, highly successful farmer. I have never seen it  fail.  </P> <P> The method requires the use of two wooden box traps and your careful attention  to the directions for completing the three steps involved.  </P> <P> Box traps are available mostly at farm-supply stores and usually are labeled  "Baitless Gopher Trap." They run about $5 apiece. Unfortunately, these traps  are sometimes difficult to locate in urban nurseries. If you cannot locate  them, the wire Macabee traps (widely available) are almost as effective with  this method.  </P> <P> Warning: Whichever trap you utilize, have the seller demonstrate the correct  method of setting and handling the trap, and follow carefully the written  instructions that accompany the trap. Many a careless gopher trapper has  experienced a smashed finger for his carelessness.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Creates Tunnels  </P> <P> Before we go into the actual procedure, it is necessary to examine a little  background on our quarry:  </P> <P> The gopher lives his life underground, spending much of his time creating  underground tunnels or runways. Where he mines these runways, he must relocate  the surplus soil. He does so by creating lateral (branch) tunnels off the main  runway, where he digs to the surface and deposits mounds of dirt. Aside from  plant damage, these mounds are the only evidence the gardener has that a gopher  has invaded his property.  </P> <P> Many people waste their time placing traps or poisons in the holes in the  center of the mounds of the lateral tunnel. This is a mistake, because the  gopher usually plugs the lateral tunnel leading to the surface mound and may  never return to the mound area.  </P> <P> Therefore, the first step in successfully trapping the varmint is to locate his  main runway. You do this by probing the gopher hole with a stick until you  locate the plugged area of the lateral tunnel that is evidenced by loose soil,  in contrast to the surrounding solid soil. This plugged area will connect you  with the main runway.  </P> <P> Using a trowel, remove the plugged soil until you hit the main runway. You will  probably find that the lateral tunnel runs into the main runway at an angle  about 6 to 10 inches from the surface hole.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traps Face Each Other  </P> <P> When you locate the main runway, use a shovel and dig down from the area  directly above the main runway until you reach it. The main runway usually is  located about 10 inches from the surface, but may be even deeper.  </P> <P> The second step involves digging a rectangular area from the surface to the  runway. It should be large enough to place the two box traps on each side of  the tunnel so that the two holes at the solid end of the trap face each other  with about 3 inches separating them.  </P> <P> It is very important not to place the box traps back into the runway or there  will not be enough room for the traps to spring. Instead, they should be  aligned so that the rear edges of the traps fit snugly with each runway  entrance.  </P> <P> If you are using Macabee traps, they are smaller and are actually inserted back  into the runway on each side of your excavation. In addition, the traps are  anchored by wire to a stake positioned on the soil surface to prevent the  gopher from dragging the traps back into the tunnel (explained in directions  accompanying Macabee traps).  </P> <P> In the third step, set the box traps and cover them with a thin coat of peat  moss or other lightweight material so that light is blocked off from any cracks  surrounding the traps. However, be certain that the small holes in the solid  ends of the traps are exposed and will let light enter the trap. This is the  key to the whole operation.  </P> <P> Gophers do not like any light entering their runways and will enter the trap to  investigate. In so doing, he will spring the trap and end your gopher problem.  </P> <P> Again, if utilizing Macabee traps instead of box traps, you will have to put  straw or other lightweight material over both openings in the runway. Separate  the straw slightly so a little light will enter the runway in both directions.  </P> <P> Using this method, you should trap your gopher within 24 hours and usually much  sooner. It is very important to use two traps so that you cover both directions  in the runway.  </P> <P> You will experience some success using just one trap, but your chances for  success increase dramatically with two traps.  </P> <P> Keep pets and children away from the area until the traps are sprung; when the  trapping operation is over, store the traps where children cannot get to them.  </P> <P> This method is intended for the gardener who encounters a gopher now and then.  If you live in an area where gophers are numerous and firmly in command, you  may want to consider gardening in containers or in raised beds with heavy mesh  wire underneath.DR, GEORGE CAREY / Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

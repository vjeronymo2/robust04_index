			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Japanese Press Review On a Japanese news-stand, the high-minded morning dailies are stored in neat rolls at the front, and the comic books, more for the office worker than the schoolboy, are tucked away on the lower shelves. Within easy reach on the counter are the most important sources of information, the weekly news magazines, where the Bank of Japan governor, the wayward soccer player and the ambitious politician get equal, unflattering treatment. The morning newspapers have a sameness ensured by clubby journalists and cartel-style reporting, but the weekly magazines generally see their role as the pursuit of the scoop and the scandal. A few of the dozen mainstream publications have serious coverage of the sensational or sensational coverage of the serious, while the less restrained magazines launch no-holds-barred assaults on public figures, icons included, who have taken a bribe or been unfaithful or simply slipped over within range of a camera lens. It is coverage unflattering to the end. Last week's crop marked the passing of Mr Kakuei Tanaka, the former prime minister and godfather of the Liberal Democratic party. Focus magazine (circulation 600,000) sifted through the archives to find a series of pictures showing the great man hugging hostesses after an evening of relaxation at a favourite bar. But the same edition also provides an accessible introduction to the erratic thoughts of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his Russian version of a Liberal Democratic party. Nearby are photographs of actresses, animals, and accidents; and in a society restrained by deference to the long-term relationship, there are few relationships not worth rupturing for the sake of a garish headline or a mocking caption. Several weeklies are the alter ego of the serious dailies, run by the same company but filled with the news not fit for them to print. The Weekly Yomiuri maintained the Yomiuri newspaper group's sympathy towards Mr Tanaka by opening the magazine with a pin-up portrait and a short but positive review of his career. Words are kept to a minimum, as most readers have waded through newspaper obituaries before reaching for their weekly. Mr Tanaka's resignation as prime minister in 1974 followed magazine articles about his personal finances and fund-raising methods. Newspaper reporters were aware of the unseemly deals done to finance the Tanaka empire, but none was willing to compromise the relationship by writing the story, fearing that privileged access would be denied them and their newspaper. Readers are apparently attracted by the magazines' sudden shifts in mood, one page smut and the next page a Socialist politician petting his poodle. The deeply downmarket Friday, the offspring of an academic book publisher, in its 'Ahh, that person, that question' section asks whether Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, should be paid an annual bonus for allegedly causing the recession. Mr Mieno, who has clearly done his best to avoid recession, also appears in the Weekly Post, where commercial bankers and bureaucrats complain that his puritanical streak is bad for equity prices. The negative coverage of Mr Mieno reflects the willingness of the weeklies to print unsubstantiated sniping, and the inability of the Bank of Japan to handle journalists other than banking writers conscious of their own reputation. Publishers are aware that a good reputation and a solid repertoire don't necessarily work for a weekly. The left-leaning Asahi Journal closed in 1992, when circulation had fallen to 60,000, less than a quarter of its peak, as readers tired of its well-meaning coverage of important issues. The Asahi newspaper group still has the Weekly Asahi and Aera, which had a worthy lead article last week on the costs of a government-sponsored rice cartel and corporate survival tactics for a recession, but also wondered why the country's best known golfer went weak at the knees on the final day of a tournament. The group dips a little downmarket with the semi-serious Weekly Asahi, strong on political coverage, but with a starlet on the cover last week, six pages of Japanese dog photographs and a feature on a dog's life in Belgium. Its favourite political target (meaning that the rolls of film are carefully studied for an unflattering angle) is Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the powerbroker who defected from the LDP to pull together the coalition government. Asahi magazines tend to sidestep the lewd, but Shukan Shincho manages to blend the high-brow with the low-cut by running a pictorial investigation of trends in the international pornography industry, adjacent to a poetic study of the cherry blossom and the Tanaka funeral as told by photography. The serious writing starts on page 22 with a well-researched report on the battle between the bureaucracy and the coalition government, while the rest of the cast includes IBM, a professional wrestler's heartthrob, Salman Rushdie, Japan's entrant in the Miss Universe contest, and Chairman Mao Zedong.</p>

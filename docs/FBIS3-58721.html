The German Defense Ministry  confirmed that a projectile hit the wing of a Luftwaffe Transall  as it was approaching to land in the Bosnian capital. The  aircraft then immediately regained altitude and returned to  Falconara in Italy. The crew were unhurt.    A ministry spokesman said the incident occurred at 1145. The  Transall, with which the Luftwaffe is supporting UN aid flights  between Falconara and Sarajevo, was been hit in the starboard  wing near the engine. The five-man crew immediately turned  around and landed safely back in Falconara shortly after 1300.  [passage omitted]    The spokesman added that the UN airdrop has not been  officially suspended. There will be no German aid flights for  the next two days, however. A decision will be made on further  German participation as soon as a replacement aircraft arrive in  Falconara.    A German Transall first came under fire about a year ago,  when a projectile tore off parts of a propeller and penetrated  the fuselage. The aircraft's chief loader sustained serious  shrapnel injuries.</p>

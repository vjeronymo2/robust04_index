			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / TUC claims GCHQ progress A BREAKTHROUGH in the eight-year dispute between the government and unions over union membership restrictions at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), was claimed yesterday by the Trades Union Congress. The TUC said the government had responded to pressure from the International Labour Organisation and was reopening talks with Civil Service unions. The ILO has been critical of the ban on membership of national unions at GCHQ. The government has argued since 1984 that membership of a national union is incompatible with security. However, the Department of Employment denied a change in the government's stance.</p>

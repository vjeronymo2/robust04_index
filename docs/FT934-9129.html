			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Investment shake-up for French TV A reshuffle of domestic shareholdings in French television is expected to result from this week's bill allowing single investors to increase their stakes from 25 to 49 per cent in a TV station, David Buchan reports from Paris. When TF1, France's leading TV station, was privatised, and newer private channels such as M6 and Canal Plus were set up, the 25 per cent limit was considered necessary to prevent a concentration of media power. But many large investors have complained that the limit gives them financial liability, without management control. The bill is unlikely to change the fact that French TV is considered off limits to foreigners.</p>

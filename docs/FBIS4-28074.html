			<p>BFN     [Text] The Thai army yesterday publicly outlined a 10-point  policy to back up its claim that it no longer supports the  Maoist guerrilla group.    The army's do's and don'ts policy on Cambodia includes  absolutely no contact at any level with the Khmer Rouge and  absolutely no support to them, according to Lt Gen Chettha  Thanacharo, the commander of the First Army Region.    He said it also strictly prohibits supplying of arms to all  sides in Cambodia.    Lt Gen Chettha, who oversees security along Thai-Cambodian  border, briefed reporters on the policy in response to a fresh  charge from the U.S. State Department concerning Thailand's  relations with the Khmer Rouge.    He said under the policy arms seized from the Khmer Rouge  would not be returned to the rebel group. Arms belonging to the  Cambodian army would be returned via the Thai Foreign Ministry,  he said.    The regional army chief said Army Commander in Chief Gen  Wimon Wongwanit had ordered that the policy be strictly observed  in order to refute any accusations that Thailand still supports  the Khmer Rouge or any other side in Cambodia.    Lt Gen Chettha spelled out the policy after the U.S. State  Department questioned Thailand about reports that it was still  backing the Khmer Rouge. The charge was repeated in an article  in THE WASHINGTON POST written by former U.S. ambassador to  Thailand Morton Abramowitz who said that Thailand's stubborn  support for the Maoist group had helped prolong the war in  Cambodia.    Lt Gen Chetha said Cen Wimon had issued firm instructions to  all his subordinates demanding full adherence to the policy. "It  is being adhered to one hundred per cent," Chettha said.    The policy has been circulated to government agencies  concerned, he said. It was formulated in February after the  accusation by Cambodia's first Prime Minister Prince Norodom  Ranariddh and Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut that Thai  Army tanks had been spotted in the Khmer Rouge zone.    "We have a clear policy. We have come to the end of our  efforts. There is nothing else to be afraid of. But doing more  is impossible," Gen Chettha said.    The accusations began in mid-February after the Khmer Rouge  recaptured Anlung Veng which had been briefly taken over by  Phnom Penh troops. The accusations escalated into a war of words  between Bangkok and Phnom Penh after the Khmer Rouge retook  Pailin from Cambodian government troops in March.    The army's policy toward Cambodia as outlined by Lt Gen  Chettha yesterday:  -- Non-interference in Cambodia's internal affairs;    -- Absolutely no support for the Khmer Rouge;    -- Ban of arms supply to Cambodia;    -- Absolutely no contact with the Khmer Rouge but liaison  with the Cambodian government is permitted;    -- Weapons seized from the Khmer Rouge are to be impounded;    -- Weapons belonging to the Cambodian government are to be  returned through the Foreign Ministry;    -- The closing and opening of Thai-Cambodian border  checkpoints is strictly under the control of the Interior  Ministry;    -- The army will provide support for border security only  on the instructions of the Interior Ministry;    -- All military units must strictly observe the  above-mentioned policy; and    -- The policy must to be seriously enforced to counter any  further accusations against Thailand.    Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said yesterday that  all the accusations heaped against Thailand were part of an  attempt to divert attention from the real cause of problems in  Cambodia.    Surin said he had clarified Thailand's position during his  meeting with the new French ambassador.</p>

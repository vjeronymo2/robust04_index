			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2 MEN FACE CHARGES OF MAIL FRAUD;  </P> <P> ARRAIGNMENTS: THE ENCINO RESIDENTS ARE ACCUSED OF BILKING 150 INVESTORS OUT OF  $1.2 MILLION IN A BOGUS OIL WELL SCHEME IN 1984 AND 1985.  </P> <P> Two Encino men who allegedly bilked investors out of more than $1.2 million by  selling shares in bogus oil wells will be arraigned Monday in federal court on  charges of mail fraud.  </P> <P> Peter Stanford, 42, and Anthony Colagreco, 32, promised more than 150 investors  from around the country substantial returns on shares in oil-producing wells  owned by American Southwest Petroleum Ltd., according to a federal indictment  unsealed Thursday.  </P> <P> The shares, which sold for between $2,500 and $3,000 each, were for wells that  salesmen said were already producing oil, although only one well ever produced  oil, the indictment charges.  </P> <P> Stanford and Colagreco will each face 19 counts of mail fraud in U. S. District  Court in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The indictment was the culmination of a joint investigation of the offices of  the U. S. Attorney and the Los Angeles County district attorney, said Terree  Bowers of the U.S. Attorney's Office. The two offices have cooperated in the  past to prosecute oil and gas investment scams operating in Southern  California.  </P> <P> Stanford was arrested Thursday by postal inspectors and was released later on  $25,000 bail and also was required to post additional property, Bowers said.  </P> <P> Stanford's attorney, Tom Nolan, said the charges were unfounded but refused  further comment.  </P> <P> Bail had not been set for Colagreco, who was not arrested because of a deal  between his attorney and investigators, said Don M. Tamura of the district  attorney's office. Colagreco's attorney did not return telephone calls  Thursday.  </P> <P> According to the indictment, Stanford and Colagreco operated American  Southwest, a telephone sales operation in West Los Angeles, in 1984 and 1985.  Telephone salesmen, who called themselves account executives, solicited  prospective investors and were offered shares in wells already producing oil in  Oklahoma and Kansas.  </P> <P> The indictment charges that only one well owned by the company ever produced  oil. Other wells drilled by the company at three locations produced only water.  A fourth location touted as having oil-producing wells was never drilled, the  indictment claims.  </P> <P> To maintain the appearance that the wells were producing oil, Stanford and  Colagreco mailed progress reports detailing false production levels, Bowers  said. They also sent small checks to investors, claiming that they were  returns, he said. Stanford and Colagreco returned about $38,000 to investors,  according to the indictment.  </P> <P> The indictment also alleges that American Southwest was established in October,  1984, with $50,000 solicited from a woman who was promised that her money would  be invested in oil wells.  </P></p>

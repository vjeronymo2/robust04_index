			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses endure worst losses since August 1991 IN THE aftermath of last week's German discount rate rise, poor performances in New York and Tokyo combined with a further weakening in the dollar early yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Bourses had their worst day since last August 19 and the attempted coup against the former Soviet president, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. Then, senior markets showed declines between 5.2 per cent in the Netherlands, and 9.4 per cent in Germany. MILAN dropped to its lowest level since November, 1985, as domestic institutional investors dumped shares after Sunday's brutal killing of a leading anti-Mafia judge, the second such murder in as many months. Dealers said the tragedy had dealt a serious blow to Italy's credibility. 'Today's selling was a vote of no-confidence in the country's politicians and did not reflect the fundamentals of the corporate sector,' one broker said. Fiat preference shares dropped L255 or 8.8 per cent to L2,628, while the ordinary shares fell L330 or 6.7 per cent to L4,575. Olivetti fell L240 or 8.3 per cent to L2,660. Trading in several shares was suspended after they fell by their daily limit. Among them was Stet, the state-controlled telecoms company, which was suspended after falling L154 or 9.6 per cent to L1,445. The Comit index lost 25.11 to 412.67, its lowest close since November 15, 1985, when it closed at 409.23. Turnover swelled to at least L200bn from Friday's L117bn. Dealers were also worried by the lira's weakness against the D-Mark and a statement from the Bank of Italy that it was prepared to increase interest rates further to protect the currency. PARIS bounced back from the day's lows in the middle of the afternoon, as concerted intervention by central banks prompted a rally in the dollar which in turn lifted the bond market. Equities followed suit, as dealers scrambled to cover their short positions, and the CAC 40 index closed down 33.88 or 1.9 per cent at 1,767.90, up from the day's low of 1,735.02. Turnover was moderately active at FFr2.73bn. Alcatel was the day's most active share, losing FFr7 to FFr618 while Suez bucked the trend to close up FFr6 or 2.4 per cent at FFr261. Hachette was a prominent loser, shedding FFr5.90 or 5.5 per cent to FFr101.10. FRANKFURT saw more losses in its dollar, and interest-rate sensitive sectors as the DAX index fell 52.99 to 1,649.67. Turnover was unchanged at DM6.9bn. Dealers said that selling continued after hours, when the September DAX futures contract showed an 80-point slide at 1,648.50, but that subsequent support for the dollar probably left share prices slightly above their official close by the end of the afternoon. Prices of all 30 DAX stocks declined. Underperformers included Metallgesellschaft, down DM20.50, or 5.4 per cent to DM361.50, and Preussag, down DM18, or 4.6 per cent to DM372. Allianz dropped DM82, or 3.8 per cent, to DM2,068. ZURICH closed above its day's lows, although the dollar intervention took place after the close. The SMI index fell 49.0 to 1,756.6 after an earlier low of 1,731.9. The weak dollar put pressure on industrials, and on chemicals in particular. Dealers said that the market ignored Sandoz's 14 per cent rise in first half sales, and its forecast of higher 1992 profits; the shares dropped SFr80 to SFr2,780. AMSTERDAM staged a partial technical recovery in the final minutes of trading with the CBS Tendency index closing 2.4 lower at 116.6. It had earlier touched 115 in thin trading as it followed other markets lower. Fokker had a turbulent day as the market awaited news on talks being held between Dasa and the Dutch government regarding the purchase of a majority stake by the German group. At one stage Fokker lost 11 per cent before recovering to close down Fl 1.70 or 5.5 per cent at Fl 29.00. KLM weakened 50 cents to Fl 32.50 on rumours, denied by the airline, that it was considering a rights issue. Philips picked up some of Friday's loses following its weekend announcement that it plans to reduce its property portfolio. Its shares closed 40 cents lower at Fl 25.20. Elsevier went against the trend, rising 40 cents to Fl 105.30. MADRID weakened in good volume with the general index closing down 5.67 at 217.87. The banking and construction sectors were badly affected with FCC in particular coming under pressure. Its shares closed down Pta1,050 or 13.5 per cent at Pta6,700.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUL 20                              Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Open   10.30am   11 am     12 pm    1 pm     2 pm    3 pm     close 1083.28  1082.63  1079.18  1069.92  1065.79  1059.70  1059.64  1064.04                Day's High  1083.87    Day's Low  1056.88           Jul 17     Jul 16     Jul 15     Jul 14     Jul 13          1097.57    1120.48    1122.53    1124.22    1121.63  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 EUROPEAN STOCK MARKETS - CHANGES ON DAY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Market              Change %          Market            Change %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Italy                 -5.7            Spain              -2.5 Austria               -5.6            Netherlands        -2.0 Norway                -3.8            Finland            -2.0 Sweden                -3.2            France             -1.9 Germany               -3.1            Denmark            -1.7 Switzerland           -2.7            Turkey             -1.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

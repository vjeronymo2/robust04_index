			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Bosnia pressure on Clinton grows The US administration came under increasing pressure over Bosnia yesterday when the House of Representatives voted to require the US to stop enforcing the United Nations arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia and to supply weapons to the Bosnian Moslem government. The vote, by 244 to 178, does not have the force of law but will complicate the administration's efforts in partnership with its European allies and Russia to bring the warring parties to a peace settlement. Congressman Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, warned it would merely aggravate the conflict in Bosnia. 'First of all, it's going to intensify the war,' he said, adding that the vote would also lead to the withdrawal of UN troops, the breakdown of humanitarian operations and the end of the peace process. Congressman Jerrold Nadler countered that the embargo was 'the handmaid of genocide'. President Bill Clinton has said he favours lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia but does not want to act unilaterally, in defiance of the wishes of the European countries which make up the bulk of the UN peacekeeping force in Bosnia. Senior administration officials lobbied members yesterday morning to vote against the measure, which they feared would complicate their efforts to persuade the Bosnian Moslem government to accept a 'reasonable solution'. The US has in recent weeks moved closer to the views of France and the UK on the need to apply pressure on the Bosnian Moslems. Officials have indicated that they would be ready to consider removing some economic sanctions against Serbia if the Bosnian Moslem government rejected the peace proposals on which the US is working with Europe. Yesterday's resolution, sponsored by Congressmen Frank McCloskey of Indiana and Benjamin Gilman of New York, requires the president to 'terminate the US arms embargo of the government of Bosnia and Hercegovina upon receipt from that government of a request for assistance in exercising its right of self-defence'. It authorises the president to provide 'appropriate military assistance' and authorises the transfer of up to Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) of military equipment and training services to the Bosnian government. Although the Senate has passed a similar resolution, its language was different, and identical versions would have to be passed in both chambers before the measure could become law.</p>

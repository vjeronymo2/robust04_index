			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SHOT BY POLICE TASER DARTS DIES  </P> <P> A young man jumping in and out of traffic in the Crenshaw area was shot with  Taser electrical darts early Monday and died a short time later, officers  reported.  </P> <P> Lt. William D. Hall, supervisor of the Los Angeles Police Department's  officer-involved shooting unit, said police were told by a motorist just before  4 a.m. that the man was acting in a bizarre fashion and jumping in front of  vehicles on Venice Boulevard, just west of Crenshaw Boulevard.  </P> <P> Wilshire Division Officers Steven Johnson and Steven Garcia tried to move the  unidentified man out of the street, Hall said, but reported that he "appeared  to be under the influence of a drug or narcotic."  </P> <P> The officers sent for the Taser device, which shoots electrically charged darts  on fish lines in order to stun a hard-to-handle suspect.  </P> <P> Although the first Taser shot failed to have any visible effect, a second  appeared to calm the man down and he was handcuffed. Paramedics took him to  Kaiser Foundation Hospital, where he died at 5 a.m., police said. Hall said an  autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] is stepping up  security at its offices countrywide following two blasts in four  days. An explosion caused extensive damage to the organization's  offices in Bothaville in the [Orange] Free State last night.  Caro Kriel reports that the two attacks have raised questions  about free poliical activity in the run-up to the election.    [Begin recording] [Kriel] The Free State town of Bothaville  is known for its fertile farmland and right-wing politics. Five  months ago the ANC opened an office in the main street. Last  night it was damaged in an explosion believed to have been  caused by commercial explosives. No one was injured. More than  100,000 rands' damage was caused, but ironically nearby shops  suffered the most. Local ANC leaders allege that the right wing  is behind the attacks. They say there was trouble from the  beginning.    [ANC spokesman Steven Mathibe] There was a group of the  right  wing who were here with the intention to stop the leadership  from opening these offices.    [Kriel] The owner of the pharmacy next to the ANC offices  said this comes as no surprise.    [Pharmacist Mannetjie van der Linde] Unfortunately the  political situation in this town is so that a thing like that  must have been expected.    [Kriel] Just 4 nights ago the ANC office in Harrismith,  another small Free State farming town, was attacked in the same  way. Commercial explosives were also used. Police are  investigating a possible link with the Bothaville blast. With  little over 3 months before the election, one wonders whether  what has happened in Harrismith and here is only the beginning.  The police say they are expecting similar terror attacks from  the left and the right, and are planning for it. [end recording]</p>

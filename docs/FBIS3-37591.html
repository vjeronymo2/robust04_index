The representative of Armenians of  Nagorno-Karabakh, Bako Saakyan attended the meeting as well.  The meeting was conducted on the initiative of Pavel Grachev.    As reported before, Grachev told both parties if they do not  come to any agreement, he will never act as mediator in  settlement of the conflict.    Such strict policy of Russian Defense Minister compelled the  warring parties to take the resolution on cease-fire.  Azerbaijani and Armenian Defense Ministers agreed to  stage-by-stage settlement of the conflict. According to Defense  Ministry of Russian Federation, Russian plan of settlement of  the conflict stipulates cease-fire, liberation of all occupied  territories, sending of all foreign mercenaries at home.    Representative of Russian Defense Ministry refused to  comment  on the question of a TURAN's correspondent "What do you mean by  phrase `all occupied territories?'". He did not explain how the  control over the sending of foreign mercenaries at home will be  carried out.    Together with this, the meeting of Azerbaijani and Armenian  Defense Ministers continues in Moscow.    Earlier this meeting was not scheduled and invitation of  Armenian and Azerbaijani Defense Ministers to Moscow was a  surprise. It should be mentioned that the meeting and the plan  of settlement were not prepared in advance.    When the Serbians of Bosnia accepted Russian offers, the  tension round the capital of Bosnia eased a little. Presently  Russia wishes to win one more diplomatic victory in another  hotbed. Moscow will try to make Azerbaijan to adopt its plan on  settlement the Armenian-Azerabaijani conflict stipulating  introduction of Russian peacemaking troops in the region. As  known, official Baku did not agree with that plan as it does not  stipulate absolute liberation of occupied Azerbaijani  territories.</p>

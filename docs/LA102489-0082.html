			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: KURAGAMI SWEEPS HER WAY TO TOP  </P> <P> Cindy Kuragami is the top singles player on the Savanna High School girls'  tennis team. And that's right where she wants to be.  </P> <P> But she has kept that part of her life in perspective.  </P> <P> "Tennis never gets in the way of studies, but not vice versa," Kuragami said.  "Ever since I started playing, my family has emphasized studies."  </P> <P> Kuragami, The Times' Athlete of the Week, is a rare athlete who considers  sports an extra-curricular activity.  </P> <P> Although there's great money to be had by young tennis players. There are  chances to travel Europe, play tennis and get paid for it.  </P> <P> But Kuragami says that such aspirations are a bit off in her case. She's not  sure if she can go that far on her talent and she is concerned about a college  education.  </P> <P> She has been working off-and-on with a private coach and, more than anything  else, has learned she must accept her limitations.  </P> <P> "I don't have a strong serve -- and part of that is because of my size  (5-foot-1 1/2, 107 pounds) -- but I try to make up for that in other ways. I'm  working on placing my serves. I try to slice my serves, spin serves and I have  a flat serve. It's coming along slowly."  </P> <P> Which might come as a surprise to her Orange League opponents. Last week was a  typical week for Kuragami. She swept her sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, on Thursday in a  13-5 victory over Magnolia, and swept 6-1, 6-0, 6-0 in a loss to Western  Tuesday.  </P> <P> She also sweeps through her classes as exemplified by her 4.0 grade-point  average.  </P> <P> "I've talked with some of her teachers, and they say, 'She doesn't get most of  the points in class -- she gets all of them,' " Savanna Coach Eric Hansen said.  "At practice, she shares everything she knows and hits with anyone who wants to  hit -- it's like having an extra coach out there."  </P> <P> That is considerably high praise for a 15-year-old. Kuragami skipped the second  grade and is still leaving her peers behind.  </P> <P> Kuragami has been a standout player on a mediocre team. She has a set record of  48-0 this season, while Savanna has a team record of 7-7 overall, 5-3 in league  play. And the Orange League has an overall quality of tennis that tends to make  Kuragami appear to be a big fish in a small pond.  </P> <P> Kuragami is ranked ninth by the Southern California Tennis Assn. for ages 16  and under and is 40th in the nation.  </P> <P> Including nonleague matches, Kuragami has lost only one set, when she was a  freshman, at Savanna. In the past two years, her only other losses have been in  the third round of the Southern Section tournament.  </P> <P> Perhaps what really sets Kuragami apart is that she's not just another  hard-working-athlete-student-robot type.  </P> <P> "Oh, she's outgoing and liked very well by, it seems like, everyone," Hansen  said. "She really is a wonderful person."  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, Kuragami wants to attend Stanford because of its reputation  for academics and for its top women's tennis program. "But I would weigh any  offers I would get," Kuragami said. "I hope my grades will help me get some  offers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Michelle Berkowitz of Fountain Valley swept her matches, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, against  Ocean View Tuesday and swept 6-1, 6-0, 6-0 against Huntington Beach Thursday.  </P> <P> Wendy Herb of Rosary had 31 blocks in a 14-16, 15-10, 9-15, 15-12, 15-10  victory over Bishop Amat Thursday.  </P> <P> Cindy Kuragami  </P> <P> Savanna High School  </P> <P> Position: No. 1 singles tennis player  </P> <P> Height, Weight, Class: 5-1 1/2, 107, Junior  </P> <P> Last Week: Kuragami swept her matches, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, on Thursday against  Magnolia and won, 6-1, 6-0, 6-0, Tuesday against Western.  </P> <P> Season: Kuragami has not lost a set this season (48-0).  </P></p>

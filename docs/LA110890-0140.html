			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: CHILLS AND THRILLS FOR SKI BUFFS  </P> <P> Skiers, anticipating your first opportunity to swoosh down snowy slopes this  winter? Between watching endlessly blue skies and waiting for enough of the  white stuff to blanket ski runs at your favorite resort, you may want to check  out renowned ski bum-filmmaker Warren Miller's latest film.  </P> <P> Written and narrated by Miller, "Extreme Winter" -- his 41st feature film --  journeys through some of the most challenging, untamed slopes in the world.  </P> <P> Fourteen cameramen traveled more than 584,000 miles to 24 locations on four  continents, offering viewers the chance to glide down untracked powder, thrash  through moguls, fly over giant cornices of snow and witness aerial-freestyle  and aerobatic competitions.  </P> <P> Ventura County enthusiasts will have two opportunities to catch Miller's ski  follies. The Westlake Village Theater, at Lakeview Canyon and Agoura roads in  Westlake Village, will show the film at 7 and 9 p.m. Wednesday. The Ventura  Theater, 26 S. Chestnut St., Ventura, will have showings at 7 and 9 p.m. Nov.  16.  </P> <P> Tickets are $7 for both venues.  </P></p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / HK civil servants warm to Patten THE possibility of Mr Chris Patten, Conservative party chairman, becoming governor of Hong Kong provoked a warm reaction from the colony's civil service yesterday Mr John Major, the prime minister, is believed to have told Mr Patten that he could have the job if he decided to make a break from UK politics. However, Downing Street officials said a final decision remained some weeks off. Mr Patten may decide he wants to return to the House of Commons at an early opportunity, following the loss of his Bath constituency in the general election last week. Hong Kong civil servants indicated they would prefer Mr Patten to Dr David Owen, the former Labour foreign secretary and leader of the defunct Social Democratic Party, who has also been tipped as a possible candidate. The vacancy follows the retirement later this year of Lord Wilson, the present governor. The colony's nascent political parties gave guarded support to Mr Patten's candidature. The United Democrats, which scored a near clean sweep in last September's direct elections, see him as a liberal who is likely to be more supportive of their calls for greater democracy than the present administration. Hong Kong government officials said that a politician with Mr Patten's political skills would be an asset to the colony as it approaches the most difficult period of its transition from UK rule to Chinese rule. Mr Patten is seen as a leading political figure - not a has been - with close ties to both Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. He has also had administrative experience, a quality seen as vital in Hong Kong, given the scale of the local civil service.</p>

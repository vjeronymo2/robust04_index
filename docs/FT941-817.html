			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Berlusconi alliance heads for clear win in Italian poll Media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi last night staked his claim to head Italy's next government, after initial projections gave his three-party rightwing Freedom Alliance a clear lead over his rivals in elections for parliament. Mr Berlusconi, who turned to politics less than four months ago after scandals demolished many veteran politicians, pledged to relaunch the economy with a free-market programme. But he acknowledged he would have difficulty in putting together a government with his allies in the Freedom Alliance - the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and Mr Gianfranco Fini of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. 'We must be united in victory,' he declared. Computer projections based on partial counting of votes indicated that the Freedom Alliance would be the largest bloc and was likely to win an absolute majority in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. One projection early today suggested it could get as many as 375 seats in the 630-member chamber. The Freedom Alliance appeared less likely to gain a working majority in the upper house, the Senate, which has power to block legislation. But one projection gave it 150-160 seats in the 315-member Senate. Final results are not expected to be known until tonight after two days of voting under an experimental system mixing first-past-the-post and proportional representation. A dejected Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) - which co-ordinated the leftwing Progressive Alliance - conceded his seven-party grouping had failed to win enough support to determine the next government. The centre alliance, composed of former Christian Democrats in the Popular Party (PPI) and the centrist pact of Mr Mario Segni, was squeezed. Early projections gave the Italian Pact 45-65 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The result is an extraordinary personal success for Mr Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia movement appeared to have won about 25 per cent of the vote nationwide. The Milan-born Mr Berlusconi looked set to win his own first-past-the-post contest in Rome against Prof Luigi Spaventa, the budget minister and candidate for the Progressives. Another big success was the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, which exit polls showed to have won 13 per cent of the vote. Signalling tension in the Freedom Alliance, Mr Bossi said the victory was one of a 'reactionary right' and he accused the neo-fascists of 'trying to open up the wallets of the north' to aid the poorer south. The Italian financial markets had surged yesterday with strong buying based on reports that the Freedom Alliance was likely to win. The Milan stock market's main index added 3.76 per cent.

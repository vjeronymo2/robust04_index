			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Sainsbury chief admits supermarket 'greed' The chairman of Britain's biggest supermarket group admitted yesterday that big food retailers had been 'greedy' in the 1980s and allowed prices for basic foods to 'drift upwards', opening a gap for cut-price discount chains. Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of J. Sainsbury, also suggested the big grocery retailers had been wrong to desert town centres, and were finding new ways of trading successfully from high-street stores as well as out-of-town superstores. Mr Sainsbury said at the annual convention of the Institute of Grocery Distribution that in their rapid expansion since the mid-1980s grocery retailers had 'allowed the pendulum to swing too far in two areas'. He said: 'The major food retailers in the 1980s concentrated heavily on meeting the increasing demands of customers for convenience, service and quality, and in so doing we allowed the prices on some basic commodities to drift upwards. This provided an opportunity for discounters to undercut us.' Over the past year, he said, superstores had cut prices on basic goods and returned to the 'historical position' where the gross profit on such products was small 'because the costs of selling them are very low'. Answering questions after his presentation Mr Sainsbury conceded that superstore groups had been 'greedy', but joked that this meant trying to make a profit margin of a few per cent on products such as bread and milk, on which they previously made virtually no profit. Mr Sainsbury suggested the big groups had been mesmerised by the efficiency and popularity of edge-of-town supermarkets, and forgot that there would always be some business located in town centres. He added: 'The market did, however, work extremely effectively and a number of chains, including the discounters, moved in to fill the gap.' Sainsbury now favoured remodelling and refurbishing town-centre stores to extend their life, rather than closing them. Mr Sainsbury's view was echoed by Mr David Reid, finance director of Tesco, the UK's second biggest food retailer, who said retailers could now achieve acceptable rates of return from smaller stores. Mr Sainsbury's comments came as Mr Henrick Gundelach, managing director of Netto, the Danish discounter which has been operating in the UK since 1990, said that discount competition in the grocery market would increase. He told a conference organised by Verdict, the retail research group, that the number of discount chains would increase from between three and four to between eight and 10.</p>

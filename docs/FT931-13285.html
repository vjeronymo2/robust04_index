			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / English speakers lead crime league ENGLISH-speaking industrialised countries head the world's crime league, with some types of offence twice as common in the US, England or Australia as in France or Germany, according to an intergovernmental report. The report is the most authoritative study to date comparing crime around the industrialised world. Sponsored by interior and justice ministries and police agencies, the report is based on surveys carried out last year and in 1989 among 55,000 respondents in 20 countries. 'With the most obvious exceptions of Japan and Switzerland, all industrialised countries suffer from an appreciable level of property and aggressive crime,' the report says. 'For the public, being a victim of crime has become a common feature of life in most urban areas.' The report suggests governments' ability to curb rising crime is limited. It puts forward a number of proposals, including better security standards for cars and measures to discourage beer consumption  - held to be a factor behind violence. But it also sounds a note of fatalism. 'Put bluntly, this (rising crime) seems to be the price for living in an affluent, urbanised and democratic society, regardless of government policy on crime, or the way in which communities try to organise themselves.' Among the more controversial findings, England and Wales are recorded as having registered the greatest increase in overall crime between 1988 and 1991. The number of respondents saying they had been the victim of one or more crime rose 56 per cent during the two periods in England - much more than indicated in previous UK crime surveys and in police statistics. The study, co-ordinated by the Dutch Justice Ministry, is based on questioning of random samples of adults, normally 2,000 people in each country. They were asked to report whether they had been victims of crime during the past 12 months - in 1988 and/or 1991. Attitudes towards crime were also polled. Eight countries held surveys in both years. Such so-called 'victimisation surveys' offer a more reliable guide to international crime trends than countries' police statistics, where comparisons are distorted by divergences in crime reporting. In view of uncertainties associated with polling methods, the report's authors - Mr Jan van Dijk of the Dutch Justice Ministry and Ms Pat Mayhew of the UK Home Office - caution about using the study to draw 'firm conclusions'. Nonetheless, some sharp international differences emerge. Northern Ireland, in spite of frequent sectarian violence, ranks as one of the industrial world's least crime-ridden areas. On the other hand, New Zealand and the Netherlands, belying their peaceable reputations, have some of the most severe law and order problems. Crime in Poland and Czechoslovakia is shown as much higher than indicated by police figures. In most countries, fear of crime is closely linked to actual prevalence of offences. In England, fear of burglary - which is much higher than in the rest of Europe - has increased since 1989, in line with actual burglary risks. In one sign of exaggerated alarm over violence, fears of street crime are much higher than the real risks in Japan and West Germany. Car theft appears roughly six times more prevalent in England, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, France and the US than in the Netherlands and west Germany. Burglary is much more frequent in non-European countries, with Australia, New Zealand, the US and Canada among the leaders, and rates also high in Poland, former Czechoslovakia and England. Sexual assaults on females appear highest in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Australia, Canada, and west Germany. Matching incidence of sexual violence, the highest rates of aggressive crime are in North America, Australia, New Zealand and Poland. Robbery is most common in Spain, Poland, the US and Italy. The survey highlights differences in attitudes towards police. People who had reported an offence were least satisfied with the police response in Poland, Norway, Italy, Czechoslovakia and Spain.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Kim Ho-sam: "Dangerous </F> Military Moves"]    [Text] According to the recent issue of the British weekly  magazine specializing in military affairs, JANE'S DEFENCE  WEEKLY, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry handed out a directive to  the U.S. aircraft carrier, Independence, to assume an alert  posture in the area from which it can reach the Korean peninsula  within a week.    Reporting this, the paper wrote that this step is designed  to  promptly cope with the crisis if it emerges on the Korean  peninsula. Such a report by the British paper specializing in  military affairs is not an accident at all.    As has been known, the hardline conservative faction in the  U.S. Congress and Government, and impure forces who collaborated  with international reactionaries recently made intolerable,  violent, and bellicose remarks one after another on the pretext  of our so-called nuclear issue.    Concerning the replacement of nuclear fuel rods in our  experimental nuclear power station, the U.S. hardline  conservative faction raved that we should suspend the  replacement, the International Atomic Energy Agency should  choose fuel rods and keep them separately, and so forth. Thus,  it raised a unreasonable [ichie matti annun] demand.    As we refused this demand, U.S. Senator McCain on 24 May  made  violent remarks at the Senate that North Korean nuclear  facilities should be air raided or attacked with cruise missiles.    Moreover, U.S. Vice President Gore, stating that  continuously  holding talks with North Korea is dangerous, said that so-called  security steps taken by the United States for South Korea are  all wise. The wise steps he referred to mean the Patriot  missiles and Apache offensive helicopters that were deployed in  South Korea some time ago.    At a time when the U.S. hardline conservative faction openly  calls for attacking the experimental nuclear power station in  our country, the U.S. defense secretary is attempting to launch  and put a mobilization posture on the carrier Independence in  the area close to the Korean peninsula. This illustrates that  the United States has not discarded at all the ambition to crush  [apsal] the popular mass-centered socialist system of our own  style by means of force and by mobilizing all of its Navy and  Air Force on the pretext of our nuclear problem.    As has been known, the carrier Independence is an  ultra-large  carrier based in Yokosuka, Japan after replacing the Midway some  time ago. This carrier has experience in directly participating  in landing exercises on the sea off Pohang when the Team Spirit  joint military exercise was staged in 1991.    The United States is planning to deploy this ultra-large  carrier in the sea close to the Korean peninsula. This proves  that the U.S. bellicose circles are going to launch a surprise  attack on our Republic at a certain time [ku onuttaee kasonun]  on the pretext of so-called nuclear development in collusion  with Japanese Self- Defense Force troops that are concentrated  in western Japan facing the Korean peninsula.    What we should not overlook in particular is that the  directive of the U.S. defense secretary is to be executed during  the period of Rimpac training which continues from the end of  May until mid-July.    As was already reported, during the period of Rimpac  training, the United States will organize a joint fleet with the  Japanese naval self-defense force and the South Korean puppet  navy for the first time since this military training started in  1970, and will carry out joint operations with them.    Concerning the plan of U.S. Navy, the Japanese naval  self-defense force, and the puppet South Korean navy to organize  a joint fleet and to stage the Rimpac training, the  director-general of the Japanese Defense Agency openly stated  that this plan will serve as a political message against the  North Korean nuclear plan. This clearly shows that this joint  fleet is aiming at our Republic.    The fact that under this situation, the carrier Independence  will move to an area close to the Korean peninsula and be placed  on alert status shows that the tripartite military alliance  system between the United States, Japan, and South Korea is  actually in motion.    Because of such policy for crushing the DPRK by the United  States, a very dangerous situation is prevailing on the Korean  peninsula. This arouses deep concern among the peaceloving  people of the world. The people of the world wish that the  nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula be resolved peacefully  through dialogue and negotiations. However, the U.S. hardline  conservative faction is continuously scheming to carry out  adventurous military action.    However, this is not beneficial to the United States itself,  nor will this situation advance as the United States wants  [kurona kugosun miguk chacherul wihaesodo iropchi mottamyo,  ttohan migugui uidodoeronun kyolko toeji annul kosimnida].    The U.S. policy for crushing the DPRK is very harmful from  the standpoint of not only U.S. interests but also of peace and  security of Northeast Asia. The U.S. attempt to crush us by  means of force is a great mistake.    We are prepared for war and for negotiations. The United  States should not adhere to adventurous military action, but had  better act with discretion.</p>

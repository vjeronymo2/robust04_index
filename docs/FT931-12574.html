			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Krajina's Serbs demand Croat withdrawal within 24 hours SERBS in Krajina, the disputed Serb enclave in Croatia, yesterday demanded that Croatian forces withdraw within 24 hours from territory seized during their six-day offensive. The ultimatum was issued as the fighting took a new twist, with Serb forces launching a counter-offensive. They later claimed to have seized strategic villages around the Maslenica bridge, which joins central Croatia with its southern Adriatic coast and which was the initial objective of the Croatian forces. In addition, the United Nations Protection Force disclosed last night 21 of its number had been detained by the Serb rebels since Sunday in a hotel in Benkovac, a Krajina town which has come under fire from Croatian troops. Ms Shannon Boyd, an Unprofor official, said in the Croatian capital Zagreb: 'The Serb militias say the UN police have been restricted for their own security. But this is totally unacceptable. There is no legitimate reason for this.' In New York, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, last night accused the Croats of widening attacks against UN-monitored areas and said these had jeopardised the entire peace process in the region. Briefing the Security Council, he said Croatian troops were shelling new targets and that their offensive had 'serious implications' for the future of the 16,000 UN peace-keepers in Croatia, whose mandate comes up for renewal in about three weeks. The commander of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, General Satish Nambiar, yesterday met Serb leaders at Knin, the capital of Krajina. Mr Boro Martinovic, a minister in the self-styled Krajina government, said: 'We told him the Croats must withdraw beyond the ceasefire line by noon on Wednesday. If not, we will have no choice but to clean the terrain by ourselves.' Following the Security Council condemnation of the Croat offensive across UN lines, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia on Tuesday said he would only order the withdrawal of Croat forces if the Serb militia returned their heavy weapons to UN control. But hopes of a ceasefire yesterday faded amid the Serbian counter-offensive. In Geneva, where Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance are co-chairing peace talks on the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Moslem president of Bosnia, yesterday threatened to abandon the talks. He cited continued Serbian attacks on Moslems as the reason for the threat. Mr Izetbegovic and Mr Mate Boban, Bosnia's Croat leader, announced a cessation of hostilities between Croat and Moslem troops in Bosnia and vowed to resurrect their alliance against the Serbs. But the International Red Cross said intensified clashes between Croats and mainly Moslem Bosnian forces around Busovaca, central Bosnia, had blocked the main humanitarian aid routes into Bosnia. Meanwhile, a British naval task force headed by the aircraft carrier Ark Royal is now in position in the Adriatic. The task force is carrying reinforcements for the 2,400 British troops helping to protect UN aid convoys in Bosnia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Viktor Karpov under the "Behind the </F> Screen of Big-Time Politics" rubric: "The Pechorskiy Rayon  Card"]    [Excerpts] Pskov Oblast -- The Tartu (Yuryev) Treaty of  1920, on which Estonia bases its current territorial claims to  Pskov Oblast's Pechorskiy Rayon, is just an "ordinary scrap of  worthless paper," State Duma Deputy Vladimir Lukin (until  recently Russian ambassador to the United States) stated in  Pechory 9 February, explaining that it was concluded on behalf  of Russia "not by the country or the government but by one of  the sides engaged in the civil war or, more precisely, by a  group of antipeople politicians." Citing a telling historical  parallel, the parliamentarian said that to recognize the Tartu  Treaty as the foundation of today's interstate relations between  Russia and Estonia would be like Hetman Semenov, who also signed  a territorial agreement in Manchuria, concluding a treaty with  China on the establishment of today's Russian state borders.  Time itself and the existing historical realities have  sidestepped and sidelined the unfortunate Tartu Treaty.    The statement is as unambiguous as it is significant, for it  shows that at last a stance is developing on the part of Russian  parliamentary circles toward the acute "Estonian question" or,  more accurately, toward the "Pechorskiy Rayon card," which the  Estonian side invariably plays in order to stymie the so far  fruitless Russian-Estonian talks on interstate relations. The  talks have been going on without any progress for a long time  now because Estonia's appetite for Pechorskiy Rayon acts as a  stumbling block. And this is evidenced not just in words but in  deeds, for the "right" to Pechorskiy soil has already been  enshrined in nothing less than the Constitution of the Republic  of Estonia. [passage omitted]    It is surprising but true that all the Baltic state's  maneuvers and intrigues were until recently met with drowsy  indifference or, at best, a wait-and-see approach, thereby  encouraging those bent on acquiring others' land to engage in  more and more subversive acts. And here it is not just  territorial appetites, not just rowdy scenes involving Estonian  nationalist organizations periodically staged on the Russian  border. The poisonous seeds of enmity toward Russians nurtured  in Estonia's political inner sanctum can only cause you to  wonder. [passage omitted]    Only the local authorities, in concert with the oblast  administration, are now tackling the problem of the border  territories and endeavoring to issue statements and reassure  people that "not an inch of Russian soil will be ceded."  (Incidentally, inhabitants of Pechorskiy Rayon also heard such  assurances from Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and Chernomyrdin -- and  what came of that?) Albeit worn out by the uncertainty, the  inhabitants of the border region do nevertheless regard these  statements with mistrust -- Pskov, after all, is not Moscow,  where big-time politics is played, and they do not believe that  the Russian authorities are capable of protecting them.    Thank God that the Pechorskiy Rayon question is finally  being  taken up in earnest by Russian parliamentarians, and  high-ranking ones at that: Namely V. Lukin, chairman of the  State Duma International Affiars Committee, and V. Podoprigora,  chairman of the Federation Council's identically named  committee. During their one-day trip to Pechorskiy Rayon they  studied the work of the border control points and the problems  of providing a border infrastructure, and met with customs  officials, border guards, and representatives of the rayon  public. A conference to sum up the results in which Oblast  Governor V. Tumanov took part was held at the rayon  administration.    "The aim of our trip was to study all the conflicts  surrounding the "Pechorskiy Rayon question'" V. Podoprigora said  in summation, "and to convey the full acuteness of the  prevailing situation to parliament, the government, and the  president. In our view, it is essential that special  parliamentary hearings be held on this question to elaborate at  last a clear Russian stance and to spur the supreme authorities  to take practical measures to disavow the 'Pechorskiy card' once  and for all."    It is time, high time this were done!</p>

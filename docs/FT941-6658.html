			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Animal spirits on too tight a leash - Services in Europe are less attuned to a mass market than in the US When Europeans discuss industrial performance, most of the talk is about manufacturing and little about services. Yet as the challenge of economic regeneration grows more pressing, services' contribution and potential look set to move sharply up the agenda. The sector is already Europe's largest source of output and employment - and its importance is increasing. In west Germany, Europe's leading manufacturing economy, the number of services jobs rose 28 per cent from 1990 to 1992, while totals in other sectors stagnated or declined. The outlook is for a continuing fall in factory jobs and a squeeze on public sector payrolls throughout Europe, leaving services as one of few areas where large-scale job creation still seems possible. Optimists point to the US, where services employment has grown by 23m people since 1980 - double the rise in the EU - and to the growth of Britain's service economy. Though the quality of jobs created is disputed, these examples are cited as arguments for relaxing continental Europe's rigid labour laws. But the story does not end there. The search for new jobs coincides awkwardly with structural upheavals in services businesses such as telecommunications, the media, financial services and retailing. These businesses ought to be at the heart of wealth creation, as Europe upgrades from declining traditional industries to newer, technology-based activities involving higher skills and greater value-added. But, in many, pressures to improve efficiency are likely in the short term to lead to fewer jobs, not more. A report last month for the European Commission found airlines' operating costs were 48 per cent higher in Europe than in the US, largely because of poorer labour productivity. A McKinsey study in 1992 found similar transatlantic productivity differences in telecommunications and banking. More recently, McKinsey found the efficiency of British retailers, supposedly among Europe's highest, trailed far behind US chains. It concluded that, if UK supermarkets had to charge US prices, they would plunge into loss. While most service businesses were labour-intensive and sheltered by national barriers, such discrepancies mattered little. But the discrepancies are becoming unsustainable as cross-border competition and labour-saving technologies compel companies to raise productivity. The pace is being forced by privatisation, which is challenging the over-staffing, bureaucracy and obsolete practices encouraged by a tradition of state ownership in sectors such as telecommunications, airlines and banking. To judge by job cuts by privatised UK companies, the scope for labour-shedding across Europe in the next few years is huge. If services are to generate economically rewarding additional jobs, tackling rigid labour laws will not be enough. Much will also depend on Europe's ability to maximise market opportunities and stimulate service-based businesses with the potential to grow fast and profitably. On this score, services in Europe are bound by two constraints which impose more heavily than on manufacturing. One is domination of important markets by national monopolies. The other is a more complex - and often more restrictive - panoply of regulatory control. The impact of the EU's single market programme on these obstacles has been uneven. Progress in dismantling barriers and encouraging cross-border competition has been reasonably rapid in a range of financial, professional and business services and road transport, but more halting in classic monopoly industries, such as telecommunications, energy supply and air transport. Nor does the programme tackle some inhibiting national regulations, such as Germany's tight curbs on shopping hours. But it is debatable how far fragmentation of Europe's services markets has, in practice, obstructed their development. Though many barriers to market entry have been real, others seem to owe much to participants' attitudes. Among the most persuasive evidence is trans-European expansion by US services producers. While Europe's broadcasters and film makers dabble with collaboration, Hollywood entertainment dominates its screens. The US-owned MTV music channel, now beamed Europe-wide, has pioneered an entirely new market. US telecommunications and cable operators have been more aggressive than most local counterparts in establishing footholds in Europe, while the running in 'multi-media' services, such as home shopping, is mostly by US firms. Most packaged software used on personal computers in Europe is of US origin, while Japanese groups dominate electronic video games. Chains such as Toys R Us and Computerland have revolutionised sectors of European retailing, while McDonald's is now France's biggest restaurateur and has earmarked western Europe as its prime growth market in the 1990s. US companies obviously benefit from scale economies from a large and homogenous home market. But, in most cases, they also succeed in Europe by offering distinctive products, backed by effective marketing and distribution. European services companies such as Ikea or Benetton in retailing, which have made an impact in North America by transplanting a new idea, are more rare. More often the preferred route is to buy market share by investing in established businesses. Though this approach is supposed to reduce risk, the results have been mixed. Grand Metropolitan has revitalised Burger King, but Bass is still struggling to turn around Holiday Inn. Marks &amp; Spencer now admits it paid too much for Brooks Brothers, the US clothing chain, while several European grocery groups which bought into US supermarkets have been troubled by the experience. Of course, US service companies are far from infallible, as the Eurodisney fiasco demonstrates. But, at their best, they often seem more closely attuned than European businesses to the mass market and more confident about exporting innovations. That suggests that, if Europe's services industries are to prosper, ridding markets of artificial barriers and excessive regulation is only half the battle. The bigger challenge may be to unleash the animal spirits needed to exploit them fully against steadily stiffer international competition.</p>

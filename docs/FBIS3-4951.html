The office's chief information officer, Dr. Suparman Sh  [Master of Law], in a talk with newsmen here also dismissed as  untrue suggestions that it was conducting the enquiry "under  pressure".    "What we are investigating now is a pure penal case and  there  is no political intrigue behind it nor are we being pressured by  anyone," he said.    However, he said he could not guarantee that the case would  remain a pure penal case. "Nobody can be sure that the case will  remain so," he said.    Suparman also refuted media reports criticizing the Attorney  General's Office for allegedly not being very objective in  deciding who had to be subjected to questioning in connection  with the Bapindo credit scam.    "We are not discriminative in our investigations. If to date  we have detained only two persons this is merely in accord with  the evidence collected so far," he said.    Since the inquiry of the case began the Attorney General's  Office has detained two persons, namely E.T., chairman of GKG  [Golden Key Group] group of companies and Sup, former deputy  head of Bapindo's Kuningan branch office.    A number of other persons often mentioned in the media as  being most probably involved in the case, have so far not been  arrested.    Suparman said in conducting the inquiry into the Bapindo bad  debt case the Attorney General's office was sticking strictly to  the penal code (KUHP), other relevant laws and regulations as  well as banking laws.    He called on the public to observe self-restraint in making  comments on the on-going investigations of the case, saying that  comments not based on precise knowledge of the matters at hand  would only mislead society.    Meanwhile E.T. was today again interrogated by Attorney  General's Office investigators.    On Tuesday Kusno Aksan, a top management officer of three  companies owned by E.T., was questioned by Attorney General's  Office agents as a material witness.</p>

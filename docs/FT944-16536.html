			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / More are going hungry A trade embargo and lack of government organisation are forcing increasing numbers of Iraqis to go hungry, top officials from the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said yesterday, Reuter reports from Rome. 'The monthly salary of an Iraqi civil servant is barely enough to buy 1kg of meat,' said Ms Mona Hammam, regional manager of the WFP in the Middle East. 'People are selling assets and land to make ends meet.' The Rome-based WFP feeds 1.3m Iraqis, making it the country's largest supplier of food, Ms Catherine Bertini, executive director, said. The number of people needing food aid would rise if the Iraqi government failed to improve distribution. 'The Iraqi government gives out food to anyone who asks, instead of targeting the most vulnerable groups.' The WFP was stockpiling food in Iraq ahead of what could be a hard winter. Food prices had increased 600 per cent in southern and central Iraq and 84 per cent in the north. Some 23 per cent of Iraqi children were suffering from malnutrition.</p>

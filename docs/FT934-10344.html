			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Big US airlines pull out of losses spiral - The troubled carriers are showing signs of renewed growth It may be the wrong time of the year for green shoots to appear, but it appears the beleaguered US airline industry is at last showing signs of renewed growth. The grounds for optimism lie in the industry's third-quarter results. This time last year, it was hard to find a large US carrier reporting anything other than the latest in a long series of losses. However, this year's third-quarter results have shown a turnround. Suddenly, the airlines are making profits again. Admittedly, the profits are not huge. United Airlines, the best-performing of the large carriers, produced third-quarter net income of only Dollars 149m on turnover of Dollars 3.6bn. However, the figures are notable in that they follow a three-year period in which US airlines have together produced losses totalling more than Dollars 10bn. The airlines' troubles stem partly from too much capacity chasing too little demand. New aircraft ordered during the boom years of the late 1980s arrived at a time when passenger numbers were falling because of recession. Company failures, which might otherwise have brought supply and demand back into kilter, were prevented by US bankruptcy laws giving companies protection from their creditors. Even more serious, however, has been the success of small, upstart carriers like Southwest Airlines, which have eaten heavily into the big companies' domestic markets by offering no-frills services at rock-bottom prices. The large carriers have been unable match the small companies' low operating costs and therefore to compete profitably at the same fares. The recovery showing through in the latest quarterly results is the result of a sustained effort by the larger airlines to bring capacity into line with demand, bring costs down to competitive levels, and abandon unprofitable operations. For example, United - the biggest US airline in terms of passenger miles flown - has accelerated the grounding of older aircraft, cut wages, and announced 2,800 job losses. American Airlines, the second biggest, has given up competing with Southwest on many short-haul routes and grounded more than 30 aircraft from its fleet. Delta, ranking third, has cut more than 6,000 jobs since June last year. For most airlines, the cost-cutting measures are just the beginning. Virtually all the big carriers plan to increase productivity through further heavy job cuts and changes in working practices. In theory, the combination of lower costs and rising passenger numbers should bring a return to healthy profits. Some airlines, however, are unlikely to have it so easy. Most employees of the big carriers are heavily unionised and are digging their heals in over some of the changes. American's 21,000 flight attendants are threatening an all-out strike later this month over cuts in staffing levels, changes in holiday arrangements, and other productivity-enhancing measures being introduced by the company. United, too, is at loggerheads with employees over radical plans to set up a low-cost airline-within-an-airline to compete head-on with Southwest and its ilk. Although employees are being offered a majority stake in United if they agree to the deal, their union representatives have baulked at some of the more far-reaching changes in working practices. Meanwhile, the competitive pressures are intensifying. Southwest's success is spawning low-cost imitators, such as Kiwi International, Republic Air, UltrAir, MarkAir and RenoAir. And Continental Airlines, now largely non-union after emerging from its second bankruptcy, has just launched its own no-frills operation called Continental Lite. Daily US newspapers are carrying pages of advertisements from small and large airlines, each trying to outdo the other with outlandish fare offers. Republic Air, for example, is advertising a New York-Los Angeles fare of Dollars 99, with no requirement for advance purchase or a Saturday night stay. Continental invites readers to combine an ultra-low 'Peanuts Fare' with another offer called Add-A-Penny-Add-A-Pal, under which the passenger's companion flies for 1 cent each way. So while the third-quarter profits offer a glimmer of hope for the airlines, they fall far short of what is required to restore the industry to health. Demand remains poor, and those that buy airline tickets want the cheapest deal they can get. In this market, it is the lowest-cost operator that makes the money - and the big carriers have yet to show they can bring their costs down to where they can not only compete, but win.  -------------------------------------------------- US AIRLINE RESULTS Third Quarter  --------------------------------------------------                     Net income Dollars m                         1993       1992  -------------------------------------------------- United Airlines1         149          6 American Airlines2       118       -100 Delta Air Lines           60       -125 Northwest Airlines3      112        -20 USAir                   -178       -106 AmericaWest Airlines      14        -71 Southwest Airlines        44         27  -------------------------------------------------- Notes: 1 Figures for UAL Corp. 2 Figures for AMR Corp 3.Figures for Wings Holdings  -------------------------------------------------- Source: Company announcements  --------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMODITIES;  </P> <P> COFFEE FUTURES FALL IN TECHNICAL SELLOFF  </P> <P> Speculators bailed out of the coffee futures market Monday in a frantic,  technically inspired selloff on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange  although fundamental factors continued to point toward higher prices.  </P> <P> On other markets, frozen pork belly futures plunged, soybeans fell sharply,  precious metals were mixed, energy futures rose and stock index futures  advanced.  </P> <P> Most coffee futures contracts settled 6 cents a pound lower, the permitted  daily limit for price movement. The limitless contracts for delivery in March  and May settled 9.43 and 8.75 cents lower, respectively, with March finishing  at $1.4829 a pound.  </P> <P> "What we saw today was a wholesale bailout of speculative longs," or players  who previously had bet that prices would rise, said Kim Badenhop, a coffee  market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.  </P> <P> Analysts said that after reaching a 27-month high of $1.669 a pound last  Tuesday, coffee was brought down by profit taking by Friday's close to levels  that triggered Monday's selloff.  </P> <P> The surge in coffee prices during December was rooted in tight-supply,  strong-demand fundamentals, including a drought in the coffee-growing regions  of Brazil and the arrival of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the annual peak  period for coffee consumption.  </P> <P> Analysts said those factors remained in place.  </P> <P> "The long-term fundamentals suggest we would move to the upside, but it gets  kind of scary when you get selloffs like this," Badenhop said.  </P> <P> Frozen pork bellies for both February and March delivery plunged the  2-cents-a-pound limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in reaction to the  Agriculture Department's Friday report of a 2% increase in the number of pigs  expected to be born from December through February. Hog and cattle futures  finished mixed.  </P> <P> Live cattle settled 0.30 cent lower to 0.20 cent higher, with February at 73.55  cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.10 to 0.62 cent higher, with January at  84.97 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.75 cent lower to 0.35 cent higher, with  February at 46.37 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 2 cents lower to  0.80 cent higher, with February at 42.45 cents a pound.  </P> <P> Soybean futures fell as much as 12 cents a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade  on forecasts for rain in Argentina, the world's fourth-largest soybean  producer, where early growing conditions have been dry.  </P> <P> Wheat and corn futures finished mostly higher, although those markets also were  pressured late in the trading session by the Argentine rain forecasts. Oats  ended sharply lower.  </P> <P> Tables, Page 12  </P></p>

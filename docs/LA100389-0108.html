			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARVESTING VINTAGE VEHICLES;  </P> <P> RESTORATION SHOP CATERS TO ELITE CLASSIC CAR LOVERS  </P> <P> Several years ago Claus Mees of Palo Alto paid $18,000 for a dismantled 1955  Mercedes Gullwing that he found in Oklahoma. The two-seat roadster, whose doors  open up like a gull's wings, have become collectors' items due to their  innovative styling and because only 1,400 were built between 1954 and 1957.  </P> <P> But Mees' car was a bit short of being in pristine condition. So in 1983 he  hired Scott Grundfor, whose Scott Restorations in Panorama City specializes in  overhauling Gullwings and other vintage Mercedes cars.  </P> <P> Mees shipped his car to California in about 50 boxes with many of its parts  missing. Three years later -- Mees said it took that long because he couldn't  afford to have it finished sooner -- the maroon Gullwing was done.  </P> <P> Mees won't say what he paid Grundfor for the repair job -- although these days  Grundfor charges up to $200,000 per car -- except that it was "substantially  less than what it costs today." But Mees has no complaints. He takes his  Gullwing out only for car-display shows, and has never driven it. "It was  perfect, and I wanted to keep it that way," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> National Reputation  </P> <P> Scott Restorations is no slapdash body shop where they pound out dented fenders  and apply a $200 paint job. Cars brought to Grundfor are literally restored  from the frame up, so that they look as good -- or better -- as they did when  they left the factory three or four decades earlier.  </P> <P> Grundfor's work has made him one of the four or five top restorers of vintage  cars -- particularly Mercedes -- in the nation, said John Olson, editor of SL  Market Newsletter, a Minneapolis-based journal for Mercedes SL owners.  </P> <P> "His reputation precedes him even as far as Stuttgart, where the Mercedes  people know him," said David Brice, an Australian hotel developer who has had  three 300SLs restored by Grundfor and has two more currently in his shop.  </P> <P> A 1954 Gullwing, which originally cost $6,280, today fetches more than  $200,000, even if it's in just average condition. But when Grundfor and his  37-member staff get done restoring it, the car could sell for more than  $400,000.  </P> <P> With Grundfor, you pay for what you get. If he completely restores a Mercedes  300SL Gullwing, the job can take up to 18 months and cost more than $150,000.  </P> <P> Despite the cost, his shop -- which consists of three, single-story buildings,  one for painting and parts fabrication, one for engine assembly work and the  third for storage -- currently is crammed with two dozen 300SLs and several  other makes in various states of restoration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Automobile Art  </P> <P> Customers from Japan and Europe ship their valuable autos to him for  restoration. He also brokers sales of hard-to-find cars. Together, the  businesses generate about $2.5 million in annual revenue, he said.  </P> <P> Grundfor knows that obsessions carry a big cost, and he's only too happy to  help wealthy car lovers fulfill their desire to own -- and often resell for a  profit -- fully restored rare automobiles. But even though Grundfor  acknowledged that his business has made him nearly a millionaire, he likens his  work more to art than to commerce.  </P> <P> "The hard part of the business is the business," said Grundfor, a lean San  Fernando Valley native whose beard and shoulder-length, light red hair make him  look younger than his 42 years. "You have cash flow problems that surface, you  have accounting problems.  </P> <P> "I could have a body shop this size and make as much or twice as much money,"  he added. "I love the cars. I like to be an artist."  </P> <P> Grundfor's canvas is not limited to the Mercedes 300SL. On a recent day, his  shop also housed a 1936 Mercedes 540K Cabriolet, a 1937 Rolls Royce Phantom 3  and a 1950 Ferrari 166-MM Barchetta, among others.  </P> <P> But he's best known for the 300SL. Many of the cars' parts can no longer be  bought from the manufacturer -- such as the ashtray -- so it's up to Grundfor  to either find a used one and refurbish it, or build one from scratch. A  Mercedes Gullwing ashtray made by Grundfor costs several hundred dollars; a  restored 300SL radio can cost $1,500.  </P> <P> Also, all replacement fenders for the 300SL must be molded by hand. Grundfor's  team can re-upholster seats (cost: about $2,000), and reset wood paneling in  the car's interior. Painting a restored 300SL can range from $4,500 to $15,000,  depending on the number of layers of paint required and the type of finish the  car's owner wants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bills Monthly  </P> <P> The 300SL originally had 47 exterior colors and 34 interior colors, but  Grundfor generally will paint the car in nearly any color that the client  desires. Most stick with an original hue, however, because they know that  protects the car's resale value, he said.  </P> <P> Grundfor gives his customers a rough estimate of the cost, but requires no down  payment once the work begins. He bills customers much in the way that law firms  do: Twice a month a detailed computerized invoice is sent listing labor ($45 an  hour) and parts "down to the number of screws and washers we use," Grundfor  said.  </P> <P> Although there are other restorers around the country, using Grundfor or  another of the top firms can add 10% or more to the car's selling price  compared with second-tier companies, said Olson. That's important to some of  Grundfor's customers, who use his work to boost the car's resale value.  </P> <P> Regardless of their intentions, Grundfor's clients don't come to him with blank  checks, he said.  </P> <P> "Although the car is the love of their lives . . . it has to make financial  sense for them," he said. "I've not had one client come in and say, 'I don't  care what it costs.' "  </P> <P> Grundfor is respected by his peers as a perfectionist, a trait that he conceded  and one that has enabled his cars to win several car shows in California.  </P> <P> "I'm always worried there will be something that isn't quite perfect on the  car" when it leaves the shop, he said. "But I've never had a client say  something derogatory about our cosmetics."  </P> <P> Indeed, if there are any differences between Scott Restorations and the other  top-tier restorers, Grundfor is known as a favorite among owners who want their  cars to be contenders in car-display shows. Hjeltness Restoration in Escondido,  meanwhile, appeals to car owners preoccupied with having the car as authentic  as the day it left the factory. And a third, Gullwing Service Co. in Essex,  Mass., specializes in restoring cars for people who enjoy driving them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Over-Restoration'  </P> <P> Paul Russell, owner of Gullwing Service, said he often puts a rubberized  coating inside the wheel wells of cars to protect them from nicks and cuts as  they're driven around town. "I don't believe Scott would ever consider putting  a protective finish in the underwell of the car," he said.  </P> <P> Olson, the newsletter editor, said "there are those who feel that Hjeltness  restorations are more authentic, and the reason is because Scott  over-restores," said Olson. Grundfor "would concede he does what the factory  would have done if it had had more time," he said.  </P> <P> But Jerry Hjeltness, owner of Hjeltness, said "everybody in the restoration  business over-restores." For instance, "the paint work is much better than any  car was delivered in because the (paint) technology has been advanced."  </P> <P> Infatuated with cars since he was 10, Grundfor painted and fixed cars to pay  his way through UCLA, where he earned a bachelor's degree in public service and  management in 1969. In his last year there, at age 19, he opened a body shop in  his garage.  </P> <P> He ran the body shop for a decade, but in 1979 decided to restore vintage  autos. After selling his body shop, Grundfor had about $30,000 to start the new  business. Slowly he generated more jobs by promoting himself -- and his  restored cars -- at car shows and meetings of Mercedes car clubs.  </P> <P> As word of his work spread, so has his net worth. Grundfor himself owns a rare  1956 Mercedes SLS prototype race car, a 1959 Jaguar XK150 coupe and a 1959  Mercedes 220S Cabriolet convertible, the latter two having been fully restored.  But he often drives a 1988 Ford pickup truck to work.  </P> <P> Grundfor would eventually like to open a training center, where would-be auto  craftsmen can learn their trade. "I love to watch people work who are doing  something I'm interested in," he said.  </P> <P> He's also thinking of building his own version of the famous Mercedes Gullwing.  The car would have many of its original parts, but Grundfor also would use  today's technology to enhance the engine, chassis and transmission. He is  considering building only one at a cost of $500,000.  </P> <P> "It's like the creative project of a lifetime; it's like going back in time and  being at Stuttgart" where the cars were originally designed, Grundfor said.  </P></p>

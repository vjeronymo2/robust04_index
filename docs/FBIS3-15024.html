			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at  1317 GMT on 1 March carries a four and a half minute report on  talks Russian President Boris Yeltsin held today with Federation  Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko and State Duma Speaker Ivan  Rybkin. The latter held a news conference afterwards.    The conference was brief and consisted largely of a  statement  that the recent State Duma amnesty decision reflected a spirit  of conciliation between the authorities and various political  forces. "If necessary, probably in the near future, the Duma  will also examine a memorandum on the responsibility of state  institutions and politicians for preserving civic calm in  Russia," he said.    Regarding his meeting with Yeltsin, Rybkin said: "I won't  hide the fact we spoke about the amnesty. And I drew the  president's attention to the fact that some people are lifting  the resolutions out of their context within the whole package of  documents and giving a somewhat loose interpretation to parts of  them.    "I drew his attention to the fact that in principle it was a  memorandum of accord that was adopted above all else. And this  was supported by an absolute majority of deputies. The  memorandum of accord says that in the coming two or three months  we should hold round-table talks to resolve many issues that are  of vital importance to Russia: political, economic, nationalism,  and social issues. And we should find a solution to many  problems, especially as during the past weeks the approaches to  this have been clearly defined by common effort.    "In the final analysis, all these agreements should lead to  an accord of civic peace, national conciliation, and close  cooperation between the authorities.    "The first young shoots of this cooperation and conciliation  are there, but they need to be lovingly nurtured and  strengthened. That's the first thing. Furthermore, we counted  on the amnesty resolutions being implemented in full compliance  with the procedure for conciliation, which was set out in detail  in the package of resolutions.    "And if anyone thinks that the authorities acted  inconsistently, perhaps a little hastily, then I say this:  Close cooperation does not simply happen. It comes about from  hard work day-in and day-out.    "These detailed stories about not being in time, hurrying  with a letter, not getting an answer are, I think -- how shall I  say this -- are just drawing the public's attention to goings-on  in entourages.    "The processes of finding accord in Russia are indeed  complex  and difficult for us."    Rybkin also said at the news conference that he thought the  conduct of the procuracy and Procurator General Kazannik's  resignation somewhat hasty.</p>

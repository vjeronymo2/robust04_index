Following the preliminary investigations, the Attorney  General's Office said the eight people under arrest are  allegedly responsible for the crimes of murder and association  with criminal intent and are charged with the possession of  firearms that are meant only for the exclusive use of the  Mexican Army, Navy, and Air Force.    The eight individuals were turned over to the First Criminal  Court judge in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas State. They are: Juan  Jimenez Santis, Juan Carlos Ruiz Garcia, Juan Guzman Velasco,  Miguel Giron Lopez, Javier Jimenez Fernandez, Miguel Giron  Guzman, Palemon Cabrera Arizon, and Alonso Moreno Hernandez. We  must point out that the Mexican Attorney General's Office said  Alonso Moreno Hernandez will probably be charged with other  crimes.    The ninth person is a minor, Jose Lopez Hernandez, who also  participated in the attacks on the Army members. According to  the Attorney General's Office, the necessary steps are being  taken to turn him over to the juvenile court in Tuxtla  Gutierrez, Chiapas.    As for the events that took place on 2 January 1994, the  Attorney General's Office said the nine members of the  subversive group attacked a Mexican Army patrol near the village  of Rancho Nuevo at approximately 0700 and immediately ambushed  the Army members, killing 1st Cavalry Captain Vladimir Lara  Salgado, Lieutenant Fernando Monroy Tinajero, 2d Infantry  Sergeant Gilberto de Jesus Damaso, and Infantry Corporals  Encarnacion Mejia Hernandez and Jordan Gonzalez Gonzalez. Those  injured were 1st Infantry Capt. Jose Luis Garcia Magana, 1st  Infantry Capt. Carlos Echeverria Mendez, Corporal Abimael de  Jesus Morales, and Private Rodolfo Lopez Arriola.    The Mexican Attorney General's Office indicated that other  Army members arrested the nine subversives when they repelled  the attack. During the operation the Army confiscated three  410-gauge shotguns, a 12-gauge shotgun, a rifle, a sawed-off  shotgun, two AR-15 rifles, a grenade, and approximately 100  cartridges of various calibers.    The Attorney General's Office concludes its report by saying  that during the investigations carried out by the Federal  Judicial Police, the necessary evidence was collected to show  that these nine people did in fact participate in the ambush  against members of the Mexican Army.

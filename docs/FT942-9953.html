			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Rao tries to build bridge to Washington: But India and US still find it hard to make progress on links India's prime minister PV Narasima Rao is due to start a six-day visit to the US tomorrow which will include a meeting with President Bill Clinton and an address to a joint session of Congress. Both countries want to improve relations, blighted for decades by the Cold War, but are still finding it difficult to make progress despite growing economic ties. It is a measure of the political distance between Delhi and Washington that this is the first trip to the US by an Indian prime minister since Rajiv Gandhi went in 1987. The last US president to visit India was Jimmy Carter in the 1970s. The collapse of the Soviet Union, once India's greatest ally, has forced Delhi into a radical reassessment of its place in the world. So has the decline of socialism, which has led India to abandon economic autarky and open its economy to global trade and investment. India in the 1990s wants good relations with the west, especially the US, as never before. The US is India's biggest export market and largest source of foreign investment, accounting for 42 per cent of the 1993 inflow of Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.1bn). But Indians do not embrace the US with open arms. Uncle Sam is still regularly burnt in effigy by protesters ranging from farmers to Hindu nationalists. Many Indians suspect the US means to get the better of India, whether in business or politics. Indians are particularly concerned about Washington's relations with their sworn enemy Pakistan. They argue the US is biased towards Islamabad and against Delhi, citing the military aid given to Pakistan throughout the 1980s and, in the past year, Washington's controversial plan to deliver F-16 jets to Islamabad in return for a pledge from Pakistan to cap its nuclear weapons programme. There is also a widely-held belief that perhaps the US does not treat India seriously enough. A 5,000-year-old history, leadership in the anti-colonial struggle and primacy among developing countries has convinced many Indians they deserve more attention in the US than they receive. Some Indians find it hard to accept that a country accounting for less than 2 per cent of world trade may not merit much international attention in the hard-nosed 1990s. President Clinton has inadvertently rubbed salt into this wound by failing to appoint an ambassador to Delhi in his 16 months in office. His first nominee, former Congressman Stephen Solarz, failed to pass the confirmation tests; his second, Mr Frank Wisner, a career diplomat, was nominated only yesterday. The snub was compounded by a gaffe earlier this year when Ms Robin Raphel, an under-secretary of state, commented about the troubled north Indian region of Kashmir in a way suggesting to many Indians she was questioning India's territorial integrity. She later visited Delhi to clear up the 'misunderstanding'. In the past month, nuclear non-proliferation has replaced Kashmir at the top of the agenda. As well as pressing Pakistan, Washington is asking India to cap its nuclear programme. US officials have revived proposals for a regional non-proliferation conference. But India does not see non-proliferation as a regional issue; if talks are to be held, they must at least include China if not all nuclear countries, including the US, it says. Mr Rao's trip to Washington will not resolve differences over non-proliferation or other controversial issues. But Indian and American officials hope it will contribute to better ties by focusing on areas where there are fewer arguments such as the need for more bilateral trade and investment. Mr Rao is being accompanied by Mr Manmohan Singh, the reform-minded finance minister, and a business delegation. Among the Americans they will meet will be many of Indian origin. As one of the businessmen going on the trip says: 'It's not as if we have nothing in common with the US. We even have thousands of people who belong to both countries. But when we talk politics we stupidly ignore these things.'</p>

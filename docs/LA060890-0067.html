			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN MARCOS  </P> <P> A 21-year-old San Marcos man who pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a  14-year-old girl at a party last Labor Day weekend was sentenced Thursday to  six years in state prison.  </P> <P> As part of a plea bargain, Pascual Rojero will spend some of the time in the  custody of the California Youth Authority, Superior Court Judge Ronald Prager  ruled.  </P> <P> Rojero, who pleaded guilty to one count of rape with a foreign object, was the  only adult present at the unchaperoned party when the sexual assault by several  party-goers occurred, court records said. The 14-year-old was attacked after  she had been drinking and lost consciousness.  </P> <P> Three boys, ages 14, 15 and 16, were previously convicted in Juvenile Court of  sexually assaulting and causing great bodily injury to the girl. They were  sentenced to eight months in custody.  </P> <P> Rojero's court-appointed attorney, Tom Mix, argued that, although Rojero  instigated the assault and took off the girl's underpants, he did not  physically harm her. Mix asked that Rojero be sentenced to three years in  prison instead of six.  </P> <P> In addition to the prison term, Rojero was ordered to pay $1,000 restitution to  the victim's family.  </P> <P> The girl did not regain consciousness until the morning after the assault --  after she had been hospitalized for her injuries -- and did not learn the  extent of attack until the matter went to court.  </P></p>

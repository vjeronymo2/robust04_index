			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Bonn urged to support free EC labour market: Clarke rules out retreat into a 'fortress Europe' MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor of the exchequer, last night sought to win Germany as an ally for the UK government's policy of freer trade and deregulation of European labour markets to reduce unemployment. The European Community, he told an audience in Munich, could 'either compete or retreat'. Ruling out retreat into a 'fortress Europe', Mr Clarke stressed the need for the EC to become more competitive rather than try to preserve its high labour costs behind a protectionist wall. 'Every regulation that adds costs, loses jobs,' he told the Deutsch-Englische Gesellschaft (Anglo-German Society). Underlining the government's opposition to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, he said the UK would 'continue to fight hard against the legal imposition on all enterprises, big and small, of shorter working weeks, statutory paternity leave, higher social security benefits, regulated pay bargaining systems, the forced introduction of new technology and so on'. Speaking just three days before the crucial House of Commons vote on the treaty's social chapter, Mr Clarke said the chapter 'would impose unnecessary extra costs on business and act as a barrier to employment'. He defended the UK's social provision 'as one of the best all-round systems of welfare in Europe', saying that Britain 'had no intention of going back to an era of sweatshops and poverty labour'. Mr Clarke's visit to Germany, less than two months after he became chancellor, is a clear demonstration that he sets greater store by close ties with Britain's EC partners than did his Euro-sceptic predecessor, Mr Norman Lamont. But his trip, which included meetings with Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president-designate, and business leaders, had a strategic purpose. Building on UK initiatives at last month's EC summit in Copenhagen and the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo two weeks ago, Mr Clarke was seeking German backing for a campaign to move EC policy in the direction of labour market reform and deregulation, and freer trade. 'Labour markets are the crux of Europe's economic woes. Over-rigid, over-regulated and overpriced,' Mr Clarke said. 'The first step must be for EC governments to look at the whole range of extra costs we force on businesses by excessive regulation,' he declared. European unemployment had grown 'inexorably', he said. The 17m unemployed in the Community were 'the best measure of two decades of European economic decline'. Mr Clarke said it was a measure of Europe's loss of self-confidence that emerging economies such as in China and Latin America were regarded as a threat. The way forward for Europe, he said, was 'to compete, to look outwards, open our markets further, train our labour force better and believe that we can take the share of opportunities which the widening of economic prosperity presents'.

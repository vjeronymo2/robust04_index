			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Wall St likely to take a more positive line  -New York Wall Street usually makes known its assessment of the government's monthly employment report within hours of its release. This time, market observers must wait four days to get a true reading on investor sentiment. Analysts say Friday's limp reaction to news that non-farm payrolls had risen by only 179,000 last month was mostly a reflection of the thin trading conditions prevailing that day, with the approach of the long Labor Day weekend. The data, which revealed much weaker jobs growth than expected, should bring a more positive tone to the market when investors return to work tomorrow. Surely, the dispirited bond market played some role in Friday's lacklustre response in equities. Fixed-income fund managers, ever wary of inflation, focused on details of the jobs report that suggested growing constraints in manufacturing capacity, which could translate into higher prices. Economists expect evidence of such upward pressure in August producer price data due at the end of this week. Excluding the volatile food and energy sector, a rise of 0.3 per cent is forecast, after a 0.1 per cent increase in July. Still, cautious optimism prevails in stocks. Mr John Moore, director of asset management at Value Line, the New York research firm, predicts the broad market will climb slowly and steadily. As he points out, there is a growing belief on Wall Street that earnings, not interest rates, are gradually taking over as the controlling force in the stock market. Consequently, he says, 'equity investors can afford to be forgiving right now, as long as they can assume rates are going to level off'. The jobs data did nothing to undermine such an assumption, according to most economists. 'This at least buys (the Federal Reserve) some time,' says Mr Ray Stone, managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research in Princeton, New Jersey. At the earliest, he says, the Fed will wait until November before lifting rates again. In the meantime, the autumn may bring new vigour to growth stocks - especially larger capitalisation Nasdaq issues such as Microsoft and Cabletron - which have mostly languished over the past two years. That may seem surprising in view of the broad pullback in computer stocks last week. The selling came on the heels of a profits warning issued by AST Research. An extra push down came from bellwether Compaq, which was thought to be trimming its supply orders. However, Mr Moore attributes last week's setback to profit-taking and a fleeting bout of the jitters. Technology concerns have turned in impressive performances for the most part, he points out. 'These stocks tend to have two, three or four good quarters, then they stumble. That makes everyone nervous for a day or two.'</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NEPALESE ANTHROPOLOGIST DISILLUSIONED;  </P> <P> WEST SEEN AS HAVING LITTLE TO OFFER  </P> <P> Nepalese anthropologist Rajendra Pradhan believes the developing world has  little reason to copy Western culture, which he studied extensively during two  years of living in the Netherlands.  </P> <P> Born in the Himalayas and a resident of India, Pradhan says he is one of the  first anthropologists from a developing country to study the West in the same  way that Western anthropologists have studied Third World society for decades  -- by living with the natives.  </P> <P> He came here as part of a Dutch government-sponsored project to allow India to  study how the Dutch welfare state takes care of its elderly and see what India  can learn from it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Visit Not Very Relevant  </P> <P> "I doubt whether my stay here was as relevant for Indian policy-making as Dutch  officials hoped it would be," he said, noting that India could probably never  afford the Dutch welfare state and should be wary about imitating it.  </P> <P> "India and Nepal have long been brainwashed by the idea that modernization  equals Westernization. . . . But we are realizing more and more that that idea  is perhaps wrong," he said.  </P> <P> He said that in 20 years India would have problems caring for the elderly as  more people move to cities, where cramped quarters and changing social habits  erode traditions of the extended family.  </P> <P> "At the moment (in India), parents who live separately from their children are  still exceptions. But there will be more," Pradhan said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Elderly Kept at Bay  </P> <P> But the privacy-minded Dutch welfare state, in which the elderly receive  generous state welfare but are often kept at bay by their children, does not  seem to provide the answer to that problem, he said.  </P> <P> "In India, you always talk to other people, even in the street. Here,  everything happens indoors. Old people are often very lonely because of that."  </P> <P> Pradhan came to Amsterdam in early 1987 to learn Dutch. He moved to  Schoonrewoerd, a village of 1,500 less than an hour south of the capital, where  he lived for about a year.  </P> <P> "There are so many contradictions here. People claim they're all equal, but  they aren't," Pradhan, 34, said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Free but Selfish  </P> <P> "People are more independent, but only at the expense of relying more on the  state. People have more freedom but tend to be more selfish," he said.  </P> <P> He went to church services to get to know the villagers, who are split into two  separate Protestant sects.  </P> <P> "In India, people live face to face. They communicate with each other, and they  fight each other. Here, people live back to back. There is peace but no  contact," he said.  </P> <P> On Sunday mornings, he prayed with the Protestants, conservatives who split  from the mainstream Netherlands Reformed Church last century. In the afternoon,  he went to a service with the Reformed Unionists, an even more stern group.  </P> <P> "Western anthropologists often offend people by being rude, like making notes  during religious services. . . . I always prayed during service here," he said.  </P> <P> "Some villagers first thought I was the new vicar. Others thought I came from  Africa," he said. "When I said I was an anthropologist, it didn't mean much to  them, but when I said I was a student or a trainee, they could place me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Each to His Own Circle  </P> <P> "Everyone had his own circle, even young people. . . . When you asked them if  they knew someone from the other church, they said they didn't.  </P> <P> "If you don't belong to one of the churches, it is difficult to belong at all.  . . . They read different newspapers and they have separate schools. Every  church has its own Bible club, women's coffee club and youth clubs," he said.  </P> <P> "In the past, some villages like this one even had separate bakery shops,  butchers and grocery stores," Pradhan said.  </P> <P> Although aware that he was studying an unusually conservative village, he still  played down differences between towns and villages. "Towns seem open and  spontaneous, but that is often only an appearance," Pradhan said.  </P> <P> "At large, religious parties in Nepal, everybody participates and each has his  own task. . . . At parties in Amsterdam, they only invite people who think  alike."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recalls Apartheid  </P> <P> It reminded him of apartheid, South Africa's system of racial segregation set  up by Dutch-descended Afrikaners.  </P> <P> "Apartheid is a Dutch word . . . what is different has to be separate. You can  see it in the neat arrangements of the houses here. Photographs of the children  are displayed separately from those of the elderly. Everything has to have its  place."  </P> <P> People were friendly but formal, he said, noting their habit of leaving the  curtains of the living room open in the evening created a deceptive image of  openness.  </P> <P> "I always felt that, whenever I was on a visit, there were unspoken limits as  to how long I could stay and the sort of things I could ask. . . . People never  talked about sex or money but a lot about the weather," Pradhan said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Personal Bonds 'Fragile'  </P> <P> "Here, you can always choose not to have relationships. Personal bonds are more  fragile. . . . Perhaps there is too much privacy," he said, adding that he left  with a feeling that he had not learned all he wanted about Dutch society.  </P></p>

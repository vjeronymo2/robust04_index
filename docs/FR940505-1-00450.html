			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (1) Biennial inspection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Vehicles subject to the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California I/M program which are registered in the FIP  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->  I/M areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be subject to the FIP I/M program and will be tested on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same biennial schedule as is currently used, with the exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that such vehicles shall go to official FIP I/M program test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider(s) for valid testing. New vehicles which are registered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the FIP I/M areas shall be tested in the next even numbered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar year after the initial titling if the model year is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even, or in the next odd numbered calendar year after the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> titling if the model year is odd, and shall be subject to regular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP I/M testing every two years thereafter. Once a vehicle has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been tested as part of the FIP I/M program, it will remain on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same biennial testing schedule until such time as the FIP I/M  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is discontinued. The sale of a vehicle shall not change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that vehicle's regularly scheduled testing date. Vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously registered in California but outside the FIP I/M areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which move into a FIP I/M area shall be tested in time to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the I/M requirement for their first registration as residents of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a FIP I/M area, and shall be tested every two years thereafter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Out-of-cycle inspection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Vehicles otherwise subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FIP I/M program's requirements which are targeted as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential high emitters as a result of RSD detection must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented for an enhanced I/M inspection within 30 days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification of the failure (or sooner, if the regularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled inspection deadline occurs first). If the vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fails this confirmatory test, it shall be subject at that time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same repair, retest, and waiver requirements as apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles which fail the regularly scheduled biennial inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to comply with this out-of-cycle testing requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall result in the assessment of a late fee to be collected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to testing whenever the vehicle is next presented for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regular testing. A late fee of $10 will be assessed for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full week past the testing deadline. Being subject to an out-of-cycle inspection does not change the deadline for the vehicle's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regularly scheduled biennial inspection, unless it occurs within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 days of the out-of-cycle test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notification of requirement for emission inspection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letter of notification shall be sent to subject vehicle owners or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lessees such that the letter shall have been received by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual owner or lessee no later than 45 days prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regularly scheduled test deadline and no later than 30 days prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an out-of-cycle confirmatory test deadline. In the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the out-of-cycle inspection requirement, the notification shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be sent by registered mail to ensure documentation of the owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or lessee's receipt of notification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emission inspection period. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The period during which a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject vehicle may be presented for an I/M inspection shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated on the emission inspection notification form along with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deadline for completing the inspection process. Subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles presented for an initial inspection or reinspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the time period shown on the emission inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification shall be charged a late fee of $10 for each full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> week that a vehicle is late. This late fee shall be collected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the initiation of testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

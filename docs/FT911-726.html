			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Maxwell's Pounds 142.5m offer for sale closes oversubscribed THE Pounds 142.5m offer for sale of Mr Robert Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspapers was oversubscribed when it closed yesterday morning. Members of the public accounted for at least 100,000 of the applications for shares in the company, which owns the Daily and Sunday Mirror and other newspaper titles. Advisers to the offer yesterday estimated that the overall UK subscription was not likely to have been higher than 1.5 times the 114m shares on offer. But receiving bankers had not yet arrived at an exact level. It was thought that the public had asked to buy up to two thirds of the shares available, with institutions accounting for the balance of the applications. Through the UK offer and a separate overseas placing, Mr Maxwell is selling 49 per cent of the company to raise Pounds 245.5m. There was speculation yesterday that part of the demand for the UK offer may have come from overseas institutions which had been unable to obtain as many shares as they wanted via the international placings. This followed reports by Salomon Brothers, lead manager for the sale outside the UK, of strong demand especially from the US. Basis of allocation would be announced once counting of applications had been completed, said Samuel Montagu, financial adviser to the flotation.</p>

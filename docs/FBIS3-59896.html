			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Sychev: "Moscow and Washington Will </F> Keep World Ocean in Their Sights"]    [Text] Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander of the  Russian Strategic Missile Forces, has had talks with top  Pentagon officials and the command of the U.S. strategic forces  regarding the retargeting of strategic nuclear missiles.    At his latest press conference President Bill Clinton did  not  specify whether the consultations had gotten far. Russian state  institutions are also refraining from comment.    The Russian and U.S. presidents are examining at least two  ways of implementing the initiative suggested in April by Boris  Yeltsin to President Clinton in Vancouver. According to one  option it is planned to retarget ballistic missiles, designed by  Russia and the United States for mutual destruction, on  godforsaken corners of the world ocean. According to  unconfirmed reports 24 desert regions have already been  identified as suitable for the role of false targets. Another  option envisages not targeting the missiles anywhere.    "The idea of retargeting has long been discussed in academic  circles," a staffer at a Russian department said. "It is useful  and it is good that we are moving from theory to practice.  Russia and the United States are no longer adversaries yet to  this day they have been keeping each other in their sights."    What will the implementation of the Russian idea provide? If  there is an unsanctioned launch there will not be mass human  casualties or a retaliatory nuclear missile strike. Because of  its military-technical flaws the agreement could become a  touchstone of the sincerity of the friendship between Moscow and  Washington and a confidence-building measure. After all, apart  from secret agents there are no other means which would allow us  to assure ourselves of the honesty of our partner and his  fulfillment of his commitments.    In addition it takes only about 15 minutes to retarget  individually targeted missiles and warheads. You only have to  put the necessary programs into the computers.    Nonetheless it is better to have "disoriented" missiles than  missiles which "know" precisely the point which has been  targeted in the United States or Russia. In given circumstances  the time necessary for reprogramming could save mankind.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON;  </P> <P> UNREGISTERED VOTER RESIGNS COUNCIL POST  </P> <P> Charles Babler, whose recent appointment to the City Council was jeopardized  when it was discovered he is not a registered voter, resigned Thursday night.  </P> <P> Just before the City Council was to "reconfirm" Babler's appointment as its  newest member, a handwritten note from Babler was read, in which he said: "I do  hereby resign my council position effective immediately.  </P> <P> I find this necessary do to health reasons."  </P> <P> Although Babler had been confirmed last month, it was later discovered that he  was not registered to vote. Babler then registered to vote.  </P> <P> Government guidelines are unclear whether a person may become a council member  without being a registered voter. City Atty. Thomas W. Allen said the  reconfirmation would eliminate any question of the appointment's validity.  </P> <P> Because Babler's resignation was a surprise, the council must wait until the  next meeting, on Aug. 14, to decide whether to fill the position again by  appointment or leave it vacant until the November election.  </P> <P> Babler, 54, was unanimously approved as the fifth council member on June 26,  replacing Paul G. Verellen, who resigned earlier in the month. City officials  said then that filling the position would help prevent deadlocks. JON NALICK  </P></p>

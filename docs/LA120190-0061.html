			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY OFFERS FREE MEASLES VACCINATION FOR PRESCHOOLERS  </P> <P> Preschoolers can receive their first or second doses of measles vaccine free  over the next three weeks as the San Diego County Health Services Department  tries to prevent an epidemic from extending into another year.  </P> <P> The immunizations will be conducted at school sites all over the county, from  Carlsbad and Fallbrook to Spring Valley and Imperial Beach.  </P> <P> Nearly 960 measles cases, including three deaths, have been reported in San  Diego County this year. From 1983 to 1988, the number of cases was as low as  three and as high as 47. A steep rise began last year.  </P> <P> Officials are particularly eager to reach infants and toddlers in the Latino  community, because the epidemic has disproportionately affected them and their  brothers and sisters.  </P> <P> In the Sun Belt, an influx of poor, unvaccinated immigrants is generally blamed  for the increase in measles cases, but federal and state cutbacks in  free-immunization programs have also contributed to the epidemic.  </P> <P> For the first time, San Diego County clinics will provide second doses of the  vaccine to 5-year-olds. The added dose is now recommended for all children  before they enter kindergarten, because, in a few cases, the vaccine fails to  work the first time around.  </P> <P> Parents who cannot take their children to a special clinic can call the  county's measles information phone lines for other regular clinic times. The  numbers are 236-2512 in San Diego and 940-1164 in North County.  </P> <P> Immunization clinics will be held in:  </P> <P> Carlsbad -- Wednesday, Dec. 5, 8-10 a.m. at the Jefferson Elementary School  health office, 3743 Jefferson St.  </P> <P> Chula Vista -- Friday, Dec. 14, 10:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. at the Harborside  Elementary School health office, 681 Naples St.  </P> <P> Escondido -- Tuesday, Dec. 18, 10:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m., at Lincoln Elementary  School, Room 32, 1029 N.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Clinton to face fresh scrutiny on Whitewater In a fresh blow to President Bill Clinton it now appears certain that the US House and Senate will conduct fully-fledged hearings into the Whitewater affair, possibly as early as next month. Last night, following an agreement between Mr Tom Foley, the speaker, and Mr Bob Michel, the Republican leader, the House voted by 408 to 15 calling on the two party heads to work out 'an appropriate timetable' for hearings without interfering in the work of the independent counsel. As with the Senate, no grants of immunity from prosecution will be given to those summoned to testify. The bipartisan agreement marks the end of Democratic resistance to the idea of wide-ranging hearings into the tangled tale of the Clintons' financial and land dealings in Arkansas in the 1970s and 1980s. It ensures the spotlight will remain focused on Whitewater to the regret of a president trying to get his domestic agenda back on track. Yesterday's announcement followed the postponement of a House banking committee session which could have provided the first congressional forum for Whitewater. The committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Henry Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat, was due to review the semi-annual report of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency created to clear up the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. A bankrupt Arkansas S&amp;L, Madison Guaranty, has been implicated in the Whitewater affair. Both Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary and Mr Roger Altman, his deputy and acting head of the RTC, were scheduled to testify. In postponing the committee hearings, Mr Gonzalez first accused Congressman Jim Leach, the ranking Republican, of seeking to transform them into a 'judicial adventure' against the president. But later, in a letter to Mr Foley, he said he favoured House hearings 'in a forum of broad reach - possibly a select committee - that can explore all the charges ..' Mr Gonzalez insisted the end result would show these charges were without foundation, but it was enough for Mr Foley to institute meetings with the Republican hierarchy yesterday to determine what would be done and when. In Little Rock Mr David Hale, a former Arkansas judge, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and fraud in an unrelated case as part of a bargain with Mr Robert Fiske, the independent Whitewater counsel. Mr Hale alleges Mr Clinton pressed him to make a small business loan to one of the Whitewater partners. Mr Clinton said this was 'a load of bull'.</p>

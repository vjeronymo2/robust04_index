The federal minister informed the prime  minister that the manner in which the 300-megawatt nuclear power  plant's monitoring system is being constructed is certainly  unsafe, and it may cause a Chernobyl-type situation. The  minister told the prime minister that some changes were made in  this nuclear power project during the rule of former Prime  Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, and that the project is now  being built on the basis of [words indistinct] instead of  ``manufacturing.'' No Pakistani engineers have been involved in  the construction of the project, and none of the 2,800 unskilled  workers working on the project is Pakistani.    The federal minister also informed the prime minister that  Japan and the European countries have declined to provide a  reliable monitoring system for this 300-megawatt nuclear power  plant. Under these circumstances, the monitoring system will  have to be built locally. In this manner, the Chashma plant  will be used as a laboratory to develop this monitoring system  for the first time. This will be very dangerous and may create a  situation similar to the one witnessed at the Chernobyl nuclear  plant.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / US food retailer hit by provision for Isosceles GREAT Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, one of the biggest US supermarket operators, saw quarterly profits slide for a second consecutive quarter. Net income for the second quarter ended September 12 was Dollars 7.64m, or 20 cents a share, compared with Dollars 14.5m, or 38 cents a share a year earlier. Sales declined less dramatically, to Dollars 2.43bn in the latest quarter from Dollars 2.65bn a year ago. For the first six months, A&amp;P's underlying net income fell to Dollars 30.4m, or 80 cents a share from Dollars 50.7m, or Dollars 1.33, the previous year. The company, which is 53 per cent owned by Germany's Tengelmann group, took an Dollars 89.2m provision in the first half of this year to cover potential losses on its equity stake in Isosceles, which owns the UK Gateway grocery chain. The write-off, and one-time accounting items, contributed to a net loss in the first half of Dollars 149.8m, or Dollars 3.92 a share. There were no significant extraordinary items in the same period of 1991. A&amp;P's results are still reflecting general food price deflation and strong competition in the supermarket industry. The company said unemployment and lack of consumer confidence had also hurt sales. In addition, the company's exposure to weak markets in Ontario, Canada and the New York city area has hit profitability.</p>

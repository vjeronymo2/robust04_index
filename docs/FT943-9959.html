			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Canadians in Pounds 43m tissue project Kruger Inc, the family-owned Canadian forest products business, is to build a tissue paper facility in Cheshire and will buy a Welsh tissue converting company with the help of 3i, the UK's largest development capital group. The Pounds 43m project to form Kruger Tissue Group UK involves Kruger and 3i investing Pounds 22.3m in the share capital of the company, which will also raise Pounds 20m of debt from Midland Bank. The Welsh company being bought for an undisclosed sum is Caernarvon-based Industrial Cleaning Paper, a tissue paper converter with a well established market. The new mill at Disley, in Cheshire, will produce recycled tissue for private label and industrial markets. Imported tissue prices have surged recently. Mr Jim Kavanagh, the managing director of ICP, will become a director of Kruger Tissue Group UK. In 1989, Kruger bought the Disley paper mill from J Bibby and Sons for Pounds 2.7m.</p>

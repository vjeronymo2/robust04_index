			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dieter Huenerkoch report: "Secret Plan for Eurofighter </F> 2000"]    [Text] The controversy over the high cost involved in the  production of Eurofighter 2000 could soon take a surprising  turn. When Bonn decides next spring whether the European  fighter aircraft will be procured at all for the Bundeswehr, the  price for the military aircraft may have dropped drastically.  Experts currently estimate it at 125 million German marks [DM]  per aircraft (production costs and costs of logistics for  Bundeswehr).    It is true that the Daimler subsidiary, Deutsche Aerospace  (DASA), and the other European producers intend to stick to  their price of DM57 million ex factory for the fighter. They  believe, however, they can save two-digit million amounts per  aircraft in connection with the so-called system costs of the  Bundeswehr, including replacement parts, maintenance, and  repair. Industry is currently negotiating with the military on  the privatization of replacement parts, maintenance, and repair.  The Eurofighter 2000 producers are confident they will be able  to fulfill such tasks at costs that would be 25-30 percent lower  than if carried out by the Bundeswehr.    If agreement is reached, Dasa will transform its plant in  Manching near Munich into a logistics center for the Luftwaffe.    The most difficult problem of such an option is that the  military does not want to depend on the private sector and its  employees in a crisis or even war. Thus a contractual agreement  is envisaged so that in such cases the logistics center in  Manching and the employees concerned would be placed under the  command of the Bundeswehr.    The parties involved believe that such an agreement would  have advantages for both sides. Industry would secure for  itself permanent, additional employment, and the Bundeswehr  would save personnel cost and above all fixed costs. As a  result, means for investment and procurement could be set free  -- despite the decreasing military budget. So industry would be  the winner in a dual sense. An arms manager: "The invested  part of the Bundeswehr's expenditures has meanwhile dropped to  less than 20 percent. It must be the goal to increase this rate  to 30 percent again."</p>

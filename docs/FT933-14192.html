			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Storehouse chief lashes out - Shareholders quiz chairman over departure of chief executive MR IAN Hay Davison, chairman of Storehouse, the retail group comprising BHS and Mothercare, strongly criticised the decision by Mr David Dworkin, former chief executive, to resign only six months after taking up the position. Mr Hay Davison's attack on his former colleague, made in response to repeated questions from shareholders at the company's annual meeting about Mr Dworkin's resignation and pay, was unusually outspoken for a company chairman. He said his reaction to Mr Dworkin's departure from the group only weeks after receiving a performance-related bonus of Pounds 2.71m was one of 'fury'. He added that he felt Mr Dworkin had let the company down. 'Maybe because he's an American and comes from a different cultural context he did not understand that in this country you just don't leave a position of chief executive of a company so soon after taking it up,' he said. Mr Dworkin was promoted from chief executive of BHS to chief executive of the Storehouse group in July 1992, but resigned in February to head US stores group Carter Hawley Hale. His basic pay rose last year from Pounds 344,000 to Pounds 575,000 but a long-term performance bonus of Pounds 2.71m  -negotiated when he first arrived at BHS in 1991 - took his total remuneration for the year to Pounds 3.29m. Mr Hay Davison is thought to be more angry about Mr Dworkin's decision to leave after only six months in the chief executive's job than about the bonus payment. He reminded shareholders yesterday that Mr Dworkin had achieved dramatic results at Storehouse and that the group's market capitalisation had increased by Pounds 400m since the beginning of 1992. No money was paid to Mr Dworkin in compensation for loss of office. But Mr Hay Davison told shareholders that, as a result of its recent experience, Storehouse had reduced the length of executives' employment contracts to a maximum of two years. Mr Hay Davison told the meeting that Storehouse's sales were currently 5 per cent ahead of last year. The company avoided giving a figure when it reported its full-year results in May, saying only that sales were in line with targets. However, he warned that Storehouse, like other retailers, had experienced a general slow-down in trading since earlier in the year, and that its year-on-year growth in sales came from its success in increasing market share. It saw 'little if any increase in overall demand'.</p>

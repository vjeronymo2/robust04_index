			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: DRY SKIN REMEDY IS AS CLOSE AS NEIGHBORHOOD FARM  </P> <P> Question: Recently, I read in your column about a product called Bag Balm that  helps dry skin. I've never seen it in my drugstore. The pharmacist looked at me  as if I were a nut case when I asked about Bag Balm.  </P> <P> Where can I get it? I tried all the advertised products for this skin  condition, with no results.  </P> <P> Answer: You and dozens of other readers have written to us to help you find Bag  Balm. What you need is an old-time pharmacy or a farm supply store.  </P> <P> Bag Balm is a veterinary product, designed to keep cows' udders from chapping  and drying out. Old dairy farmers learned that it worked as well for their  hands as for their cows' udders.  </P> <P> It contains petroleum jelly, lanolin and a disinfectant. You could probably  substitute a product with similar ingredients, such as A&amp;D Ointment,  Cutemol or Lanoline.  </P> <P> If you want to try the original Bag Balm (which hasn't changed its ingredients  or green tin can in decades), you can contact the manufacturer, Dairy Assn. Co.  of Lyndonville, Vt., 05851.  </P> <P> Q. I'm recuperating from a reaction to Feldene. My doctor prescribed it a month  ago for sore shoulders and mentioned it might cause indigestion.  </P> <P> I liked the way it eased the pain in my shoulders, but after 30 days my stomach  suddenly started bleeding. I lost three units of blood. My blood pressure  dropped so low I couldn't stand up.  </P> <P> Clearly in my case the cure was worse than the ailment. How often does this  happen to Feldene users?  </P> <P> A. You are not the first, and assuredly won't be the last to develop a bleeding  ulcer while taking Feldene (piroxicam). Almost any of the anti-inflammatory  agents such as Motrin (ibuprofen), Naprosyn (naproxen), Indocin (indomethacin)  or Voltaren (diclofenac) can cause stomach irritation, ulcers or bleeding. As  you found out, the bleeding may occur without warning.  </P> <P> Studies show that about one patient in 100 will develop an ulcer or serious  intestinal bleeding when taking one of these arthritis drugs for three to six  months.  </P> <P> In patients treated for a year, 2% to 4% experience such problems, which appear  to be more serious, if not more common, among older people.  </P></p>

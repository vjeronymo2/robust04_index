			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Aegis The history of Aegis is that sadly familiar tale of a one-time media glamour stock which made some people associated with it seriously wealthy without doing much to enrich outside shareholders. Following its proposed refinancing, existing shareholders will see their current 57 per cent interest in the company diluted to 13 per cent. Preference shareholders, too, are similarly disadvantaged. The directors chiefly responsible for creating the tottering edifice by use of highly-rated paper and deferred considerations have, of course, already departed with substantial pay-offs. There is no question that Aegis was badly hit by French legislative changes which have shredded the margins of Carat. This made it impossible for Aegis to generate sufficient earnings to sustain its precarious capital structure. With Pounds 180m of convertible shares and bank debt to service annually, and some Pounds 55m of deferred payments to complete over the next few years, the company desperately needed some form of refinancing. But Aegis's attempts to make a virtue out of the fact that its shareholders will receive better terms than those offered by WPP and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi at the time of their restructurings is hardly comforting. It is rather like arguing it is better to be crushed by a small avalanche than a big one. Still, not everyone will do so badly out of the deal. Carat's vendors will receive the bulk of the deferred consideration owed to them. But it is Omnicom which could emerge as the ultimate beneficiary. Having helped to underwrite the open offer, it will be perfectly positioned to acquire the rest of Aegis in a few years time - just as the European advertising market returns to health.</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Tokyo package dropped Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said early today that the government was not considering an economic stimulus package, William Dawkins and agencies report from Tokyo. His announcement to the budget committee of the lower house of parliament came as stocks suffered a sharp fall in early trading, with the Nikkei average down more than 600 points at about 16,830. Mr Hosokawa also said that Japan's past economic stimulus measures, including a growth-oriented budget for the current fiscal year ending March 31 1994, were certain to promote economic recovery. Last week, Mr Kazuo Aichi, in charge of policy for the Japan Renewal party, the coalition partner responsible for economic policy, said the seven-party coalition had agreed on the need to take some action to boost the economy around December 7. But the package began to look increasingly unlikely yesterday when plans hit delays due to the coalition's hectic schedule. Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister for international trade and industry, said on Japanese television that the government was discussing no such plans and that it must now give top priority to the supplementary budget required to finance part of the Y6,150bn (Pounds 38.7bn) pump-priming package launched in September.</p>

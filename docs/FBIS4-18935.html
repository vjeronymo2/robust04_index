			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jacques Isnard: "Military Planning Law Puts Off </F> Decision on M5 and ASLP Nuclear Missiles Until 1997"]    [Text] The 1995-2000 military planning law, which will be  put before the cabinet on Wednesday 20 April, to some extent  puts the fate of the two nuclear weapons projects on hold.  These projects concern the new generation strategic submarine  missile, M5 (and possibly a version of the M5 for the Albion  platform), and the airborne ASLP air-to-surface missile to be  carried by the Rafale. However, that does not mean that these  projects have been frozen. Research credits have been earmarked  for both deterrent weapons systems. However, any decision to  start -- or, if necessary, abandon -- the development and above  all the production of these missiles has been delayed until 1997  when the schedule will be revised to take account of the  international situation and the state of French public finances.    Designed to determine the level of credit for the purchase  of  equipment and the number of troops in force for the period  1995-2000, the military planning law has been drated up by a  presidential Defense Committee. It will take the form of  six-year legislation after being submitted to Parliament before  the end of this spring session.    Intended to be the continuation of the 1994 defense white  paper, the planning project, which translates the white paper  into budgetary terms, prioritizes a conventional armed force  charged with foreign missions, and envisages the creation of  so-called projectable units for long-distance deployment either  under national command or operating by international mandate. On  the other hand -- and this is the main turning point in France's  conception of security compared with previous planning programs  -- the new draft law more or less signals a pause in plans for  future nuclear weapons systems. To be more exact, it does not  make a definite decision between the various options available  but leaves all avenues open.    There are several reasons why things have reached this point  but the logic is the same in each case: namely, it is too early  to make a commitment to send plans for nuclear weapons in one  direction rather than another and so risk making irreversible  decisions, since the production cycle for this type of weapon is  in the region of 15 to 20 years.    First, financial restrictions weigh heavily, even if France,  by agreeing to increase its military expenditure despite  economic difficulties, has taken a direction which runs counter  to the attitude of most of its allies, who have been obliged to  make significant defense cuts. Given these financial  restrictions, the emphasis placed on conventional forces means  that nuclear investment has to be limited. In addition, the  priority that was for a long time given to the whole range of  deterrents was, to some extent, a carryover from the East-West  Cold War which has since lost much of its meaning. The French  nuclear arsenal has not suddenly become so obsolete that it has  to be completely modernized from top to bottom and at any cost.  Last, it is generally considered that -- without seriously  jeopardizing its security -- France can wait, and extend the  life of existing nuclear weapons until such time as they become  obsolete. The current and foreseeable state of the world no  longer justifies, as it once did, the deployment of the most  up-to-date deterrents.    All these considerations came into play to ensure that the  military planning law is kept within reasonable limits. In 1997  a final decision will have to be taken concerning the different  formulas that will lay the ground for the weapons systems that  will replace -- or not replace -- the current M4 submarine-borne  missiles, the S3D missiles in the Albion platform's silos, and  the ASMP air-to-ground missiles carried by the Mirage IV, Mirage  2000-N, and other Super Etendards in service. The aim is still  for these nuclear weapons to be replaced by their possible  successors around the year 2010. By then, and between 1995 and  1997, research credits will continue to be allocated for the M5  (including for its ground version on the Albion platform) and  for the ASLP, so that the industrial groups concerned can retain  their know-how and their engineering teams.    If necessary, it will be possible to allocate development  credits in advance. This should be the case for the  stato-reactor technology which forms the basis for the ASMP (and  the new version of the ASLP which will be derived from it), an  area in which France is still a long way ahead of its  international rivals.  <H5>  Will Tests Restart? </H5>   All this means that, while the core has been retained and  there is apparently no hurry, it will be up to the next head of  state to make the final decision, during the first two or three  years of the planning law, to determine which nuclear weapons  system will replace the existing submarine missiles and make up  the rest of the deterrent. It is understood that, in addition  to the missile-launching submarines, a second strategic  "component," based on ground-based or airborne missiles, will  have to be chosen.    Whatever decision is made by the next president of the  republic, it is assumed that by 1995 a solution will have been  found to the particularly thorny problem of which explosive  warhead should be used in the nuclear weapons system. The issue  is not so much the nature of the new missile, but the nuclear  charge it will carry.    The suspension of nuclear testing decreed by Francois  Mitterrand, due to run until the end of his presidency in May  1995, prevents experts -- or so it would appear -- from defining  the characteristics and performance of the warhead which is to  be adapted to suit the requirements of this second "component."  All they can hope to do is "patch together" a new warhead using  existing ones, hoping that laboratory simulations will prove  sufficient, for the next 10 years, to build the weapon in  question. However, even if this were the case, it would still  be unwise to deploy a nuclear weapon whose safety and "scale"  aspects had not first been subject to full-scale testing.    The next head of state will be given two choices that in  effect come down to the same thing. Either he can prolong the  test ban and, as a result, he will not be assured of having a  really new deterrent -- missile and warhead -- ready in time.  In this case he runs the risk of being accused of having led  France down the path toward definitively abandoning the very  principle of deterrent. Or he can take the initiative and break  the test ban, and then have to modernize the nuclear arsenal  with the prospect of having to be content with a relatively  limited number of tests before switching to laboratory  simulations. In this case, he will need much more courage and  tenacity to brave the antinuclear campaign in his own country  and, at the same time, risk turning his back on much of the  international community, which will be plunged into the torment  of having to renegotiate the non-proliferation treaty (NPT).    A cruel dilemma for a newly elected president to have to  face  just after taking up his new office! Those in favor of  restarting nuclear tests -- unilaterally, if need be -- will not  be held up by this point of detail. They consider that, on the  contrary, 1995 will be the year when a new president can --  during what is termed the period of presidential grace -- obtain  the backing for France to participate in the new NPT [Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty] framework with the express condition  that it can first complete its new deterrent by performing any  remaining tests.</p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH RESERVES JUDGMENT ON IOWA BLAST PROBE  </P> <P> President Bush said Monday he is awaiting a report on the reopened  investigation into the explosion last year aboard the battleship Iowa, and that  if Clayton M. Hartwig is shown to be innocent of any blame, the dead seaman  deserves an apology.  </P> <P> Bush said he cannot reach any conclusions until he sees all the facts, but he  said: "Clearly, I'm interested."  </P> <P> It was his first comment on the matter since investigators reported new  evidence to Congress on Friday.  </P> <P> Sandia National Laboratory, hired by Congress to look into the tragedy,  challenged the Navy's conclusion that the April, 1989, blast that killed  Hartwig and 46 other sailors was probably an act of suicidal sabotage by  Hartwig, a gunner's mate.  </P> <P> The explosion occurred in the reconditioned World War II battleship while gun  crews were firing the 16-inch guns in the No. 2 turret.  </P> <P> The Sandia report suggested that the explosion could have been caused by  gunners "over-ramming" the powder bags into a gun breech.  </P> <P> Bush, wrapping up a four-day Memorial Day weekend at his summer home here, was  asked if Hartwig deserved an apology.  </P> <P> "I have no opinion on it," Bush told reporters before teeing off at the Cape  Arundel Golf Club. "I really have no judgment."  </P> <P> But, he said: "If the man is innocent, is proved innocent, of these  allegations, clearly there should be a statement to that effect."  </P> <P> The President declined comment when asked to assess the Navy's initial  investigation, which critics have charged was flawed and even bent on pinning  blame on Hartwig rather than its own equipment.  </P> <P> "I can't assess it until I get all the facts. They'll get it (the report) to  me. . . . I don't know how long."  </P></p>

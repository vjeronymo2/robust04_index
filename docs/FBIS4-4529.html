			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 2 KYODO -- Political parties and  organizations collected tax-free political funds totaling 158.3  billion yen during 1992 from local backers, an 8.7 percent drop  from the previous year, according to a government report  released Saturday [2 April].    The funds raised by 53,818 political parties and supporting  groups across the country represented a decline of some 15.1  billion yen from 1991, when the amount hit a record 173.4  billion yen, the Home Affairs Ministry said in its report. It  was the first time in five years that political funds fell below  the year before, it said.    Combined with national-level political funds, the total  revenue stood at 332.3 billion yen, down 7.5 percent from 1991.    The local-level total expenditure, meanwhile, stood at 156.2  billion yen, bringing the combined expenditure at 328.5 billion  yen, a 7.6 percent decline from the previous year.    Ministry officials attributed the primary cause of the drop  to the sharp decrease of funds collected by the then ruling  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), as well as the economic  recession after the bursting of the speculative "bubble economy"  in the early 1990s and a growing momentum toward political  reform.    The ministry compiled the report after political parties'  local chapters and political organizations declared their  fund-raising balance of payments to local election management  committees.    Of the amount, political parties collected 66.7 billion yen,  down 5.7 percent from the previous year, while 617 organizations  raised 3.6 billion yen in fund-raising parties, an increase of  75.8 percent over 1991.    The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) topped the list at 29.8  billion yen, followed by the LDP at 22.4 billion yen, the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) at 7.1 billion yen, Komeito [Clean  Government Party] at 4.0 billion yen, the Democratic Socialist  Party (DSP) at 3.3 billion yen and the United Social Democratic  Party (USDP) at 200 million yen.    Although many of the major parties registered increases of  funds over the previous year ranging from 1.6 percent of the SDP  to 24.8 percent of Komeito, the LDP recorded a sharp decrease of  18.0 percent, or about 4.9 billion yen, the report said.    The LDP, currently the leading opposition party, was active  to raise funds in 1991 to prepare for the House of Councillors  elections the following year.    The JCP, another opposition party, also suffered a 1.1  percent drop.    The coalition's Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and new  party  Sakigake [Harbinger], two LDP breakaway parties which were  founded in June 1992, were not covered.    Another coalition bloc, the Japan New Party (JNP), headed by  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, did not report such funds.    Of the 47 prefectures, Tokyo outshone the other prefectures  at 18.5 billion yen, followed by Osaka at 11.5 billion yen and  Aichi Prefecture at 8.2 billion yen and Kanagawa Prefecture at  7.2 billion yen.    The ministry released a report last September on political  funds that central offices of political parties and  organizations collected in 1992.</p>

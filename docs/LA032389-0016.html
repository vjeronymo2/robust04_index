			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEEN RECOGNITION  </P> <P> Since the beginning of this year the media have focused on gang activity in the  region. Every day we read and hear about another youth dying in our streets.  The daily reports have made the average citizen numb to the grief and horror.  However, I have not written this letter to criticize the media but to show  positive progress within their reports of despair.  </P> <P> I am a teacher at Pater Noster High School, a small Archdiocese high school in  northeast Los Angeles. My students took steps towards eliminating gang  violations recently. Sixteen seniors took weapons of paint and brushes into the  community to cover gang slogans and remarks.  </P> <P> The community has been elated with this push coming from our school. The  seniors have agreed to work with the Northeast Field Patrol Division of the Los  Angeles Police Department to paint over graffiti on walls throughout the  community. My students are hoping this action will prompt other high schools in  the area to pick up the brush and do the same.  </P> <P> I am very proud of these students, not because I know them (that is an honor in  itself), but that they organized and developed this themselves. I think that  when students take this type of action they deserve more media recognition than  the gangs. After all, these are the type of students we will look to as our  future leaders.  </P> <P> PETER ROMERO JR.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

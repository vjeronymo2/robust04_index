In the morning  he had several meetings at the U.N. headquarters, including with  U.N.

Nazarbayev's speech at Columbia University, in which he set  forth Kazakhstan's stand on problems of the world order,  development and democracy, became the feature event of the day.  He stressed that Kazakhstan, like any other young state, seeks  to protect its sovereignty, independence and territorial  integrity, to create conditions for the formation of a  market-based economy, the strengthening of democratic  institutions and the maintenance of harmonious inter-ethnic  relations, and to ensure national security.    Speaking about Kazakhstan's foreign policy, Nazarbayev  pointed out that its priority goal is the creation of a zone of  confidence and good neighbourly relations along the whole  parameter of its borders. "I have always been and continue to be  an advocate of historically formed relations of friendship,  cooperation and mutual understanding on the whole territory of  the former USSR republics and I have consistently supported the  idea of economic integration of the CIS member states,"  Nazarbayev said.    So far as Kazakh-American relations are concerned, their  essence is reflected in the charter on democratic partnership,  signed in Washington, the Kazakh president continued. He said  the Clinton administration was actively encouraging large-scale  American private investments in the Kazakh economy.    The U.S. Asian society gave a reception for the Kazakh  president on Wednesday night.    Today Nazarbayev flies home to Almaty via Paris, where he is  planning to meet French President Francois Mitterrand.</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Syria call to Israel supported Syria yesterday won the public backing of Egypt and Saudi Arabia for its demand that Israel must fully withdraw from the Golan Heights and south Lebanon as part of a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement. After a two-day meeting in Alexandria, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia issued a statement which also called for Iraq to abide by United Nations Security Council resolutions and for the removal from the region of all weapons of mass destruction, a reference to Israel's nuclear stockpile. The surprise summit was held at Syria's request after growing concern in Damascus that Israel was winning wider recognition in the region despite continuing to occupy Arab land. Mr Assad is understood to have been particularly concerned at the visit earlier this week to Oman by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister. The Syrians hope that yesterday's statement by Saudi Arabia, the dominant nation in the Gulf Co-operation Council, will put pressure on the other five members to await progress in the peace negotiations before establishing links with Israel. The summit may also herald a concerted effort to rebuild Arab bridges after the divisions caused by the 1991 Gulf war and the unilateral decision by the Palestine Liberation Organisation to sign a separate peace agreement with Israel. The three leaders said they 'highly appreciated Syria's serious efforts' to make the deadlocked peace process a success and urged the US and Russia, the co-sponsors, to work towards 'removing the obstacles the Israeli side puts in the road to peace'. They also urged Iraq to abide by all UN resolutions 'to alleviate the suffering of the brotherly Iraqi people and provide a suitable atmosphere for stability in the Arab world'.</p>

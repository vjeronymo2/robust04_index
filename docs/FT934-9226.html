			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Chamberlin &amp; Hill up to Pounds 787,000 AN IMPROVEMENT in its light engineering companies enabled Chamberlin &amp; Hill, maker of iron castings, electrical conduit fittings and switchgear, to raise pre-tax profits by 8 per cent from Pounds 728,000 to Pounds 787,000 in the six months to September 30. Mr John Eccles, chairman, predicted that given order books were somewhat stronger than at the same time last year, the company expected to make further progress in the second half. The shares responded with a 7p rise to 185p yesterday. Trading conditions generally showed a modest improvement during the period, Mr Eccles said. Although inflation at the consumer price level remained low, raw material and electricity prices continued to rise sharply and this was putting increased pressure on foundry margins. First-half turnover advanced from Pounds 9.95m to Pounds 10.4m, while interest charges were lower at Pounds 70,000 (Pounds 96,000). Earnings per share increased from 6.82p to 7.35p and the interim dividend has been stepped up to 2p (1.75p).</p>

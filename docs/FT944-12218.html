			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sharp advance at Quebecor in third quarter Quebecor, an expanding Canadian-based international commercial printing, publishing and forest products group, posted a sharp gain in third-quarter earnings and is raising its dividend by 18 per cent, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Third-quarter net profit was CDollars 27.2m (USDollars 20.1m), or 39 cents a share, up almost 56 per cent from CDollars 17.5m, or 27 cents, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 1.07bn, up 35 per cent. Nine-months net profit was CDollars 70.3m, or CDollars 1.04, before special items, against CDollars 52.6m, or 77 cents, on revenues of CDollars 2.8bn, up 26.5 per cent. Quebecor, controlled by the Peladeau family of Montreal, is North America's second-biggest commercial printer and is expanding in Europe and Asia. It also owns a Canadian daily paper, plus weeklies and magazines. Its newsprint affiliate is one of North America's lowest-cost producers.</p>

Yatskevich, Institute of Technical Thermal Physics, Ministry  of Energy, Ukraine; UDC 621.311.22]    [Abstract] Before combustion, natural gas is subjected to  thermochemical reprocessing to increase efficiency and reduce  harmful emissions. This thermochemical reprocessing, or  conversion, may improve the use of fuel energy in thermal  electric power plants. It may also substantially reduce the  amount of fuel used to produce electricity. Consequently,  thermal electric power plants may be modernized virtually  without reconstruction of existing equipment. Endothermic  conversion is found to be more efficient than exothermic, but  requires radical retooling. The problem is being examined in  conjunction with the US Institute of Gas Technology. Exothermic  conversion may be used without retooling. The conversion process  is described. Exothermic conversion involves the combustion of  natural gas with an insufficient amount of oxygen to convert  CH[.sub]4[/] into CO+2H[.sub]2[/]. Endothermic conversion  involves conversion of CH[.sub]4[/] into CO and  H[.sub]2[/]. The reactions which occur in fuel conversion and  changes to existing equipment, which are minimal, are described.  In addition, some of the heat of stack gases is used to heat  water.

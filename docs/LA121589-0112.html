			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Presidents of NCAA colleges and universities were urged to support a proposal  requiring disclosure of graduation rates among athletes as an alternative to a  government-mandated program.  </P> <P> Sen. Bill Bradley (D.-N.J.) and Rep. Tom McMillen (D-Md.) are sponsoring  legislation that would require colleges to disclose how many of their athletes  graduate.  </P> <P> James Whalen, chairman of the American Council on Education board of directors,  said federal intrusion would "set a very dangerous precedent and would open a  door that we will never be able to close again."  </P> <P> Whalen has also asked for a favorable vote on a proposal to shorten football  and basketball seasons. The proposals are up for approval at the NCAA annual  meeting Jan. 7-9.  </P></p>

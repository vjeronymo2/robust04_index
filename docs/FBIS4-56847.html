			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 6 May (NA) -- Economy Minister  Domingo Cavallo stated on 6 May that the trade deficit "does not  constitute a problem" because it is caused by the importation of  capital goods, which produce "more investments." The economy  minister stressed: "The increase in imports does not constitute  a problem if it helps to increase our productive capacity."    Cavallo conceded that the unemployment number is  "worrisome,"  while snapping out that "1.5 million new jobs have been created  over the last four years." He argued: "During October 1989,  there were 11.5 million people employed. This figure increased  to 12.5 million in October 1993 while in the last six years it  had grown by only 600,000." [passage omitted]    The minister said one should wonder "why more new jobs are  not being created." He said many small- and medium-scale  entrepreneurs "are afraid of the law on accidents on the  shop-floor and current labor laws."    This prompted him to reiterate his request for the enactment  of the Labor Flexibility Law because "we must have more  realistic labor laws, at least for the Pymes [small- and  medium-scale enterprises]."    To conclude, Cavallo pointed out that over the last three  years the country has grown "25 percent," which means Argentina  "has recorded the third largest growth rate in the world."

			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has stated that the rebels who  broke away from legitimacy have refused to accept the principles  that the National Defense Council declared yesterday to observe  a cease-fire for the sixth time as of 2400 last night, Saturday,  under the supervision of the U.S. and French military attaches  in the Republic of Yemen and other members of the joint military  committee. The initiative was in abidance by UN Security Council  Resolution 924 and in response to the UN secretary general's  appeal and the good efforts of brothers and friends.    The source said that the outlawed rebels have violated the  cease-fire, continuing their aggression against the units of our  Armed Forces--the forces of unity and legitimacy--in Aden and  Hadhramaut. Since the early hours of this morning, they have  been subjecting our troops to artillery shelling and launching  raids against the positions of our Armed Forces, despite the  full abidance of the forces of unity and legitimacy by  yesterday's announcement by National Defense Council. The  source held the separatist rebels responsible for the rejection  of the new cease-fire initiative, their continued aggression  against the citizens and our Armed Forces, their failure to  respond to the UN secretary general's appeal and the good  efforts of brothers and friends to secure a cease-fire and  resolve the Yemeni problem through peaceful dialogue within the  framework of the Republic of Yemen, maintaining unity, and  respect for the constitutional legitimacy.</p>

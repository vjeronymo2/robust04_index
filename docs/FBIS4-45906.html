			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jan Gunnar Furuly: "Fear of Virus in Medicine </F> for Hemophiliacs"]    [Text] Director Thor Krey Jacobsen at No-Re-Farm criticizes  the virus cleansing methods used by an Austrian supplier of  Norwegian hemophilia medication.    The National Health Inspection Agency yesterday halted all  further use of a particular production run of hemophilia  medication from the Austrian producer after having confirmed  that a young hemophiliac had become infected by hepatitis C. The  health authorities fear that the source originates in a blood  product from that producer. Norwegian hemophiliacs have been  asked to submit to testing in order to reveal any possible  further source of the viral infection.    "The pharmaceutical company Octopharma's faulty virus  cleansing method exposes Norwegian hemophiliacs to the risk of  contracting serious viral infections," Jacobsen says to  AFTENPOSTEN. He criticizes Norwegian health authorities for  protesting EU demands for stricter rules concerning viral  cleansing of blood plasma.    The case is particularly serious because Octopharma has been  approved by Norwegian health authorities to produce blood  products from all the Norwegian plasma extracted from the blood  banks, altogether 40 tons a year. The plasma is brought to  Octopharma's laboratories in Vienna to be further processed  into, among other things, medication for hemophiliacs. After  processing, the finished products are shipped back to the users  in Norway.    Director Jacobsen of No-Re-Farm, which is the representative  for the foreign pharmaceutical industry in Norway, maintains  that Octopharma's virus cleansing method is far from  satisfactory.    He points out that most other competitors employ a double  cleansing method that kills all types of viruses. Jacobsen  refers to a report from the EU Commission, in which it was  revealed that as many as 84 cases of hepatitis A have been found  among hemophiliacs in Italy, Germany, Ireland, and Belgium in  connection with the use of hemophilia medication from the same  Austrian pharmaceutical producer in 1992 and 1993. The drug  manufacturer was criticized in the report for having weak  procedures for the so-called virus inactivation process.    The drug that the EU Commission has brought into focus is  the  same one that the National Health Inspection Agency has now  halted in Norway.    Erik Juel, the leader of the Health Director's advisory  council for transfusion matters, takes the news of the hepatitis  C infection very seriously, thinking this might be a reason to  reevaluate Octopharma's virus cleansing method if it turns out  that the hemophilia medication is the source of the infection.  Juel, however, stresses the fact that this has not yet been  established.    "Tests of this particular hemophilia medication will not be  ready for another week," departmental director Anne Marie Horn  of the National Health Inspection Agency informs us.    The report that Jacobsen refers to about the 84 cases of  hepatitis A infection, is, among other things, the reason why an  internal council for transfusion matters in the EU has proposed  ordering double virus cleansing of plasma that will be marketed  in the EU.    Norwegian health authorities have categorically rejected the  proposal and have asked for an exception for plasma products  produced from Norwegian blood. The National Health Inspection  Agency maintains that Norwegian blood is so clean and subjected  to such strict control procedures that double virus cleansing is  unnecessary and will drive up prices. The health director's  advisory council for transfusion matters says that the extra  cleansing step will result in a 25-percent loss of plasma volume  and that Norwegian self-sufficiency of plasma products might be  endangered.</p>

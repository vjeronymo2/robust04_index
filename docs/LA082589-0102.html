			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LORENZO WEIGHS SALE OF STAKE IN CONTINENTAL  </P> <P> Frank Lorenzo, the indomitable chairman of Texas Air Corp., said Thursday that  he was discussing the sale of part or all of Continental Airlines with several  unnamed parties.  </P> <P> Lorenzo, who brought Continental out of bankruptcy in 1985 two years after  filing for court protection from creditors, said he was considering the sale of  a stake in Continental to give the airline "access to stronger financial or  marketplace resources."  </P> <P> In a statement released after the stock market closed, Lorenzo said there were  also several good reasons not to sell the airline. He said Continental had just  emerged from a difficult period of consolidation after its bankruptcy and  showed potential for improved results. He also pointed out that he and his  associates have 17 years experience running Texas Air. Texas Air acquired  Continental in 1981.  </P> <P> The announcement by Lorenzo, who controls a large stake in Texas Air, was  unexpected. Most airline industry analysts had expected Lorenzo to combine  Texas Air's troubled Eastern Airlines unit with Continental to strengthen both  carriers. Eastern is currently operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code and is starting to rebuild despite a bitter and disabling  strike by machinists.  </P> <P> Continental, which has an extensive domestic route system and a large hub in  Newark, N.J., earned a small profit of $32.1 million on revenue of $1.3 billion  in the quarter that ended June 30. It is the main operating company of Texas  Air. The airline isn't unionized, as a result of the 1983 bankruptcy filing  that earned Lorenzo the reputation as a union-buster.  </P> <P> Louis A. Marckesano, an airline industry analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott  in Philadelphia, said Lorzeno might be under pressure from Eastern's creditors  to raise cash. Marckesano said Texas Air had guaranteed a portion of Eastern's  $2-billion debt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LBO Called Unlikely  </P> <P> "Or he may just be testing the waters in light of all the other airline buyouts  that have taken place," said Marckesano.  </P> <P> UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, is considering takeover offers from  several parties, including a $6.2-billion bid from Los Angeles investor Marvin  Davis. Two months ago, Los Angeles investor Alfred A. Checchi acquired NWA  Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, for $4.05 billion.  </P> <P> Marckesano said it was unlikely that Continental could be acquired through a  leveraged buyout. In such a transaction, the purchaser borrows money to buy a  company, using its assets or cash flow to repay the debt. Continental's  aircraft and domestic landing slots are "fully valued and over-leveraged,"  leaving little ability to borrow against them, said Marckesano.  </P> <P> One possible buyer for Continental was thought to be New York investor Carl C.  Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airways.  </P></p>

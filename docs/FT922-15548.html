			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Yeltsin concludes federal treaty PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's Russian Federation yesterday concluded a federal treaty designed to cement it together for the post-Soviet era. Eighteen of the 20 'republics' within the 150m strong Federation, together with the leaders of Russian administrative regions and the mayors of Moscow and St Petersburg, signed the treaty in a formal ceremony at the Kremlin. Created by Stalin as part of a divide and rule policy, the autonomous republics were set up to house Russia's ethnic minorities, even though the biggest group, the Tatars, were scattered over four republics. The ceremony was marred by a boycott by Tatarstan, the biggest of the autonomous republics, and Chechnya, where a state of emergency was called yesterday after internecine fighting broke out. But the treaty may allay fears that the country itself will break up like the Soviet Union did before it. President Yeltsin warned that the challenge now would be to implement 'every article' of the treaty, despite the fact that he has had to conclude a series of deals, chiefly over property and taxation, to get individual participants on board. The treaty was designed to be a section of a future Russian constitution. Its main provisions are as follows: The federal government is responsible for foreign policy, defence, defending civil rights and protecting ethnic minorities; defining federal policy for the social, political and economic development of the Russian Federation; establishing the foundations for a common market, financial and monetary policy, customs regulations, a federal budget and taxation policy; running federal energy, transport, and communications systems. Responsibilities shared between the federal government, the republics and the regions include: ensuring that legislation is in accordance with the constitution; law enforcement; management, use and ownership of land, minerals and other natural resources; common matters of health, education and culture. Republics are responsible for every other area except those they have delegated to the Russian Federation. Disputes are to be resolved through the use of conciliatory procedures, to be specified in a future constitution. Russian is the official language in the Federation although republics can also have their own official language. Stopping short of outright secession, Tatarstan is negotiating a separate treaty with the Russian Federation. With some republics still under the firm grip of their old Communist rulers, they have also provided a focus of opposition to President Yeltsin's radical reforms. But apart from local political ambitions, much of the differences with Moscow arise from the desire of local areas to hang on to whatever wealth they have for themselves at a time of great economic hardship. This is why even areas which do not have a separate national identity, such as oil-rich Tyumen in Siberia, or Sakhalin Island in the Far East, among the signatories to the treaty, have also joined in the fight for more freedom from Moscow.</p>

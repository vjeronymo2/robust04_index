			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: High charges, poor performance - Serious Money Novices often think of investment as a string of brilliant money-making decisions. In practice, much investment consists of avoiding traps and recognising your own limitations. But that does not remove all need to make intelligent choices. Many busy people decide that investing directly in ordinary shares is not for them and stick to packaged products managed by professionals. The snag is that packaged products need to be scrutinised almost as closely as individual shares. Some life insurance and pension policies bear much heavier costs and commissions than others, and this is one of the reasons why the returns from apparently similar products vary so much. Hence the need for the new deal for investors which comes into force from tomorrow. The disclosure rules mean that life insurance companies now have to reveal their charges to prospective clients. Such information, however, is of use only to clients who understand what they are being told and have some standard of comparison. Few people are going to have the patience to slog round scores of different firms before they take out a life or pension policy. So, we have done it for you. Our detailed survey on personal pensions (page 7), the first of an occasional series on different investment products, throws up some staggering variations. Charges on a pension plan with a notional end value of Pounds 134,000 ranged from just over Pounds 9,000 to more than Pounds 34,000 over the 20-year period of investment. The conventional justification for high charges is that they are worth paying if the investment performance is outstanding. But what our tables suggest is that, in many cases, the companies which charge the most also have very poor investment performance records. Costs and performance are the two main points to consider if you stick with your investment for the full period planned originally. But only one person in seven does. So, we have also looked at transfer values: how much of your investment you get back if you move your pension to a different firm. In several cases, you get back nothing if you move after the first year; in many, you still lose some of your original investment after as long as three years. The new deal for investors is good in two ways: it increases the amount of publicly available information, and fear of what the public will think of this information has already made some of the insurance companies change their ways. What it has not done is remove the duty of care from the investor. One reason Christmas crises tend to loom so large is that no one is around to put out the fire. Next week is the soonest it will be possible to get any realistic idea of where Mexican markets may stabilise. And that, in turn, will depend greatly on what foreign investors think of the package of measures proposed by Mexico's new leadership. Even if the overall package looks acceptable, individual companies with large quantities of dollar debt may be crippled or killed. If US mutual fund investors panic, their managers would have to take money from other Latin markets in order to meet investor demands for cash. But economic prospects for many of the other countries in Latin America still look attractive. And, although other Latin markets have fallen sharply, no one really expects Mexico to start the dominoes tumbling. It is unfortunate that the Mexican upset occurred just when rising US interest rates were beginning to make cash deposits appealing to mutual fund investors once more. But the big long-term flow of money into emerging markets comes from US pension funds rather than individuals. That flow could be checked, but it is unlikely to be reversed in the long term. Optimists are even arguing that this could be a wonderful buying opportunity for Latin American enthusiasts. Impossible for the layman to tell? Undoubtedly. But he should not need to. A well-spread emerging markets fund might have perhaps 10 per cent of its assets in Mexico, and an average UK-based investor might have 10 to 20 per cent of his assets in emerging markets. So, we are talking of a Mexican involvement of less than 2 per cent of an overall portfolio. Anyone with that kind of exposure has no need to take any decisions. Several pundits are predicting that 1995 will be a year of hectic bid activity for the London stock market. But don't waste time looking for the next bid candidate; keep on searching for under-valued companies. Most bid rumours do not turn into fact - but an under-valued company is a good long-term buy regardless of whether it gets a bid in the short term.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New initiatives to accelerate the implementation of  the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) were pushed in the recent ASEAN  Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ASEAN-CCI) series of meetings  in Brunei.    The AFTA, which took effect last 1 January, requires the six  ASEAN countries to reduce intra-regional tariffs on all  manufactured goods to between 0 percent to 5 percent within 15  years through the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT)  scheme.    Its primary objective is to create a single ASEAN market of  330 million people and a combined GNP exceeding $300 billion.    In the said meetings, it was proposed that the harmonization  of tariff codes be accelerated with priority accorded to  products enjoying high volume of intra-ASEAN trade and products  that fall under the 15 fast-track product groups in the Common  Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) agreement. Product groups  under the fast-track program are vegetable oil, cement,  chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, plastic, rubber  products, pulp, leather products, textiles, ceramic and glass  products, gems and jewelry, copper cathodes, electronics, wooden  and rattan furniture.    Other proposals adopted by the council are:  -- to improve the frequency and availability of shipping between  ASEAN countries;    -- identify, through regional industry clubs, industry  specific non-tariff barriers (NTBs) that should be eliminated;    -- upgrade the efficiency of trade procedures including  the possibility of implementing an electronic data interchange;    -- facilitate product certification and acceptance;    -- raise the capability of the services sector such as  banking, insurance, and telecommunications to support trade; and,    -- address the issue concerning developments in global  trade such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Other recommendations are being pushed by working groups of  ASEAN-CCI.    These include:    -- the establishment of joint promotion of ASEAN  agricultural products;    -- the development of infrastructure such as the  establishment of a pan-ASEAN land bridge;    -- pursuing open skies policy; and,    -- the development of ASEAN optic fiber network and the  expansion of cellular phone network beyond country borders.</p>

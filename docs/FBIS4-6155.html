			<p>CSO     [Text] Pressure for Higher Yen Intensifies--Factors  Include Political Turmoil, Deadlocked Japan-U.S. Negotiations  and Foreign Exchange Futures Transactions Related to Exports    Foreign exchange markets reflect intensifying pressure for a  higher yen. The reason is that the perception is spreading that  Japanese political turmoil will preclude any progress in the  expansion of domestic demand, decontrol of markets and  correction of the Japan-U.S. trade imbalance. The perception of  dollar surpluses associated with the need for large-scale  purchases of yen and sales of dollars by export industries has  also accelerated a high yen-cheap dollar situation. The view  prevails that for the time being the yen will hover in the high  range of 101-105 yen to the dollar.    In response to the widening chasm associated with the  selection of a successor prime minister by the coalition  parties, the perspective is strengthening that "further delays  will take place in the reopening of the suspended Japan-U.S.  comprehensive economic talks." Prospects are that Foreign  Minister Hata will attend the cabinet minister-level meetings of  the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT) in Morocco to seek an agreement for resumption of the  comprehensive talks, but the view prevails that "talks of a  serious nature cannot be resumed until the appointment of a new  government," and it appears that expectations of a high yen for  the future will persist in the face of the political vacuum.    The U.S. Government is expected to wait for the decision to  be made on the next prime minister and to allow for additional  time in the disposition of pending problems such as the  comprehensive talks. However, repeated statements by C. Fred  Bergsten, chief of the U.S. International Economic Research  Center, currently visiting Japan, relative to tolerating a high  yen have prompted market sources to comment that "They encourage  speculative buying of the yen."    A look at the supply and demand situation for the dollar in  currency markets indicates that export-import firms have begun  to establish this fiscal year's intra-company exchange rate at  105 yen for the dollar for accounting purposes. Accordingly,  they show signs of steadily entering into currency futures  contracts to sell the dollar whenever the yen falls in value to  above 105 yen to the dollar. In reality, last weekend when news  of Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation hit the markets, the  yen dropped temporarily, but prompt selling of dollars by  export-import firms prevented any persistent fall in the yen.  Sources at Sumitomo Corporation interpret the situation in the  currency markets as "Substantiating the perception of a surplus  in dollars."    Sources at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank point to frequent mention  that structurally, "It will be difficult for a while to alter  conditions which cause a monthly trade surplus of $10 billion."  In view of this situation, unless institutional investors  actively purchase foreign debentures, the excess dollar supply  will continue and incremental selling of dollars will occur.  Currency market sources state, "Although we will see near-term  demand for purchase of dollars in connection with Brazilian bond  purchases by Japanese banks, the basic trend reflecting a high  yen-cheap dollar relationship will not change."</p>

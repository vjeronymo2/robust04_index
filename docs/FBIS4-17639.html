			<p>BFN     [Text] A new version of the 1994 draft federal budget was  submitted to the State Duma this evening.    As a result of amendments made by the Finance Ministry, the  budget deficit has increased by nearly 6.5 trillion rubles,  totalling 70 trillion rubles. It will be funded by credits from  the Central Bank.    According to the document, the deficit grew because the  expenditure part increased by 8 trillion rubles. This money has  been earmarked for food purchases and investment in agriculture.  The income part has also slightly increased because export and  import duties have been raised.    Aleksandr Pochinok, deputy chairman of the committee for  budget- related issues, told a correspondent of Ekho Moskvy that  a joint parliamentary and government commission will now start  work on the document since there are still many criticisms  targeted at the budget.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Management: One of the boys - The rapid growth of an Ohio bank over the last 18 months has lifted it into the same league as some of the oldest US financial institutions Against a national backdrop of a commercial banking industry battered by property loan losses and recession, a bank from Columbus, Ohio, has quietly emerged as one of the best managed, most rapidly expanding and most strategically successful financial institutions in the United States. Banc One, little known outside the US, has expanded away from its roots in the midwestern heartland by way of a dozen bank takeovers over the past 18 months in places such as Colorado, Texas and Arizona. The acquisitions have been accompanied by a management formula that combines decentralised decision-making with group-wide guidance and advice. Since the start of 1991 - as a result of the acquisitions - Banc One has succeeded in boosting its total assets from Dollars 30bn (Pounds 15.7bn) to more than Dollars 75bn. Its network has grown from 587 to 1,328 branches, its workforce from 19,300 to 47,061 people and its geographic presence from six to 11 states. Wall Street analysts say Banc One is one of the few US institutions genuinely positioned to become a nationwide bank. This has been accomplished without diluting the bank's earnings per share, its equity-to-assets capital ratio or its return on assets, which at 1.5 per cent is significantly higher than the average (0.89 per cent) return of the top 25 US banks. Last year, only four US banks - Bank of America, JP Morgan, Chase Manhattan and Bankers Trust - earned more than Banc One's Dollars 529.5m of net profits. And only BofA, NationsBank, Morgan and Chemical Bank have a present market capitalisation larger than Banc One's stockmarket value of Dollars 9bn. The secret of Banc One's success is the result of a mosaic of strategies. These include a strictly domestic banking operation, a conservative approach to lending that has kept the bank largely away from the troubled property sector, a technology-driven focus on consumer banking and an innovative set of management and financial reporting tools that are admired throughout the industry. It is almost axiomatic to assume that problems must await any bank that is expanding as rapidly as Banc One. Yet Wall Street analysts and top bankers alike say they have confidence in the bank and in John McCoy, the third generation member of his family to chair the bank. George Salem, a normally sceptical analyst with Prudential Securities, fairly bubbles with praise: 'Banc One could well be the best practitioner of excellent bank management in all its dimensions.' Art Ryan, president of Chase Manhattan, has great faith in Banc One's strategy: 'They are very, very good at what they do. I'd buy their stock.' Banc One's stock price, which has leapt by 86 per cent over the past 18 months, has obviously helped pay for the takeovers, which are mainly in stock, not cash. But so has the bank's continuous experience in acquiring banks - more than 100 deals have been made over the past 25 years. Acquisitions, according to McCoy, are more than a strategy. They are a line of business. The 48-year-old McCoy, a burly man with a penchant for monogrammed blue shirts, sits in his 16th floor office in downtown Columbus and explains his acquisition and management strategies. 'First of all I don't believe in merger of equals. We've really tried to study what we do. One rule is we never buy a bank more than a third of our own size. 'Then, we are only really interested in opportunities in a retail banking market where we can be first or second in terms of market share. And we don't want to take on a bank with asset quality problems.' The few sceptics around say Banc One has paid too richly for some banks. But McCoy insists that the bank takeovers will not dilute overall earnings per share, even if the issuing of new stock has diluted shareholdings in Banc One itself, including that of his own family, which is now below 1 per cent. Once banks are acquired, however, Banc One swings into action to help manage and to slash operating costs. The first step is to transfer data processing operations to a central office in Springfield, Ohio. The Springfield computer centre is more than just an administrative division  -it is also the second biggest automated clearing house transaction processor in the US, a profitable Banc One business that last year processed 44.8m electronic payments, primarily made to insurance companies by individuals. The dollar value of those transactions was Dollars 47bn. The heart of Banc One's much envied management, however, is what the bank calls its policy of 'uncommon partnerships'. This is shorthand for leaving acquired banks relatively free to design their own marketing strategies and pricing, although not their management system and product portfolio, which are uniform inside the Banc One empire. Managers at the 58 separate banks inside the network are both intimidated and inspired to achieve a high return on assets by an unusual, computer-based monthly reporting system known as the Management Information Computer System (Mics). All Banc One managers can and do use Mics to compare results. The management system also has a human face. A team of Banc One consultants is almost always on the road, offering a manager in Kentucky the fruits of lessons learned in Ohio or Wisconsin. 'Most people don't have anything to compare themselves to. We allow our guys to see who is doing things the best, and how they are doing it,' says McCoy. If Banc One is bucking the national trend, this is also because of the bank's strategy of spreading risk geographically and among numerous small consumers. Its retail banking experience includes being the first bank in the US to buy a franchise to issue BankAmericard (1967), the forerunner of Visa, and being the first bank to install a cash dispenser machine (1970). McCoy notes that 99 per cent of the bank's Dollars 32.6bn total loan book consists of loans of less than Dollars 50m. The bank's strong focus on the consumer can also be found in the profitable credit card and instalment loan divisions. With Dollars 4.1bn of credit card receivables on its books, Banc One is among the leading card issuers in the US. Nancy Bush, a bank analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, says the bank's above-average 6.5 per cent net interest margin stems in part from the rich pickings of an average 17.8 per cent interest yield earned on credit card balances. Just as striking is the fact that while big banks in New York are experiencing record consumer delinquencies, Banc One's more conservative midwestern clientele is better at paying bills, which helps explain the average 14 per cent earned on Dollars 6.9bn of consumer instalment loans. The main criticism to make of McCoy's management approach is that he is taking on more than he can handle. Bush says the bank is 'pushing the outer edge of the envelope' with its aggressive acquisitions strategy. But she adds: 'They have a great depth of management simply by dint of having already acquired and integrated so many banks for the last 20 years.' McCoy, while noting proudly that Banc One will be the seventh biggest bank in the US in asset terms by year-end, agrees that the bank must now undergo a period of consolidation rather than further acquisitions. Yet analysts forecast that Banc One will achieve an increase of about 13 per cent in its 1992 net profits, hardly a sign that the acquisitions have caused a bout of indigestion.</p>

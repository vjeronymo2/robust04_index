			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (15): A dash for mobility all across Asia - The Hong Kong market is to be thrown open to competition Telecommunications operators across the world will be eyeing Hong Kong over the coming months after the recent news that the mobile communications market is about to be cracked wide open. The territory's industry regulator, the Office of the Telecommunications Authority (Ofta), has decided to move ahead with plans that will bring unprecedented competition, perhaps even as early as April next year. Ofta aims to license up to 10 new operators across two new technologies, offering six licences for digital PCN - a high capacity derivative of Europe's popular GSM, and four using PHP - an almost untried Japanese technology halfway between conventional cellular and the telepoint (CT-2) phone. Not surprisingly, the existing four operators - Hongkong Telecom, Pacific Link, Hutchison Telecommunications and SmarTone - are not overjoyed by the news. Few markets measure up to Hong Kong's almost feverish appetite for mobile. Even CT-2, which proved a disaster in the UK, has been lapped up in Hong Kong. The arrival of digital technology in the territory has caused so much demand that by June, one operator, SmarTone, was forced temporarily to halt accepting new subscribers to clear a backlog of several thousand applicants. One consequence of mobile telephony's mass market appeal in Hong Kong is that pricing does not impact as it does in Europe or the US - a situation upon which industry has not been slow to capitalise. Ofta's plans to throw open the market has left analysts divided. Some claim that the market will be swamped, causing prices to plummet, meaning casualties for some operators. Others say that the operators have long acted as a cartel maintaining artificially high charges, so increased competition would be welcome. What is sure is that the tenders for operators will see international giants queuing up with hopeful bowls extended. One question which Ofta's move has thrown up is just how high the demand for mobile telephony can go. Hong Kong already has one of the highest penetration levels of mobile users in the world at 4.9 per cent, yet Ofta believes the market is far from saturated. It suggests that demand could rise to 1.1m users by 1988 - almost a quadrupling of existing users over the next four years. While Hong Kong's runaway mobile success now rarely makes headlines, China's booming cellular market does so regularly. With a fast-growing economy, an increasing proportion of well-heeled potential customers, and a sorry shortage of fixed-line connections, cellular phones sales have rocketed, with subscribers increasing by more than 300 per cent annually over the past two years. China's most important economic region, Guangdong, will have spent Dollars 1bn on cellular equipment by the end of the year, by which time its mobile users could even overtake Hong Kong. This growth has been achieved despite the high cost of connection and handset fees which at Yuan 20,000 (Dollars 2,300) work out at 12 years' salary for the average worker. One interesting phenomenon unique to the Chinese market is a preference for large handsets. The bulkier the model, the greater the attraction, for there is great prestige in being seen to carry a large handset, however brick-like it may appear across the cultural divide. With little alternative in terms of fixed-line connections, over 150 cellular networks covering all major cities and ambitious plans for far greater capacity coming on stream, China's extraordinary growth levels look set to continue. By the end of 1994, the number of mobile users is expected to top 1.2m. There are few markets where cellular telephony can truly claim to have taken the place of fixed networks, but China is one. While India too offers this potential, with fixed-line penetration at a mere eight lines per thousand population, plans have been stalled by lengthy court battles over licence allocations for Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. When mobile finally arrives in the subcontinent, the effect could be dramatic. Interest throughout south-east Asia has quickly picked up, with Malaysia and Thailand clinching growth rates of around 70 per cent in 1993. Not far behind were Australia, the Philippines and South Korea, all clocking up over 50 per cent growth. Even the Japanese market - where interest has long been modest given the size of potential demand - has recently seen a sudden dash for mobility. Mobile phone users jumped by 488,000 between April and July - more than the total of new subscribers recorded for the whole of 1993  - and handset sales are expected to top 1.5m by the end of the year. This sudden spurt of interest coincides with the opening of digital networks and a change in the law, allowing Japanese customers to purchase their handsets, rather than rent them, for the first time. The latest digital handsets are proving far more popular than analogue varieties, despite being about 30 per cent more expensive. The result has seen Japan kick-started onto a higher plane of growth. Another market rapidly rising up mobile statistics charts is Thailand. Here the main spur to demand, particularly in Bangkok, has been competition between handset dealers. A basic analogue model now retails at Bt30,000 (about Pounds 780) and a digital handset goes for Bt33,000 to Bt35,000. In the capital, a shortage of public phone boxes and relentless traffic jams, which keep people in their cars for hours at a time, has also helped boost interest in mobile. Unlike China, a dearth of fixed lines may not matter so much in Bangkok, since those who can afford a mobile almost certainly have a fixed-line phone. This does not hold true for provincial areas where waiting lists for connection to fixed lines are long. Demand in rural areas is set to rise for the odd reason that long-distance calls are cheaper on a mobile than on the fixed-line network. One spur to growth in Asia's mobile markets is competition. The regulators have been willing to issue licences to new operators. The Philippines has five, Malaysia has six, while Hong Kong and Thailand have four. Japan tops the list with a total of nine competing networks. Yet the country that lays claim to the highest penetration level of mobile users, Singapore, has achieved a base of 6.3 per hundred population, through a monopoly-provider, Singapore Telecom. ST offers attractively-priced tariffs with monthly access fees at SDollars 50 and airtime charges of 20 cents per minute across the board. But the wave of liberalisation sweeping across Asia has not stopped at Singapore, and ST will be working hard to ensure the greatest returns from its mobile monopoly before it is joined by a second cellular operator in three years' time. While analogue networks still form the lion's share of Asia's mobile networks, they will soon be overtaken by digital. Almost all new licence awards in the region stipulate that digital technologies be employed, of which Europe's GSM has proved the most popular. According to the London-based communications consultancy, CIT Research, there could be over 30m digital cellular users in the Asia-Pacific by 2003. The largest market will be Japan with over 12.8m, followed by China with around 7.1m. In only nine years' time, says CIT, some 2.1m South Koreans, 1.9m Australians, 1.8m Thais and 1.3m Taiwanese will be carrying digital cellular phones, at which time the total market for mobile services in the region will be worth Dollars 20.3bn.

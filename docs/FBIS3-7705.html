			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hisahiko Okazaki, former Japanese Ambassador </F> to Thailand, by unidentified GAIKO FORUM reporter on 6 December  1993; place not given]    [Text] The Situation Cannot Be Grasped When Thinking  About Unnecessary Things    [GAIKO FORUM] The Gulf war is the recent case in which the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs' assessment of the state of affairs  was regarded as bad. Japan's Foreign Ministry was greatly  criticized for that. What do you think about it?    [Okazaki] Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990. I was the  Japanese Ambassador to Thailand then. On that date, Foreign  Minister Taro Nakayama had stopped over in Bangkok for a night  on his return trip after attending an ASEAN meeting.    As I was listening to a news program, I learned that Iraq  was  likely to invade Kuwait. The reason was because, for one thing,  there was information that Iraq was amassing its troops along  the border. Since it is difficult to supply needs when you come  to the forefront in a desert, assembling at the border means  that the troops are on the offensive. For another, what Iraq  had been demanding from Kuwait was far from acceptable to it.    That night Mr. Nakayama and I had dinner with the foreign  minister of Thailand. If Washington had known about the  possibility of war, there was a possibility that it would have  already discusses it only with the top leaders of the world. So  I briefed Mr. Nakayama on the subject, just in case, but it was  not brought up during the dinner. Later we learned that the  United States had not imagined that the war would break out.  So, Thailand did not know about it as a matter of course.    When Mr. Nakayama returned to Bangkok after the incident had  occurred while he had been staying for a night in Laos, he  immediately came to my residence, (the official residence of the  ambassador) and asked my opinion. I said at that time, the  point was, first, to what extent Saudi Arabia would cooperate  [with the United States], and whether Egypt was going to support  [the United States]. If Saudi Arabia and Egypt supported the  United States, it would be all right. Also, [we thought] the  first thing the United States would do was to block Iraqi  economy, and it was better for Japan to join the United States  immediately. In fact, Japan supported imposing economic  sanctions at once, and that was before the UN resolution on  sanctions. Up to that point, I was very satisfied with Japan's  judgment and actions. However, they were not good thereafter.  What happened after that is as you know. Stubbornly adhering to  the postwar pacifism without regard to its practicality,  Japanese assessments and policies were terrible. I was in Japan  from the beginning to the end of September on annual leave.  Japan's views on the situation while I was there were so  terrible. I learned how bad the Japanese are in assessing the  situation.    The president of a top leading company asked me what would  happen next. And I answered that the United States would of  course intervene and a war would break out. Then he said, "the  dispute should be solved by peaceful means." Also, a prime  minister-level politician said, "If there is going to be a war,  oil prices will skyrocket, and [the economy] will get mixed up.  War should be avoided because the world economy will be thrown  into great disorder." I thought this opinion was wrong in terms  of not only its economic outlook but also its view in which war  could not be started because oil prices would increase.    [GAIKO FORUM] You mean economics is not the only thing that  influences human society.    [Okazaki] While I was paying attention to the U.S.-Saudi  Arabia negotiations, they ended in almost no time, and on 9  August a formation of F-15's arrived in Saudi Arabia from  Germany. This meant that oil was all right because the 300 km  stretch from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia's oil fields is a desert  without trees, grass, or even clouds. You cannot do anything  unless you have air supremacy. Therefore, the moment the U.S.  fighters arrived in Saudi Arabia the safety of large oil fields  in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, whose supply is enough to meet  the world's demand, was assured. I said this to the politician.  I also told him not to worry. Oil prices may rise for the  first week after a war starts, but they will drop steeply  afterwards. The politician did not want to think that oil  prices would not surge. That was why everybody made a wrong  judgment.    [GAIKO FORUM] That is a question [of prerequisite] before  discussing information itself.    [Okazaki] In September, I met many people, including  Kissinger, who was visiting Japan, and a rough outlook of the  situation became apparent. I returned to Bangkok late in  September. From then on, there was no information.    So I made a decision. There is a British division called the  "Desert Rats." It is a glorious division which fought Erwin  Rommel at the Libyan front. In short, it is England's most  powerful division. This division was heading for the Gulf from  the riverside of the Rhine. In Bangkok, I decided to  occasionally ask the British ambassador to Thailand where the  Desert Rat division was. So I got such information as the  division was in the Mediterranean Sea, it had landed, or it was  under training.    The United States would not start a war alone. So, when the  deployment of the British division was completed and it was  ready to fight, it meant the beginning of war. The deployment  was completed in late November.    The last notification was issued at the United Nations on  30 November. The notification period was originally one month,  but this was extended to 45 days after the Soviet Union asked  for an extra 15 days. The war then began in mid-January. So,  my prediction was correct. If you look at the world as it is,  you can get the answers. If you do not grasp the situation, you  must be considering something irrelevant. In other words, you  start to understand the world once you stop thinking about  unnecessary things.  <H5>  The Collapse of Eastern Europe Predicted a Year Earlier </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] Besides the Gulf war, did you find the  collapse of Eastern Europe impressive?    [Okazaki] When the Berlin Wall fell, every newspaper  described it as "a situation no one would ever have imagined."  Thanks to those who started the talk, I do not know who, no one  can be blamed for not predicting the event.    The fall of Eastern Europe, however, was a clear possibility  about a year earlier. I met a great many people in 1988. Each  of them, including Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, said  Eastern Europe was in trouble. Brzezinski made the best point  when he said, "the current situation of Eastern Europe is  similar to that of Europe in 1848." It was in 1848 that  Metternich fled after revolutions occurred in chain reaction  across Europe.    As I did not know a lot about that period I studied and  learned that the situation was taking the same course. I  reported this to senior Foreign Ministry officials. From that  time Vice Minister Murata repeatedly said Eastern Europe would  soon be chaotic.    In a speech made to presidents of Japanese firms in Bangkok  at the beginning of 1989, I said there was the possibility of  the Soviet Union intervening if the situation in Eastern Europe  erupted. I explained that if the Soviets intervened, it would  lead to a near state of war. At such a time the value of the  yen would drop. On the other hand, if there was no  intervention, and the situation moved in a direction favorable  to the United States, leading to victory for the West, then the  value of the dollar would rise. Investment in Southeast Asia is  very sensitive to the value of the yen. A certain company [in  Bangkok] told me, "if the yen goes over 180 to the dollar, then  the head office in Japan will not take care of goods  manufactured there. They will have to be sold locally."  Everybody fears a weak yen. At the end of 1989, I told firms  to beware a weaker yen, and the dollar turned out to be slightly  stronger thanks to the victory of democracy in Eastern Europe.  You can even predict these kinds of things.    [GAIKO FORUM] I see. Is there anything else?    [Okazaki] What is more strange are the discussions  surrounding the current recession. In February 1993, Fred  Bergsten [director of the Institute for International Economics]  came to Japan. He made speeches at various places. He also met  then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, and they apparently found  in each other a kindred spirit. What Bergsten said is that the  issue of Japan's trade imbalance could be settled by an  appreciation in the yen rate. I think he said that if the value  of the yen increased by 1 percent, it would bring down Japan's  trade surplus by $5 billion. It would not happen immediately,  but in two to three years. A 10-percent increase in the yen's  value would cut $50 billion, eliminating almost entirely the  trade surplus with the United States, Bergsten said at various  different times. I knew the U.S. Government would try to guide  the value of the yen upward, and the Japanese Government could  not resist it. Since I am not an expert on economics, I asked  my friends in the business world what they would do if the yen  reached the level of 100 to the dollar. Everybody said Japanese  economic growth would be zero, and the economy would fall into a  recession comparable to that in Europe. This means everybody  knew the yen would become stronger, and that the yen's  appreciation would halt economic growth. That was in February  and March of 1993.    Nevertheless, newspapers and economic forecasts expected a  recovery in the summer. When, by the summer, it had not  recovered, they blamed it on the cool summer. I do not think  the cool summer caused a business slowdown, except perhaps in  one or two industries. The cause was the strong yen.    In short, the government had to encourage industry to carry  out drastic restructuring while implementing a large-scale  economic stimulus package in February. But both politicians and  government officials appeared frozen into inaction.  <H5>  Strategic Thinking and Secret Funds Enable Positive Diplomacy </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] You also believe Japan-U.S. relations will be  at stake in February.    [Okazaki] The United States urged Japan to set numerical  targets in July 1993, and Japan agreed on condition it be a  reference index, thus postponing a real settlement of the issue.  I think such a solution was, at the time, a success because it  put a stop to the Japan-bashing then taking place. However, in  February, six months later, the two countries will have to pay  for putting off a real settlement.    The discussion on the Japanese construction market in  November was handled all right, so the issue now will center on  whether to set a numerical target for the auto parts market.  This time Japan will not make concessions because even at last  July's talks it had no intention of compromising to that extent.  It agreed to the compromise in word, with no thought of putting  it into action.    However, the U.S. approach has been very demanding and has  come in for criticism even within the United States. It has  continually urged Japan not to exercise administrative guidance;  now it wants Japan to meet targets through the use of  administrative guidance. This is quite wrong theoretically.  That is why all economists oppose the idea.    But the United States has its reasons. It concentrated on  promoting deregulation in the past, urging Japan to abolish all  sorts of regulations. However, the trade imbalance would not go  away. It thought Japan might be exercising administrative  guidance out of sight, so the United States thought that if  Japan was set a target to achieve, it would use its discreet  administrative guidance to that end. This is very coercive  reasoning, but there is about 30 percent of truth in the  suppositions behind it. Many economists, though, disapprove of  the idea.    In addition, the United States has rapidly regained its  confidence. So now there is a possibility the U.S. Government  will stop making unreasonable demands on Japan if we can wait  for another six months. If Japan judges that the grounds on  which the U.S. argument are based are about to collapse, it will  never compromise. At such a time the two nations are on a  collision course. It will be all right if the United States  softens its stand by February, but, if not, Japan and the United  States will collide. If there is going to be a head-on  collision between the two countries, there is the possibility of  a revival of the Super 301. If the Super 301 is reinstituted,  the situation will become more problematic. There will be no  place for negotiation or discretion. This must be avoided or  there will be disastrous consequences for years to come.    At the moment neither side has any intention of making  concessions. Instead, they are playing "a game of chicken," in  which two cars run at each other on course for a head-on  collision, and the one who turns the steering wheel first is the  "chicken." February will be like that.    One way Japan can avoid such a situation is to persuade U.S.  economists and open-minded legislators one by one, by mobilizing  many people, including scholars, and anyone else in a position  of influence. If Japan can relax feelings in the United States  it may be able to reach a compromise at some point. Such  diplomacy would succeed now if it could be carried out, but I do  not think it can be done.    Let me explain why. Basically, diplomacy is passive  administration. In other words, a problem occurs first and then  diplomacy comes in to solve it. The best example of passive  administration is policing. You arrest a thief if there is one.  You do not set a target, for example, to catch 2,000 thieves  next year because 1,000 were arrested this year. Traditional  ministries such as foreign and home affairs are passive  administrations. They do not think it is their job to carry  swords and make raids on enemies.    You may have an ambassador, with the knowledge and eloquence  of a first-rate economist, who is able to persuade his  opponents, but that is not always the case.    In the past, both the Foreign and Home Affairs Ministries  had  the means of positive administration. That is, secret funds.  Nowadays, there are no such funds. For instance, suppose you  hire economists, and ask each of them to win at least three  people over to your side, by giving them 10 million yen each.  If you use 10 economists, the you will need to pay out 100  million yen. It is difficult today to freely spend an amount  like 100 million yen. So, the two countries will be moving fast  on a collision course before anything serious can be done.    [GAIKO FORUM] Is not strategic thinking a positive means?    [Okazaki] Yes, it is. And if you had a strategic mind and  secret funds, you could carry out positive diplomacy.  <H5>  Developments in the Crisis-Ridden Korean Peninsula </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] You have written a book called Tonari no  kuni de kangaeta koto [My Thoughts on a Neighboring  Country], and you are familiar with the situation in the  Korean peninsula. What are the important developments in North  Korea (the Democratic People's Republic of Korea), that we  should watch.    [Okazaki] Everybody feels in their hearts that the  government of North Korea will collapse. We do not know whether  this will happen tomorrow or 10 years from now, but there is  always the possibility. A more immediate problem is the issue  of nuclear inspection. By February 1994, the matter will be  reaching its final stages.    The administration of the United States has changed from  Republican to Democrat. The appointment of the new  administration's officials was completed around June and July  1993. Since then, the issue of nuclear inspection has moved  toward a negotiated settlement. This means, the United States  will try to stop North Korea's development of nuclear weapons by  offering a series of concessions to North Korea's liking, such  as the cancelation of the joint Team Spirit exercise with the  South.    This kind of approach itself has met opposition from the  conservatives. For one thing, they feel that rewarding North  Korea for violating the treaty sets a bad example. For another,  if the negotiations are slow, North Korea's nuclear arms  development will continue to progress. But despite such  opposition, the United States is determined to solve the issue  by diplomatic means. The question is how long this resolution  will hold.    The Democratic administration is dove-like compared to the  Republicans. It is the Republicans who can conceive of things  like pinpoint bombing. The Democratic Party, however, is  characteristically peaceable and believes in principle-oriented  diplomacy. Principles such as human rights. Among them is the  principle of not allowing the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction. If the United States permitted North Korea to arm  itself with nuclear weapons, then it would be forced to allow  Iraq and Iran the same right. That is the last thing the  Democrats can allow. In that respect, Democrats do not think in  terms of power politics. There is no room for the Democratic  administration to think nuclear armament is inevitable, so why  not accommodate the country as a new nuclear nation and treat it  accordingly. Nevertheless, it seems difficult to maintain a  policy that nuclear armament should never be allowed while  saying the issue must be settled by diplomacy. As a result, it  is negotiating with North Korea by offering a lot of  compromises, but is determined to impose sanctions if talks  break down. This is U.S. policy.    However, South Korea cannot follow it. As a result of the  fact it has its first civilian government in a long time, there  were antiestablishment, left-wing liberals in the Seoul  administration until a recent reshuffle. Because of them, the  South Korean Government was not able to show determinedly that  it would not tolerate North Korea pushing things too far.  However, there is an extreme sense of crisis among the military  and the conservatives in South Korea because of the  antiestablishment figures in the administration. Their  opposition is so strong that the South Korean Government again  cannot support the U.S. negotiation tactics of offering good  concessions to North Korea. The South Korean Government was  unable to announce the suspension of Team Spirit. It may do so  eventually, but Seoul cannot take any action.    The reason why South Korea does not face criticism, even  though it is doing nothing, is because it keeps saying that  diplomatic talks are underway. For example, at the meeting  between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Kim  Yong-sam, they concluded that diplomatic negotiations would be  continued. As long as they maintain that line there will be no  contradiction. Of course, there are contradictions behind the  scenes. It will be about February when these contradictions  come to the surface.    [GAIKO FORUM] Does the Korean peninsula face a crisis in  February too?    [Okazaki] Here is the reason. There are surveillance  cameras which constantly monitor North Korea's nuclear  facilities. However, the cameras are about to run out of film  and batteries. So the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)  says they have to be changed soon or the status of North Korea's  nuclear weapons development cannot be monitored. The IAEA will,  in the near future, ask the UN Security Council to do something  about the issue. As circumstances stand at the moment, it is  currently constrained. Even if North Korea yields and accepts  inspection of its nuclear sites, the suspicion that North Korea  is developing nuclear arms will not go away. And there will be  allegations that North Korea is buying time and that it is  continuing to develop nuclear weapons. Talk of adopting a  resolution to impose sanctions will once again emerge unless  people are prepared tacitly to allow North Korea to develop  nuclear weapons. It is inevitable. If sanctions are adopted,  which North Korea has been saying it will take as almost a  declaration of war, Pyongyang could take any kind of action.  This is approaching.    However, there is also the possibility of the matter coming  suddenly to a peaceful settlement. The United States is ready  to make concessions until the issue is solved. The problem will  be settled when North Korea is satisfied with the deal. There  is also the possibility that North Korea's nuclear weapons  development is not nearly as advanced as we thought, and that it  has been blocked by technological hurdles. This, then, would  provide a marvelous opportunity for North Korea to strike a  bargain. So there is a chance the situation could improve very  quickly. In either case, February 1994 will be the turning  point. In addition to all this, people also feel the government  of North Korea could collapse at any time.    [GAIKO FORUM] A fearful thought.    [Okazaki] North Korea's reaction to economic sanctions, if  they are imposed, is a fearful thought too. It is especially  frightening to South Korea and Japan. We do not know what North  Korea will do. A missile may be fired or, like the Rangoon  incident, a bomb may be planted somewhere.    [GAIKO FORUM] Will China cooperate in imposing sanctions on  North Korea?    [Okazaki] Yes, I think so. If food and oil to North  Korea are stopped, it cannot exist. However, since China was  North Korea's ally in the Korean war, it cannot strangle North  Korea to death by its own hands. China will cooperate in  enforcing sanctions to a certain degree, but it will not be  possible to rely on that to ruin North Korea. North Korea would  be destroyed if China seriously imposed effective sanctions.    [GAIKO FORUM] The issue of Hong Kong's democratization is  now being given a great deal of attention.    [Okazaki] The return of Hong Kong to China will be in 1997.  There are four more years. Before then the issue of Deng  Xiaoping's successor will emerge. Also, we do not know what  Taiwan and Tibet will do. Taiwan has already applied to join  the United Nations, and that is virtually a declaration of  independence. Moreover, the outside world will start to realize  that Taiwan has become a free democratic country. When Taiwan  is recognized as a democratic nation, the United States will not  be able to neglect it. As it becomes clear the Taiwanese are  taking a different course from Mainland China, people in Hong  Kong will envy them. This issue will come up around 1995.  <H5>  Comparing 19th Century Europe With Asia </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] Lastly, let's take up the issue of historical  vision, which you have been stressing. What do you think is the  most important thing as we look toward the 21st century?    [Okazaki] I wrote an article for a magazine about the  similarities between 19th century Europe and Asia at the moment.    After the Napoleonic war, ethnic nations emerged all at  once.  These countries had been in chaos in the 30 or so years from the  Napoleonic war to the revolution of 1848, but all of them  suddenly started to grow economically from about 1848.    In Asia today, China, for example, became independent around  1950, and it was about the time of the Gang of Four in 1978 that  its economic growth started. Other Asian nations also declared  their independence about 1950, and their growth began from about  the time of the Plaza Accord in 1985. In short, growth is  attributed to the emergence of ethnic countries. Consider the  following. By holding an international exposition, countries  change the entire look of their cities. First in London, then  in Vienna, Chicago, New York, and... the change in Tokyo took  place exactly at the time of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Osaka at  the Osaka Expo 1970, and Seoul at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.  Expos or the Olympics have changed the faces of cities  completely.    I wrote this thesis in the summer of 1993. After that, the  former Beijing Bureau Chief for THE NEW YORK TIMES, Nicholas D.  Kristof, wrote an article in the latest issue of FOREIGN AFFAIRS  [Volume 72, No. 5]. He says the rise of China definitely  changes the balance of power and it is dangerous. In addition,  he says, because China has been subjected to various  humiliations in the past, it is dangerous for such a country to  gain power. In other words, Prussia was humiliated by the  Napoleonic invasion, but it won in the end. He compares  Bismarck to Deng Xiaoping. While Deng Xiaoping is in power it  is all right, but when a person like Wilhelm II takes power, it  is dangerous. In sum, he compares the rise of 19th century  Germany to the current rise of China. This line of thinking is  almost the same as mine.    In my essay, I tried an analogy between the present age and  the 19th century in terms of strategic theory. First, England's  manufacture of the Dreadnought made every existing warship  obsolete. Then Germany, on the rise, tried to catch up with  Britain by making a lot of Dreadnought-class warships. Although  the United States currently places nonproliferation of mass  destruction weapons as its first-priority objective, it does not  have much effect. The high technology of the United States  during the Cold War was always 10 years ahead of that of the  Soviet Union, and at the same time it was preventing the  proliferation of its technology under Cocom [Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] regulations. But no  matter how it controlled the spread of technology, by the 10th  year Soviet technology had always reached the same level of U.S.  technology 10 years before. By the time the Soviet Union caught  up to that level, of course, the United States had further  developed its high technology again, and won the Cold War in the  end. However, the United States has now started to reduce  investments in high technology. Controlling the proliferation  of weapons is not enough, because the technology is only 10  years away for other nations.    So the level of military technology possessed by the United  States and Japan in the Far East at the end of the Cold War--in  other words, technology not so different from that used in the  Gulf war--will be attained by China. And in terms of quantity,  China will have more. What happened at the time of the  Dreadnought will be repeated. So the comparison between 19th  century Europe and modern Asia is significant.    [GAIKO FORUM] Very interesting. But, is there any solution  to this situation?    [Okazaki] There will never be a solution.    [GAIKO FORUM] We have had a valuable opportunity to listen  to you and how, using concrete examples, to analyze information.  Thank you very much.</p>

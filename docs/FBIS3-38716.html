Saglar said Turkey is trying to draw the  attention of the whole world to the savagery of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    (Enest Durakovic), the culture, education, and sports  minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina [name and title as heard], has  arrived in Ankara on an official visit.    In a statement he issued while receiving the guest minister  at the airport, Saglar said the countries championing human  rights and democracy have been displaying indifference in such a  way as to tolerate massacre and have not been taking the  necessary measures. Saglar further noted that tomorrow the two  countries will sign their first cultural protocol as well as  another protocol on Turkey restoring the historic Mostar bridge  and other edifices.    The guest minister, in turn, asked the whole world to take  seriously the necessary measures to stop Serbian aggression and  cruelty. Explaining that in Bosnia-Herzegovina not only are the  people being eradicated but also a cultural heritage was being  wiped out, the Bosnian minister stressed that they are  determined to defend their existence and that Turkey is greatly  assisting them toward this goal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer Arina Sharipova] Recently, news bulletins  have been devoting a great deal of attention to the evacuation  of Russian citizens from Yemen. Quite a few questions on this  topic have arisen and our correspondent Aleksandr Peslyak today  met the high-ranking Russian diplomat [Foreign Ministry  Department director] Viktor Posuvalyuk.    [Peslyak] In the diplomat's view, the evacuation of our  fellow countrymen from Yemen was justified. After all, it was a  matter primarily of the life and security of women and children  and also of some experts whose presence was not vitally  important.    [Begin Posuvalyuk recording] We have already evacuated some  340 people to Moscow. In addition, there are over 60 people in  Djibouti and I believe that some 30-40 people are also under way  from al-Hudaydah to Djibouti. [end recording]    [Peslyak] The diplomat admitted that even though the French,  Germans, and Americans had left in large groups, Russians had  not been evacuated by order.    [Begin Posuvalyuk recording] Now many need to be persuaded  and people are weighing all the pros and cons, are looking  closely at the situation, and making a decision sometimes at the  last moment. [end recording]    [Peslyak] And, for instance, 100 Russian women with children  who are residing permanently in Yemen, did not board the French  navy vessel the day before yesterday. So, people themselves can  choose whether to take the risk staying. Regarding the  situation as a whole, in Posuvalyuk's view, it is not the ethnic  or the religious factor which caused the civil war, but the  alienation of the power structures of the north and south, the  incompatibility of the economies of the two parts of Yemen, the  falling-out of the commands of the two independent armies, and,  as a whole, the building of different models for socio-economic  and political development. Fighting at the point where North and  South Yemen meet has subsided and the diplomat believes the Arab  League could now effectively play a peacemaking role.</p>

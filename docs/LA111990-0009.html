			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BODY TJAK' AT WADSWORTH  </P> <P> Out of the factious, alienated '80s, a longing for community is fueling a  resurgence of tribal art in America. From such small, experimental performing  collectives as San Francisco's Contraband and our own Open Gate Theatre on  through the Hollywood epic "Dances With Wolves," we see the accommodating  extended family presented as a social model.  </P> <P> "Body Tjak" accepts the premise and offers its own paradigm. Seen at the  Wadsworth Theater on Saturday, the project enlists two dozen performers -- half  of them Balinese, half American -- in an attempt at cultural synthesis.  </P> <P> From American percussionist Keith Terry they learned Body Music: methods of  slapping, stamping, clapping and vocalizing common to many world cultures. With  Balinese choreographer I Wayan Dibia they practiced Kecak, an intricate, often  guttural sacred chant increasingly secularized and hybridized in Bali since the  1930s.  </P> <P> As long as "Body Tjak" remained focused on alternating and then combining Body  Music and Kecak, the evening had great mastery to recommend it, along with  rhythmic innovation galore. Besides high-energy displays of interlocking body  percussion, singing and chant, the ensemble made music on newly developed  metallic instruments capable of both Balinese and Western tunings, along with  delicate, soothing bamboo.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the dance component of "Body Tjak" proved nowhere near this  distinguished.  </P> <P> The intense physicality of Body Music makes a dancelike statement in itself,  but became dulled here by the flat-footed boogie processions led by Terry.  Except during the slowest, simplest music, the U.S. contingent evaded the  challenge of dancing to the new Bali-American rhythms. Brief displays of tap,  ballet, juggling and lambada served as an index of possibilities but led  nowhere.  </P> <P> Dibia and the Balinese came closer, borrowing potent movement ideas (most of  them gestural) from their traditional culture. But dance still seemed an  afterthought -- as did the masks, puppets and philosophical baggage of the  production.  </P> <P> Indeed, the giant effigies who bleated in two languages about "new world  transition" ("seek justice, build bridges") brought the whole experience close  to self-parody.  </P> <P> In a lecture after the performance, Terry defended the smug, simplistic  references to war, racism, sexism, religious intolerance and class strife,  saying that these were issues he wanted to address, and citing the moral  commentary in traditional Balinese dance dramas.  </P> <P> Of course, "Body Tjak" never began to address those issues but merely scattered  greeting-card homilies -- while traditional Balinese dance drama belongs to a  continuum of moral art utterly different from Terry and Dibia's diversionary  showpiece.  </P> <P> No, the most profound statement made by "Body Tjak" is the company itself:  pan-cultural, multiracial, full of distinctive individuals yet unified in  style, purpose and spirit. The members are talented, versatile, beautiful in  many different ways -- and we don't need to see them in their unfortunate,  '60s-style tie-dyes to understand the message of their solidarity.  </P></p>

The history of the Arab-Israeli conflict  is nothing if not a tedious roster of acts of violence and  terror by Zionist gangs. This has been the case since British  colonialism implanted Israel on Palestine's soil.    The atrocity is reminiscent of terrorist operations carried  out by Jewish extremists against the Palestinian people since  the beginning of the occupation of the Palestinian homeland and  the establishment of the State of Israel.    Repeated UN resolutions on the partition of Palestine  between  the Arabs and the Israelis and the right of the Palestinian  people to self-determination have been systematically ignored by  Israel. Israel continued its criminal acts against the  Palestinian people, safe in the knowledge that the punishment it  is subjected to after each operation never goes beyond the  rhetoric of denunciation for these operations and a perfunctory  note that it should refrain from such acts in the future.  Israel gains from such acts. It seized miles of Palestinian  land, with the inhabitants forced to flee under pressure by  Zionist gangs.    Zionist operations in Palestine began with the well-known  Dayr Yasin massacre, only to be followed by atrocities in Nasr  al-Din, Bayt al-Khuri, al-Zaytun, and Bayt Dras. Al-Aqsa mosque  was not spared. Monasteries were not immune to attacks by  Israeli gangs. Some of these gangs attacked the Greek Orthodox  monastery in April 1990, occupied it, and converted it into  barracks for Jewish settlers. The number of settlers has been  constantly on the rise, particularly since Israel succeeded in  obtaining $10 billion in loan guarantees from the Bush  administration. The loan was used to help settle the new  immigrants who flocked to Israel from the former Soviet Union  following the collapse of communism, as well as from  poverty-stricken East European countries.    There is no doubt that the thousands who live in the  settlements built by successive Israeli governments represent a  source of continued tension in the occupied Arab territory. It  is in these settlements that acts of aggression carried out by  the armed Jewish settlers against the unarmed native population  are planned. It is from these settlements that these acts are  mounted.    Therefore, we categorically conclude that the massacre at  the  Ibrahimi Mosque against the Palestinian people will not be the  last criminal act carried out by the settlers. This is because  the settlers knew beforehand that reaction to their aggression  would not exceed a strongly or even mildly worded resolution or  statement, words that will have no perceptible mark on the  political or economic life of Israeli citizens or governments.  As long as the international community fails to assume its  required duty vis a vis this steady stream of aggression, such  attacks will persist.    We must say that the timing of this ugly crime cannot be  lightly taken. Muslim worshipers were mowed down as they stood  in piety before God. The fasting martyrs did not have stones in  their hands for Israel to use as a pretext for carrying out its  aggression. Most were elderly people who simply showed up for  prayers at the prescribed time and place.    Israel's masks have fallen. Its unconvincing pretexts, which  it routinely cites following every aggression against innocent  Palestinians, have been invalidated. This time, the attacked  Palestinians were not engaged in resistance against the  occupation or pelting Israeli armored vehicles with stones.    Yes, all the masks have fallen. International public opinion  can now see that it has been deluded into thinking that Israel  was serious in seeking peaceful coexistence with the Arabs and  earnest in wanting to make lasting peace with the Arabs, while  all that time it was the Arabs who scrambled for peace and  strove long and hard for its realization.    Despite the ugliness of the crime committed by the Israeli  settlers against innocent Palestinians, we cannot absolve  ourselves of responsibility for the atrocity. The absence of  honest and serious Arab coordination was the crack in the Arab  wall, through which Israel and others advanced their most odious  schemes and got away with plots to destroy the Arab (?identity)  and even the very faith of Islam. Serious and collective action  is indispensable to confront these schemes that are now laid  bare, shorn of their last bit of modesty.</p>

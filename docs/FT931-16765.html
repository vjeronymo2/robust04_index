			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / People: Sir Brian Unwin customised for EIB The man who made his mark renegotiating the UK's contribution to the EC budget under Margaret Thatcher in the mid-1980s has just been given a job at the heart of the Community's financial establishment. Sir Brian Unwin, the 57-year old chairman of HM Customs &amp; Excise, is to become president of the European Investment Bank at the beginning of April, making him the first Briton to hold the position and the fifth president in the bank's 35-year history. His arrival comes at an intriguing time. The EIB, which last year lent more than Ecu15bn - making it a bigger lender even than the World Bank, and the biggest borrower on the international capital markets - has been handed a central role in the EC growth package agreed at last month's Edinburgh summit of Community leaders. His 17 years at the UK Treasury up to 1985, including the agreement reached at Fontainebleau on the UK budget contribution, would seem to make Sir Brian better suited to restraining ambitious EC financing plans, rather than promoting them. Speaking from his office in London yesterday, though, he appeared an enthusiastic supporter of the Edinburgh agreement. The Ecu5bn of extra financing over the next three years, and the establishment of a new European Investment Fund, was a 'very significant package' which would greatly advance the sort of infrastructure investment in which the EIB specialises, he said. Sir Brian points to extensive experience in EC-related negotiations to fend off any suggestions that he is ill-suited to handling pressure from politicians in Brussels. This includes leading the UK's negotiators on the harmonisation of EC banking law in the mid-1970s, and serving as the senior UK director on the EIB's board for three years in the mid-1980s. As chairman of Customs &amp; Excise in the run up to the EC's single market, he has also had to oversee what he calls 'a vast administrative upheaval'.</p>

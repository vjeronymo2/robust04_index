			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (7): The 'other' Merseyside - Wirral, Sefton, St Helens and Knowsley feel unfairly treated LIVERPOOL IS only 30 per cent of Merseyside. This is the city's share of county-wide costs for such services as policing and waste disposal. Wirral, with nearly a quarter of Merseyside's population, pays 23 per cent, with Sefton, Knowsley and St Helens sharing the rest. It is easy to see, therefore, why the four other Merseyside boroughs often feel unfairly sullied by Liverpool's problems. They have nearly 1m of Merseyside's 1.4m residents, yet Liverpool hogs the headlines and gives them all a bad name. Sensitivities show in postal addresses. Many in Wirral - including some prominent people responsible for promoting Merseyside - already describe themselves on their private notepaper as living in Cheshire, and more will do so soon when the government officially allows people to use ancient county names and boundaries in addresses. Sefton, comprising Bootle, Crosby, Formby and Southport, never uses the name of the Liverpool postal district in the addresses of council offices, even though it is an official part of many of them. For anyone writing to the council, 'Bootle 20' will find most of offices, when the postcode should really be 'L20'. Moreover, council headquarters in Southport are officially in the 'PR', for Preston, postcode district, although many locals would rather be in Lancashire. A yearning for its old Lancashire roots is also apparent in St Helens, although the borough escapes the Liverpool postcode stigma by being in the 'WA', for Warrington, postal area. Pilkington, the world's largest glassmaker, avoids the image problems of Liverpool by driving most of its visitors to St Helens from Warrington or Runcorn inter-city railway stations or Manchester airport, both routes being mainly green countryside all the way. Companies in Knowsley, which houses a third of Merseyside's manufacturing industry, can do similarly. Wirral is also easily and directly accessible from Runcorn, Chester or Manchester airport. Even Liverpool's working docks are now entirely in Sefton; the M57 and M58 motorways enable access from the national network without crossing Liverpool's boundary at all. The problem for the four other Merseyside boroughs, however, is that although many of their residents would rather not live with Liverpool, they cannot live without the place. It is the regional capital, offering rich cultural and recreational diversity, and it is still an important centre for financial and professional services. Generally, they wish Liverpool could still be looked up to so it could act as Merseyside's leader without embarrassing anyone. No matter Liverpool's progress and present stability, people get fed up of having to explain its past and present problems away, or its litter, or the structure of Merseyside, or that 'it's a very nice place to live, really'. More than 30,000 people from Wirral cross the river each day to work in Liverpool - approaching a fifth of the peninsula's workforce. 'Home' for many of them, however, is in the small Deeside towns of Heswall, Neston, Caldy, West Kirby and Hoylake, facing the Welsh hills or Liverpool Bay. Many other 'Liverpool' professional and white-collar workers live in Sefton, in the pleasant, middle-class Conservative constituencies of Crosby and Southport. If they live in St Helens, it will probably be in Rainford. None of the four outer Merseyside boroughs has a self-contained economy, although St Helens and Wirral probably come closest to not needing Liverpool. This, however, has not stopped them all taking steps to avoid being blighted by the troubled image created by Liverpool in the 1980s. Politically, they are all stable - Knowsley and St Helens because they are solidly in moderate Labour hands, and Sefton and Wirral because they have three-way hung councils where consensus has to be achieved. Wirral went through a period of left-wing Labour control, but the council's leader came unstuck when she led a campaign against paying the poll tax and was dumped by an angry electorate in the 1991 local government elections. The Conservatives came within an ace of taking overall control this year and consensus politics now rule. Whether there will ever be a Merseyside consensus, however, is another matter. Wirral, for example, is very wary of joint marketing to attract inward investment, preferring to compete in its own right. 'We have all the advantages of being an island without the disadvantages,' Mr Alan White, the chief executive, points out. 'We are midway between Liverpool and Chester and have more golf courses than any comparable borough.' The private sector - dominated by Vauxhall, Unilever and Shell - influences the council greatly and a partnership called the Wirral Investment Network has been formed with Baroness Chalker of Wallasey as its president. Wirral's private sector appears wary of doing much for Merseyside when this might detract from the obvious selling points of Wirral's proximity to Cheshire and sharing the same pleasant look of that shire county in most respects. When the council asked its partners what was its most important job, the answer was street cleaning, so as to foster a good image. Clean streets reinforce Wirral's generally pleasant appearance - a stark contrast to Liverpool, where no route out of the city does not pass through a depressing swathe of dereliction or run-down, urban tattiness. The customer-orientation implied by this response was not lost on Wirral councillors and their officers, who have made cleaner streets a priority. They also get business leaders to present Wirral's case to potential investors. 'We're paid to say the place is good, they're not, and so are more likely to be believed,' Mr White says. The borough is also working hard on its European links to maximise the benefits of the single market. There are a high profile 'EuroWirral' campaigns at local level and in Brussels itself, again with the private sector to the fore. Knowsley, meanwhile, is also being pragmatic on industrial development. The borough contains the infamous 1950s outer estate of Kirkby and has desperate unemployment problems. Mr Jim Keight, the council leader, is a retired compositor from the Liverpool Echo. He puts the need for jobs first, and readily eased the arrival in Knowsley of News International's Pounds 200m northern printing works, in spite of his own union's anger over Wapping. Local private sector confidence has manifested itself in other ways, such as IMI Yorkshire Imperial Metals spending Pounds 10m modernising its Knowsley factory and BICC investing in new plant. There was also a 49 per cent increase in VAT registration in Knowsley between 1979 and 1989, the largest locally and well ahead of the 15 per cent rise achieved by Merseyside as a whole. It is against this background that a Merseyside Partnership of all local authorities and the private sector is struggling for life. Wirral, the second biggest block in Merseyside's structure, probably holds the key, but it is difficult to find much enthusiasm there. What will probably happen is that Wirral will join, but will not put much effort in and very little money. The 'other' Merseyside has its own song to sing and appears to be doing it rather well.</p>

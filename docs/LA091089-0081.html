			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. BACKS BALTICS' EFFORTS, QUAYLE SAYS  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle said Saturday that the United States supports the  nationalist independence movements in the Soviet Union and suggested Washington  may react if Moscow tries to block them.  </P> <P> "Let's hope that the Baltic states continue in the direction they want to go .  . . toward asserting their independence," Quayle said on Cable News Network's  "Evans and Novak" program.  </P> <P> Asked whether Washington would respond if the Soviet Union refused to grant  independence to the Baltic republics of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, Quayle  said it might.  </P> <P> "Well, clearly every event triggers a response," he said. "And if there's a  negative event toward the Baltic states, I would imagine there would be a  negative response."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yevgeniy Skukin: "Red Carnation for Gaydar"] </F>   [Excerpts] The State Duma yesterday adopted a federal law  whose importance is truly hard to exaggerate -- "On the  Procedure for the Publication and Coming into Force of Federal  Constitutional Laws, Federal Laws, and Acts of the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly Chambers." Henceforth, under  Article 5 of this law, the publication of federal constitutional  laws, federal laws, and acts of the Russian Federation Federal  Assembly chambers in VEDOMOSTI FEDERALNOGO SOBRANIYA ROSSIYSKOY  FEDERATSII [Records of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly]  and ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will be official.    The State Duma rapidly adopted a decree on the complex and  largely deadlocked issue of a political settlement of  differences with the organs of power of Chechnya. [passage  omitted]    Sergey Shakhray, Russian Federation Government minister for  nationalities affairs and regional policy, refuted the claim  that Russia, despite everything, is feeding and will continue to  feed Chechnya. No money was sent there in 1993, nor will any  money be sent this year until there is a complete political  settlement.    There was a very unusual episode at the very beginning of  Friday's session. Vyacheslav Marychev, a Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia deputy known for his activeness, handed the  chairman a red carnation for presentation to the man celebrating  his saint's day -- Yegor Gaydar.</p>

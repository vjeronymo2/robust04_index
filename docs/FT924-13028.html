			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Redland sells remaining stake in plasterboard venture REDLAND, one of Britain's biggest building materials companies, is proceeding with plans to sell to Lafarge Coppee of France its remaining 20 per cent stake in their loss-making UK plasterboard joint venture. The joint venture, which made a Pounds 20m loss last year, was formed in August 1990 after Redland's original partner, CSR of Australia, sold its share to Lafarge. Under the terms of the deal Redland has the right to request Lafarge to buy its remaining 20 per cent stake by December 1, this year. The British group, which earlier this year announced it would exercise the option, is expected to raise Pounds 40m from the sale.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / International Company News: Intel buoyed by exceptionally strong first term INTEL yesterday consolidated its position as the world's leading computer chip maker with exceptionally strong first-quarter earnings and revenues on the back of brisk sales of PCs using its microprocessors. The unexpectedly robust results, and the company's bullish forecast for the second quarter, lifted shares across the semiconductor manufacturing sector in mid-session trading. Intel firmed Dollars 4 to Dollars 117, Motorola climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to a 52-week high of Dollars 70 1/8 and Advanced Micro Devices hit a year-high of Dollars 25 5/8 , up Dollars  5/8 . For the three months to March 27, Intel posted net profits of Dollars 547.9m, or Dollars 2.48 a share, on revenues of Dollars 2.02bn. This compares with earnings of Dollars 184.1m, or 86 cents, on revenues of Dollars 1.24bn a year earlier. Wall Street had expected Intel to report earnings of about Dollars 2.13 a share, and few analysts had expected per-share earnings to exceed Dollars 2.40. Mr Andrew Grove, chief executive, said: 'It took us 22 years to get to the Dollars 1bn a quarter in revenues and, thanks to the explosion in demand for the Intel 486 chip, less than three years to get to Dollars 2bn a quarter.' Intel is the leading supplier of microprocessor chips which form the brains of more than 70 per cent of the world's PCs. Mr Grove said computers using Intel's 486 microprocessors have become the preferred solution for a wide range of computer tasks. 'Fortunately we have been investing heavily in new plant and equipment, so we have been able to respond quickly to this rapid growth in demand.' The company recently unveiled plans to add a Dollars 1bn expansion to its New Mexico plant. Intel said its record first-quarter bookings 'indicate a positive outlook, with favourable produce mix and potential for revenue growth in the second quarter'.</p>

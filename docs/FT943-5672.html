			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hartstone directors lift collective stake Four Hartstone directors have increased their collective stake in the hosiery and leathergoods group by more than seven times following the Pounds 30m rescue rights issue. The company announced yesterday that the four directors, including Mr Shaun Dowling, chairman, had increased their holding from 71,133 to 595,000 shares. The directors both took up their entitlements through the 2-for-1 rights at 15p and bought shares in the market at 15p and 14 1/2 p. The largest shareholder on the board is Mr Dowling, who now holds 500,000 shares, compared with 50,000 before the cash call. He took up 100,000 new shares in the rights, and purchased a further 350,000 at 15p in his role as sub-underwriter. The other directors who increased their stakes are Mr John Hunter, chief executive, with 40,000 shares (10,000), Mr Stephen Oakley, finance director, with 30,000 (6,000) and Mr John Padovan with 25,000 (5,133). At Hartstone's annual meeting yesterday, Mr Dowling warned that the US leathergoods business was suffering from lower demand and the planned cutbacks under the restructuring. Sales were at lower levels than last year, he said. Hartstone was confident trading would pick up in the second half, however. The Spanish hosiery business, which may be sold at some stage in the future, was performing satisfactorily, he added.</p>

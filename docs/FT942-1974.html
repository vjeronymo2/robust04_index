			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: Danish trade surplus declines Denmark's first quarter current account balance of payments surplus declined to Dkr7.2bn (Pounds 700m) from Dkr8.39bn in the same period last year, according to a preliminary estimate by the official statistical office. The decline reflected the fact that imports are rising faster than exports for the first time for several years, under the influence of a strong economic recovery this year. Merchandise exports rose by 5.0 per cent to Dkr61.5bn and imports by 7.6 per cent to Dkr50.4bn. The total surplus on trade in goods and services declined by Dkr1.5bn to Dkr12.6bn. Over the past four quarters the current account surplus increased by Dkr4.6bn to Dkr34.8bn, which is about 3.5 per cent of GDP. Inflation in Italy looks set to fall for the first time in 25 years below an annualised 4 per cent. According to the national statistics office, Istat, June inflation in a sample of nine cities was running at 0.2-0.3 per cent, giving an annualised 3.7 to 3.8 per cent. The inflation figures for the big cities have tended to be an accurate reflection of monthly figures. French consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent in May, to give a year-on-year rise of 1.7 per cent, the national statistics institute, Insee, said.</p>

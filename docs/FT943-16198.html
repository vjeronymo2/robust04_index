			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Morocco plans to extend scope of privatisation Morocco is planning to extend its privatisation programme to include sectors such as power generation which until now have been considered out of bounds for the private sector. Mr Abdellatif Filali, prime minister, emphasised the need to reduce the state's role when meeting business leaders in Casablanca yesterday, in his first major economic policy statement since he was appointed a month ago. Earlier, he told foreign journalists that privatisation was 'an absolute necessity'. Morocco needed to develop foreign and domestic investment to combat a 15-16 per cent unemployment rate. The government would do 'the maximum' to help the country's private sector and cut red tape. It would seek safeguards to prevent a loss of control over 'strategic' activities such as banking; in certain cases the state might keep majority shareholdings. But Mr Jettou Driss, commerce and industry minister, said: 'Nothing is excluded. There are no taboos'. Morocco has so far sold control of 22 companies to foreign and domestic investors under an initial programme covering 75 companies and 37 hotels to be privatised by the end of next year. These include Societe Nationale d'Investissement, a state holding company with interests ranging from brewing to banking. The programme is expected to bring in some Dirham 17bn (Pounds 1.2bn). Sectors excluded so far from the programme, such as public utilities, the Samir oil refining company, and Office Cherifien des Phosphate, the phosphate company, will now be considered for privatisation. 'It is possible to associate the private sector with everything,' Mr Driss added. Plans include giving private companies responsibility for future electricity plants and possibly selling off some existing power stations. Distribution of electricity would remain in state hands although possibly with minority private-sector shareholdings.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, contrary to Krupp's contentions, the final LTFV determination margin is no more representative of the period under review than is the preliminary margin. Both of these margins are based upon information which relates to a period prior to the period of review. Indeed, in this instance because Krupp failed to respond to the Department's information request, it has not demonstrated that the final determination rate is any more probative of the period under review than the preliminary rate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Rhone Poulenc <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 899 F. Supp. at 1190. As such, there is no record evidence to show that one is more or less probative than the other as to what the actual dumping margins would be for the period of review. This then is the reason for undertaking an administrative review, i.e., to analyze information concerning the actual entries for the review period so that any duties that might be assessed on those entries would have been based on the actual data relating to those entries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, when the administrative review process is thwarted, as it has been in this case by Krupp's failure to provide information about the entries subject to review, then the Department is forced to rely upon the best information available. Under these circumstances the court has clearly ruled that ``Commerce may exercise discretion in determining what is the best information available when a [respondent] has failed to supply requested information.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tai Yang Metal Industrial Co.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 712 F.

Further, when the respondent fails to provide the requested information, the use of BIA ``can be detrimental to [respondent's] interests.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Daewoo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 712, F. Supp. at 944. Thus, because of Krupp's failure to comply with the Department's information request, it should not find itself in a better position as a result of noncompliance than it would had it provided the Department with complete, accurate, and timely data.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Canadian Paving Parts <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 56 FR at 47453. ``Otherwise, alleged unfair traders would be able to control the amount of antidumping duties by selectively providing the ITA with information.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Olympic Adhesives, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 899 F. 2d 1565, 1572 (CIT 1990).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Accord, Pistachio Group of Ass'n of Food Industries  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 671 F. Supp. 31, 40 (CIT 1987). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Krupp's speculations as to what the Court might have done in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Krupp I  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> had it been able to divine the particular circumstance of this review are also misplaced. In fact, there is nothing in the Court's opinion even to suggest that it would have considered Krupp's challenge to the preliminary determination ripe for review if it had known that margin would be used as a BIA margin in the first administrative review because of Krupp's failure to comply with the Department's information request. To the contrary, after reviewing the facts surrounding the preliminary determination, the Court found that ``the deposit of estimated duties will not cause a hardship of the type which justifies judicial intrusion into an ongoing administrative investigation.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Krupp I <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 553 F. Supp. at 396. Indeed, the Court saw the deposit of estimated duties as being ``the normal consequences of involvement in these investigations.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reason the Court found no hardship to Krupp is that the preliminary margin is simply an estimate of the potential duties owed_it does not represent an assessment rate for purposes of liquidation. Under the statutory scheme, all of Krupp's entries subsequent to the date of the preliminary LTFV determination would only be liquidated at a rate determined on the basis of an administrative review of those entries. If that assessment rate were determined to be higher than the preliminary LTFV rate, Krupp would not be required to pay the difference.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Thus, any so-called ``hardship'' that purportedly has befallen Krupp is of its own making by virtue of its failure to comply with the Department's information request, thereby resulting in the assigning of an adverse BIA rate for the entries subject to review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 6:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Petitioner recites the history of this litigation highlighting that, in its Motion for Summary Judgment, Krupp asked the Court, among other alternative prayers for relief, to enjoin liquidation of the December 1982 through May 1983 entries while directing the Department to conduct an administrative review of those entries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHLAND PARK FARMERS' MARKET PLAN UNVEILED  </P> <P> A plan to open a city-sponsored farmers' market in Highland Park was unveiled  by Los Angeles officials Tuesday night.  </P> <P> The plan by Councilman Richard Alatorre would create the first farmers' market  subsidized by the city of Los Angeles. It would operate with city funds for a  year as a pilot for city-sponsored markets in other areas of the city.  </P> <P> Alatorre said the market is intended to bring the diverse Highland Park  community together by providing a safe and friendly atmosphere in which to buy  fresh produce and meet people.  </P> <P> There are three open-air markets in the city where farmers sell their wares  directly to consumers, but all were started and are run by private nonprofit  groups. At least six other cities in Los Angeles County subsidize farmers'  markets.  </P> <P> Alatorre's plan is supported by the city Department of Recreation and Parks and  by Mayor Tom Bradley. Recreation and Parks Department officials at Tuesday's  meeting said they have tentatively agreed to allot $25,000 to start and run the  market in its first year. As proposed, the farmer's market would eventually be  run by a nonprofit community group.  </P> <P> The plan is subject to the approval of the Board of Recreation and Parks  Commissioners and the City Council. It is expected to be considered by the  parks board within a month.  </P> <P> Most of about 40 residents who attended Tuesday's meeting at the Highland Park  Senior Center applauded the idea, but some said they were concerned that the  market would increase traffic, noise and trash.  </P> <P> "I think it's nice to have a market, but I don't think it's nice to have it in  my back yard, which is where it's going to be," said Alice Agllman, a Highland  Park resident whose home borders Arroyo Seco Park. "It's going to cause a big  mess, that's for sure."  </P> <P> The president of an association of homeowners who live near the proposed market  site said at the meeting that he will oppose the market proposal. Alatorre said  he will attend next week's meeting of the group -- the Hayes Avenue, Echo  Street and Arroyo Glen Neighborhood Assn. -- to push the idea.  </P> <P> But Alatorre's proposal has the support of the Highland Park Neighborhood  Assn., the largest and most vocal homeowner's group in the Highland Park area.  Association President Diana Barnwell said at the meeting that she supports the  idea and will ask association members to help with the market in any way they  can.  </P> <P> The market would be at Arroyo Seco Park and Avenue 60 and would be open for  three to five hours one day each weekend. Farmers selling their produce at the  market would have to be have certificates from state inspectors.  </P> <P> Farmers at the 23 other markets operating in Los Angeles County pay a fee to  participate in the markets -- usually 5% of their revenue. Alatorre said his  staff estimates that there are about 160 parking spaces next to the Highland  Park site.  </P> <P> A city-paid part-time manager would recruit farmers and promote the market. The  cost is estimated at $14,200 a year after a start-up cost of $11,000. Alatorre  said the market is expected to be self-sustaining by the second year.  </P> <P> The idea was a project last fall of an intern in Alatorre's office. But  Recreation and Parks Department officials have been working independently on  such an idea for more than two years.  </P> <P> "When Councilman Alatorre called me, I said, 'Wait, I've heard that idea  before,' "said Ronald Kraus, senior management analyst for the Department of  Recreation and Parks. "I think it was just a case where the ideas coalesced."  </P></p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Results Season: Reuters dividend likely to be beacon in a dark season REUTERS' near 25 per cent increase in its 1992 dividend, announced on Tuesday, is likely to be a beacon in an otherwise dark season. Little change is expected for 1992 payments across the market. Some analysts are forecasting a small fall, especially outside the utilities and blue chip companies. The drag factors are obvious: a small minority of companies are expected to cut their final dividends and a rather larger number will maintain, in some cases for the third year running. To offset these dampeners, there is likely to be only a smattering of 10 per cent-plus increases. Some of the likely cutters marked themselves out at the interim stage. British Aerospace had to reshuffle its reserves to enable it to pay a much reduced interim dividend late. Rolls-Royce, on the other hand, held its interim, but doubts have surfaced about the final. After twice holding it at 7.25p - once uncovered - the prospect of brazening out a lack of cover for three years altogether may sway the argument for a cut. The doubts are reflected in a historic yield of nearly 8 per cent, almost double the market rate. Among the maintainers, ICI seems to be heading for a hat-trick of three years at the same level. Once it splits in two, the more immediate hopes for growth focus on Zeneca, the pharmaceutical spin-off. A profile of prolonged flat dividends is also presented by the motor components groups GKN and T&amp;N. The latter's vulnerability in a second year of inadequate cover is suggested by an 8 per cent yield. However, both returned to profits growth in the first half of the year. GKN is a good example of the industrial groups which have improved cash flow and reduced gearing, and so can justify holding dividends even when earnings cover is a problem. On the brighter side, Lloyds Bank is expected to announce a 10 per cent dividend increase tomorrow but its gesture would make far fewer waves than a cut from bad-debt-ridden Barclays. Its dividend prospects have been the subject of considerable debate. Among the insurers, Commercial Union's 3 per cent dividend increase yesterday, alongside its Pounds 428m rights issue, may well be the best of the big five composites. Royal, which passed its final last time and slashed the 1992 interim, is forecast to make the annual total up to 5p. Losses on domestic mortgage indemnity policies have hit its ability to pay more. Looking ahead, dividend growth is forecast to resume this year, although recovering at a slower pace than earnings. A couple of years of modest dividend rises - say 4-5 per cent in line with inflation - should enable companies to rebuild dividend cover, which has fallen below 1.8 times. Analysts are questioning the need to restore cover to historic levels of 2.5 times or more because of lower inflation and the downward pressure exerted on the average by privatised utilities. A lower target would bring forward the point at which real dividend growth can resume. As long as prospects are sluggish, the attractiveness of equities diminishes compared with gilts.</p>

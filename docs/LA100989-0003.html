			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE  </P> <P> We just crammed the new linens and Mac along with the shoe boxes of early life  mementoes into the Cadillac and drove our third -- and last -- child to  college. We can set up a dorm room like professionals by now, and have learned  how to dash off frequent, neutral, comforting letters.  </P> <P> Our current 18 year old leaves home even better prepared and more mature than  her brother and sister four and two years ago.  </P> <P> But her parents fixated at the stage of having teen-agers around. Despite our  anticipated pleasurable ignorance of the hours she will keep and the diet  she'll choose, we dreaded the goodby. Although we will be free to have fish and  eggplant, foods she hates, for dinner every night, we will miss her.  </P> <P> The laundry bin will stand empty; the phone won't ring. Our excitement about  the professors and peers who will make her think and grow cannot match our  selfish need for her to need us.  </P> <P> We take the kids to college and they're fine. We only keep the children who  they were and meet the people they will be when they visit for Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> BARBARA C. MARSHALL  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

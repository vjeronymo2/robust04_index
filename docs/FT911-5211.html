			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / World Trade News: Chile makes US free trade pact a top priority - Few practical obstacles stand in the way, but early success could prove elusive CHILE is worried that its chances of reaching a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US may be scuppered if Mexico's trade negotiations with its northern neighbour get bogged down over labour and environmental issues. Reaching an FTA with its biggest trading partner has become Chile's foreign policy priority. Santiago has even snubbed the overtures of Brazil and Argentina to form a regional common market in order to concentrate on its partnership with the US. But after the euphoria that greeted President George Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative last June, a new mood of realism has begun to take hold in Santiago. US officials are asking Chileans to be patient. If Congress grants President Bush an extension of fast-track authority for trade agreements, Mrs Carla Hills' small team of trade negotiators will be overstretched in just trying to conclude the stalled Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and launching the Mexican negotiations. Mr Bush also included his Americas Initiative within the fast-track petition, but his aim to create a free trade area from Alaska to the Antarctic remains a distant priority. There are those within the State Department, however, who do not want to see the Americas Initiative lost to the realm of good intentions. 'The concept of free trade needs successes,' said one western diplomat in Santiago, 'and the US must begin with countries like Chile, which are ready for it.' There would be surprisingly few obstacles in the path of a US-Chilean FTA. Their economies are complementary - Chilean fruit, for instance, does not compete with US produce as it is exported during the northern hemisphere's winter months. Chile already operates the most open foreign investment regime in Latin America and it recently passed a law to protect intellectual property rights to appease US pharmaceutical companies. The greatest beneficiaries of an FTA in the US would be mining equipment companies, which would gain a competitive edge over their European and Japanese rivals in the race to supply almost 100 major mining projects being developed in Chile. Contracts for equipment could run into several hundred million dollars over the next four years. Chile hopes that an FTA would accelerate its export-driven growth. Two-way trade last year reached Dollars 2.84bn - 18 per cent of Chile's foreign commerce. And even though Chile recognises that it is only a tiny market for US goods, it is playing strongly on the Bush administration's need to have a success in the region. 'Without a free trade accord with Chile, Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative is dead,' one Chilean official commented. Within Chile, there is strong support for an FTA with the US. The American Chamber of Commerce in Santiago has set up a task force with the Confederation of Chilean Industry to co-ordinate the push for free trade. They are getting advice from Mexican businessmen who have been lobbying Washington. Mr Danilo Lacallo, president of Esso-Chile, will be travelling to Washington next month on behalf of the American Chamber of Commerce to set the ball rolling. 'It is all a question of timing,' he says. 'We have to target congressmen and employ professional lobbyists. But we also have to be cautious. If we start pushing too soon, we may create antibodies against a deal with Chile.' At the official level, Chilean and US trade negotiators will meet twice this year, in May and in November, for consultations on which trade barriers ought to be tackled and which special interest groups mollified. This forms part of a framework agreement on free trade which was signed by Mr Alejandro Foxley, Chile's finance minister, and Mrs Hills, the US trade representative, last October. US officials believe that the outlines of an FTA could be ready by the end of this year. Chilean officials know that they must then bide their time and pray for the Mexican negotiations to be successful. But if stumbling blocks arise there, they hope that Washington will open up an avenue to allow trade talks with Chile to be conducted simultaneously.</p>

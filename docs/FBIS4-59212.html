			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu by Bina </F> Barzel; place and date not given -- first three paragraphs are  introduction]    [Text] It has been more than a year since Likud leader  Binyamin Netanyahu argued that "a senior Likud member" headed  the "mafia" that wiretapped his calls and tailed him. The media  claimed he was referring to David Levi, and Bibi did not deny  it. At that time, Levi decided not to cooperate with the man  who leveled such accusations at him and his colleagues. Since  then, Levi has hardly set foot in the Likud headquarters at  Metzudat Ze'ev, and he conducts his political activities from an  office on Balfour Street in Tel Aviv. Levi was active in the  municipal elections, in which many of his followers (heads of  local councils and mayors) ran, but has stayed out of events and  consultations conducted by Netanyahu or Moshe Qatzav.    In a surprising and one-sided move, Netanyahu apologizes  here  to David Levi for the distress inflicted on him. He calls on  Levi to cooperate with him and to patch things up: "I appeal to  David Levi. If I hurt him, I am sorry about it."    Netanyahu's new initiative should be seen in the broad  context of recurrent secret efforts to renew their dialogue.  These efforts were conducted by former Knesset Member [MK]  Re'uven Rivlin, Levi's confidant, and by his brother, Maxim  Levi. All these efforts have so far proved fruitless.    [Barzel] What is your attitude toward David Levi's prolonged  boycott? Do you not think it is time the two of you made up?  The animosity between you is so obvious, that not too long ago  MK Hayim Ramon even had the audacity to propose to Levi to head  his list in the elections to the Histadrut labor federation.    [Netanyahu] In view of the big national challenges ahead of  us, the Likud and all the other parties in the national camp  should rise above personal disputes and rivalries. I would like  to seize this opportunity to call on David Levi to set aside  past squabbles. If I hurt him, I am sorry about it. Many people  look up to us and expect us to close ranks in these difficulties  times. We must act together for the success of the Likud, which  is so vital to the future of the country.    [Barzel] Why the sudden urge? Was not a whole year wasted,  during which the resentment increased?    [Netanyahu] People have their own personal resentments, but  it seems to me that Israel has never before experienced such a  period of deterioration in personal safety and confidence in the  future of the country as that brought about by the government's  failed policies. This is why I arrived at the clear conclusion  that this is a fateful hour which calls for special efforts to  achieve unity. All personal considerations must be tossed aside,  and everything possible must be done to close the ranks of the  national camp.    [Barzel] How can such an appeal help? What do you expect  Levi to do? Kiss and make up?    [Netanyahu] This is not my first appeal. I took similar  initiatives in the past, away from the public's eye. I hope  this appeal will elicit a positive response.    [Barzel] All the key positions in the Likud institutions  have been filled. If Levi heeds your call, how do you envision  his role in the leadership?    [Netanyahu] Some senior Likud members hold jobs, while  others, such as Beni Begin, chose not to run for any official  positions but are very well integrated in the Likud's work,  consultations, and decisionmaking on central issues. There is a  broad range for cooperation and teamwork for anybody who so  wishes.    [Barzel] Refa'el Eytan proposed to set up a shadow  government. Were you to set up such a government, what job  would you offer Levi?    [Netanyahu] To the best of my knowledge, the shadow  government system exists only in Britain, where there is a big  party in the opposition and there is no coalition. I am not  sure that the idea can be applied in Israel or that there can be  a shadow government that includes all the opposition factions.  It might lead to more divisiveness than unity.    On the other hand, I am very much in favor of getting the  opposition used to teamwork and cooperation. Indeed, this is  what we have been doing over the past few months, not entirely  unsuccessfully, as proved by our joint position opposing the  government's policies and the removal of the Jewish settlement  from Hebron.    It goes without saying that I would not presume to determine  now the exact composition of the next government, but there is  no doubt that David Levi would have a dignified and central role  in it.    [Barzel] Have you met with him this past year?    [Netanyahu] We have not had any talks worth mentioning.    [Barzel] Does the recent appointment of Maxim Levi indicate  that your mutual confidence has been restored?    [Netanyahu] I will not go into an analysis of relations  among Likud members. As far as I am concerned, I will cooperate  with whoever wishes to do so.    [Barzel] Do you enjoy the cooperation of members of Levi's  camp?    [Netanyahu] I work with all Likud members. We have come a  long way from the critical situation in the Likud a year ago: a  shattered movement on the brink of bankruptcy, without any  institutions. We have fundamentally changed this situation. In  less than a year, we set up all the institutions that had not  existed in the previous 15 years. We enacted a constitution and  appointed a tribunal. We pulled the Likud out of its financial  crisis, and in recent months, we began activating thousands of  members.    Fortunately, I enjoy the cooperation of all flanks of the  Likud. This is mainly because of the field activists' eagerness  to work and take part in the activities needed to curb the  policies of this government and to replace it as soon as  possible. This, of course, is not reflected in the media, which  tries to highlight the divisions and rivalries.    For example, there were reports about a mass walkout from  the  Likud's ranks. Let me tell you that the Likud is the largest  party in the country today. At the end of last year, after we  raised membership fees, no more than 19 percent dropped out, and  we now have 180,000 paying members. In most parties, the  typical drop-out rate after primaries is over 50 percent.    We built the organizational and financial tools to  demonstrate this strength in the upcoming struggles and in the  next Knesset elections.    [Barzel] Does the message about the need for unity also  apply to Ari'el Sharon? He talks about the need for a  collective leadership.    [Netanyahu] Sharon can make quite a considerable  contribution to the Likud's success if he so wishes. I do not  understand what the term "collective leadership" means. If it  means team work, then let me tell you that I regularly summon  the Likud's institutions and senior members in order to make  decisions. However, I was chosen by thousands of Likud members  to lead this team, and that is how I work. The door is wide  open to anybody who wishes to join in or make a contribution.    Furthermore, the negative focus on the Likud is rather  surprising for two reasons: First, because the Likud is clearly  undergoing a speedy recovery and is growing stronger. This  process is corroborated by all public opinion polls, and the  government is very well aware of it.    Second, because divisions and rivalries -- which I do not  ignore -- are not exactly the exclusive domain of the Likud.  There is hardly any party in Israel that is not afflicted by  disputes and rivalries. What is happening today in the Likud  pales compared to the rivalry in the Labor movement, which  ultimately led to a rift.    [Barzel] Do you think the pullout from Gaza, which many  right-wing people support, and the contacts with Syria will  reawaken in the public the euphoria caused by the signing of the  Oslo agreement?    [Netanyahu] The euphoria of Oslo will not recur. The  government is using the withdrawal from Gaza, which is supported  by most Israelis, as a smoke screen for a withdrawal from all  parts of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza and the ensuing return to the  1967 borders. The people already realize whom they are dealing  with. The Arabs have not abandoned their ambitions, and they  take advantage of every retreat on the part of the government to  fulfill their goals: pursuing terror in the short run, and  bringing about Israel's annihilation in the long run.    [Barzel] Would you pull out of Gaza?    [Netanyahu] As prime minister, I would definitely be  prepared to consider a redeployment of the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] in Gaza and its vicinity. However, there is no way I  would forgo the IDF's right to enter any place, including Gaza,  in the course of a hot pursuit, to cite just one example.    But Rabin is not just pulling the IDF out of Gaza. He is  about to establish an army of terrorists there, as well as in  Jericho, Nabulus, and Hebron. He is handing terrorists the  responsibility for fighting terrorists, and he is allowing  'Arafat to establish a state of armed terrorists overlooking a  shriveled up and dwarfed State of Israel.    This is no peace process. This is the process of  establishing a second Lebanon in the heart of Israel.    [Barzel] Even under these conditions, Rabin is having a hard  time finding partners for a political process. With whom would  you reach an agreement about the IDF governing Gaza?    [Netanyahu] I am not surprised that the Arabs are demanding  more than even these capitulation terms. They have become used  to the idea that this prime minister, Rabin, has no red lines.  All his promises are absolutely worthless. He has promised  just about everything imaginable. The PLO has not abrogated the  charter calling for Israel's annihilation and has not stopped  terror or taken any steps against Fatah men who continue to  engage in terror and, what is more, who closely cooperate with  the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] assassins.    [Barzel] Why should they talk to you about less than what  Rabin has already promised them?    [Netanyahu] The fact is that when we conducted a genuine  peace process, the Arabs demanded less and received less,  because we know how to negotiate with the Arabs. Did al-Asad  and the Palestinians believe they would get everything they are  getting today when they came to Madrid? Did anybody conceive  that the Likud would allow them to have a Palestinian state or  would give back the Golan?    Certainly not, and yet they came nevertheless.    When the Arabs realize there is a different government, a  determined government and not an appeasing one, they will have  to forgo their exorbitant demands.    [Barzel] The current government will soon sign agreements,  and this looks irreversible. If you head the next government,  will you honor these agreements?    [Netanyahu] We will honor any international agreement that  is honored by the other side, but there is no way we will honor  them unilaterally. So far, the PLO has grossly violated all its  basic commitments.    [Barzel] What will you propose to the Palestinians?    [Netanyahu] The Israeli public is gradually coming to  realize that there are two concepts in the search for peace.  The first, which is being pursued by this government, has it  that we must withdraw to the 1967 borders, establish a  Palestinian state, and entrust our security to an army of  terrorists, led by 'Arafat.    I believe in a totally different concept. Israel must keep  its sovereign rule all the way to the Jordan River. The IDF,  and not an army of terrorists, must be solely responsible for  security in all areas of trans-Jordan, and the Arab inhabitants  of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza will be given autonomy.    No autonomy in the world has a flag, an anthem, an army,  border controls, foreign relations, and judicial and executive  branches. This is not autonomy. This is a state. And therein  lies the essential difference between us and the government:  They are offering a state, not autonomy.    [Barzel] Who on the other side will accept the kind of  autonomy you propose?    [Netanyahu] I believe my plan will enjoy significant support  among prominent elements in the Arab world -- first and  foremost, Jordan, whose king probably realizes he will not  survive if a Palestinian state is established in the West Bank.  Such a state will result in his downfall. I believe a common  denominator can be found with Syria, which should ask itself  what it would rather have to its south, in its underbelly: King  Husayn, or a Palestinian state that would strike an alliance  with his enemy, Saddam Husayn?    [Barzel] Is this the basis on which you expect an accord  with Syria?    [Netanyahu] If I were the prime minister, I would conduct  the negotiations with Syria in a totally different matter. Who  has ever heard of a government announcing the concessions it  intends to make before negotiations have even started?    I would tell al-Asad: You stand to lose from a state of war.  I would elaborate on the issues that are more important to  Syria than they are to us, such as water, security arrangements,  striking Syria from the list of terror-supporting countries, and  an arrangement in Lebanon acceptable to both countries.    There is no way I would offer Syria the Golan, which is a  buffer against war. As long as the IDF is on the Golan with its  tanks and artillery, the Syrians do not have the option of war.    [Barzel] In a few days, the government will sign an  agreement with the PLO. Even if you return to power, you will  face a fait accompli. What will you do?    [Netanyahu] Contrary to others, I do not think the  establishment of a Palestinian state is an irreversible process.  If the government thinks it can race from Gaza and Jericho  straight to the permanent solution while uprooting settlements,  it will encounter growing opposition on the part of the public.    This is not a nation of idiots. It will not agree to be  forced back to the banks of the Yarqon River and to deploy  'Arafat and his terrorists on the hills overlooking Tel Aviv.  This opposition is being led by the Likud, along with all the  parties in the national camp.    [Barzel] Finally, how do you feel today about your personal  affair a year ago?    [Netanyahu] I am deeply sorry about my personal slipup. I  hurt myself and my wife, Sara. The media blew the issue out of  all proportion, to the point of reporting out-and-out lies,  which definitely did not make things any easier for us.    We had quite a tough year, but I believe that in the end, we  will emerge stronger.</p>

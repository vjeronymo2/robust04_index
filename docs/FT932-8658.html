			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Letter: UK farmers would do better without CAP Sir, Every concerned taxpayer should support MEP Terry Wynn's protest about the short-sighted increase of Pounds 800m in Common Agricultural Policy funding (Letters, May 10). Contrary to popular thought almost all efficient British farmers would agree with him, for fraud and incompetence have made the CAP an anachronistic and fraudulent nonsense. The recent EC report on the subject of CAP fraud lists corruption to the extent of Pounds 198m. But the newly appointed president of the EC's Court of Auditors estimates CAP fraud in 1992 to have been not less than Pounds 6bn. Quite apart from fraud, the majority of the Pounds 26bn annual spending on the CAP is not achieving its objectives. Research by Professor David Harvey of Newcastle University suggests that less than 20 per cent of the CAP's spending actually helps farmers. The majority of British farmers would be far better off were there to be a rapid termination of the CAP and if they were to be allowed to compete on a fair trading basis. New Zealand has eradicated all agricultural subsidies and their agriculture is now booming. Is there not a lesson to be learned here?

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Milk prices sour the cheesemakers: Companies face paying far more in a liberalised market Cheesemakers are feeling the pinch from the impending deregulation of the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales, which is pushing up prices for almost all buyers. Mr Tony Craske, managing director of Abergavenny Fine Foods, which he claims is the largest speciality cheesemaker in Wales, said he faces a 16 per cent increase in the price of his supplies. He said: 'We're competing at the supermarkets almost exclusively with continental cheesemakers and I'm not sure we'll be able to pass on the rise in price.' Under liberalisation of the milk market on November 1 the Milk Marketing Board, the government's statutory purchasing body, will be abolished. In its place will be Milk Marque, a voluntary farmers' co-operative which has already signed up 65 per cent of producers. Since cheesemakers paid one of the lowest prices for supply under the milk board's allocation system, they are facing the highest rises in the new free market because they have to compete with all other milk buyers. Mr Stephen Curtis, managing director of Horlicks, a mature-cheddar producer in Ilminster, Somerset, said: 'I'm concerned and very angry with the government for authorising a system which was almost certain to have this effect.' Mr Curtis is paying 18 per cent more for his supplies, which he believes will be difficult to recover from a competitive marketplace. Mr John Price, director-general of the Dairy Trade Federation, the dairy industry group, said all manufacturing companies faced significant price increases. The federation has applied for a judicial review of the government's plans for the milk industry. The hearing to decide whether to grant a judicial review takes place tomorrow. If it is successful, the federation will push for a decision to be speeded up so that a conclusion can be reached next month, before the market is opened up. Milk supplies in Britain are kept tight because of European Union quotas which mean farmers can produce only 85 per cent of UK needs. Under the milk board scheme prices were kept low by a rationing system which gave priority to dairies selling liquid milk. But the new free market means buyers can bid up supplies as they rush to secure enough milk for their own uses. One producer in Lancashire has found his demands were still scaled back by 60 per cent even though he was paying 3.2p per litre more for his milk under the new Milk Marque auction system. Mr Paul Plowman, sales and marketing director at the milk board, said it was too simplistic to compare the board's rationing system with the new auction which offers specific service contracts. He said: 'Today companies will be able to buy defined volumes and be able to plan their businesses more effectively.' But many cheese producers disagree with him, saying they will face more uncertainty in the new market. Ironically, the price rises have led to uncertainty over the flotation of Dairy Crest, the milk board's own processing arm, which was hoped to be sold before the November launch. The flotation has been put off indefinitely. One of the benefits of liberalising the market is to allow companies to buy supplies directly from farmers. But small dairies and cheese producers cannot afford to hire tankers or employ testing equipment to make collection of the milk worthwhile. Mr Craske said: 'For dairies using less than 3,000 gallons a day it's not a proposition to buy directly from farmers.' Even larger dairy companies are finding it difficult to secure supplies as Milk Marque has signed up 65 per cent of milk production. The price changes are forcing many small dairies and cheesemakers to reconsider their business plans. Mr Craske has been trying to break into the North American market with a promotion timed for St David's day next year, but has been forced to reduce his efforts. 'We're squeezed so much on margins - we don't have any money left for that sort of thing,' he said. The Lancashire producer is planning to re-direct his business to the production of cheeses such as Cheshire, Lancashire and Wensleydale in smaller quantities, which is a more lucrative market niche than before. He expects to give up exporting double Gloucester in 20kg blocks. Many dairies believe imports will rush in to the UK market in November to compete with higher-priced domestic products. Mild cheddar cheese is expected to be the most competitive sector. Mr Craske said: 'I can't believe it was one of the government's objectives of milk privatisation to allow one company to hijack the nation's milk supply and hold them to ransom at a hugely inflated price.'</p>

Foreign Minister  Prasong Sunsiri yesterday expressed "surprise" that the envoy  had chosen to go public with his remarks instead of conveying  his message directly to him when they met on Monday. While  refusing to comment directly on Mr. Lambertson's statement, Army  Chief Gen. Wimon Wongwanit said he felt "deeply bitter" after  hearing the accusation.    The sour reaction by Mr. Prasong and Gen. Wimon was sparked  by Ambassador Lambertson's speech at the Foreign Correspondents'  Club of Thailand on Thursday night, when he expressed concern  over the alleged ongoing cross-border contacts between Thailand  and the Khmer Rouge, saying the U.S. wanted the Khmer Rouge to  be isolated. The U.S. envoy also questioned the implementation  of Thailand's policy which "has at times been less than clear."    Foreign Minister Prasong conceded that cross-border contacts  with the Khmer Rouge continued due to the close relations  between Thais and members of the Khmer Rouge which were forged a  long time ago. But he insisted that the contacts had nothing to  do with the Government because Thailand had sealed the border  and banned trade with the guerrilla faction in accordance with a  resolution of the United Nations Security Council.    "We honored the resolution of the United Nations Security  Council," Sqn. Ldr. Prasong reiterated. "But the fact that the  Khmer Rouge have maintained contacts with people in the area is  due to their relations from the past," he added. The UN Security  Council issued a resolution early last year requiring countries  neighboring Cambodia [to] close the border and stop trading with  the Khmer Rouge. The Foreign Minister said he was surprised as  to why the U.S. envoy did not raise his concerns over the border  contacts with him when the two met at the Foreign Ministry on  Monday.    Mr. Lambertson accompanied Assistant Secretary of State for  Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs John Shattuck on a visit  to the Foreign Ministry.    Sqn. Ldr. Prasong seemed to be furious at complaints filed  by  other countries that Thailand maintains contacts with the  guerrilla faction, so much so that he raised the matter with  Australian Ambassador to Thailand John McCarthy, who called on  him yesterday. The Foreign Minister even challenged those who  made the allegation to visit the border with him to clarify  their suspicions. "From now I will invite any individual or  groups who make allegations against Thailand to inspect the  border with me so they can see the facts with their own eyes,"  he said. Sqn. Ldr. Prasong said the Khmer Rouge has not been  outlawed and continues to have contact with the Cambodian  government.    Gen. Wimon said the allegation that the Thai military was  still backing the Khmer Rouge made him feel bitter. Gen. Wimon  said the allegation, though incorrect, was accepted as the truth  by a number of people who did not know any better. "We have to  have faith in Thai people and the army by not believing the  allegations made by other countries," said the 59-year old  commander.    The army commander made the comment while in Lop Buri  Province, where he inspected an army exercise conducted by the  2nd Cavalry Division in Phatthana Nikhom District. "We feel  deeply bitter over such an allegation," the army commander said.  Gen. Wimon said the Thai army had lost a large number of  soldiers while doing their duties along the Thai-Cambodian  border.    The last incident occurred early this week when a new army  officer who just graduated from the Chunlachomklao Military  Academy died when Khmer Rouge guerrillas and Phnom Penh forces  fought a brief battle on Thai territory. He said the army  officer died when he stepped on a booby-trap planted near the  border. "This young officer died as a result of fighting between  the two Khmer groups," said Gen. Wimon. "They (Cambodians) have  caused a lot of suffering to us," said the commander. He said  that the army would adopt stiffer military measures to deal with  the problem along the border area.    Commenting on US Ambassador David Lambertson's statement  expressing concern that the Thai military still had contact with  the Khmer Rouge, Gen. Wimon refused to be drawn into an  argument. He urged reporters to raise the question instead with  Ambassador Lambertson who made the allegation.    A colonel attached to the Army Secretary said the army would  not comment on the ambassador's statement, saying that it was  the duty of the Foreign Ministry. The officer admitted that a  number of senior army officers were surprised to learn of the  ambassador's comments. They said they found it hard to believe  that he would actually make such a statement.</p>

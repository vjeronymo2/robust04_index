			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VONS CONTRACT LINKS PAY, STORE PERFORMANCE;  </P> <P> SUNDAY SALES, BONUSES KEY FOR TIANGUIS WORKERS  </P> <P> Workers at Vons' seven Tianguis food markets have ratified an innovative  contract that will tie their pay to the performance of their stores.  </P> <P> Labor experts said Thursday that the three-year contract, ratified last week by  1,000 workers, is unusual because it links productivity and pay in a service  industry. The concept is common in manufacturing where individual workers'  productivity can be more easily measured.  </P> <P> Although contract issues are still being worked out, the agreement includes two  key provisions, according to Bill Bailey, director of labor relations for Vons  Cos.  </P> <P> First, the company and the union have agreed to a form of profit sharing in  which employees would be paid bonuses for helping to boost profit. In addition,  employees working Sundays, by far the Latino-oriented chain's busiest day,  would be paid according to a formula based on sales per square foot.  </P> <P> Under a long-standing rule, food industry employers generally pay workers time  and a half on Sundays. Unions nationwide fought for that premium years ago,  largely in an effort to discourage food merchants from opening on Sundays so  that workers could be off.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Pay Formula  </P> <P> But in recent years Sunday has become a huge shopping day. Tianguis assigns 85%  to 90% of its staff to come in on Sundays to handle the crush of customers.  </P> <P> With the aid of UCLA Prof. William G. Ouchi, a management expert, the El  Monte-based company and the United Food and Commercial Workers devised a new  pay formula. The UFCW represents the Tianguis chain's clerks and most of its  meat cutters.  </P> <P> Workers will start out making straight time on Sundays, but their pay will be  adjusted upward as sales rise. Company and union officials anticipate that  workers eventually could earn nearly double the straight pay.  </P> <P> Audrey Freedman, a labor economist with the Conference Board research group in  New York, praised the contract as one that should promote teamwork.  </P> <P> "They're paying workers for the burden of serving more people," she said. "It  encourages cooperation (because) a group is being rewarded on a group basis for  taking on an extra load."  </P> <P> Ranging from 21,000 to 60,000 square feet, the Tianguis stores are more  dependent on service than typical self-service supermarkets. The larger stores  employ as many as 400 workers.  </P> <P> Among other departments, they feature a large delicatessen, a Mexican-style  bakery, a pizzeria and a tortilleria, where workers make and bag tortillas  daily.  </P> <P> "The Tianguis operation is labor intensive," said Rick Icaza, president of UFCW  Local 770 in Los Angeles. "They service you to death. Tianguis allows employees  to kibitz, making it more of a social event."  </P> <P> Union sources noted that profit sharing programs of one sort or another do  exist at a few other chains in the East, including A &amp; P and Kroger stores.  </P> <P> But the Tianguis pact is unusual in tying Sunday wages to productivity and in  combining two job categories -- food clerks and lower-paid general merchandise  clerks -- into one, affording Tianguis more flexibility in assigning workers.  </P> <P> Icaza said the union is excited about the possibilities. "We like the idea that  if we work hard we can earn potentially more than in the mainstream," he said.  "I think this may be the contract of the future."  </P></p>

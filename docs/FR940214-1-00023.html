The Cooperating Sponsor may be excused of its obligations for such payment or replacement if it is determined by CCC that such improper distribution or use, or such loss or damage, could not have been prevented by proper exercise of the Cooperating Sponsor's responsibility under the terms of the Program Agreement. Normal commercial practices in the country of distribution shall be considered in determining whether there was a proper exercise of the Cooperating sponsor's responsibility. Payment by the Cooperating Sponsor shall be made in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fault of others in country of distribution and in intermediate country. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) In addition to survey or outturn reports to determine ocean carrier loss and damage, the Cooperating Sponsor shall, in the case of landlocked countries, arrange for an independent survey at the point of entry into the recipient country and make a report as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. CCC will reimburse the Cooperating Sponsor for the costs of survey as set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Where any damage to or loss of the commodity or any loss of monetized proceeds or program income is attributable to a warehouseman, carrier or other person, the Cooperating Sponsor shall make every reasonable effort to pursue collection of claims for such loss or damage. The Cooperating Sponsor shall furnish a copy of the claim and related documents to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. Cooperating Sponsors who fail to file or pursue such claims shall be liable to CCC for the value of the commodities or loss of monetized proceeds or program income is attributable to a warehouseman, carrier or other person, the Cooperating Sponsor shall make every reasonable effort to pursue collection of claims for such loss or damage. The Cooperating Sponsor shall furnish a copy of the claim and related documents to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. Cooperating Sponsors who fail to file or pursue such claims shall be liable to CCC for the value of the commodities or monetized proceeds or program income lost, damaged, or misused: Provided, however, that the Cooperating Sponsor may elect not to file a claim if the loss is less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor may retain $150 of any amount collected on an individual claim. In addition, Cooperating Sponsors may, with the written approval of the Agricultural Counselor or Attache, retain amounts to cover special costs of collection such as legal fees, or pay such collection costs with monetized proceeds or program income. Any proposed settlement for less than the full amount of the claim requires prior approval by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. When the Cooperating Sponsor has exhausted all reasonable attempts to collect a claim, it shall request the Agricultural Counselor or Attache to provide further instructions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) At a minimum, the Cooperating Sponsor shall pursue any claim by initial billings and with three progressively stronger demands at not more than 30 day intervals. If these efforts fail to elicit a satisfactory response, legal action in the judicial system of the cooperating country shall be pursued unless: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Liability of the third party is not provable,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The cost of pursuing the claim would exceed the amount of the claim, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The third party would not have enough assets to satisfy the claim after a judicial decision favorable to the cooperating sponsor, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Maintaining legal action in the country's judicial system would seriously impair the Cooperating Sponsor's ability to conduct an effective program in the country. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Cooperating Sponsor's decisions not to take legal action, and reasons therefore, must be submitted in writing to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache for review and approval, and the Agricultural Counselor or Attache may require the Cooperating Sponsor to obtain the opinion of competent legal counsel to support its decision. A Cooperating Sponsor may request approval to terminate legal action after it has commenced for any of the exceptions described above or if CCC determines that it is otherwise appropriate to terminate legal action prior to judgment. In each instance the Agricultural Counsel or Attache must provide the Cooperating Sponsor with a written explanation of its decision. If the Agricultural Counselor or Attache approves a Cooperating Sponsor's decision not to take further action on the claim for reasons described in paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section, the Cooperating Sponsor shall assign the claim to CCC and shall provide to CCC all documentation relating to the claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

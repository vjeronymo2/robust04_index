			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chen Wei-ming (7115 1792 0682) ] </F>   [Text]The British Keep Neither Faith Nor Dignity    According to a source in Beijing, an authoritative CPC  person  talked about the situation in Hong Kong in early March. He  pointed out that the British unilaterally disrupted the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, unilaterally tore up agreements  reached between the governments of the two countries, and  publicly declared that those agreements were not binding. Such  an act was unexpectedly committed in the 1990's, and by a state  which claims to be democratic. This has exposed to the world  the reputation of the so-called democratic state. How can its  sincerity be trusted if it showed no consideration for its own  dignity?    The authoritative person said: The British chose  confrontation. Let them do it for as long as they wish.  However, they must be clear that they cannot capitalize on Hong  Kong for this purpose without end. We will not allow Britain or  any hegemonist to lead us by the nose. The People's Government  of China is not a government under the Ching Dynasty, nor like  the Kuomintang Government, nor like Argentina, which can be  bullied by military means. The British must be aware that if  they go on with the confrontation, they will not attain their  political motives. Conversely, they will lose the interests  they originally had. We will certainly eliminate the influence  of colonialism in Hong Kong, otherwise, we will not be able to  justify ourselves to the Chinese nation. The era in which China  was oppressed and controlled by others ended 45 years ago. If  the British are unwilling to cooperate with us, we will no  longer stretch out our hands in cooperation. It looks as if the  tension and deterioration of the Sino-British relations will go  on until the next century.  China Keeps a Close Watch Over the Trends in Hong Kong [subhead]    The source added: A senior CPC official said recently at a  discussion with nonparty personalities that after the foundation  of cooperation was disrupted by the British, the CPC would keep  a closer watch over British moves in politics, economics, and  society in Hong Kong during the transition period, in accordance  with Deng Xiaoping's instructions on the Hong Kong issue. He  said: We have clearly indicated that since the British chose to  have confrontation rather than cooperation with China, all  affairs unilaterally arranged by the British side must be  terminated on 30 June 1997, and they will be examined and  approved again by the sovereign state according to the Basic Law  after the sovereignty of Hong Kong is handed over and the  colonial rule put to an end. The "three-tier council system"  masterminded and formed by the British side will also be  terminated on 30 June 1997 as well. Some people spread the  rumor that the British-style parliamentary system will remain in  force after 1997. This is an idle dream, as well as cheap  swindling, of the colonialists.    The aforementioned official continued: Moreover, we have  clearly and repeatedly said that if drastic political changes,  turbulences, disturbances, or a runaway situation emerge during  the transition period, and if people plot to turn Hong Kong into  an international political city, which will lead to economic  chaos in Hong Kong, we will be forced to reconsider the timing  and mode of recovering Hong Kong.    The official further said: We do not hope that such drastic  changes, turbulences, disturbances, or a runaway situation will  emerge, because Hong Kong is a territory of China, and Hong Kong  compatriots are Chinese. The achievements made by Hong Kong in  its construction are chiefly a crystallization of wisdom and  diligence of the Hong Kong compatriots. However, as the British  are playing their old tricks before pulling out of the colony,  we must be prepared for the worst. Otherwise, we will commit a  glaring blunder toward the Chinese nation and the Chinese people.</p>

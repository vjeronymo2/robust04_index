Mr. Redman informed Granic about U.S.  views on the possibilities for resolving the crisis in this part  of Europe, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the light of the  latest NATO decisions.    Ambassador Redman presented several U.S. initiatives -- also  supported by the leading countries of the European Union -- for  setting up Croat-Muslim relations on a lasting basis and for  ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Minister Granic voiced Croatia's support for NATO's resolve  to end the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible.  Hope was expressed that all parties to the conflict --  especially the Serb side -- would take the world community's  warnings seriously.    Both sides attached particular importance to the setting up  of Croat-Muslim relations and cooperation between the two  peoples in the final resolution of the crisis.

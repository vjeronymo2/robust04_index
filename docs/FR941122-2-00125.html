AmTran has also applied to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice of receipt of an application is published under 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120 (formerly Section 157 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417)) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgment concerning the merits of the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph S5.3 of FMVSS No. 120 states that each vehicle must have a label affixed which includes the size designation of the tires and the size designation of the rims. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AmTran produced approximately 38,000 buses and school buses from 1987 through 1994 which do not meet the labeling requirements stated in the standard. The vehicles lack the rim diameter designation on the label. The label does include the rim width and complete tire size. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AmTran supports its application with the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> American Transportation (AmTran) requests that an exemption be granted based on the grounds that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it related to motor vehicle safety. The rim width is listed on the certification label; however, the rim diameter is not listed. The complete tire size, including the diameter (which is identical to the rim diameter), is listed on each label. Therefore, [AmTran] believes that sufficient information is available for the user to match tire and rim sizes appropriately. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the application of AmTran, described above.

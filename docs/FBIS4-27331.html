			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hiroshi Hasegawa, AERA Editorial Department </F> reporter: "The Japanese Government's Top Secret Scenario To Cope  With Emergency on the Korean Peninsula"; first paragraph is AERA  introduction]    If North and South Korea start a war on the Korean  peninsula after the United Nations imposes economic sanctions  against North Korea which is suspected of developing nuclear  weapons, how will Japan cope with the war? AERA has obtained a  document that reveals a package of measures under secret  examination by the Japanese Government.    The outline of the package of measures to prepare for a  state  of emergency on the Korean peninsula, which the Japanese  Government is now secretly examining, has come to light.    If the United Nations imposes economic sanctions against  North Korea, how will the Japanese Government deal with them?"  If a war breaks out, how will Japan cooperate with U.S. Forces?  AERA has obtained the document revealing how relevant  ministries and agencies are now working on to map out the  package of measures. (Refer to tables on pages 14 and 15.)    Commenting on the package of measures, a cabinet Secretariat  official has said, "As Japan's measures to deal with  international crisis, the package of measures is the largest in  scale since Japan was defeated in World War II." Relevant  ministries and agencies have recently briefed the Foreign  Affairs Division of each ruling coalition party on the package  of measures. The top government leader is aware of the package  of measures.    The document lists all areas where Japan cannot cope with  the  emergency under laws and ordinances currently in force and  clearly indicates what sort of legislation is required to cope  with the emergency.    North Korea is promoting its nuclear program in Yongbyon, 90  km north of Pyongyang, and it appears to be expanding  underground facilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) has been trying to check North Korea's nuclear facilities  in accordance with a safeguards agreement concluded between the  IAEA and North Korea as required by the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty, but North Korea is still refusing to  permit IAEA-sought inspections of its nuclear facilities.    The United States has intervened in the standoff between  North Korea and the IAEA in an effort to alter North Korea's  attitude through dialogue. However, North Korea has triggered  the war of nerves instead by using its nuclear card, and the "on  and off" negotiations have continued for more than two years.  Some have therefore begun arguing for economic sanctions by the  UN Security Council and non-UN economic sanctions imposed by  such concerned nations as Japan, the United States, and South  Korea.  <H5>  Japan Bans Remittances, Trade, and Exchange of Visits With </H5> North Korea    Under this situation, North Korea has been developing the  Nodong-1 missile capable of hitting any part of Japan. Last  year, it test-fired the missile into the Sea of Japan. Its  leadership has continued its criticism of Japan.    Meanwhile, during his meeting with then Prime Minister  Hosokawa last November, President Clinton reportedly took the  issue of continued illegal outflow of huge sums of the yen from  Japan to North Korea.    According to the same cabinet Secretariat official, the  Japanese Government is prepared to enforce economic sanctions by  establishing a countermeasure headquarter two or three days  after the UN Security Council votes to impose economic sanctions  against North Korea.    So far, the government and the ruling coalition parties are  working on details of the package on the assumption of four  situations: 1) Japan's cooperation on economic sanctions  imposed by the UN Security Council; 2) Japan's assistance to the  U.S. forces when the United States and South Korea go into a  state of war with North Korea; 3) Japan's transport of refugees;  and 4) Japan's defensive actions or "Japan's self-defense war"  in accordance with Article 76 of the Self-Defense Forces Law.  The private views of officials who have been involved in  compiling the document are incorporated in the tables.    It is legally possible for Japan to ban or restrict the  remittance and investment by ethnic Koreans residing in Japan to  North Korea; Trade; and the exchange of visits by ships,  aircraft, and personnel between Japan and North Korea, but there  is a possibility that the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan [Chongnyon] will strongly react against such  measures. Nonetheless, the Japanese Government will be able to  put the measures into effect whenever the top government leader  makes a decision on them.    It is still difficult for the Japanese Government to draw a  conclusion on how to deal with reentry into Japan by ethnic  Koreans residing in Japan after their short visits to their  relatives in North Korea.    If the Korean residents residing in Japan are banned from  returning to Japan where they have their base of livelihood,  Japan would be criticized from the humanitarian point of view.    What is impossible or difficult under laws and ordinances  currently in force are the activities of the Self-Defense Forces  [SDF] to back up the economic sanctions and Japan's assistance  to the U.S. forces engaged in combat.

The SDF  cannot carry out these activities in either open sea or Japan's  territorial waters.    As a result, the argument is surfacing on the need to amend  the SDF Law. If the SDF undertakes naval interception and check  of ships near sea waters where North Korea wages sea battles  with the United States and South Korea, it would be dragged into  the sea battles.    The amendment to the SDF Law may breach the Constitution  depending on how the SDF Law is amended. Unlike the Gulf war,  for which Japan made financial and material contributions, and  the peacekeeping operations (PKO) in Cambodia, for which it sent  its units, Japan would be a country involved directly in the  emergency on the Korean peninsula.    Japan will choose between letting the SDF carry out  activities as it is or organizing a PKO unit. It also will  decide whether to refrain from taking part in activities outside  Japan while joining the economic sanctions. It will not adopt an  attitude of indifference toward the emergency.    Laying of Mines in the Sea -- Under current law,  the SDF can participate in removing mines from the sea if it is  not known which country laid the mines.    If the SDF is to remove the mines laid in foreign  territorial  waters for amphibious landing operations, it must amend the SDF  Law. It is hard to see the SDF's removal of mines as a  self-defense act and the SDF's involvement in the removal of  mines will most likely be seen as an act breaching the  Constitution.    A minesweeper of the Maritime Self-Defense Force was sent to  the Persian Gulf only after the Gulf war ended.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

Bills to allow the dispatch of  SDF airplanes overseas have been submitted to the Diet, and the  dispatch of war vessels also has been discussed. But the  prospect of these bills becoming law is dim.  <H5>  Government Is Studying Mobilization of SDF in an Emergency </H5>   Legislation for Emergency Cases -- Besides the  review of the SDF Law, the revision of relevant laws and  ordinances, as well as the enactment of new laws, will be taken  up for discussion.    For example, when the government urgently needs to construct  a surveillance facility somewhere, it has to obtain landowners'  consent if the place is a private forest. Whether or not  legislation to allow emergency land expropriation is necessary  to save the government the trouble of obtaining such consent  will likely be discussed.    A noticeable point in the government's study of the DPRK  issue is the inclusion among subjects for detailed study of  Articles 76 and 77 of the SDF Law, which stipulate ordering the  mobilization of SDF troops and standby for mobilization.    The study of these articles is aimed at clarifying  conditions  under which Japan can wage a "defensive war."    Although the current law allows the government to expose tax  evasion by Korean residents in Japan, to do so will unexpectedly  be difficult for the government.    According to the (1991 issue of) Chongnyon, a  brochure published by the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan [Chongnyon], the Commercial and Industrial  Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a Chongnyon-affiliated  organ, reached a five-point agreement with the National Tax  Administration Agency 18 years ago. The first point stipulates  that "all issues concerning Korean businessmen's taxes should be  resolved through consultation with the Commercial and Industrial  Association of Korean Residents in Japan."    Is there any connection between "tax evasion" by Korean  residents in Japan, which the government plans to expose when  sanctions are imposed on North Korea, and this agreement?  <H5>  Money Flow, Tax Evasion Will Also Be Targets of Economic </H5> Sanctions    Moreover, what is the connection between the flow of money  from Japan to the DPRK, which the United States is also closely  watching, and "tax evasion" in Japan? The National Tax  Administration Agency has so far denied the existence of the  five-point agreement. But when sanctions are imposed on the  DPRK, the agency will need to disclose the facts about the  agreement so it can expose tax evasion in a fair manner.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has seldom told about specific  measures to cope with possible Korea crisis since his term as  foreign minister.    But at a House of Representatives' Budget Committee session  on 24 May, he made remarks suggesting the possibility of Japan  engaging in activities other than those to be carried out under  a UN resolution. His remarks indicated that the government is  steadily promoting the study of measures to deal with an  emergency case.</p>

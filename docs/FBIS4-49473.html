			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Main News" program] </F>   [Text] Good evening. China's top official dealing with  Hong Kong affairs has been offering reassuring words about the  future to local businessmen. But Lu Ping also says that the  territory is only a value to China if it doesn't become too  political. That message has not gone down well in some  quarters, as Linda Lee reports.    [Begin recording] [Lee] Addressing some 500 local  businessmen over lunch today, Lu Ping stressed that the value of  Hong Kong to China has been and will be economic.    [Lu Ping] Of course, there are always a handful who are so  naive as to think that they can turn Hong Kong into a political  city in order to influence the mainland in the sense of  politics. If that were the case, Hong Kong would be of negative  value instead of positive value to China.    [Patten] I don't think that you can treat Hong Kong as  though  it were just an economic laboratory. It is a living and  thriving community with all sorts of social and political  aspirations. [end recording]    [Lee] Governor Patten had made himself readily available to  respond to any comment from Lu Ping by scheduling a visit to  Tsing Yi this afternoon. He reminded the Chinese officials that  they were party to a promise to give Hong Kong greater democracy.    [Patten] China itself has signed up in the Joint Declaration  and in the Basic Law to a process of political development in  Hong Kong, which recognizes the modest but growing aspirations  of the people of the community.    [Lee] But Lu Ping pointed out that the principles of One  Country, Two Systems and Hong Kong People Ruling Hong Kong were  designed to meet the aspirations of the community. Lu assured  his audience that the territory will enjoy a high degree of  autonomy. [end recording]</p>

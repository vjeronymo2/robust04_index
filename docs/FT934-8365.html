			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Observer: Off-balance Hilmar Kopper, boss of Deutsche Bank, does not miss a trick. Like any other sensible banker, he is mindful of the topsy-like growth of those clever-clever instruments such as yield curve swaps, look-back options and forward rate agreements, lumped under the catch-all name of derivatives. Hence, quizzed recently as to whether he had yet thought of a nickname for the Trianon tower, the bank's third skyscraper in Frankfurt opened earlier this month, Kopper hesitated not a moment. Given that the newcomer is taller than the existing pair, dubbed 'Soll und Haben' (assets and liabilities), why not call it 'derivatives'?</p>

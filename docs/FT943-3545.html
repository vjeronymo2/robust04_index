			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher unsettled Stores group Kingfisher saw an early gain clipped back as worrying stories of executive changes moved through the market ahead of the company's interim figures, due today. The Woolworths and B&amp;Q parent has suffered from what many in the market see as an unsuccessful sales policy known as 'Every Day Low Pricing', and concern over the competition in the DIY market from Home Depot, of the US. Full-year forecasts have edged down and the share price has tumbled from almost 780p at the peak in December. There was talk yesterday that Mr James Kerr-Muir, the finance director who replaced current Asda chairman Archie Norman, could be under pressure. But there is also thought to be little love lost between chairman Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy and Mr Alan Smith, the chief executive. Kingfisher had been up 6 but ended the day only 2 better at 490p. Banks and insurances were among the market's best performing areas, with the former given a strong push by the move to higher interest rates in the UK, which dealers said would help boost margins for the banks. Barclays was the star turn, racing up 10 more to 595p, helped by recent broker buy recommendations; turnover was 6.6m shares. The sharp slide on the Hong Kong market, ahead of the visit by Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK home secretary, later this week, upset HSBC Holdings, which fell 11 to 737p and put pressure on Standard Chartered, 4 cheaper at 267p. Composite insurances attracted solid support and were not badly affected by reports of an earth tremor in the US. Guardian Royal Exchange moved up 6 to 193p, Royal 7 to 281p and General Accident 10 to 564p. Prudential was the pick of the life assurances, closing 4 1/2 firmer at 315 1/2 p at the start of an important week which brings interims from Prudential, Legal &amp; General and United Friendly. Clothes retailer Country Casuals fell 32 to 120p after warning that full-year profits would be below expectations. Meanwhile, Liberty dropped 33 to 355p after announcing losses of Pounds 301,000 in the six months to July, against profits of Pounds 601,000 previously. There was more news of share buy-backs in the utilities areas of the market. PowerGen settled 2 easier at 569p after buying a block of 2.5m shares at 573p. In the regional electricity stocks, Seeboard purchased 1m shares at 434p; its shares eased 6 to 434p. Transport shares came under pressure on the back of a reappraisal of debt worries following the rise in bank base rates. Eurotunnel tumbled 9 to 270p and British Airways, another heavy borrower, ended 5 lower at 397p. Ahead of tomorrow's half-year statement, Associated British Ports fell 13 to 269p, not helped by bearish comment in the weekend press. British Aerospace ended a penny off at 496p in the wake of denials of a deal with Germany's corporate monolith Daimler-Benz. Weekend press comment to the effect that BAe was discussing the sale of its business interests in Airbus Industrie was flatly denied by the company, with BAe declaring itself 'absolutely committed to Airbus'. Fairey, the defence electronics group, jumped 16 to 399p following a surge in profits. Circulation figures for August led to cautionary reading for News International, the Murdoch group which sparked off the newspaper price war. SG Warburg pointed out to clients that while Sun sales rose 0.2 per cent, the sales of its chief rivals, the Mirror and Daily record, rose a combined 2.1 per cent. At the other end of the spectrum, sales of Mr Murdoch's Times were down 0.3 per cent, while the Telegraph had rebounded 1.9 per cent. News International fell 11 to 239p and Mirror Group was steady at 137p. The Telegraph slipped 5 to 349p. Other statistics, Page 43</p>

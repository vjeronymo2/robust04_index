			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> NIXON, KUNSTLER MEET AT STUDIO  </P> <P> fierce ideological rivals met backstage at "CBS This Morning" today and there  were neither fireworks nor fisticuffs.  </P> <P> Former President Richard M. Nixon and radical lawyer William Kunstler appeared  on the show separately, and Kunstler went searching for Nixon, whom he had  never met.  </P> <P> "Where is he? I've got to find him," Kunstler said after he had been part of a  discussion about the First Amendment. He finally found Nixon in the makeup  room, where he was being prepped for his own interview. Kunstler asked the  former President if he really was Richard Nixon and then they shook hands and  they chatted briefly but pleasantly. The topics were aging and baseball.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The United Nations began one of its most ambitious repatriation operations,  bringing hundreds of Namibian exiles home to participate in the territory's  independence process. The U.N. High Commission for Refugees sought to  repatriate more than 1,300 refugees on 11 flights on the first day, but several  flights were canceled, allowing only about 700 to return. The United Nations  wants to bring back 1,000 refugees a day -- it estimates there are about 40,000  in camps in neighboring countries -- for the next six weeks under the  independence plan for Africa's last colony, ruled by South Africa for 74 years.  </P></p>

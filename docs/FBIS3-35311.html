According to  Sudanese officials his visit was aimed at encouraging and  equipping the rebels, who have recently suffered heavy defeats.    The action, which was taken on the orders of American  President Clinton, is an undisputed violation of Sudanese  national sovereignty and ridicules the definite principles of  international law.    The American Government's intervention reveals the long  standing support given by this country to the southern Sudanese  cessationists and adds a page to the bulky record of state  terrorism by Washington's leaders.    In a similar action, in coordination with the British  ambassador to Sudan, the Archbishop of Canterbury also travelled  to southern Sudan some while ago, but this led to a firm  response by the Sudanese Government and the expulsion of the  British ambassador from the country.    At the time the Sudanese Government also warned the U.S.  ambassador regarding intervention in Sudan's internal affairs  and support for terrorism, and called on him to be aware of the  consequences of such actions.    However, with no concern for the warnings, America, while  leading the Western world, continued to increase pressure on  Sudan in various ways from both inside and abroad.    The propaganda horns were once again sounded to poison  public  opinion, while standard Western practices used to bring down  independent countries refusing submission were put into effect  -- countries which in the opinion of the West are enemies  because they are not in the Western camp. Reports on violations  of human rights and of Sudanese Government support for terrorism  were transmitted constantly. Seminars and congresses by the  Sudanese opposition in Western countries were given priority  news coverage, and there were even reports about direct Western  intervention to divide the country. Western crocodile tears  were shed in sympathy with minorities in southern Sudan, while  Western governments not only turn a blind eye to the rights of  the majority in various parts of the world, including Bosnia and  Algeria, but are active in denying these rights by cooperating  with the violators. [passage omitted].    Obviously, in the final analysis the West will have to bear  the negative consequences of these irresponsible actions and  double-standard policies. Such actions will only increase  instability in the international order and will lead the world  toward new chaos and disorder.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Pension providers face cost increase The trustees of the Mine-workers Pension Scheme have recommended that half of the scheme's Pounds 800m surplus be used to improve benefits for pensioners and members. The improvement is likely to increase the costs facing private pension providers in compensating former scheme members who were persuaded wrongly to transfer to personal pensions. The pension transfers are the subject of a regulatory review, and insurance companies are likely to be ordered to pay compensation to 'buy' members of the miners' scheme back into it. The benefit improvements will increase payments to about 450,000 current and deferred pensioners by 6.5 per cent. Deferred pensioners are those who have left the scheme, but are below pensionable age. Current contributing scheme members will be entitled to one additional years' service credit for each 15 years of membership, which will be equivalent to a 6.5 per cent increase in benefits. The trustees of the scheme make recommendations on the use of scheme surpluses, but the decision is ultimately at the discretion of British Coal. The decision to distribute some of the surplus follows the latest pension scheme valuation last September. The rest of the surplus will be used to continue British Coal's contributions holiday until the date of privatisation. The balance will be invested in a reserve account, in accordance with an agreement between the government and British Coal designed to protect the benefits of scheme members. The two previous scheme surpluses have also been used to enhance members' benefits and to offer a contributions holiday to British Coal.</p>

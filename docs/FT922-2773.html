			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Opposition seeks full inquiry on Maxwell revelations BRITAIN'S opposition Labour party yesterday demanded a full inquiry into what the government knew of Mr Robert Maxwell's activities prior to the collapse of his business empire. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, wrote to Mr John Major, the prime minister, urging him to set up an inquiry after the Financial Times reported yesterday that the UK government had intelligence information at least two years before the death of Mr Maxwell that suggested he had been acting dishonestly. Government officials said yesterday there was no evidence to suggest that any government ministers had seen telephone or other intercepts which might have alerted them to fraud in the Maxwell empire. Mr Major was certain that he had seen nothing either as chancellor of the exchequer or prime minister. Mr Brown called for a statement on 'who was informed, when and in what detail, and - specifically - why no action was taken to investigate fraud'. Conservative MPs including Mr Rupert Allason, the author of books on espionage, were ready to accept that Mr Maxwell had been the subject of intelligence reports, but expressed scepticism that these would have gone into his financial activities. Mr Richard Page, Conservative co-chairman of the all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners, said: 'If it turns out the government knew that Maxwell was bleeding money out of the pension funds, then the pressure on the government to provide for the pensioners becomes almost irresistible', he added. The FT yesterday quoted Mr Robin Robison, who in June 1988 became an administrative officer for the Joint Intelligence Committee, part of the Cabinet Office which assesses information from Britain's intelligence services. The FT has confirmed separately, from a source other than Mr Robison, that intelligence information on Mr Maxwell's activities had been available for some years. A full intelligence report on Mr Maxwell was prepared from files for the JIC at the time of his death on November 5 last year. Mr Robison - a Quaker who was positively vetted by the security services in 1987 - claimed that in 1989 he saw intelligence information on Mr Maxwell from intercepted telephone conversations and faxes. The information, he said, had been distributed to government officials. Senior government officials disputed Mr Robison could have seen signals intelligence information in autumn 1989, as he claimed. Downing Street indicated that there were no plans to seek a prosecution of Mr Robison under the Official Secrets Act. Government officials declined to comment on the suggestion that the intelligence services may have collected information on the Maxwell empire. Any suggestion that the government was responsible for the late Mr Robert Maxwell's raiding of his companies' pension funds was rejected last night by Miss Ann Widdecombe, junior social security minister. She also rejected calls for another Commons' debate or government statement on the affair. 'It would be quite counter productive to react every day to every new twist of the Maxwell saga,' Miss Widdecombe said on Channel Four News. She also ruled out a fresh investigation into the affair. It also emerged yesterday that a book co-authored by Mr Peter Thompson, a former director of Mirror Group Newspapers, and suppressed by Mr Maxwell in 1988, had originally claimed that the British security services had extensive files on the publisher. According to Mr Thompson, Mr Maxwell strenuously objected to a claim by a former MI5 agent saw no fewer than 37 assembled dossiers on the publisher. The book, Maxwell: A Portrait of Power, was published in February 1988, without the passages in question. But Mr Maxwell's lawyers obtained an injunction to prevent further sales.

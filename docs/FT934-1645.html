			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Chiltern Radio recovers Chiltern Radio, the independent local radio operator, returned to profits in the second half of the year to September 30. However, the figure of Pounds 79,000, against losses of Pounds 136,000, was not sufficient to overcome first half losses leaving a full year deficit of Pounds 246,000 pre-tax, against Pounds 392,000. The shares lost 9p yesterday to 109p. The outcome had been affected by costs incurred in the relicensing process. The company retained eight out of 10 licences and gained a licence for one of the new regional areas which covered one of the other two. The company said the present year had started well with strong national airtime revenues. Turnover was Pounds 5.76m (Pounds 5.27m). After a tax credit of Pounds 27,000 (Pounds 95,000) losses per share were reduced from 4.6p to 3.4p.</p>

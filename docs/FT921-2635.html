			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: Inheriting the earth - Western investors moving to eastern Europe may face environmental liability Three years ago eastern Europe was a convenient dumping ground for western Europe's toxic waste. That was partly because the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), or former Soviet Union, had few qualms in accepting nuclear waste from eastern Europe. Today a consortium of western companies bidding to expand nuclear power at Paks, in south-west Hungary, has admitted that it needs a new solution to the waste problem since the CIS has rejected its role as a dumping ground. The disintegration of the Soviet Union, the assertion of the rights of the new independent republics and the political sovereignty of the countries of eastern Europe are just some of the reasons why western companies' nuclear, chemical, or industrial waste is no longer welcome. Another reason is that the debate about the environment in eastern Europe is changing. On the one hand, it continues to focus on trying to clean up the damage caused by 45 years of communist-style industrialisation. On the other, it is beginning to concentrate on four issues which are likely to influence the region's future environmental standards. These include: Liability incurred by western companies investing in eastern Europe. The role played by international financial institutions, particularly the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), in shaping a development policy for the region's infrastructure which will be compatible with the environment. How European Community environment legislation will influence corresponding legislation in eastern Europe, as well as influencing environmental standards by western companies investing, or trading, in the region. What effect market reforms will have on the environment in eastern Europe. Environmental issues first gained prominence in eastern Europe in the early 1980s when Charter 77, the Czechoslovak human rights movement, environmental groups in Poland, Ecoglasnost in Bulgaria and Duna Kor in Hungary started to flex their muscles against the communist regimes. But since the collapse of the communist systems throughout Europe, much of the energy and idealism of the environmental groups have been sucked into the political system. 'As to the environment, one has to understand that its development is connected to the economic situation. Results can be achieved which are based only on a successful economy,' said Sandor Keresztes, Hungary's environment minister. In practice, however, the environment is beginning to play a greater role among western companies thinking about investing in the region. This is because advantages of cheap labour and a skilled workforce in the region have to be offset by the disadvantages of possible liability costs. 'Western companies wishing to invest in eastern Europe must be aware that they could be saddled with the cost of cleaning up the waste accumulated over many years,' said Tassilo Metternich, a consultant at Environmental Resources Limited. ERL specialises in carrying out a wide range of activities, from individual site audits to company-wide communications and training programmes related to the environment. Its primary role is to identify what environmental problems a western investor will inherit, and what liability that company will incur. 'It is not an easy thing to do. Some western companies would naturally resent the fact that they have to pay for the damage caused by the previous owners - who were communist,' said Metternich. 'It is also very messy because we are working to laws that do not exist in these countries. Moreover, companies wishing to invest in eastern Europe are sometimes treated on a case-by-case basis. So you are not always sure where you stand with the law. We tell our clients the pros and cons about the sites they have chosen as a greenfield, or what problems they inherit in a plant into which they are buying,' he added. Metternich says he is not sure if liability acts as a deterrent to attracting foreign investment into eastern Europe. 'Maybe, if it was said that there would be no liability, more foreign investors would go into eastern Europe. It is hard to say. The legislation is in flux,' he added. John Mitchell, head of the east European division at ICI, one of the world's largest chemical firms, is sanguine about the question of liability. 'We are more interested in obtaining licences than in acquiring sites at the moment in eastern Europe,' explained Mitchell. ICI, which is expanding into the region and which had sales worth Dollars 36m in Hungary last year, appears to be motivated by one philosophy. 'When we obtain licences in eastern Europe, or anywhere else, we make sure that that company conforms to the highest standards in quality with regard to the product, the environment and service to the consumer,' he explained. 'Through training schemes, our partners in eastern Europe know what to expect from standards in warehousing and distribution.' Martin Houldin, an environmental expert at management consultants KPMG in London, says EC legislation on the environment means that western firms investing in eastern Europe will automatically have to meet EC standards. 'Even if legislation on the environment is absent in eastern Europe, those governments which wish to apply for full membership to the EC will in any case improve their standards over time,' he explained. The need to improve standards partly explains why UK companies such as ICI and Johnson Matthey are involved in training programmes and are working more closely with environmental groups in the UK and eastern Europe. Duncan Fisher is director of the East-West Environment Programme. Organised under the umbrella of the London-based Ecological Studies Institute, the forum brings together companies, banks, non-governmental organisations and governments all involved in central and eastern Europe. The forum has three aims: To help members pursue activities and investment benefiting the environment in eastern Europe. To provide members with a forum in which to exchange ideas and information. To offer members a framework for developing and implementing projects which promote growth while protecting the environment in eastern Europe. Fisher and Gordon Hughes, from London's Centre for Economic Research Policy, believe one aspect of the environmental problem is coming to an end. 'Liberalisation of prices means that enterprises and the consumer will use less energy,' said Fisher. 'The huge, mass emissions which we saw in eastern Europe over the past four decades will be phased out as industry is modernised. Those kinds of environmental problems will diminish,' he argued. But other problems will persist and new ones will emerge. Like the EBRD, Fisher is also aware that the economic reforms will bring new problems for the environment. 'Household waste will consist of more plastic packaging. The expanding tourist industry will also create more pressure on the environment. Closure of environmentally-damaging, and obsolete enterprises could meet resistance as the recession deepens,' explained Fisher. 'Addressing these problems will not be easy. But they cannot be ignored as eastern Europe attempts to integrate its economy with the west.'</p>

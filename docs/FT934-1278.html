			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Leading Article: UK training For roughly a decade there has been a strong consensus around the view that raising the skill level of its workforce is the UK's most important microeconomic priority. After a week which has brought the first sighting of skill shortages in the West Midlands, as well as a widely publicised attack on the new system of National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), it may seem that this consensus has not produced much in the way of worthwhile results. But given the structure of the UK labour market and the lack of the formal framework on which training is based in other countries, reform was always going to be a long haul. And the overall picture is less gloomy than recent news suggests. Britain now has, for the first time in its history, a national system for company-based training, in the shape of the employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils and the employer-devised NVQs. Both have their shortcomings, but they are not set in stone and can be improved with experience. They are also taking shape in a much more friendly environment than 10 years ago. Training budgets were cut less in this recession than in the last. And the latest Labour Force Survey finds that 2.8m employees of working age received job-related training in the four weeks prior to being interviewed, an increase of 69 per cent over 1984. Much of this training effort is being concentrated on elite groups, such as computer specialists, or takes the form of crash courses to compensate for the fact that initial training in middle range craft and technical skills is so poor. It is with the latter in mind that the government has now come up with a third leg to its training effort - a 'modern' apprenticeship scheme, to be launched in autumn 1995. This is a long time to wait, but at least the delay shows that the government is not seeking short-term political advantage. There is also enough time to work out an appropriate combination of public and private financing, something which in-company training has not had before. Indeed, the apprenticeship scheme might be an opportunity to experiment with German-style collective employer funding, topped up by public funds, in an effort to reduce the temptation for companies to poach skilled workers rather than train them. The fact that young people's wages are continuing to fall ought to help. The NVQ system needs refining: it should be more stringently tested and less job specific. For all its faults, though, the current training framework does try to integrate training with real business needs, something which the grandiose plans of the 1960s and 70s often failed to achieve. Handing training over to employers is not on its own a solution. Combined with financial incentives which encourage more employers to provide quality training, it can be. The government is still shuffling in the right direction.</p>

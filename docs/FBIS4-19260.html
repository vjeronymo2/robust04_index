			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with President Martti Ahtisaari by Kaa </F> Eneberg and Anders Mellbourn in Helsinki; no date given]    [Text] Helsinki -- Martti Ahtisaari does not intend to  stand on the sidelines watching during the Finnish referendum  campaign on the EU [European Union]. Using all the power of his  presidential office he will work for a "yes" to membership. He  expects to travel to South Africa before visiting Finland's  gigantic neighbor, Russia.    Much will be different with former UN official and diplomat  Martti Ahtisaari as the Republic of Finland's tenth president.  But not in the sense that as a result of the presidency's  presently more limited powers he will content himself with the  presidential role of only representing Finland.    On the contrary, he exudes a desire to work and a very  conscious desire to influence policy and the development of  society when he met DAGENS NYHETER for his first newspaper  interview since he entered office a little over a month ago.    He had already acquired a new authority in his behavior when  he received us in the Yellow Salon in the presidential palace by  the harbor in Helsinki. He has not opted for a solemn approach,  but it is already natural to address him using the formal form  for "you."    The 56 year old Ahtisaari still moves slowly, but has lost  13  kilograms since the election campaign and he joked about being  overweight and about the impression he sometimes gives of being  a little indolent and absent-minded:    "You forget that I use my resources as and when they are  needed. I am probably not oblivious of tactics either and know  about the need for timing with international diplomacy.    ``I too am in favor of more power for the Eduskunta. It is  natural for the political elite to want to strengthen the  Eduskunta. But at the same time there is a firm call from the  people for strong presidential powers,'' he said, clearly  approving and stressing that he has never been a political  innocent.    Despite the fact that the presidency stands above party  politics, he referred as a matter of course to the Social  Democrats as his party. During his first weeks as president he  has built up his own staff of aides, often with UN experience,  and set in motion regular discussions with the parties. When we  met him he had just had a visit from the National Coalition  Party.    During the election campaign his criticism of the  government's economic policy gave rise to questions because  domestic policy does not lie within the president's area of  competence. He explained his criticism by saying that it was  necessary in order to distinguish him from his opponent,  Elisabeth Rehn, in the final round, but said, not without some  satisfaction, that the government is currently preparing tax  cuts to stimulate the economy. He is happy with the favorable  push from his predecessor, Mauno Koivisto, who has predicted  that there will be "a better Finland" than today's Finland with  its half a million unemployed when Ahtisaari's term of office  expires in six years' time.    "Of course the question then is whether I will be able to  take the credit for this," he added.    Martti Ahtisaari wants to lead Finland into the EU and wants  Finland to be the first of the Nordic applicant nations to hold  its referendum -- by early October at the latest:    "I have nothing against Finland showing a little leadership.    ``My election campaign was something of a lecture tour about  the EU for which I should almost have received payment. I will  undoubtedly speak out warmly in favor of membership during the  referendum campaign.''    He believes in a special Nordic responsibility and  involvement in the EU and wants to develop Nordic cooperation on  the basis of the patterns which already exist today in the  United Nations where the Nordic area is most often seen as a  unit. He stressed the Nordic involvement in support of  democracy and economic growth in Russia and the Baltic region:    "In the EU, Sweden and Finland will have a special interest  in the EU's playing an active role in developments."    He admitted that there are differences in Finland's and  Sweden's policies toward the Baltic region, but he prefers to  stress what they have in common:    "We are both deeply involved and positively disposed. That  is the important thing."    He is prepared to go into battle about appointments to  public  posts which are often viewed in Finland as a system of political  rewards:    "I have told the parties that I do not want to read in the  newspapers that they have portioned out the appointments under  consideration among themselves," he said authoritatively.    "I want to be informed at an early stage and have urged the  parties to look for the best possible candidates for all the  posts and not just think about who they represent politically."    In the context of the question of future EU membership a  discussion has grown up with the parties about whether the  president or the government should represent Finland.    "I have to see to it that the responsibility for foreign  policy does not appear divided. It would be dangerous if it  looked as if it was the president who dealt with bilateral  contacts with the rest of the world and the government with  everything else. In relation to the EU the important thing is  that I will decide who will represent Finland . Here I will be  very pragmatic and decide what is most sensible in each  individual case."    His activism coupled with his critical distance to  traditional party politics could perhaps help to regain the  respect for politics which has largely been lost in Finland, as  elsewhere. In addition he is striving to achieve a new  folksiness in the presidency. Once a month he travels out into  the country to listen to people's worries, complaints, and  wishes.    His wife, Eeva, goes with him. But without having any  "Hillary ambitions" she has complained about the program of the  first trip they made. In future she will demand that her  husband must also take part in her program of visits to schools  and care institutions and not simply make industrial visits.    The first stories about his breakouts from presidential  isolation have already begun to be heard. He went to an  ordinary cinema showing of "Schindler's List" and the  projectionist was so beside himself that he mixed up the reels  of film.    His first engagement at the presidential residence at  Tamminiemi was a swing session with Count Basie's band for his  circle of friends who are interested in jazz. And when an  unemployed man complained during his first walkabout in the  country that he needed money to be able travel to visit his  fiancee he had one of his aides buy a return ticket for the  unfortunate man. He was not given any cash, however.    "That was probably the best thing we did," he said.    Relations with Russia were once a Finnish president's most  important responsibility. They were a very formal and solemn  business. Now the situation has been normalized, Martti  Ahtisaari stressed, mentioning appreciatively all the more  relaxed contacts between local authorities and individuals.    If he is worried about developments in Russia and the Baltic  regions, he hides it well. Unlike the Swedish prime minister he  seems more relieved that the time of shock therapy for Russia  seems to be over:    "When you pursue a policy of reform you have to have the  people with you. You can always theorize about what you want to  do. But if you want to keep a democratic system you must, in my  view, take a slower reform pace," he said, pointing to his  experience in the IMF's tough programs of savings in developing  countries.    The extremist Russian nationalist, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  had  just left Helsinki when we met the president. Martti Ahtisaari  said that he approved of the initiative to invite a Russian  delegation to discuss the democratic terms for membership in the  Council of Europe and pointed out that it is not up to the hosts  to decide which deputies the Duma's Foreign Affairs Committee  should choose to send. Ahtisaari's comment on Zhirinovskiy's  provocative statements and behavior was short:    "I think that it is useful both for Zhirinovskiy himself,  his aides, and his voters to see what reactions there are to his  behavior."    Part of the normalization of contacts with Russia is the  fact  that as yet the date for a first official visit has not been  set. It is even possible that Estonia will be higher up on the  list of visits, even though the sensitivity here is clearly  still the subject of consideration. And in any case he will --  unless something catastrophic happens in the elections -- pay a  visit to South Africa before going to Russia.    "My friends would not like it if I were not present at the  installation of a new president on 10 May," the former UN  commissioner for Namibia said.    But Martti Ahtisaari, like his predecessors, is paying his  very first visit abroad as the president of the republic to  Sweden and will arrive on Wednesday [13 April]. The special  relationship with Sweden continues to exist:    "We share a common history. It is not without reason that my  first state visit will be to Sweden. This is something  completely natural, and I could not have envisaged anything  different."    Martti Ahtisaari's own relationship with Sweden is also a  special one. In his working life he has been more Swedish than  his Finland Swedish opponent in the presidential election.    His background is purely Finnish and he found Swedish so  difficult at his Finnish high school in Oulu that he had to  repeat a year. But in 1960, as a 23 year old, he found  employment in a Swedish aid project in Pakistan. There he  learned his Swedish which is still excellent and began his work  as a Nordic-based UN aid official which has been his main career  since then.    When he told us about his Swedish friends and his early work  it was like a refresher course in the history of the personnel  of Swedish aid policy. He mentioned such foreground figures as  Sixten Heppling, Arne Bjornberg, Ernst Michanek, Anders Forsse,  and Bengt Save-Soderbergh. He said that he had been involved in  supplying idea's for Save-Soderbergh's study on improvements to  UN social programs.    His Nordic philosophy is founded on these experiences, and  not on the work of the Nordic Council or through party contacts  with Ingvar Carlsson and other top politicians. It was when he  was out in the big wide world that he realized that the Nordic  area is viewed as a unit. And it is through the Nordic area  that Finland must work:    "I have seen that Nordic cooperation is so important that  the  responsibility for it cannot be left to our Finland Swedish  friends alone."    This is why he will not simply be devoting his visit to  Sweden next week to representative courtesies. He will meet  Finns who live in Sweden on factory floors and in schools and  will discuss the conditions under which they live in Sweden. He  thinks that they should have a special position, but does not  seem to want to make any capital out of their wish to be counted  as a linguistic minority in Sweden.    At the Foreign Policy Institute he will also deliver a  lecture on Finland, its Nordic neighbors, and Europe:    "But don't ask what I intend to say. We are still working on  the speech and it probably will not be ready until immediately  before I leave."</p>

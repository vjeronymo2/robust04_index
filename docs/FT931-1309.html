			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / People: Sellars seizes his chance Ian Sellars, who made it as a partner with Europe's largest law firm Clifford Chance six years ago at the age of 32, is quitting to join one of his longstanding clients, Schroder Ventures. Sellars, who acknowledges the move is highly unusual, says that 'being a lawyer can be quite frustrating. You are constantly near the sharp end but a lot of the really important decisions have actually been made by the time you become involved'. He will become the twelfth partner at the venture capital arm of merchant bank Schroders, which specialises in medium-sized to large buy-outs. Managing partner Jon Moulton says that despite the recession, his outfit has seen one of its busiest 12 month periods ever. He said he expected Sellars to become 'a general purpose partner - he's not coming here to keep the law library'. One of the few other cases of a law firm losing a partner in a similar move is that of Victor Blank, a partner at Clifford Turner, as it then was, moving to Charterhouse, where he is now chairman. Linda Collier, Karen Cook, Lester Gray, John Kinsella, Paul Mullins, Vincent Oratore (joining from Linklaters &amp; Paines), and Elizabeth Warren have been appointed directors of J Henry Schroder Wagg &amp; Co. Gerry Aherne is appointed a director of Schroder Investment Management, and Mark Smith a director of Schroder Capital Management International.</p>

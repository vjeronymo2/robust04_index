			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / International Company News: Aker warns of lower full-year earnings Aker, the Norwegian oil and gas technology and cement and building materials group, has announced weaker results for the first eight months of the year and warned of a lower annual profit. Group pre-tax profit slipped to NKr358m (Dollars 53.45m) from NKr526m as sales dipped to NKr11bn from NKr11.9bn. Operating profit fell to NKr441m from NKr518m. The result was in line with analysts' expectations, however. The decline was due to a lower activity in oil and gas technology - particularly by Norwegian Contractors (NC) and Aker Engineering - which will post a significantly lower result in 1994. Aker also warned of weaker offshore activities in 1995. NC faces a substantial reduction in business due to changes in market conditions and will cut the number of its employees to 300 in 1995 from 2,000. Domestic and international cement and building materials markets are experiencing growth - after a four-year lull - which will improve the division's 1994 result. 'Even though the upturn is modest, this has a significant impact on profits as a result of restructuring and cost-efficiency measures undertaken by Aker in recent years,' it explained. The cement and building materials division achieved sales of NKr4.16bn against NKr3.91bn as pre-tax profit rose to NKr211m from NKr191m. Aker expects the improvement to continue. The oil and gas technology division's sales fell to NKr6.39bn from NKr7.48bn as pre-tax profit declined to NKr156m from NKr343m. At the end of the eight-month period, the division's order book stood at NKr6.4bn, down from NKr10bn at the end of 1993, due to lower activity in the domestic offshore sector and postponement of several new development projects. NC, which builds concrete oil and gas platforms for the offshore sector, saw eight-month sales fall sharply to NKr2.1bn from NKr3bn and plunged into a pre-tax loss of NKr5m from a profit of NKr160m.</p>

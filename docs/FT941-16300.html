			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Major's deadly mantra Back to basics has become the defining slogan of a morally bankrupt government. This was unintentional. The three fateful words were perhaps too carelessly written into a speech prepared for Mr John Major last year. The purpose was to pander to the mood of October's Conservative party conference. The tacky little device worked. The party leader kept his job. A difficult week passed without serious mishap. That should have been the end of it. In a sane polity the phrase would have been returned to the file of political cliches, to be retrieved only in emergency. This prime minister should be so lucky. 'Back to basics' has become a deadly mantra, meaning whatever the hearer chooses to believe. This week it is bouncing about the media, postponing yet again, perhaps for ever, the time when the present British government will regain the respect of its electorate. We may question whether Mr Major is held in such persistent contempt because he is a weak politician, or, as an alternative, a politician in a weak position. The latter, more charitable, explanation is supported by his courageous policy for Northern Ireland, not to mention his steadfast navigation by the fixed star of low inflation. He has other, less universally celebrated, achievements to his credit, not the least of which was the negotiation of and legislation for the Maastricht treaty. By hook and by crook he has kept the Tories in one party, although to say that he has united them would be a truth of the same order as his assertion in April 1992 that he would not increase taxation. What he has not been able to do is provide intellectual coherence, a philosophical justification for his social policies. Thinking such ponderous thoughts through to a satisfactory conclusion is not his strength. That is why he is imprudent to play around with the dangerous 'back to basics'. To the Puritan right this piece of nonsense appears to mean that ministers in Mr Major's government who are guilty of sexual misconduct must resign. There are monastries in which the penalty is less severe. On Sunday Mr Major tried to explain himself on BBC television's Breakfast with Frost. He was not in favour of a witch-hunt against people who behaved in a foolish fashion, although where people patently behaved badly then it was perfectly proper that they shouldn't remain in a public position. These are the weasel words of the wily whip; they do not win anyone's respect. To be fair, the prime minister was in a corner. Even his home secretary, Mr Michael Howard, found the Jesuitical wriggling at which he is usually so adept difficult yesterday. 'Back to Basics' in his view certainly included individual responsibility, but not those matters which were more the responsibility of the pulpit than politicians . . . It would be a joke, were it not for the victims. Mr Tim Yeo, the former environment minister, was unjustly sacrificed. His private life was, and remains, his own business. He was capable in office, but sadly destroyed by a lethal phrase not of his own making. If he was now to resign his seat, he would precipitate a by-election. The government might lose. Marvellous. The damage to the Conservatives would have been self-inflicted, and thoroughly deserved. Others extend the phrase to include financial impropriety, the appearance although not the actuality of which led to the prompt resignation of Mr Alan Duncan, a minister's parliamentary bag-carrier. This is surely a jest. Britain's genteel forms of corruption have become entrenched in the constitution. The sale of honours, the payments to Conservative party funds by companies headed by the recipients, the fattening-up of redundant officials for transfer to the lucrative private sector, the boardroom chairs for the ex-ministers who when in office supervised the process - all of these wholly legal Italian practices would be swept away by a truly honest application of 'back to basics'. Mr Major, who apparently believes that it would be more damaging to abandon the slogan than to persist with its use, has another interpretation. He wants 'neighbourliness, courtliness, courtesy,' he told Sir David Frost. 'We need those community values back.' They were taken away by the Tories. The Conservative government has destroyed local authorities and local communities, by centralising power in Whitehall and farming out jobs in non-elected quangos to party supporters. Let us give it one more try. 'Back to basics,' Mr Major said on Sunday, was designed to meet the fears of ordinary people about unemployment, rising crime, lower standards in education, and the instability of institutions such as the monarchy and the church. Oh yes? The social disintegration that the prime minister describes so well has occurred under the management of a single party, in office for the past 15 years. A rise in unemployment was a necessary consequence of Mr Major's counter-inflation strategy, as his former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, once famously indicated. Rising crime certainly does have everyone worried, Mr Howard so much so that he has taken refuge in posturing as the hard home secretary, tough on criminals. He has no credible strategy for reducing the number of burglaries, assaults and car thefts. For that we must look to Labour's Mr Tony Blair. The Conservatives have an excellent strategy for education, the execution of which they have persistently botched since it was introduced by Mr Kenneth Baker in 1988. Mr Major's fault is that he has kept on Mr John Patten, a singularly inept secretary for education. Mr Patten, a high priest of moralism, managed last spring to have upset everyone - the left, the right, the centre, the trade unions, teachers, parents - even, it is said in the long corridors, his own permanent secretary. He may be rescued by Sir Ron Dearing, brought in to advise him, plus a new top civil servant. But nothing would carry education more convincingly 'back to basics' than the appointment of a competent minister. In short, the government has been in office too long. It cannot be blamed for the instability of the monarchy, or the church, but only one party has been in charge while the sense of community has been destroyed, crime has risen, and educational standards have not. 'Back to basics' is the Tories' last excuse.</p>

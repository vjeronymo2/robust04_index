			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Hong Kong Domestic issues are set to command greater interest over the coming weeks, as the interim reporting season unrolls and a signal on the state of the colony's property market is delivered at tomorrow's land auction, writes Louise Lucas. Brokers say fears of a US interest rate rise have now been largely discounted and a clutch of good results from the corporates and a show of healthy demand at the land auction stand to nudge the Hang Seng index upwards. Turnover is likely to remain above the lows of around HKDollars 2bn witnessed earlier in the month. The land to be offered for sale is not considered by analysts to be especially good, but the auction itself will be the first since May 26 - when developers bid together in big consortia to secure two parcels of land at prices markedly lower than market expectations. The government last week adopted a mild set of measures aimed at preventing a recurrence. Companies due to report their results this week include Wheelock, the Hong Kong corporate empire of the late Sir Yue-kong Pao, which will announce its finals on Thursday.

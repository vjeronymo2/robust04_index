			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: VW set for management changes SWEEPING changes in the top management of Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, are expected to be approved at a meeting of the company's supervisory board next month. Speculation about the outcome of the March 16 sitting revived yesterday when officials of the Lower Saxony government claimed that Mr Ferdinand Piech, the new VW chairman, had enticed Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriotua to quit his job at General Motors of the US. Mr Lopez moved within GM from Europe to Detroit last year, taking with him a reputation as a hard-bargaining cost-cutter. He was recently promoted to vice-president and group executive in charge of worldwide purchasing. GM denied the reports. 'He is not leaving. He is happy here and is staying here', the company said. However, Mr Piech has already had marked success in poaching key GM managers. Before he left his former job as head of Audi, he brought in Mr Jurgen Gebhardt, former manager of Opel's car plant in Eisenach, as director responsible for production at the upmarket VW subsidiary. Mr Erich Schmitt, another GM manager, was given a boardroom seat and responsibility for purchasing and finance. Yesterday's reports that Mr Lopez was to join VW were given extra credibility by their origins. The Lower Saxony government, with 20 per cent of the shares, is VW's largest stockholder and is represented with several seats on the supervisory board. Other changes expected at the board meeting include the replacement of Mr Dieter Ullsperger, finance director, and directors responsible for legal affairs and the environment. Mr Daniel Goeudevert, deputy to Mr Piech and responsible for the Volkswagen brand, is expected to be given other day-to-day responsibilities. Deteriorating conditions in VW's markets were underlined yesterday by the announcement that group sales worldwide fell more than 16 per cent in January. Incoming orders were still unsatisfactory, the company said, and short-time working was likely to be continued into the second quarter of this year.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Arts: Scenes from Constable's sketchbook - Susan Moore draws attention to the intimate masterpieces which are so easily overlooked Blockbuster exhibitions are not an easy place to consider drawings. Monochrome, uniformly hung in bland museum mounts and frames, they inevitably appear like dowdy poor relations; there are always expanses of luscious oil paint urging us on. In the case of John Constable, there are bravura oil sketches and watercolours vying for our attention too. Beside his showy, revolutionary Academy six-footers like 'The Leaping Horse' and 'The Hay-Wain', his pencil drawings are all too easily overlooked. For this reason the relatively small show at Dulwich Picture Gallery, believed to be the first solely devoted to Constable as a draughtsman, is especially rewarding. The bulk of the exhibition is drawn from the collection of David Thomson, grandson of Roy Thomson, founder of the Canadian media empire. His is the largest holding of Constable drawings outside the V&amp;A, and it is aired in public for the first time here. Dulwich's narrow exhibition galleries make for a sympathetic setting in which to study these often intimately-scaled and always heart-felt landscape studies - and they repay our scrutiny handsomely. Constable was a slow developer. An introductory section shows him throughout his 20s and 30s trying his hand at the various styles of some dozen contemporary draughtsmen. In 'A Farmhouse by a River', he is emulating his first tutor, JT 'Antiquity' Smith, borrowing the drawing master's looping pen and ink line and his taste for coloured tints. In an expansive panorama of a wooded landscape, the distant trees are simply outlined in pencil, a la Joseph Farington. 'Chalk Church' sees him adopt the nervous, Canaletto-ish line of Richard Wilson. In 'A Lane near East Bergholt', the density of foliage of the trees is conveyed by Gainsborough's rapid diagonal lines of shading using the softest graphite. It is only on the pages of the pocket sketchbooks of 1813 and 1814 that Constable comes into his own, responding to his native Suffolk landscape with an original and distinctive voice. The tiny sheets - 3 by 4 inches, sometimes slightly larger - of these and later sketchbooks are the gems of the show. On these pages Constable the draughtsman achieved the extraordinary feat of combining painterly breadth and particularity. He formulates a shorthand that finds exact visual equivalents for the information he is intent on recording. Topography, time of day and weather conditions are thus precisely rendered. We can judge exactly the distance to the knoll of trees or the incline of a bank, and comprehend the lie of the land of the rapidly noted panorama beyond and the cursorily abbreviated figures or cattle in the foreground. A distant rain-squall is rendered by a faint scribble of vertical lines, a flock of birds in flight by the merest dots of varying density. A keen eye for the effects of light and shadow and an infinite variety of touch enlivens the surface of each landscape or tree, note 'The Great Alder in Leadenhall Garden'. Constable referred to these sketches as 'my memoranda'. These vignettes have an immediacy and sense of place that bring them to life. Interestingly, Constable's shorthand never appears formulaic. He seems to respond to each scene afresh. Unusually, he also chose to depict landscape as he found it, without wanting to elevate it as high art. Most of the drawings in the exhibition are intimate pencil studies made directly from nature, memoranda that formed the basis of Constable's studio paintings for the rest of his life. There are working drawings made during the development of the composition of major oils, 'Stratford Mill' and 'Hadleigh Castle'; a pencil portrait; strange, dense iron-gall ink sketches for a book illustration; and a proof mezzotint for his English Landscape of 1832, almost completely worked over in thunderous wash and white heightening. By now, Constable had, at long last, been elected as a full Royal Academician, his beloved wife had died leaving seven children and there was little opportunity for sketching in the countryside. The show closes with a relaxed and open 'Dowles Brook', executed during a rare expedition to Worcester taken in 1835 to deliver three lectures on the history of landscape. In this Constable employs a whole vocabulary of pencil marks, from flicks of the pencil point and soft hatching to using the dark, chiselled edge of the graphite, but the intensity of his earlier vision is dimmed. The exhibition continues at the Dulwich Picture Gallery until October 16, and travels to the Frick Collection in New York in November and to the Art Gallery of Ontario in May 1995</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 16 May -- The Abkhazian Liberation Union  brought an action at the Georgian Supreme Court for instituting  criminal proceedings against Eduard Shevardnadze, head of the  Georgian state, on the basis of Clause 65 of the Criminal Law of  the Republic of Georgia. The clause deals with the betrayal of  the country manifested in the fight against the country's  territorial integrity and independence. The above-mentioned  action was caused by the Georgian delegation's signing of the  agreement reached at the Georgian-Abkhaz talks in Moscow.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Tension stalks Algerians in Paris: Moslems in France fear a civil war backlash There was an air of unease yesterday in the Cafe du Dome in Barbes, a district in northern Paris with a large Algerian community. The Christmas hijacking of an Air France airliner by Islamic militants and the murder of three French priests in Algeria on Tuesday dominated conversation. 'It is tragic what is happening, Algeria is being torn apart,' said Hamid, a mechanic who moved to France in the mid-1980s. He fears that his new homeland is being dragged increasingly into Algeria's civil war between the government and Islamic militants, and is concerned about the implications for France's Algerian community, which numbers more than 1m, and for other Moslem groups in France. 'We are worried that the troubles will come to France and build a feeling of hostility towards ordinary Moslems,' says one of Hamid's friends as he grinds his Gauloise into an ashtray. Such concerns among France's Moslems have been fuelled over recent months by a series of crackdowns on suspected Islamic militants by Mr Charles Pasqua, the hardline interior minister. Mr Pasqua, determined to prevent the spread of the Algerian conflict to France, has launched a series of security measures since the summer, from stop and search operations to the expulsion of suspected Moslem radicals. Mr Pasqua believes that France's Moslem community has been infiltrated by extremists. In raids last month, he claimed to have smashed an international support network for the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), the most militant opponents of the Algerian government, which perpetrated the Christmas hijack and the killing of the priests. Most Moslems play down the threat from extremists in France. 'There is little support for them. And I think there are very few here,' said one delegate to last week's congress of the Union of French Islamic Organisations. Many Moslem groups, such as the National Council of French Moslems, endorsed the storming of the Air France airliner in which the four hijackers were killed. They also backed French policy towards Algiers. 'France is the best-placed western country to play a significant role in the search for a democratic solution to the Algerian drama,' the council said. There are, however, growing concerns about attitudes to Moslems in France. 'First there have been the security crackdowns, then there was the banning on wearing headscarves in classrooms,' says Yusef, a student from Nanterre, near Paris. The relationship between France and its Moslem community remains fragile. 'The Moslems in France are a disparate community and France has still not come to terms with its Algerian history,' says Mr Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute for Foreign Affairs. The relationship may face further strains, particularly if the number of immigrants from Algeria increases. Demands for political asylum from France's former colony are rising steadily, according to the French Office for the Protection of Refugees. In November 300 Algerians applied to France for asylum, more than 20 per cent higher than in October and double the June figure. With urban problems already a serious social concern and with political parties of the extreme right firmly opposed to immigration, the concerns of Hamid and his friends could become more acute.</p>

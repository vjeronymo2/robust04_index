			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Canary Wharf tenant loses case A HIGH Court judge yesterday rejected a lawsuit against the administrators of Canary Wharf by Bear Stearns, a US investment bank that occupies 20,000 sq ft of the London Docklands development, Vanessa Houlder writes. Bear Stearns claimed that it was entitled to rescind its Canary Wharf lease because Olympia &amp; York, the developer, had breached its agreement to pay the rent on Bear Stearns' former premises at Devonshire Square. Mr Justice Morritt concluded in the High Court that there had been no breach. O&amp;Y commonly offered to take responsibility for a tenant's old premises as an incentive to move to Canary Wharf.</p>

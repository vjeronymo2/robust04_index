			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Bardin and Aleksandr Volynets: "Foreign </F> Economic Regulation in Playing the Swan, the Crab, and the Pike"]    [Text] Two weeks ago, we wrote about how Russian  departments are mastering economic methods of regulating foreign  economic activity. This week the former unity was no longer  there. The government decree "On Coordination Organs on  Currency-Financial Questions," in spite of its conciliatory  name, by eliminating the currency-economics commission, could  aggravate the age-old interdepartmental dispute about access to  the distribution of Western credit. At the meeting of the  government commission on operational issues, the latest version  of the new import tariff was approved, and in parallel the GTK  [State Customs Committee] with its instruction, "On Exemption  From Payment of Customs Duties of the Russian Fund for Disabled  Veterans of the War in Afghanistan," is legalizing the almost  forgotten but still no less attractive practice of granting  customs benefits just like that--for an organization. As a  result, there are gaps in the system of regulation, of which  participants in foreign economic activity could very well take  advantage.  <H3>  The Ministry of Finance Has Its Own Credit, and the Ministry  of Foreign Economic Relations Has Its Own </H3>   The restructuring of the government apparatus, which was  brought about by the reduction by half of the number of deputy  prime ministers, was reflected particularly in the elimination  of the currency-economic commission, "because the tasks assigned  to it had been performed." This wording, unfortunately, does not  mean that there is no centralized currency left at all. It comes  from two main sources: exports credited to state quotas and  foreign credits. The former is under the jurisdiction of the  Ministry of Finance, as the holder of budget funds. It has the  firm intention of taking control of and distributing Western  credit granted to Russia. But in practice, although the  conclusion of the Ministry of Finance will be taken into account  in each specific case, the old method is most likely to be used:  the submission of the question at the level of some collegial  government organ. And it will have to weigh the claims of the  departments, that is, at least a deputy prime minister will have  to head this commission. Of the available deputy prime  ministers, only Oleg Soskovets is suitable for playing this  role, and he is already in charge of a commission on operational  issues, which will actually expand its authority.    For now the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations [MFER],  under whose wing the Russian Export-Import Bank (Roseksimbank)  is being created, will provide an example of independent  extension of lines of credit. While Roseksimbank must initially  grant ruble credit to producers of export products, in the  future it will not be prohibited from drawing to itself some of  the credit of "related" Western banks, in whose distribution the  MFER will not have the last word. The credit priorities of the  MFER have already been determined: joint-stock companies and  state enterprises under its jurisdiction.  <H3>  The New Import Tariff Has Not Even Been Adopted, but Ways  Around It Have Already Been Devised </H3>   At the meeting of the commission on operational questions,  which in principle approved the new import tariff to take effect  on 15 March, it was stated that the average level of customs  rates ranges from 7.5 to 18 percent. On the whole, the rates are  simply being increased. But, according to the assessment of the  deputy minister of economics, Sergey Vasilyev, the lobbies of  the Russian automotive and aircraft builders are committing  "highway robbery" with their high offensive import duties. Thus,  to the traditional commodity groups that enjoy increased customs  protection--alcohol and liquor products, motor vehicles,  electric household appliances, equipment for petroleum and gas  extraction (such is the condition for receiving the associated  credit from the American Export-Import Bank)--they may also add  aircraft (recently Russian airline companies have preferred  Boeing), products of the textile industry, and foodstuffs. The  struggle of the branch representatives is not over, and the  question of the customs tariff is to be considered again at a  meeting of the government next Thursday. Moreover, the influence  of branch lobbies is apparently becoming a permanent thing: At  the meeting it was suggested that they create a Tariff-Customs  Council, which would be authorized to work out operational  changes in the rates of customs tariffs (the government would  still make the final decision). But customs duties are not the  only thing affecting the dynamic of imports. In January, when  exchange rates were favorable for imports, new excise taxes led  to an absolute reduction of imports as compared to January of  last year. It cannot be ruled out that on 15 March the  inevitable (although, possibly, partial) successes of the  supporters of raising rates of the import tariff for certain  branches of industry will be accompanied by a marked decline of  the ruble, which will make import activity a losing proposition.  But not for everyone.    The GTK has returned the benefits to disabled Afghanistan  veterans, the same ones that were taken away last July in  compliance with the law on the customs tariff. This time the  basis for the decision of the GTK was the president's edict, "On  Measures for State Support for the Activity of All-Russian  Public Associations of Disabled Persons." Yet under that same  law (Article 34) the newly granted benefits "may not be of an  individual nature." The benefits were localized by concrete  contracts. It is an important precedent, however: A breach has  been made in customs barriers that worsen conditions mainly for  import activity, which in principle may be utilized by more than  disabled Afghanistan veterans. The technology is well known:  variations on the theme of sale of contracts and supplements to  them as futures. But the main thing is that the Afghanistan  veterans have laid a path that can now be widened, and importers  and exporters have been given a point for application of their  efforts.</p>

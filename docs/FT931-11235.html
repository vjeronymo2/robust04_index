			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Italians return to loans market ITALIAN borrowers are returning to the international syndicated loans market after an absence of several months. So far, a handful of medium and long-term credit institutions has tapped the loans market with relatively small deals, but bankers expect several more financial institutions and some corporate names to seek international syndicated credits over the next six months because of their relatively heavy borrowing needs. While the cost to Italian borrowers of raising money from international banks is in some cases higher than in early 1992, bankers believe that as more Italian names return to the market, pricing on Italian deals should start to edge lower. Italian borrowers have been virtually barred from the syndicated loans market since last July when Efim, the state industrial holding group, went into liquidation. Italian and foreign banks are owed L9,500bn (Dollars 6.22bn). Initially, the Treasury proposed to repay the Efim loans using bonds with below-market interest rates, in a deal which was resisted by the banks. The Treasury has now agreed to repayment in full, although international banks are still waiting for their money. The Efim debacle meant that few international banks were willing to lend to Italian names  - which have traditionally been frequent users of the Euromarkets  - in the second half of last year. However, now that some bankers are satisfied that the problems concerning Efim will be resolved, Italian borrowers are eagerly seeking funds in the international syndicated loans market. Some of the deals launched in the last few weeks have been quite generously priced, bankers said, in order to woo back lenders. For example, Meliorconsorzio launched a DM37m seven-year loan paying a margin of 75 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and participation fees of 30 basis points for DM4m amounts. One of the banks involved said that, as this was one of the first 'post-Efim' Italian deals to be launched, the deal carried a slight premium, and reflected the market's perception of the borrower's creditworthiness. The deal was successfully syndicated with the amount increased to DM57m. More tightly priced was Monte dei Paschi di Siena's loan, originally set at Ecu 50m but raised to Ecu 110m. Bankers appeared content with the margin of 52.5-57.5 basis points over Libor and the maturity of 10 1/2 years, despite initial concern that the terms might prove too tight. Since the completion of these deals, other Italian names have come to the market. Mediocredito Lombardo, a medium-term credit institution, has launched a Dollars 50m, two-year loan paying 35 basis points over Libor, which lead manager Sumitomo has said may be increased to Dollars 100m. Other borrowers include Credito Fondiario e Industriale, which has launched a five-year Ecu100m loan priced at 65 basis points over Libor with participation fees of between 22.5-37.5 basis points, and Istituto Nazionale per il Credito Edilizio, a medium-term mortgage institution.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No favourable treatment Sir, I do not wish to become involved in a public debate with the leader of Camden Council (Letters, January 17), but Richard Arthur's claim that the City of Westminster receives favourable treatment from the government must be refuted. Mr Arthur should consider instead the possibility that it is Westminster's efficient and business-like approach that sets our two boroughs apart. Since April, government support has reflected the taxable base of each borough and, on that basis, Westminster's grant was less than that of most other London boroughs - less even than Camden's. Despite this, we announced a Band D tax of just Pounds 295 compared with Pounds 718 in Camden. This reflected, among other things, Westminster's competitive tendering programme, which saves Pounds 10m a year, while also improving standards through enhanced contract specification. In addition, we have recently streamlined the centre of our organisation enabling us to concentrate more of our resources on front-line services. These achievements, among many others like them, are the true 'Westminster story'. Miles Young, leader of the council, City of Westminster, Westminster City Hall, 64 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6QP</p>

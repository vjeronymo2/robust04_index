			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (7): The Russians are coming - Commercial rivalry is flowering in space ALMOST HIDDEN in the long list of space collaborations agreed in June by Presidents Bush and Yeltsin at their Washington summit was one that could have more economic impact than the rest put together: Russia can now bid for contracts to launch US-built telecommunications satellites. At a stroke, Russia could become the most powerful recent entrant into an industry that has attracted the interest of many countries. Its impact will be all the greater because many in the list of hopefuls, such as Japan and Brazil, have encountered technical and budgetary problems or trade barriers that have slowed their progress towards commercial sale of launches. Russia is in a good position to compete with established launch organisations. It has six different rocket launchers on offer. The biggest, the Proton, can lift large satellites into geostationary orbits, which is usually necessary for telecommunications and satellite broadcasting. Russia could make its presence felt quickly, driven by a need for hard currency and the immediate availability of its technology. It has already this year offered Proton to Inmarsat, the international consortium which operates satellites for mobile communications. However, obstacles still remain in the path of the Russian Space Agency. Apart from the economic instability, the main rocket launch site is in another country, Kazakhstan, which has set up its own space agency. Progress has been made in recent weeks. In June, the two apparently came to an agreement over the joint use of Baikonur. If Russia is on the point of joining an elite group of nations which can offer commercial launches, it will soon find itself competing with some well-entrenched opposition. Ariane is the world's most successful commercial satellite launcher. Operated by the French-led Arianespace consortium, it claims to have launched more than three quarters of the world's commercial satellites. The company last year had sales of FFr5.87bn, is profitable and is designing the next generation of launch vehicle, the Ariane V. The first launch is expected in 1995 with commercial operations set to start a year later. Arianespace's biggest rivals are in the fragmented US market. Seven years ago there were only two serious contenders in the space launch business: the US Space Shuttle, built by Nasa, and Ariane. Then came the Challenger disaster in 1986 and the announcement by Nasa that the Space Shuttle not be used for commercial space launches. A flood of launch orders for the private sector followed. Ariane was the main beneficiary, but three US defence companies also picked up business: Martin Marietta, McDonnell-Douglas and General Dynamics. Partly as a result of their late entry into the business, however, the US companies lag far behind Ariane in the value of commercial orders they are winning today. They have also been cushioned from the need to rely on commercial orders by defence contracts. McDonnell-Douglas, for example, is still launching satellites for the US military's Global Positioning System, a network of satellites that allowed allied forces to navigate across the featureless desert in the Gulf war. Of the company's 11 launches this year, only three are commercial. 'Could we afford to stand on our own without the military? I don't think so,' says one senior executive at McDonnell-Douglas. The three US companies might find it hard to reduce their dependence on the military, where they are protected from foreign competition, by plunging further into the civil sector. Prices there threaten to reach new lows as the likes of China and Russia enter the fray. Typical of the fall in launch costs brought by more competition is the Chinese Long March III rocket. This month it is scheduled to take into orbit an Australian communications satellite at a cost of about Dollars 30m, compared with more than Dollars 50m for a US or Ariane launch. China is not the only country attracted by the possibility of chunky dollar earnings from space. Governments also like the idea because they believe it will help in developing missiles. Rocket technology is basically simple - to create a controlled explosion at one end of a metal tube - and available in theory without recourse to the latest in western high technology. So there are many countries at various stages in the race to build launchers. India launched a satellite in May shortly after Washington imposed limited sanctions against the Russian and Indian space organisations. The US objected to Russia's proposed sale of rocket technology which India says is for its space programme but the US thinks could be used for ballistic missiles. Japan has intended to test launch its H-2 rocket in February next year. But Japan has chosen an unusually advanced design and has had persistent difficulties in test firings. Israel whose Jericho 2 military missile has been converted for space use as the Shavit and has successfully launched small test satellites. Brazil, which has its Veiculo Lancador de Satellites (VLS) booster, based on the Sonda 4 rocket. Its development has been stifled by technical and budgetary problems and Western technology-transfer controls. Other countries reported to have space programmes include Iraq, North Korea and Argentina. That such programmes will find commercial customers is unquestioned. The satellite services market is an immature industry that is growing quickly despite the worldwide economic slowdown. Telecommunications is still by far the largest area of application for civil satellites. New customers include third world countries eager to leapfrog the technology of copper cabling. Satellite telecommunications appeals to physically large countries, perhaps with many islands or difficult terrain, where cabling would be expensive. In June, a McDonnell-Douglas rocket launched Indonesia's fourth telecommunications satellite in its second launch programme. The third launch programme is already scheduled for the mid-1990s. Satellite broadcasting is a much smaller business, but growing quickly thanks partly to European deregulation. Observation satellites are among the industry's favourites for sharp growth through the 1990s. They are used to forecast weather, keep track of changing surface temperature and other environmental applications. Importantly, earth observation from space is seen by the military as a better value for money than thinly spread ground personnel. More emphasis is being placed on earth observation in the post-Cold War world where the US, UK and France increasingly see their roles as global. The UK defence White Paper in July made explicit the UK's interest in widening its defence activities to more than just Europe and the North Atlantic. For that reason, in the US satellites are taking an increasing proportion of defence spending. 'The space budget is holding steady while other budgets are falling', says the US Air Force space procurement division in Los Angeles. And military cash means that the US launcher manufacturers can afford to invest in new fuels, re-usable launchers and air-launched rockets. With these developments they may be able to cut costs low enough eventually to compete with the likes of Russia while maintaining the reliability of US and Ariane launches. This perhaps helps explain why the US launch industry is sanguine about the threat of the Russian and Chinese launch industries: it can continue to rely on defence contracts while developing the technology that will allow it one day to compete for civil contracts on its own terms.</p>

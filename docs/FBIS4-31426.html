			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by T. Cela: "Caution and Speculation Over the </F> Kosova Issue -- Serbs Propose Dialogue Between Foreign  Ministers"]    [Text] Something is moving in Serb Albanian relations.  This time, as TANJUG reported on 2 June, it is the self-styled  Yugoslavia that wishes to suggest to Albania the start of a  dialogue at foreign-minister level. The Yugoslav Government  outlined relations between the two countries and entrusted the  Foreign Ministry with "renewing the proposal for dialogue."    Dialogue between Prishtina and Belgrade began to take up  column inches in the press especially after the visit of the  British minister Douglas Hogg, who announced after his talks  with the Serbian leader Milosevic that the latter was ready to  talk with representatives from Kosova about the restitution of  some kind of autonomy similar to that of 1974, while stressing  again that he categorically cannot allow a change in the borders  of Yugoslavia.    The two Albanian leaders Rugova and Berisha showed a  readiness for dialogue months ago, but always conditional on the  presence of a third party. Meanwhile, Rugova is continuing his  visit to a series of European countries, holding meetings with  high-level officials of these countries, and holding fast to the  view of an independent and neutral Kosova. Rugova proposes a  civil protectorate as a transitional phase in order to avert  conflict.    In this situation, when a gentle, softening breeze has begun  to blow across the diplomatic landscape, daily life in Kosova  has not changed in the least. In Prishtina, the Serbian police  continue to beat and maltreat Albanian political activists.  Rugova, speaking to Deutsche Welle, called this repression an  attempt to publicly weaken the position of Kosovar diplomacy.  Rugova also stressed that it is unlikely that dialogue with the  Serbian side will be imminent.    Meanwhile, some British and Serbian newspapers have recently  reported secret meetings between some Albanian and Serbian  representatives at a foreign embassy. According to these  newspapers, these talks have involved the Serbian Socialist  Markovic, the Kosovar journalist and intellectual Veton Surroi,  and Fehmi Agani, deputy Chairman of the Kosova Democratic  Alliance. It is said that Markovic proposed to these two  Albanians talks about education and health, etc., with the aim  of normalizing relations between the Republic of Serbia and the  Albanians of Kosova. All these proposals contradict what is  happening in Albanian everyday life, and it seems that Rugova is  right when he says that "The Serbs want to publicly weaken our  position."    The British newspaper THE GUARDIAN quotes one Western  diplomat as saying "There are movements of several kinds, but it  sometimes seems to me that we are trying to bore a tunnel with a  needle."    The Kosovar leader Agani, said to have taken part in the  secret talks, nevertheless recently said that "If we are told  that we must be part of Serbia, this is the same as telling us  to continue to suffer under Serbian rule. This idea has no  future." Agani thus conclusively proved that he continues to be  Rugova's right-hand man.    In the meantime, Albania, although its parliament  unanimously  recognized the Republic of Kosova, is showing itself to be  increasingly cautious in its statements. The only joint  statement issued by Albanian and Kosovar leaders and diplomats  is that "Albania favors Albanian-Serb dialogue, in the presence  of a third party." This caution in Albanian policy is a result  of a kind of pressure exerted by international diplomacy on  Albania, so that Albania may exert influence in softening the  Albanian radical factions across the border. At a news  conference one week ago, the Albanian Sooialist leaders called  the policy over the issue of Kosova pursued by the leaders in  power today a failure. However, this cannot be said now that  Tirana is following from behind the steps of international  diplomacy concerning the destiny of Kosova, and has conflict  avoidance as the foundation of its policy.</p>

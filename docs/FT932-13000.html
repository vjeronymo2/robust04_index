			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Where the main thrust of the DTI's new competitive policy will be focused ...: Exports PROOF that the DTI's new compet-itiveness strategy is working will lie in a lasting improvement in Britain's unhealthy balance of trade. Boosting exports - with the help of the DTI - lies at the centre of any strategy to achieve long-term economic recovery. The department's responsibilities for encouraging exports - Britain already sells abroad 25 per cent of what it produces - is consequently being given high priority under Mr Richard Needham, trade minister. There has been a spate of recent initiatives aimed at assisting an export-led revival, including a boost to export insurance cover, lower insurance premiums, DTI-led export campaigns and the reorganisation of the department's Overseas Projects Board, whose remit it is to support the fight for big export projects. Two years ago a partnership was also forged between the DTI and the Foreign Office, intended to improve exporting back-up around the world. According to one DTI official: 'The FO no longer sees trade as second-rate.' Although details remain under wraps, Mr Heseltine is also in the process of finalising a internal restructuring of the DTI's export support operations, which now cost the taxpayer Pounds 170m a year - excluding the bill for trade aid. He says his plans will extend to much more than 'moving chairs' and will further sharpen up exporting services. In the meantime, the private sector is being called upon to play its part in the shape of so-called export promoters, drawn on secondment from companies and brought in to give the benefit of their experience to others. Mr Heseltine dismisses the concept of office-bound civil servants imploring companies to 'get off your bottoms and go out there'. The answer, he says, is to recruit people who have spent their careers selling overseas and who can teach others how to do it. About 25 full-time promoters have so far been enlisted, initially for one year, and the intention is to get about 100 into the DTI. The department traditionally recruits around one quarter of that number. Freed from day-to-day line management responsibilities the promoters will liaise with overseas posts and also maintain a dialogue with UK companies. They will be expected to visit businesses around the country, keeping them informed on exporting opportunities and providing advice on how to exploit them.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY SPEAKER BROWN'S CHARTERED JET PROPOSAL  </P> <P> So the sorry condition of public transportation is causing Brown a bit of  trouble meeting his busy schedule and he proposes to resolve the problem by  having the state lease an executive jet.  </P> <P> Though we working stiffs might think it would make more sense for Brown and his  colleagues to spend their energy and our resources doing something constructive  about public transportation, we shouldn't be surprised if this fantasy comes to  pass. And so a couple of suggestions to make the idea a little less  unpalatable:  </P> <P> At least 25% of the legislators' existing auto allowance should be deducted to  support the plan. This might mean having to lease a Ford rather than a Lincoln,  but most of us who elect the legislature have to scrimp a bit too, if we need a  second car for work, and we have to deal with the tax code to get any sort of  benefit.  </P> <P> All use of the plane should be paid at commercial rates, and since the chances  range between slim and none that this would be a "no-frills" operation (can't  serve the constituents without a shower, a hot meal, a wet bar and a fax  machine, can we?), payment should be equivalent to first-class rates.  </P> <P> CHARLES H. JOHNSON  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

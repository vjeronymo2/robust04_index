			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UN urged to consider military action THE UN should be prepared to consider military intervention to halt the fighting in Bosnia Hercegovina, Turkey said yesterday, adding it would be willing to contribute troops if asked to do so. Mr Hikmet Cetin, the Turkish foreign minister attending the London conference, said it was difficult to explain to the Turkish public why the west wanted Turkey's help for military intervention in Iraq if it was not also willing to intervene in Bosnia. He said feelings in Turkey were running high because there were 3m people in Turkey of Bosnian origin and an estimated 30,000 Bosnian refugees had fled there. Mr Cetin said Turkey would not be drawn into any regional conflicts in the Balkans, whether in Bosnia or in Kosovo or Macedonia. 'Turkey will not act alone.' However, he criticised the EC for not recognising Macedonia because of Greek objections to its name. He also denied reports that Turkey had put its application for full membership of the European Community, originally made in 1987, on the backburner.</p>

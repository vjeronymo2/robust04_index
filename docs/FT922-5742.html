			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / HK looks forward to monetary authority HONG KONG yesterday moved closer to the creation of a monetary authority, or central bank, when the government said it would set up a discount window to act as a lender of last resort to the colony's banking system. The discount window will be administered by the Office of the Exchange Fund, a government entity which manages the colony's foreign exchange reserves, sets interest rates and is responsible for maintaining the value of the Hong Kong dollar. The move marks a further step in the development of the Exchange Fund into an active public sector institution monitoring the day-to-day monetary affairs of the colony. It further erodes the informal style of monetary management in the colony and the role of Hongkong and Shanghai bank which, in the past, has acted as the government's agent in times of financial turbulence. Mr David Nendick, secretary for monetary affairs, said last night that the government had no intention of taking away Hongkong Bank's powers to issue bank notes or manage the bank clearing system in the colony. Analysts expect the Exchange Fund to evolve into a Hong Kong version of the Monetary Authority of Singapore before Britain relinquishes sovereignty of the colony to China in 1997. The 'liquidity adjustment facility' (LAF), as the discount window is known, will be introduced on June 8 and will enable banks to make late adjustments to their liquidity positions. Overnight funds will normally be provided to banks through sale and repurchase agreements of their holdings of exchange fund bills and Hong Kong government bonds.</p>

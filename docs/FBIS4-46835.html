			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with V. Sazonov, chief of the Ministry of </F> Railways Lines Main Administration, by GUDOK correspondent V.  Gitkovich; place and date not given: "Reduce Expenses, Not by  Decreasing Volume"]    [Text] Maintenance workers have already gone out on  their lines. They have three main objectives now: to increase  the volume of repair, to improve its quality, and to reduce  expenses. At first glance, it is hard to coordinate these  desires with each other. But obviously they can be coordinated,  and most importantly, they must be! But how is this to be  accomplished? Our correspondent discusses this with V. Sazonov,  chief of the Lines Main Administration.    [Gitkovich] Vladimir Nikolayevich, 6,808 kilometers must  undergo major repair this year. If the railroads' current  shortage of funds to acquire the needed quantity of materials is  taken into account, it will be a very hard job.    [Sazonov] This may sound paradoxical, but we plan to  increase  the area for repair by reducing expenses for it. The point is  that the railroads will be making the maximum use possible of  resource conservation technologies. We are putting many rails,  ties, tie plates, and other materials into use for the second  time.    This was also done previously, but not in such volume, and  it  did not have as much effect on the production cost of operations  as we expect now for this reason. After all, this year we are  counting on reinstallation of 4.382 million wooden ties and  70,000 metric tons of tie plates and the reuse of 8,500 spikes.    I will not list everything else. I will add only that the  old  track grids are being repaired intensively with reinforced  concrete ties at unit assembly bases of the PMS [track machinery  service]. This year we plan to make use of 1,126 kilometers of  selected grid work. It will be installed on the main routes with  overall freight traffic of up to 25 million ton-kilometers. If  we succeed in carrying out all the measures, this year we will  save 57 billion rubles (in December 1993 prices).    [Gitkovich] Everything you mentioned involves major repair.  And, although new rails are used in this, as a rule, there is  quite a lot of concern about them as well.    [Sazonov] I have not forgotten about the rails or the  switches. I was simply saving them up "for later." After all,  they should provide the most economy for us. Clearly, we will be  welding them in long lengths. But at the same time, we will be  making more and more extensive use of rails that have already  completed their service life on sections with heavy traffic.  Without cutting them, we will install them on lines with less  freight traffic.    But this will not leave our rail-welding trains without  work.  They will have to significantly increase the volume of  hard-facing on the defective rail ends directly on the track (up  to 5,000 units this year) and renovation by electric-arc welding  of the frogs (over 28,500 units this year).    Everything mentioned not only will provide for substantial  economy, it will enable us to repair more, but, if we add to  this the many kilometers of sections without a single joint from  station to station that have already appeared on the Kuybyshev,  Gorkiy, and other mainlines, as well as the careful polishing of  the rails, we will have a line that is really "like velvet."    [Gitkovich] All this is fine. But they say that we are  substantially behind the most technically developed countries in  our technology for major repair, and that those countries have  distinctive combines that perform the entire complex of  operations needed for major repair in one pass.    [Sazonov] You see, the main reason for the different  technologies in major repair here and in the West is the  fundamentally different requirements for them. There, where the  freight traffic is relatively insignificant and the network of  rail lines is more dense, they can shut down a certain section  for a week, or even three, to perform major repair. In past  years, when transport service was increased rapidly and at times  exceeded the throughput capacity of the lines, we counted every  hour of interruption in the traffic. And under these conditions,  productivity during a "window" hour and the opportunity to work  on a double-track section without interrupting traffic on both  sides for one of the tracks were most important of all for us.    I believe that under these conditions our technology coped  with its basic task. Perhaps the most vulnerable aspect of it  was cleaning the ballast. We worked only with the upper layer,  and, for that reason, whether we liked it or not, we were forced  to add a substantial amount of fresh ballast, raising our tracks  even higher, or to move the "extra" ballast with bulldozers to  the slopes and into the ditches; in addition to the economic  losses, this also damaged the roadbed.    Incidentally, in the West, ballast cleaning is not as  critical because the rolling stock there is in much better  condition and they package much of what we ship in bulk.    But life has changed now, and we have the chance to shut  down  entire sections of the lines for a significant period of time. I  think that this, combined with the new ballast cleaning machines  that not only cover a thicker layer of it, but make it possible  to return the ballast to the track after cleaning, will make  major repair more efficient.    In addition, under these conditions, we can also devote our  attention to treatment of the main roadbed, which plays a  decisive role in improvement of the line.    The first "windows" over many days are already under way on  the October Railroad. We are checking there to see if it is  necessary to spend billions right away on new machinery or  whether we can manage with what is available and achieve good  results.    [Gitkovich] "Windows" for many days--this is one more result  of the continuing decline in the volume of freight service. And  the pace of this process is very rapid (22.4 percent in the  first quarter of this year, instead of the 4.8 percent that was  predicted). And in order to be profitable, the railroads are  rushing to bring operating expenses into conformity with the  decrease in transport service. And this is one of the simplest  measures, at first glance--reduction of the work force. How do  you view this?    [Sazonov] Unfavorably. And this is why. For the present they  are not cutting back on line maintenance personnel, but the  personnel departments of many subdivisions are already posting  lists showing that hiring for work is being discontinued. And  this is essentially the same thing. The point is that the  turnover in our subunits is roughly equivalent to 50 percent  annually. And by discontinuing the hiring of new workers to  replace those who have left, we may be short of one-quarter of  the line repairmen that we had in just six months. But after  all, the average personnel strength for the system at the  beginning of the year was a little over 70 percent of what is  authorized--and even less on individual railroads.    It is hard to visualize how the brigades will look soon on  the East Siberian, October, or Kemerovo railroads, where the  turnover last year was 68, 70, and 81.8 percent, respectively.  But after all, Russia's railroads are poorly equipped with track  machinery at present, and manual and labor-intensive operations,  especially for current track maintenance, are adequate for this  reason. This is one of the important reasons for the turnover,  by the way.    Recently many highly skilled employees from a defense plant  came to one of the subdivisions where a reduction in force was  under way. But they did not have time to rejoice in the  subdivision, since nearly all the new arrivals were dismissed.  The people were unaccustomed to hard work outside in any kind of  weather, and at times even at any time of day.    With the extent of mechanization and the volume of repair  work we have today, each line maintenance brigade should be at  least 75 percent of its authorized strength. Only under such  conditions can we provide for reliable track use.    There is no question that authorized personnel strength  should also be adjusted for the decline in transport service.  These standards were worked out recently in the Ministry of  Railways and sent to the railroads. I also want to point out  that reducing the number of track maintenance workers is not the  most efficient method of lowering operating expenses in our  administration, where wages account for 32 percent of overall  expenses.    The introduction of resource conservation technologies is  much more productive. Including those that provide for extension  of the service life of materials by maintaining the track in  good condition, where the track maintenance employees play an  important role.    A small example. Today the cost of one new rail is nearly a  quarterly wage for a track maintenance worker. In sections with  an excellent record, such a rail serves 1.5 to two times longer.  It is not hard to determine what is more advantageous for a  railroad and in which direction they need to proceed.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FSIS is also proposing that the percentage lean statement and the percentage fat statement be contiguous and in lettering of the same size, type, and on the same color background.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS is proposing to allow the use of percentage labeling for lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger only. FSIS will consider expanding the proposed percentage labeling for lean and fat to ground meat from other species and/or ground poultry, if information submitted during the comment period demonstrates the need and consumer acceptability of these terms for such products or that differential treatment of ground beef relative to other ground products would inappropriately restrict informed consumer choice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final nutrition labeling regulations promulgated by FSIS on January 6, 1993, in most instances, did not permit ground beef and hamburger to be labeled based on a percentage of ``lean.'' As a result of the regulations, manufacturers and retailers would be prohibited from using the terms ``lean'' and ``extra lean'' in labeling ground beef and hamburger, unless such products meet the definitions of these terms, as set forth in 9 CFR 317.362 and 381.462. The practice of labeling ground beef and hamburger based on lean percentages has been allowed by FSIS under the Uniform Retail Meat Identity Standards since 1973. Under the final FSIS nutrition labeling regulations, which become effective on July 6, 1994, this longstanding practice would become prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS has reexamined this unintended consequence, and has concluded that consumers and the goals of nutrition labeling will best be served if the practice of labeling ground beef and hamburger based on lean percentages is allowed to continue, with certain restrictions as outlined in this proposed rule. Consumers are widely familiar with the percentage of lean information. FSIS believes that continuation of the practice will help consumers to select leaner ground beef and hamburger products. In order to avoid an unintended lapse in the allowed use of lean percentages for ground beef and hamburger, it is imperative that regulations pertaining to this issue become effective simultaneously with the overall July 6, 1994, effective date of the FSIS nutrition labeling regulations. The Agency has already reviewed comments received on the November 27, 1991, proposed rule concerning the continued use of lean percentages. The issue has been the subject of considerable public discussion. Therefore, FSIS believes that a 45-day comment period is sufficiently adequate to allow interested parties a meaningful opportunity to comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 317  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Food labeling, Food packaging, Meat inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed in the preamble, FSIS is proposing to amend 9 CFR part 317 of the Federal meat inspection regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 317_LABELING, MARKING DEVICES, AND CONTAINERS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Delhi fails to ring telecom changes: India is finding the practice of deregulation harder than the theory WHEN India announced in 1991 that private companies would be permitted to enter its tightly-controlled state-owned telecommunications industry, executives from the biggest names in the business hurried to New Delhi to examine the opportunities in what promised to be a multi-billion dollar market. They need not have rushed. Eighteen months later, the government has come to a grinding halt in its efforts to attract domestic and foreign groups into two key areas - the supply of telephone switching equipment and the establishment of cellular telephone networks in the four big cities of Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. Companies seeking the switching gear contract have run into a complex dispute over technical standards. Bidders for the cellular phone licences have fared even worse - the tenders have been referred to the Delhi High Court amid allegations of corruption, mismanagement and nepotism. The telecom disputes highlight an important failing of India's much-vaunted economic reforms - the inability to implement policy decisions. As a telecommunications ministry official admits: 'Having opened up the market to international investors, the government has failed to devise a system for the award of the contracts which is not only fair but which also appears to be fair.' The contracts for cellular telephones were awarded amid tough competition, controversy, and protests in parliament about the need for a sophisticated mobile network. Many MPs felt the money would have been better spent on more ordinary telephone lines which number just 0.52 per hundred Indians. Eight companies, two for each city, were shortlisted from 30 original bids. The successful foreign groups, all teamed with Indian partners included General Mobile and Vodafone of the UK, Societe Francaise du Radiotelephone and France Telecom from France, the Australian and Overseas Telecom Corporation (AOTC), and three Bell companies from North America. Two unsuccessful bidders decided to sue, accusing the government of corruption and arbitrariness. IXL, a telecom company belonging to the Delhi-based Dalmia group, and Anido, a member of Bombay's Onida electronics group, filed a joint petition in the Delhi High Court in November, maintaining that 'the selection criteria were neither properly evolved or applied'. A month later, Hutchison Max, a joint venture between the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa and the Delhi-based Bhai Mohan Singh group, filed another petition, claiming that though its tenders for Bombay and Delhi ranked highest in the selection process, they were disqualified because of a typographical error in their compliance statement. Both petitions allege that BPL Systems and Projects which has tied up with France Telecom and been awarded the Bombay contract, has 'grossly violated tender conditions'. Hutchison Max's petition has been supported by a winning bidder - Tata Cellular, which together with Bell Canada, has been awarded part of the New Delhi network. Tata Cellular contends that the selection process 'is subjective and based on erroneous assumptions'. The Hutchison Max petition complained of 'hidden evaluation criteria'. It alleged that Mr B R Nair, a member of the government's Telecom Commission, who as 'chiefly responsible for recommending the rejection of the Hutchison Max bid was well aware of the fact that the key beneficiary of this decision would be BPL. Knowing that his son was working with BPL, such a decision smacks of nepotism/favouritism and an arbitrary exercise of power.' Mr Nair denies the allegation. A judgment from the Delhi High Court is still awaited, over two months after the hearings ended, and India's cellular mobile plan will have to wait. The government's plan to purchase switching equipment worth Rs1.5bn (Pounds 35m), to meet its ambitious target of providing 1.1m new telephone lines in 1993-94, also ran into trouble, with almost all the major bidders, including Siemens and Ericsson, failing to pass the stringent technical validation tests stipulated by the telecommunications ministry. Fujitsu of Japan passed the validation test and is awaiting a firm contract from the government. No one is openly questioning the ministry's technical expertise to evaluate the tenders but the foreign bidders are unhappy with the selection procedure. 'What was most frustrating was that at no point did the government specify which of the 40-odd tests each company had failed to clear,' says a senior manager of one of the unsuccessful companies. The disputes and delays have brought sharply into focus the need for reform of the public sector tendering system and for a less arbitrary and bureaucratic method of selection. The snags in India's telecom privatisation programme could adversely affect the country's entire economic reforms effort, admit government officials. 'Though the importance of telecoms is slowly dawning on the government, there seems a bureaucratic reluctance to get projects off the ground, and give foreign investors the impression that things are moving,' says a top official of a telecom company. The World Bank, in a report on Indian telecommunications, suggested radical management and infrastructural reform. The telecom services in India, notes the report, are pitifully thin compared with other developing countries. Subscribers sometimes wait ten years for a telephone connection. The bank felt that even eight times the existing 5.8m lines could be effectively put to use by a population exceeding 850m. The government's expansion plan envisages only 20m lines by the year 2000. Businessmen and others can pay stiff fees to secure lines on a priority basis. But they are still hampered by the poor quality of much of the network. Thus, cellular phones are expected to be very popular - if and when the government allows companies to provide them.</p>

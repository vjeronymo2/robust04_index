			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Panama City, 9 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Various  political, labor, and student organizations marched today in  Panama City to commemorate the 30th anniversary of clashes with  U.S. troops on 9 January 1964, when 23 Panamanians died and  diplomatic relations were temporarily broken. [passage omitted]    A mass was held today at the San Juan Bosco Basilica to  honor  the "9 January Martyrs," and dozens of people later marched  toward the U.S. Southern Command Headquarters on Ancon Hill  beside the canal, where they burned an effigy dressed in a U.S.  military uniform.    Approximately 200 persons marched along Central Avenue  chanting anti-U.S. and antigovernment slogans while the  Panamanian flag flew at half mast in the distance on Ancon Hill.  [passage omitted]    The absence of representatives from Guillermo Endara's  administration was quite evident in today's events.</p>

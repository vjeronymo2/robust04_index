			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [lnterview with Josip Jakovcic, Karlovac parish priest, by </F> Ratko Peter: "An Enemy Did This"]    [Excerpts] [Jakovcic] What took place, according to police  reports, at 0418 on Christmas morning was a criminal and  political act. This building is in the center of Karlovac, it is  the property of the Serb Orthodox Eparchy, but it is also part  of the city. Regardless of who the perpetrator was, which is  still not known, this act did not benefit Croatia, quite the  contrary. These people are the enemies of our country.    Everything happened at a time of intensive talks with local  Serbs, during the peace initiative of President Tudjman, on the  greatest Catholic holiday, a time for peace, love, unity, and  forgiveness. This was an act which deserves condemnation. Tt did  not happen when thousands of shells were falling on the city,  and it should not have happened now either. We presume that it  was a premeditated act intended to destabilize all of us here. I  want to stress that it was also an act from which all the  citizens want to disassociate themselves.    [Peter] After this terrorist act, for which there is no  justification, could you tell us what the current mood in  Karlovac is?    [Jakovcic] Quite a few citizens of Serb nationality left the  city, and about 6,000 Serbs live in Karlovac today. They live  and work in a normal way, just like all the other citizens.  [passage omitted]    The burden of Karlovac is about 16,000 exiles, half being  from Slunj. Recently, Karlovac citizens have been upset by  Muslims who travel every weekend to Cazinska Krajina across the  control point in Turanj. UNPROFOR convoys also pass through  Karlovac, which upsets the citizens. [passage omitted]</p>

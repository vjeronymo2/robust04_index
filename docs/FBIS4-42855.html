			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by former Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa: "Put </F> a Stop to Italian Debt-Making"]    [Text] The recession in the Italian economy touched bottom  around the third quarter of last year. Since then, we have  begun to see signs of a recovery, strengthening in the first  months of 1994. In the fourth quarter of 1993, GDP rose. Since  December, household confidence has improved uninterruptedly and  employment expectations have reversed. Again, since the fourth  quarter of 1993, industry's confidence, recorded by the ISCO  [National Institute for the Study of the Economic Situation]-  MONDO ECONOMICO surveys, has improved. The balance on  short-term order and production trends has turned positive and  is increasing. Industrial sales and the retail sales index are  rising. Capacity utilization levels remain low but are improving.    Since February, on the other hand, the downward trend in  medium- and long-term interest rates has first stopped and then  reversed. In 1993 this trend permitted a 4.7 percent reduction  in the yield-to-maturity of 10-year treasury bonds and a halving  of the yield differential with corresponding German paper.  Foreign holders have sold, at times substantially, prices have  fallen, and yields have risen.    Obviously it would be out of place to establish any  connection between the observed events, whether favorable, such  as the end of the recession, or unfavorable, such as the rise in  interest rates, and the arrival of a new government. There is  no need for "sensations" or for "surveys not covering the whole  country" in order to obtain "signs of a recovery which has  already begun." An ample mass of data and commentaries from  official and private sources demonstrate that the turning point,  as we have seen, lay between the end of 1993 and the beginning  of 1994, well before "confidence and enthusiasm" had any  opportunity (or reason) to show themselves. As for interest  rates, the increase has come since March, in other major  countries just as in Italy.    The "good fortune of having inherited an economy which was  strongly improving" (according to the Goldman Sachs analysts),  on the one hand, and the reversal of the downward trend in  interest rates, on the other, compose a framework which both  offers opportunities and presents problems.    In the Bank of Italy report we find that, in 1993, "the  Italian economy has achieved results, not only in reducing the  government deficit, but also in rebalancing its foreign  accounts, starting a restructuring of the services sector,  recovering profit margins, and containing inflation which are  unprecedented taking into account the unfavorable economic  climate." Certain of these results are solid; others need to be  consolidated or improved.    Last year, the process of bringing public financing back  into  balance was hindered by the recession and facilitated by the  reduction in interest rates. The structural adjustments  achieved by the 1992 and 1993 budgets, leaving aside interest  charges, were imposing (as can be seen by comparing the trend  forecasts calculated by the Treasury Ministry for the coming  years before and after the interventions), but fell short of the  objectives, despite the supplementary measures adopted during  1993. The recession's effects, in terms of lower income and  higher expenditures, have been felt and continue into 1994. On  the other hand, thanks to the reduction in interest rates  (promoted by a shrewd debt management policy), interest  expenditure was some 20 trillion lire lower than forecast in  1993 and will be some 30 trillion lower in 1994. More  precisely, the average cost of state indebtedness, which went  above 11 percent in 1992 and was a little lower in 1993, should  be scarcely more than 9 percent in 1994.    Adding to this an excess of tax income over expenditure,  apart from interests, a reduction in the average cost of  indebtedness represents an essential ingredient in restoring the  financial situation. It serves to reduce the current deficit.  In particular it alleviates the budget correction (on  expenditure and/or income) necessary to stop the growth in the  debt to national product ratio. The "cost" of attaining this  objective by 1996, in terms of cuts in expenditure or increased  income, diminishes by some 22 trillion lire for every one  percentage point reduction in the average cost of the debt.    But can we be certain that the reduction in the cost of the  debt will continue? Unfortunately not, because the achievable  level for the year will turn out roughly equal to today's cost  of medium- and long-term borrowing. Let us say straightaway  that monetary policy is unable to influence long-term interest  rates, as international experience has taught us. Or rather, a  lax monetary policy, which arouses expectations of inflation,  far from reducing them, will run the risk of increasing them.  Should we therefore resign ourselves, and place our confidence  solely in the development of external rates on the international  markets, which is not favorable today? Not necessarily, because  Italian yields still have some way to go on their own.    The yield differential between long-term Italian securities  and similar German or French paper, even if it has halved  compared with the beginning of 1993, still remains three points  or a little less. This is due in small part to the "country  risk," due in part to expectations regarding inflation, and in  particular to the size of the debt and the continuing  uncertainty on the budget adjustment. This is a differential  which can be reduced, if the adjustment policy is incisive and  is perceived as such by the markets. But it can also increase  the other way, and even more if the purse strings are opened  wider, with the idea of financing lower income today with the  hope of higher income tomorrow. In the first case, the course  of Italian rates could become in part untied from that of  international rates, making use of a margin for further descent;  in the second case, a reduction in international rates would not  provide us with any relief, and the negative effect of their  increase would be heightened.    There are good reasons which should induce us to continue,  unhesitatingly, on the first path. An economy which is out of  recession, in which the impetus of exports promoted by the  undervalued exchange rate is now consolidated by the European  recovery, not only has no need of fiscal incentives, but makes a  further decisive step toward budget adjustment easier and more  bearable. Today, the average cost of the debt is still lower  than that forecast last July in the economic and financial  programming document. As a result, the necessary 1995 and 1996  correction has decreased compared with what was then estimated.  Decisive intervention in 1995 could further reduce it,  permitting and supporting a reduction in rates.    In the final years of the past decade, we had ideal  conditions for arresting the growth of the debt in terms of the  domestic product. This chance was squandered, and the cost of  adjustment rose, leaving it to begin in much more difficult  years. Another opportunity, even if less favorable than the  previous one, appears to be on the horizon today. We need to  seize it. It could be the last one.</p>

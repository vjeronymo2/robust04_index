			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2 MEN PLEAD INNOCENT TO KIDNAPINGS AND RAPES  </P> <P> Two men pleaded innocent Thursday to rape, kidnaping and other felony charges  alleging they abducted three women from San Fernando Valley streets at gunpoint  and raped them at a ranch in Acton.  </P> <P> Paul James McDaniels, 23, of Canyon Country and Theodore Robert Conyers, 26, of  Acton each were charged Thursday with five counts of rape, two counts of  kidnaping, one count of attempted forcible rape while acting in concert and one  count of sexual battery.  </P> <P> McDaniels also was charged with a third count of kidnaping.  </P> <P> At an arraignment Thursday in Van Nuys Municipal Court, Commissioner Rebecca  Omens-Rochman ordered both men held without bail and set a July 2 preliminary  hearing date.  </P> <P> On at least three occasions over the past eight months, police believe the men  ordered lone women into a pickup and drove them to the ranch, where they raped  or attempted to rape them. After the rapes, the men returned the victims to the  area where they were picked up, police said.  </P> <P> The victims ranged in age from 12 to 31, investigators said. Court documents  name three who were allegedly raped.  </P> <P> But police believe there may be other victims who have not come forward.  </P> <P> The most recent known abduction occurred June 8, according to the criminal  complaint filed against the men. The other known assaults took place last Nov.  30 and Oct. 13, the document states.  </P> <P> Omens-Rochman on Thursday granted a defense request not to permit media  photographers and television cameramen to take the men's photos, saying such  exposure could taint witnesses' and victims' identification of the men in a  lineup.  </P></p>

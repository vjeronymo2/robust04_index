			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Pit probe will focus on roof supports BRITISH COAL was expected to launch an inquiry today into the Bilsthorpe pit accident, in which at least one miner died, with attention focused on the mine's roof support, Michael Smith writes. The roof bolting system on which the trapped miners were working at the Nottinghamshire pit has been introduced gradually throughout British Coal mines over the past decade in the face of strong opposition from the National Union of Mineworkers. British Coal said yesterday that roof bolting was more scientific and safer than traditional methods. The accident inquiry will involve British Coal, the mining inspectorate and the mining unions. Yesterday's accident happened on a section of mine where roof bolting is being applied. British Coal said yesterday that the circumstances surrounding the accident were unclear. Roof bolting works in a similar way to a screw being driven into a wall through a plug. A hole is driven into the roof. It is then packed with a glue-type resin and a bolt is inserted. Roof bolts are placed about a metre apart. British Coal said virtually all its remaining mines used roof bolting, although the system was not suitable for all parts of mines. Before roof bolting, pit tunnels were held up with a system of steel arches and girders. Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, said yesterday that he was totally against roof bolting as a primary support and had been campaigning against it for many years.</p>

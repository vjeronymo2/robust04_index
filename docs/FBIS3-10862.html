			<p>Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] During a news conference held at approximately 1530  in a Mexico City hotel, Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for  peace in Chiapas, said he has kept his interests focused on the  reconciliation efforts so far. He also said he had not thought  about changing his political plans until he finishes this  mission, but political pressures have forced him to change these  plans. In this manner, Manuel Camacho Solis said he does not  accept any criticism of the actions or work he has carried out  as a public statesman.    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] It is being said that if  Camacho makes a rival decision, he will accept the interests of  the Institutional Revolutionary Party. No one, however, stops to  consider that some of the programs he led in Mexico City  continue to be supported by a majority in the federal district.  I do not accept that some people want to make me a factor to  explain the inefficiencies of others. Camacho has shown loyalty  to the president of the republic, and he is [word indistinct] in  the tasks that have been entrusted to him. [end recording]    Later on, the peace commissioner clarified doubts on what is  being said regarding his possible candidacy to the president of  the republic.    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] Camacho will not be a  problem  so the candidacies can comply with their responsibilities of  consolidating their campaigns and of showing their effectiveness  to the people. The opening has always been there. Something I am  not willing to do is to stop fully exercising my citizen's  rights. [end recording]    In conclusion, Manuel Camacho Solis reiterated his decision  to continue fighting to strengthen the democratic system in  Mexico, and he emphasized that is his commitment.    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I am not going to act under  pressure or hastily. My task is to contribute to unity and to  participate in the democratic transition of Mexico. What is the  best way to do that? To be effectively loyal to the nation? That  is the question.    One path that I think is the most advisable for today, is if  everyone would support the IFE [Federal Electoral Institute] and  COFIPE [Federal Code of Institutions and Electoral Procedures]  reforms in such a way that the Agreement for Peace, Justice, and  Democracy, which the political parties and presidential  candidates signed, is duly observed, and if conditions are right  so I can contribute to the guarantee of the democratic  transition. After I fulfill my mission in Chiapas, my role will  be to support the democratic transition in Mexico and to defend  its results.    Another path is that if there is no progress toward  democracy, if instead of agreements there is polarization, and  if there is an effort to violate my rights as a citizen, then,  after concluding my mission in Chiapas, I will make the  necessary political decision for progress toward democracy and  the promotion of Mexico's unity.    Nothing is more important to me than to maintain and  strengthen Mexico's unity. There cannot be unity if one has to  forgo interests; unity is derived by feeling confident about  legitimate interests and by opening the doors of institutions to  the demands of justice by Mexican society and people. In other  words, a unity that does not exclude, but rather one that is  based on peace, justice, and democracy.    That is my stand and that is the field in which I will work.  Camacho will be a factor of reconciliation and stability, and he  will be a useful component in the democratic transition. As I  have done since 10 January, as of this moment, I am completely  focused on my task of seeking peace in Chiapas. [end recording]</p>

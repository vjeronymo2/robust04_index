			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRINTER'S ERROR SAVES AIR TRAVELERS $300 PER TICKET  </P> <P> Dozens of central Florida newspaper readers knew they had spotted a bargain  when they saw the Pan Am ad offering a one-way flight to Nuremberg, West  Germany, for $109.  </P> <P> Oops. The advertisement should have said $409.  </P> <P> But never mind, Pan Am went ahead and honored the erroneously advertised price  for about 75 people who wanted tickets Wednesday and Thursday.  </P> <P> After all, the ad promised "A lot of Europe for not a lot of money."  </P> <P> The deal on the fare, made possible by the mistake of a New York printing  company, ended at noon Thursday. Company officials said the error appeared only  in an ad in the Orlando Sentinel. The printer said it would pay the difference.  </P></p>

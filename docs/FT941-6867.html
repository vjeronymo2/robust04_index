			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Green rules threaten to lift waste disposal cost by 50% The waste industry will today tell the government that new environmental regulation could push up the cost of waste disposal by nearly 50 per cent. Complying with the 1990 Environmental Protection Act will cost between three and four times as much as the government has estimated, the industry says. 'The environment department is talking in terms of extra costs of about Pounds 1 a tonne but we think it will be closer to Pounds 3 or Pounds 4 a tonne,' said one leading waste company. UK landfills typically charge between Pounds 6 a tonne and Pounds 16 a tonne for taking municipal waste. Today is the deadline for waste companies to respond to the government's plans for tighter control of landfills - licensed rubbish dumps. The rules, which the industry expects to come into force on May 1, will say that licence holders must be judged 'fit and proper'. It will also make them liable for any future pollution from the site. A separate, tighter European Union directive on landfills being discussed in Brussels, could push costs up to almost double their present level, companies say. Industry estimates suggest that in Germany, where licensing rules are strict, landfill costs range from Pounds 49 a tonne to Pounds 60 a tonne. In the Netherlands, where pollution of groundwater is a concern, costs range from Pounds 18 to Pounds 300. Mr Miguel Pestana of Waste Management International, the environmental services group, said: 'Once the new provisions take effect landfill prices should rise.' But he added: 'In the last year pricing has been falling in parts of the country because of competition - lots of players saw the recession bite and volumes fall.' The industry proposals, submitted through the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors, will call on the government to drop plans for a landfill levy, arguing that the new regulation will prompt sharp price rises. The government wants the proposed levy to encourage more recycling and incineration of waste. Mr Steve Webb, policy director of the association, said: 'They have been tackling this the wrong way round - they should encourage people to recycle but not discourage them from doing something else, such as landfill.'</p>

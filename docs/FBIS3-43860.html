			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano has told  the weekly DOMINGO newspaper that he does not remember having  discussed with Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo], the alleged involvement of General  Domingos Fondo in the smuggling of arms. In the interview,  Chissano said it is possible that he may remember later on  having had a conversation with Dhlakama on the issue. The  Mozambican head of state added that there are institutions to  investigate whether there is a basis in the accusation of the  Renamo leader. He concluded that once the process begins,  Dhlakama may give his contribution.</p>

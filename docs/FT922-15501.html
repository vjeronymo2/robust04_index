			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: BNB Resources tumbles to Pounds 2.6m PROFITS AT BNB Resources, the recruitment, training and advertising group, tumbled 40 per cent, from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 2.6m pre-tax, in 1991 as the recession put severe pressure on fees. Mr David Norman, chairman, said the results were 'more than respectable' against the 'worst trading conditions experienced in our industry sectors in more than a decade'. UK demand for recruitment advertising and selection had fallen by 40 per cent. He warned that the first six months of this year would continue to be difficult, but some growth was expected by the second half. The result, struck on turnover 16 per cent lower at Pounds 54.9m, was buoyed by interest gains of Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.9m). The group had Pounds 7.5m cash after the Pounds 2.8m purchase of ATC, the chartered accountant training company, at the end of the year. Mr Norman said BNB 'may well spend the money on acquisitions' and suggested that the next significant purchase was likely to be in the training sector. The decline in profits masked a strong showing from the executive search business, which increased its contribution by more than 20 per cent. Profits in the human resources division overall fell by 19 per cent to Pounds 2.07m, following a 33 per cent drop in advertising revenues. Further declines in this division had been halted through a Pounds 100,000-plus restructuring programme. The regional communications business incurred a Pounds 45,000 loss (Pounds 399,000 profit), largely from a sharp decline in profits in Scotland. The other two regional businesses, in Manchester and Birmingham, were expected to return to profit this year following significant cost-cutting, said Mr Norman. 'I think we have got the cost base right, but demand is static to say the least,' he said. Earnings per share fell by 6.2p to 8.3p. The final dividend is 3.3p for a total of 4.9p (4.6p).</p>

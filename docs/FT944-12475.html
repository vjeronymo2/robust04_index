			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Bonds: NTT finds strong UK demand for Dollars 300m deal Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone yesterday launched a Dollars 300m offering of five-year bonds priced to yield 24 basis points over US government bonds. The deal, NTT's first offering in the dollar sector for almost two years, met strongest demand from UK institutional investors, joint lead manager JP Morgan said. Bonds were also sold to Japanese accounts in London, non-Japanese buyers in the Far East and investors in Switzerland and Germany, JP Morgan said. The offering, which was believed to have been swapped into fixed-rate yen, was well received by other syndicate managers, who said the bonds were fairly priced. One syndicate manager in London said: 'The bonds could have been priced slightly tighter than they were but to get deals away at the moment you have to make sure they are priced attractively.' Recent five-year offerings by Triple A credits like Japan Development Bank and Oesterreichische Kontrollbank are now trading at around 20 basis points above US Treasuries, which makes the NTT bonds attractive to investors on a yield basis, JP Morgan said. The launch spread was maintained after the bonds were freed to trade. JP Morgan said that the offering was one of only a few recent dollar deals in which the pricing spread has not widened out immediately after being launched. Interest in the US dollar sector has picked up recently, particularly from institutional investors in the Far East, and spreads in the dollar secondary market have tightened, traders said. In the D-Mark sector, Ford Credit Europe launched a DM200m offering of five-year bonds targeted at retail investors. The bonds were priced to yield 45 basis points over the equivalent German government bonds and the proceeds were believed to have been swapped into floating-rate D-Mark. The spread widened slightly to around 49 basis points over after the bonds were freed to trade. The offering was launched following the success of a similar issue by BMW in September, lead manager Dresdner Bank said. The prospects for the D-Mark sector are encouraging, one trader said. Retail investors, in particular, are being attracted by the relatively high yields and current low German inflation rate, he said. The yen sector saw two new bond issues, targeted almost exclusively at institutional investors in Japan, including a Y30bn offering of bonds due February 2000 by Santander International.</p>

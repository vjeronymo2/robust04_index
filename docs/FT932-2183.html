			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Stonehenge: new plans for the rocks of ages - Gerald Cagodan on how best to preserve Britain's greatest monument THE USUAL constraints on visitors will be in force at Stonehenge this summer solstice. That means no Druids, no 'travellers', and no special access at dawn on Monday when the midsummer sun rises over the Heel Stone along the axis of the Avenue, the processional way outside the great circle of standing stones in Wiltshire, as it has been doing now for more than 4000 summer solstices. The long, mysterious history of Stonehenge, which began probably over 5000 years ago, has one advantage for 1993 AD. It puts into perspective the slow progress of English Heritage (EH) towards solving the problems of how to preserve, conserve and present the monument. Because it is so old and because it is unique, it demands that we find the best possible solutions. Nine years ago, when EH was formed, under Lord Montagu as chairman, it announced that Stonehenge was a top priority. It also badly underestimated how long it would take to tackle it. Five more years is a fair guess. What is the position now, and what are the prospects? Nobody would dispute that its present surroundings, on a triangle of land between two busy roads (the A303 and A344), and its squalid visitor facilities, inadequate parking and gloomy post-war concrete buildings, do not honour Europe's premier prehistoric monument. EH has long suggested that the A344 be closed and grassed over and the present visitor centre be moved far enough away that visitors have to walk to the stones. These proposals would do wonders to restore Stonehenge to its proper position as the heart of a downland landscape crammed with prehistoric monuments - especially the important burial barrows - put there precisely because they were next to the holy place of power. At the same time visitors would have time to get over the travails of the drive and to adjust to the breadth of history as they walk like pilgrims to Stonehenge. To run greater Stonehenge - the whole spread of the the site - which mostly belongs to the National Trust but is partly government property, a Stonehenge Trust is now proposed. Where is the best place for the visitor centre? EH long favoured the Larkhill site to the north, a 1km walk to the stones, and displayed the winning plans of Edward Cullinan (designer of the visitor centre at Fountains Abbey) at an exhibition at the Royal Institute of British Architects in London in January. Now, however, things are not so clear. There are problems with the approach road to Larkhill: if it is from the north, the Ministry of Defence, which oversees many military manoeuvres in the area, is not happy; and if it is from the west, it may affect the underlying archaeology. So public consultation is under way again to find the best site and a present exhibition at Stonehenge shows eight possible areas, rating them by the following (perhaps surprising) criteria: How much will the sites damage the archaeology How far are they from the public highway How long would the walk be to the stones What is the cost (estimated at between Pounds 13.5m and Pounds 16.5m) How impressive is the approach - a class which Larkhill and the New King Barrows (east of Stonehenge, enjoying the same marvellous view as you have driving on the A303 from Amesbury) wins easily. Visitors can fill in a questionnaire and send it to EH, which will also have the guidance of a professional seminar at the Society of Antiquaries in Burlington House, London, on July 6. After that, EH and the National Trust will choose a site, re-instruct Cullinan and the landscape architects Livingston Eyre, submit a planning application, be ready for the inevitable public inquiry and await eventually the decision of whoever is then secretary of state for the environment. Five years for all this is probably not enough. In the meantime, who will pay for the work? EH, under Jocelyn Stevens, its new chairman, says that it will be looking for outside funding, perhaps similar to the Sainsbury supermarket family's gift of the new wing of the National Gallery in London. Or we may by then have a government that sees Stonehenge as a crown jewel of our national heritage, quite apart from the money its visitors inject into the economy, and therefore will fund it wholly from public money, or from the National Lottery. The A303 road is the other big problem for Stonehenge: it runs too close. The Department of Transport has proposals and is willing to fund them. Either keep the present route and put it in a tunnel next to the stones (known as the 'yellow' solution) or re-route it over 1km to the south (the 'grey' solution), which saves the stones and should do less damage to the archaeology around. The latter is preferable, as the President of the Society of Antiquaries, Professor Barry Cunliffe of Oxford University, has informed the DOT. At present, he says: 'As the cars whizz by, I think of Oscar Wilde's Ballad of Reading Gaol - 'Yet each man kills the thing he loves'. The whole Stonehenge problem is a perfect microcosm of all the problems we face at such sites around the world. If we can solve them here, we should be able to do it anywhere'. What problems? Preserving the place; maintaining it; presenting it; controlling visitor access so that it is not spoilt; controlling the transportation that brings people. Can Britain do it? I hope so. These holy, mysterious stones deserve the best we can give them.</p>

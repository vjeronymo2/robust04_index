			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Alma to close its factories Alma Holdings, the unquoted Scottish confectionery maker which went into receivership on February 21, is to close its four factories and make its 461 employees redundant. Mr Rod Owen, joint receiver from Peat Marwick, said that a significant number of Alma's customers had transferred their business elsewhere making keeping the plants going impossible. More than 200 jobs are to go at two plants in Dundee, 150 at Glenrothes and Kircaldy, Fife and the remainder in the sales office in Manchester. Some 115 staff are to be retained in the short term to assist with closing the plants.</p>

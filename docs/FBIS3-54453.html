			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nadav Shragay] </F>   [Text] The joint government and Jerusalem Municipality  committee of experts is recommending to the political echelon to  try to reach a situation where by 2010 there will be 1.8 million  inhabitants in what the government in 1987 defined as the  greater Jerusalem area -- Bet El in the north, Hebron in the  south, Mitzpe Yeriho in the east, and Bet Shemesh in the west.    The committee of experts was appointed three years ago at  the  government's request to plan greater Jerusalem. When two of its  members were asked what the viability of the plan was in the  wake of the signing of the Declaration of Principles for  self-government, they replied that the issue is not their  concern and that they had studied the metropolitan problems from  an expert's point of view. Arnon Yequti'eli, head of the Meretz  faction in Jerusalem Municipality, believes that the plan is  part of the municipality's almost racist pettiness by constantly  taking into account the numerical relationship between the  Palestinian and Israeli populations.    There are currently some 1.2 million inhabitants in the  area.  The committee of experts recommends a series of moves to change  the current demographic relationship from 55 percent  Palestinians and 45 percent Jews, to 52 percent Palestinians and  48 percent Jews by 2010. Jerusalem Municipality tends in  principle to be for adopting the recommendations, with minor  additions and changes, and hopes to convince the government to  embrace them.    Two of the committee leaders, who presented the findings to  Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert this week, believe that if a series  of moves to build in and expand greater Jerusalem -- especially  in the areas annexed after 1967 -- are not taken quickly,  Jerusalem is likely to become "a dead-end city" with Palestinian  building closing in on the city from the south, north, and east,  and blocking its ability to expand. The two, Shemaryahu Kohen,  formerly head of the Jerusalem District in the Construction and  Housing Ministry, and Professor Adam Mazur, maintain that  Jerusalem will wither both in the urban and economic fields if  large areas within the metropolitan area are not designated  territorial reserves set aside for the town's expansion.    In order to achieve that aim, the two said, the committee  recommends expanding Ma'ale Adumim in the direction of  Jerusalem, linking it up territorially with Pisgat Ze'ev,  linking Giv'at Ze'ev to the Ramot neighborhood, and expanding  the 'Etzyon Bloc in the direction of the town of Betar and the  'Adulam region.    The coordinator of the steering committee is Yisra'el  Kimche,  of the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Research, and its members  include Jerusalem Municipal Engineer Elino'ar Brocci, Yohanatan  Golani of the Interior Ministry, Sofia Lidor of the Construction  and Housing Ministry, and Mikha'el Tirkin of the Israel Lands  Authority.    The team proposes creating "joint Jewish-Arab zones" along  Highway 45, between Modi'in and 'Atarot, where economic projects  will be set up.    One of the team's guidelines is that political or other  boundaries should not block the setting up of "a single voting  area" for the population of greater Jerusalem.    In a letter of response sent to Olmert, Meretz faction  leader  Yequti'eli said that since 1967 "successive Israeli Governments  and Jerusalem Municipality have been conducting a clear policy  of expelling Palestinians from Jerusalem, either through mass  confiscations of land or the destruction of hundreds of houses.  The only approved project, the al-Nusaybah housing project, was  also implemented because of the need to house people expelled  from the Old City after the 1967 war and the evacuation of the  square in front of the Western Wall.    "At first `we fought' over the relationship between Jews and  Arabs in the city of Jerusalem, and when that was decided, we  began to take stock of the numbers of Jews and Arabs in East  Jerusalem and the territories annexed to it. We have now  reached a clear Jewish majority there too. In fact, so much so  that the Palestinians from Jerusalem -- tens of thousands of  them -- have been pushed out of town and have gone to live in  al-Ram, al-'Ayzariyah, and other places. The latest stock  taking is over the numerical relationship in the greater  Jerusalem area. There is no significance -- and should be none  -- to a numerical relationship between Jerusalem and the  Palestinian towns and villages, such as Bethlehem and Ramallah,  which are due to come under Palestinian autonomy and the future  Palestinian state anyway," Yequti'eli wrote.</p>

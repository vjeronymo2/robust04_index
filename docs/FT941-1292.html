			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: South Africa seeks bank to advise on bond market South Africa is seeking to appoint an international bank to advise the new government's entry into the international bond market. Several banks have been interviewed. Mr Etienne Calitz, director-general of the department of finance, said yesterday the multi-party Transitional Executive Council (TEC), which is in charge of government policy leading up to next month's elections, had compiled a shortlist of candidates. He declined to name the banks involved. However, they are thought to include First Boston, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan and Salomon Brothers. The first task of the successful applicant will be to guide the new government through the delicate process of obtaining a credit rating from the two leading international rating agencies, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. Discussions with the agencies are expected to begin once the elections are over. South Africa is thought to be keen to obtain an investment-grade rating, as this would facilitate its access to the international bond market and to the Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers. An investment-grade rating would also reduce South Africa's funding costs and allow a broader range of investors to buy its bonds. The adviser will be selected by the technical committee of the TEC's finance sub-council, which has the responsibility of drawing up a foreign loan finance strategy for the new government. The first foreign debt issue of a new government will be an important test of international confidence in South Africa's new administration, and of the ANC's economic policy in particular, given its likely victory in the April elections. Mr Calitz said a new issue would primarily have 'benchmark value'.</p>

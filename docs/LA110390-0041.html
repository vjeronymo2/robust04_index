			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> BOND COULD LEAD TO COLLEGE ARTS CENTER  </P> <P> Moorpark College could build a $7-million performing arts building with two  theaters if voters approve Proposition 143, the Higher Educational Facilities  Bond Act, on Nov. 6, college officials say.  </P> <P> The proposed building, which has already cost the state $700,000 for  architectural plans, would have two theaters -- one seating about 400 people  and the other 100.  </P> <P> If funded, construction is scheduled to begin after July.  </P> <P> Should the bond fail, construction will be delayed, said Larry Lloyd, vice  president of administrative services.  </P> <P> "The performing arts building would be delayed a year or longer," Lloyd said.  "But if the state spends $700,000 on working drawings, they won't let them lie  around too long. It's bad economy. They'll find a way to fund it because it's  wasted taxpayer money."  </P> <P> Moorpark College would also get $163,000 for handicapped ramps and a second  elevator in the humanities building.  </P> <P> Other schools in the Ventura County Community College District would also  benefit. Oxnard College would receive $265,000 toward a new gymnasium and  Ventura College would get $644,000 to finance plans for a math and science  complex. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER  </P></p>

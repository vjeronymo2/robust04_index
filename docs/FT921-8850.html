			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow weakens as investors react to rising bond yields Wall Street IN SPITE of some rare good economic news, share prices retreated sharply yesterday as investors reacted negatively to a big rise in bond yields, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 30.18 down at 3,246.65 after Wednesday's record high close. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 3.44 to 413.69, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks receded 5.82 to 639.10. Turnover on the New York SE totalled 231m shares, and declines outdistanced rises by around two-to-one. The release of positive US economic news - a bigger than expected 0.6 per cent rise in January retail sales and a surprise 13,000 decline in weekly unemployment claims - would normally have cheered the market. The key influence on equities yesterday, however, was bond prices. The fact that the positive economic data reduced the chances of another cut in interest rates depressed the bond market, which was already suffering under the pressure of Dollars 36bn in new securities issued this week. Heavy selling sent the price of the benchmark 30-year bond tumbling more than one point, in the process pushing the yield back up towards 8 per cent. Among individual stocks, the focus was again on corporate profits and the earnings outlook. Although Ford Motor announced a Dollars 2.3bn loss for the full 1991 year (a big deterioration from the Dollars 860m profit earned in 1990), the bad results had been widely expected and investors chose instead to concentrate on the improvement in fourth-quarter results and the company's emphasis on cost control. Consequently, Ford rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 35 1/4 in turnover of 2.5m shares. Pfizer fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 72 5/8 in heavy trading on the heels of a meeting between the company and analysts at which Pfizer's chief financial officer said first-half performance this year would be affected by increased costs associated with new drug launches. The Pfizer weakness afflicted the rest of the sector. Computer shares were in the news. After an early gain, IBM slipped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 90 5/8 when it announced it would go ahead with plans to open a laboratory to develop supercomputers. In contrast, Digital Equipment jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 61 1/8 on reports that it has developed a more powerful computer chip. The ADRs of British Petroleum dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 59 1/4 on news of disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. Canada TORONTO lost ground after a disappointing final phase to the US Treasury's refunding weakened US bonds. Cigarette company shares fell after the Canadian government said that it will tax exports to cut smuggling. Imasco, which owns Imperial Tobacco Ltd, finished CDollars 1 1/4 off at CDollars 37 1/2 . Imperial said the tax will cause Canadian tobacco products to cost nearly double those of comparable American products. The composite index declined 14 points to 3,581.8 and volume came to 28.9m shares.</p>

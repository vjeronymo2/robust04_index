			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Dealers in the derivatives reported a volatile day in stock index futures, in which a dull morning session was transformed by the surprise cut in German interest rates, writes Joel Kibazo. Initial firmness as March opened at 3,420, some 6 points ahead of its previous close, soon faded as dealers decided on a bout of profit-taking. An early feeling that there would be no reduction in German rates encouraged further selling. The move by the Bundesbank was completely unexpected. It brought a turnround in the fortunes of March, helping to pull the underlying cash market higher. Market participants said there were several opportunities to arbitrage in both the morning and the afternoon, a factor said to have been responsible for the volatility in the future's premium to cash. March finished at 3,424, up 10 from its previous close and near parity with the cash market but at a 5-point discount to its fair value premium of minus 5. Volume at the official close was 20,030 contracts. Business in the FT-SE 100 option continued to dominate activity in the traded options, ahead of today's expiry of the index options. It saw 26,169 lots dealt and the Euro FT-SE option 5,396 contracts. Total volume in the sector was 48,814. Glaxo, reporting bumper profits, was the most active stock option at 3,107 lots.</p>

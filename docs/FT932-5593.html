			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / OECD Ministerial Meeting: 'Ray of hope' on tariff-cutting deal AN extensive tariff-cutting agreement among the leading industrial countries has become 'a realistic aim' at next month's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo, trade negotiators said in Paris yesterday, writes David Dodwell, World Trade Editor, in Paris. Negotiators were anxious to play down talk of a breakthrough, given the number of times over the past four years that hopes have been dashed, but the mood at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's annual ministerial meeting indicated that progress has been made during the 13 ministerial meetings held since President Bill Clinton came to power in January. The tariff-cutting agreement, which would embrace both trade in services and in manufactured goods, would pave the way for the long-delayed Uruguay Round negotiations on reform of world trade to be completed by December. While details of an agreement might not be unveiled until the Tokyo summit, a senior US official said negotiators hoped the market access package would be in place before then. 'In a world where economic gloom is all too prevalent, a ray of hope is emerging from these talks,' said Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade negotiator. Ministers in Paris for the OECD meeting agreed that trade liberalisation was one of the only ways to stimulate recovery from recession and tackle chronically high levels of unemployment worldwide. 'We are at last in striking distance of the largest market access package in history,' Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said at the end of a meeting of the 'quad' trade ministers from the US, Japan, the EC and Canada. Ministers refused to be specific about the substance of their market access negotiations, but outlined a sequence of almost non-stop negotiation - both bilateral meetings, and full 'quad' discussions - between now and the Tokyo summit, which begins on July 7. A critical stepping stone will be a series of meetings in Tokyo leading to a full 'quad' on June 23-24. It is understood the ministers discussed harmonisation, reduction or elimination of tariffs on manufactured goods ranging from pharmaceuticals and medical equipment to textiles, ceramics and non-ferrous metals. They also embraced the opening of financial services markets, telecommunications, and audio-visual services. Japan is believed to have offered more open access to its financial services market when officials met their US counterparts in Washington last week. Japanese officials are expected to give details of the new offer to EC negotiators in Geneva today. In contrast with the mood of harmony and progress in Paris on the Uruguay Round, there appeared to be tensions between OECD ministers over Japanese efforts to use the end-of-summit communique to oppose an apparent US decision to seek managed trade and 'target setting' agreements with Tokyo as a means of opening the market to foreign competition. Most OECD ministers informally support Japan, but were divided yesterday on whether the issue should be tackled head on in the communique. There was a strong impression at the conclusion of the Franco-German summit in Beaune yesterday of some movement in the long-stalled Gatt talks, David Buchan writes. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, said he was grateful for German support last week in getting French farmers enough extra EC money to make the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy acceptable to Paris and that his government would decide later this week whether to accept the draft oilseeds deal with the US, which EC farm ministers will decide on next Tuesday. However, he warned that France was not ready to swallow the rest of the farm agreement with the US, which provides for a 21 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised EC farm exports over six years.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YANKEES SIGN LEARY TO 3-YEAR CONTRACT FOR $5.95 MILLION  </P> <P> The New York Yankees signed free agent pitcher Tim Leary to a three-year  guaranteed contract for a reported $5.95 million today.  </P> <P> Leary, acquired from Cincinnati in a trade last winter, was 9-19 for New York  with a 4.11 ERA.  </P> <P> His career record is 54-75 in six-plus major league seasons.  </P> <P> Leary led the Yankees in innings pitched with 208, the fourth straight year he  has worked more than 200 innings. He was often victimized by slim support, with  the Yankees scoring only 38 runs in the 19 games he lost.  </P> <P> "We showed Tim at the end of the season that we were interested in bringing him  back to pitch in 1991 for the New York Yankees," Gene Michael, the Yankees'  vice president and general manager, said.  </P> <P> The contract includes options for 1994 and 1995 at the club's discretion.  </P></p>

Both parties recognise in the preamble that the final aim of  the agreement is Estonia's full integration to the EU. The free  trade regime on industrial goods as well as general trade and  customs principles have been agreed upon and the negotiations  have reached the most sensitive subjects - textile and  agriculture, Kull went on. He added that the EU had made some  concessions concerning possible use of customs duties by Estonia.    The experts are to meet in Tallinn on April 12-13, while the  next meeting of the delegations is to take place in Brussels on  April 27.</p>

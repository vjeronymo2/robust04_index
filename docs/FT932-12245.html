			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Playing the big boys at their own game - Tomy's tilt at Sega and Nintendo Two words dominated the Christmas shopping baskets of parents across the developed world last year - Sega and Nintendo. Tomy, another Japanese toy maker, hopes to join them this year. A share of the electronic games pie would be worth having. The Economist Intelligence Unit says the total retail value of electronic games in 1992 - the overwhelming majority of the market taken by Sega and Nintendo - was Pounds 755m in the UK alone, having grown from only Pounds 100m in 1990. Worldwide, the figure is probably closer to Pounds 10bn and growing fast. The EIU believes the 'present generation of electronic toys has a good two years of growth left'. Much of the market explosion has come from the two giants' clever use of one of the oldest marketing tricks in the book - get the kids to squeal loud enough. In 1992 Sega and Nintendo made clever use of hi-tech TV advertising and sponsorship deals, as well as carefully targeting kid-oriented media slots, all with one aim; make every child want what he or she thought every other child already had. That effort will be repeated this year. Such intense marketing led to bush-fire popularity in the playground, but Sega and Nintendo's astonishing recent growth may be unsustainable. So they are using other means to keep the ball rolling. A battery of legal defences  -against smaller, competing software producers - and technological innovations - CD and eventually virtual reality games - are other tools each uses to fend off competition from the other and from smaller companies. Tomy, which launches its hand-held electronic game, Barcode Battler, in the UK at the end of May, is one such new entrant to the electronic game market. Such is the entrenched position of Sega and Nintendo - together they sold more than 1m hand-held games in the UK in 1992 - that Tomy faces an uphill battle. Tomy's methods of trying to steal market share are a combination of the clever and the unusual. The unusual is that Tomy UK - covering other European markets - has no advertising agency, but instead uses a single consultant to generate the creative ideas for its ad campaigns. Once the ad is made, Tomy concentrates its efforts and marketing spend on well-targeted media buying. Peter Brown, Tomy UK's managing director, estimates that by not using an advertising agency the company saves about Pounds 500,000 annually. As important for him is that 'there is no advertising agency imposing its ideas on us'. Tomy has a Pounds 750,000 marketing budget for Barcode Battler, its biggest product launch so far. The clever element resides to a large extent in the product itself, which tries to tempt not just kids but also parents and large consumer goods manufacturers to get involved. Parent-pull number one is price: Barcode Battler will retail for about Pounds 40, little more than half the price of a typical Sega/Nintendo hand-held game. Moreover, Barcode Battler's software is free, unlike that of Nintendo and Sega, whose extra games retail at around Pounds 25. Barcode Battler uses barcodes (found on almost all consumer goods) as the software with which players stage battles between science-fiction creatures. The game also comes with a set of cards carrying barcodes which the game scans and then translates into points giving extra strengths to players. Parent-pull number two is game content: unlike most electronic games currently available, Barcode Battler requires the players to use addition and subtraction to work out the relative strengths of the combatants. (One turn-off for children might be that there are no visual characters; instead the player sees a numeric display and the 'battles' are fought in purely arithmetical terms.) Tomy can thus claim that Barcode Battler provides both fun and educational activities - something that the best public relations efforts of Sega and Nintendo have failed to do. Whether kids will find Barcode Battler as appealing as the high-definition visuals of competing games is another question. But to some extent an answer is already available. Barcode Battler has already scored well in Japan, where Tomy - which has worldwide turnover of Pounds 500m - sold more than 1.2m units in the year since launch, 800,000 of those in the last six months. In Japan the Barcode Battler has developed its own image - children have discovered that some products' barcodes have much higher values in the game than others. 'But it is not really practical for the consumer to establish the strength of the barcode other than by scanning it through the game,' says Brown. What are prospects for UK sales? 'Our sales team has come up with a forecast of up to 300,000 units, and that would represent about Pounds 7m of turnover, out of the UK figure of Pounds 60m,' he says. But estimating UK demand for Barcode Battler, particularly for the two-month run-up to Christmas, causes headaches. 'It's made in Hong Kong. It takes a month on the water and the production lead time is three months, so there is a four-month gap. The last shipment dates we can make are at the end of November. For Christmas, we have to make a decision early, and we tend to err on the conservative side,' Brown adds. Tomy UK has seen failures in the past. 'Five years ago we had a product called RATS, which stood for Robot Anti-Terrorist Squad,' says Brown. 'We had a wonderful television commercial, everything was in place, but the kids didn't want it. You can increase your advertising and so on but now we try to keep close contact with electronic point-of-sale data to see what's going on. You can over-advertise to kids, they get suspicious - 'why are they advertising so much? It can't be any good'.'</p>

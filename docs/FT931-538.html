			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Canberra in budget deficit commitment MR JOHN DAWKINS, the Australian treasurer, yesterday sought to calm nerves in financial markets by reaffirming the re-elected Labor government's commitment to cut the federal budget deficit. He said the Canberra government stood by its pre-election promise to cut the deficit from about 4 per cent of gross domestic product this year to about one per cent by 1996-97. Mr Dawkins' comments contrasted sharply with reports last week that he regarded the deficit as less important than a drop in unemployment from its near record level of 11.1 per cent. Fears that fiscal policy would be loosened sparked a wave of selling on financial markets on Friday, but prices recovered after his comments.</p>

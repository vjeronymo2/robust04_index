			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Heavy guard for Mr Clean THE voters trickle into the cavernous school building, converted into a polling station, with the solemnity of people attending Mass. Wailing sirens suddenly puncture the tranquility of this balmy Sunday morning in Palermo. Then, amid a screech of brakes, a stocky figures steps out of an armour-plated Fiat Croma, surrounded by bodyguards. Mr Leoluca Orlando, former mayor of Palermo and founder of La Rete, the rapidly growing movement for clean government, has come to cast his vote in Italy's ninth post-war referendum. Mr Orlando is bundled forward, scarcely given time to greet a few supporters. An implacable opponent of the mafia, he is the politician most at risk in Sicily. Inside an upper room, election officials respectfully check his identity card against the electoral register (one for men, another for women). He is handed eight coloured folders, a different one for each of the referendum proposals, then disappears into a small booth. Only his legs are visible. To read the fine print of the proposals should take an average of eight minutes, but he emerges after little more than one. The first slip he casts into the line of eight boxes is yellow - the key ballot for ending proportional representation and introducing a system of majority voting in the Senate. Although he originally backed the referendum movement, led by former Christian Democrat Mr Mario Segni, Mr Orlando has since come out against the majority vote proposal, claiming electoral reform has been hijacked by the traditional parties. 'If the majority system is accepted,' he told a packed crowd on Friday outside Palermo's decaying opera house, 'in the north we will have the regions nearly all represented by the Lombard League and in the south by the (Christian Democrat) old guard. The yes vote will mean that wholly discredited people will be called on to carry out electoral reform.'</p>

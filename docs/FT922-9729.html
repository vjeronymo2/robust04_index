			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Bush to see Los Angeles devastation PRESIDENT George Bush will fly to Los Angeles today to visit the devastated South Central area where riots killed 58 people last week. Mr Bush met cabinet advisers and congressional leaders yesterday to work out his administration's plans for rebuilding the shattered city, where he is expected to stay until Thursday night. In the wake of the riots, Mr Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban development and the administration's enfant terrible, has been given more leeway to press his free-market solutions to the nation's urban problems. Mr Kemp advocates  - with little support from Mr Bush until now  - programmes to reform the welfare system and help the inner-city poor accumulate capital and buy their own homes. 'People do not trash their own property,' he said. Los Angeles remained calm yesterday after three days and nights of burning and looting, and schools and businesses returned to near normality. No serious incidents were reported on Monday night despite Mayor Tom Bradley's decision to lift the dusk to dawn curfew that he had imposed last Thursday. Soldiers in battle dress continued to patrol the streets, however. Police said many of those who took part in the pillaging of shops last week were now returning their booty or leaving it out on the street. Cardinal Roger Mahoney's appeal for looters to return goods to Roman Catholic churches has found a strong response, and police indicated they were offering an informal amnesty to those who voluntarily returned their loot. 'If they tell us, they get a free ride. If we find them, they get arrested,' said one police officer. Arrests are limited, however, for the city's jails are already overflowing and its police courts working overtime to deal with the 13,379 people arrested during the rioting. The costs of containing the rioting and cleaning up afterwards have put a new burden on the already strained finances of Californian state and city authorities. Besides damage to its own property, the city of Los Angeles is estimated to face a bill in excess of Dollars 12m (Pounds 6.7m) for police and firefighters' overtime pay. The greatest cost, however, is likely to come in the shape of falling revenues from property taxes levied on the damaged areas.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADMINISTRATION DEFENDS ITS DIALOGUE WITH PLO  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, brushing aside a storm of criticism from Israel and  its American supporters, on Friday defended its decision to talk to the deputy  chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization and vowed to continue the  six-month-old U.S.-PLO dialogue.  </P> <P> State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Robert H. Pelletreau Jr.,  the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, has held unannounced meetings recently with a  number of PLO officials in addition to Yasser Arafat's deputy, Salah Khalaf.  The department Thursday confirmed the talks with Khalaf after the PLO official  told a Kuwaiti newspaper about them.  </P> <P> "In addition to Mr. Khalaf . . . , there were other people that Ambassador  Pelletreau has been meeting with over the last several weeks," Tutwiler said.  She refused to reveal other names, but she said there has been no meeting with  Arafat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not an Upgrading  </P> <P> Although Tutwiler said the contacts should not be considered an upgrading of  the U.S.-PLO dialogue, she said they began after Pelletreau was recalled to  Washington in April for strategy sessions with Secretary of State James A.  Baker III and other officials.  </P> <P> Tutwiler said Washington's objective in the recent contacts with the PLO has  been to persuade the organization to end its opposition to Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal for Palestinian elections in the West Bank  and Gaza Strip to select representatives who would negotiate with Israel over  limited Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> U.S. officials believe that without at least the tacit approval of the PLO, the  elections can never take place because few Palestinians would defy the  organization to run or vote. U.S. officials believe it will take months to  bring about the elections.  </P> <P> Israeli officials, however, see the election plan as a way to split West Bank  and Gaza Palestinians from their allegiance to the PLO. Shamir has made it  clear that he will not deal with the PLO, even to advance his own election  plan.  </P> <P> Israel and its supporters were especially critical of Pelletreau's decision to  meet Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad.  </P> <P> The Israeli Embassy in Washington issued a statement saying Khalaf "has been a  proponent of the PLO's adherence to its national charter and has pledged its  unwavering support for the use of violence in the armed struggle against  Israel."  </P> <P> Thomas Dine, chairman of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, said  Khalaf "has publicly boasted of his terrorist deeds against Americans and  Israelis and bragged about his ability to deceive the United States."  </P> <P> Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) demanded in a letter Thursday that the Administration  end its dialogue with the PLO. Tutwiler said Baker has read Mack's letter and  the answer was "a polite no."  </P> <P> Wire services reported these other developments:  </P> <P>  -- The PLO formally asked the United States to restrain Israeli occupation  forces in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the organization's news agency WAFA  said.  </P> <P> The PLO made the request in a memorandum delivered to Pelletreau by Hakam  Balawi, the PLO representative in Tunis.  </P> <P> WAFA said the memorandum asked the Bush Administration "to take effective  measures with regard to Israel's terrorist acts in the occupied territories and  to oppose (these acts)."  </P> <P>  -- A Syrian-based PLO faction, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine, said that it had suspended talks on handing over the remains of an  Israeli soldier in retaliation for Israel's deportation of eight Palestinians.  </P> <P> The Israeli army said the eight Palestinians dropped off in southern Lebanon on  Thursday were leaders of the uprising and members of Fatah, the largest PLO  faction, or the Democratic Front.  </P> <P> The soldier, a Druze in the Israeli ground forces, was captured in April, 1983,  during Israel's invasion of Lebanon. The Democratic Front says he was killed in  an Israeli air strike.  </P> <P> The front also accused Israel of deliberately killing a Palestinian identified  as the kidnaper of a U.S. relief worker abducted last week in the Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Mohammed Abu Nasr had been identified as leader of a three-man group that  abducted Chris George, a 35-year-old co-director of the Jerusalem office of the  Save the Children Federation.  </P> <P> The Democratic Front said Nasr did not belong to their faction.  </P></p>

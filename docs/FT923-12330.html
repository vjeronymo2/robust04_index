			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Management: Why a local authority sent its scheme to Coventry Coventry Council's experiment with performance-related pay lasted just 18 months. When the authority withdrew its scheme in 1991, it joined a tiny minority of organisations which have abandoned the concept. The case of National Westminster Bank is more typical. Three years after introducing a PRP bonus system for managers, it launched a review which showed that the scheme needed to be improved. The experiences of Coventry and National Westminster both provide insights for other organisations considering PRP schemes. Coventry's decision to introduce performance pay for chief officers in 1989 was prompted by a feeling that existing rates were not attracting good enough candidates for vacancies. The council opted for the cheaper of two schemes suggested by management consultants. In retrospect, says Roger Manning, head of employment policy, the council did not pitch at the correct level. 'We still left ourselves downmarket.' Partly as a result, a further review was necessary within two years and by then PRP had gained a bad name at the authority. Some of the problems stemmed from the rapid introduction of the scheme. Manning says the first appraisals triggering performance pay were based on 'somewhat arbitrary' judgments. 'People got less than they thought they might and it was not handled sensitively. We did not take enough time.' Such difficulties could have been overcome but some of the senior councillors who had originally been keen on PRP had been replaced by members who were less comfortable with the time-consuming job of assessing the work of senior officers they dealt with. In addition, a new chief executive was not as enthusiastic as his predecessor and was keen to stress the value of team work in the council. Resentment surfaced from people below chief officer level, some of whom believed their contribution was making money for their superior but not for themselves. 'It became clear that the contribution of chief officers was dependent on people who worked for them and to them,' says Manning. 'We felt we had to either extend the scheme downwards to make it more broadly based or we had to come out of it.' National Westminster's annual bonus scheme for its 6,500 managers was introduced four years ago to complement other payment mechanisms including a grading structure and profit sharing. It can add up to 20 per cent to the salary of junior managers and 30 per cent for executives. Mike Goodswen, deputy general manager, personnel, says the bonus scheme has played an important part in reinforcing bank business planning and business objectives. However, a survey of employees conducted after three years showed a large measure of discontent. Some 11 per cent wanted the scheme abolished, while two-thirds felt it was too bureaucratic. Others felt they were not heavily enough involved in the target-setting process. In addition the bank was concerned that the scheme might be too individually based and jeopardising moves towards team work. As a result, the scheme has been changed so that payments can only be triggered when a whole unit meets its targets. The revised scheme focuses on objectives which apply to all managers in a unit. However, individual assessments are still made and if a unit pool is triggered, the unit manager decides how it is distributed. The revised scheme is also less prescriptive than before. Previously, written objectives and assessments were agreed between an individual and his superior. The flow of paper was added to by a 'grandfathering' system, which the superior's superior was required to supervise. Under the revised system, grandfathering and the requirement for written individual assessments have disappeared. The bank also encourages participants to crunch fewer numbers. 'There is more of a tendency to assess softer targets such as improving morale of staff and customer satisfaction rather than just attaining numerical objectives,' says Goodswen.</p>

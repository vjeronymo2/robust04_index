			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Channel 5 bidding row returns to High Court THE LEGAL battle between Five TV and TV-am over their planned bids for the Channel 5 franchise returns to the High Court today amid considerable bitterness. Mr Bruce Gyngell, chairman of TV-am, believes the integrity of the breakfast television company has been tarnished and is determined to pursue the issue for as long as it takes to clear the company's name. On May 5, Five TV issued a writ against TV-am, which is leading a consortium called The Entertainment Channel, for alleged breach of contract. Five TV, whose shareholders include Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City TV in Toronto, said TV-am had signed a confidentiality and exclusivity deal preventing it from bidding for Channel 5 with anyone else. Five TV was horrified when TV-am signed an agreement to bid for the franchise in a consortium including Time Warner, the international media company, and Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group. It meant that a rival was in possession of most of Five TV's confidential plans. Mr Gyngell emphasised that Mr Stratis Zographos, his finance director, had signed what he took to be a normal confidentiality agreement and had not noticed a line blocking any investment in a rival Channel 5 bidder. Mr Gyngell has denounced the clause as a 'restraint on trade', although on May 8 in the High Court TV-am gave an undertaking that it would give Five TV notice before it concluded any agreement to bid for Channel 5. The legal action is delaying any serious attempts at bringing together the rivals to form a single consortium, which would almost certainly be in a position to bid the minimum Pounds 1,000 a year for the franchise. In the Five TV camp are Thames Television, Sony Entertainment, the parent of Columbia and Tristar Pictures, and CanWest, an international broadcaster. Several leading shareholders in the two consortia believe the start-up costs are so high that Channel 5 will be viable only if any bid is uncontested. Apart from the legal action, there is a gulf between the programme plans of the two groups, with Five TV placing greater emphasis on local news and The Entertainment Channel thinking more in terms of a single national channel. As soon as the two sides leave the High Court, the talking may start in earnest before the deadline of July 5.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Chechen Republic has described the proposal by  the Central Election Commission that it take part in the  parliamentary elections on March 13 as an ultimatum which will  aggravate confrontation.    INTERFAX correspondents report that the official Groznyy  accused Russia of unwillingness to quit the gendarme approach,  as well as the policy of threats and intimidation.    The Chechen Republic believes that the date of March 13 is  nothing else than a new deadline for the existence of the  Chechen Republic to be possibly followed by punishment of the  "obstinate".</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Centrist Party Bloc Supports Bishkek </F> Protocol"]    [Text] A press conference was held 26 May with  representatives of the Centrist Party Bloc [CPB] at the staff  headquarters of the Social-Democratic Party of Azerbaijan  [SDPA]. A correspondent of the agency ANS-PRESS reports that  Abil Guseynov, member of the Bureau of the SDPA Central  Committee who opened the press conference, expressed  dissatisfaction with the work of the CPB Coordinating Council  and with the frivolous attitude displayed by certain bloc  members towards the work done in commissions. He informed  journalists that beginning next week, chairmanship of the bloc  will go to the party Ana Veten for a month. Virtually all  representatives of the Centrist Party Bloc, with the exception  of the Social-Democrats, have supported the signing of the  Bishkek Protocol. They have not explained the reasons for their  attitude towards the document, however.    Nizami Suleymanov, chairman of the party Independent  Azerbaijan and a supporter of the Bishkek Protocol, condemned  the fact that it was not discussed by the National Assembly.  Fakhraddin Aydayev, leader of the party Equality of the Peoples  of Azerbaijan, stated that Azerbaijan had no alternative to the  Bishkek Protocol. Abil Guseynov, SDPA representative to the  CPB, stated in turn that the Social-Democrats did not agree with  certain points of the Bishkek Protocol. He stated that Karen  Baburyan was a citizen of Azerbaijan and had no right to sign  any international documents on behalf of the self-proclaimed NKR  [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]. In his view, Azerbaijan  authorities should therefore not have sat down at the  negotiating table with Baburyan.    Guseynov noted that the SDPA was supporting the protocol  because it provides for a cease-fire, which will provide the  opportunity to gain time, especially since this document  represents simply a protocol of intentions. A. Guseynov noted  that his party was opposed to the introduction of Russian troops  into Azerbaijan, and even if they were stationed in the republic  as international peacekeeping forces, such forces must include  Turkish troops.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 12 June, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, king  of the Kingdom of Cambodia, graciously wrote a message to his  beloved children, grandchildren, and compatriots. The content  of this message is as follows:    Dear compatriots, the inter-Cambodian conference for peace  and national reconciliation or the so-called Pyongyang  roundtable ended with a negative result following a day's  discussion because Democratic Kampuchea [DK] representing by His  Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan refused to accept my proposal  for an unconditional, immediate, complete, and permanent  cease-fire for the sake of the entire Cambodian nation and  people despite repeated appeals from Supreme Patriarch Tep Vong,  Supreme Patriarch Buo Kri, Venerable Khousananda, and Venerable  Patriarch Mongkol Tepeacha. The DK party replied that before  such a cease-fire is imposed, the Royal Government must first  accept a minimal policy program of the DK party.    Therefore, the second roundtable to be held at the Royal  Palace in Phnom Penh on 15 June 1994 under the chairmanship of  Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong, my high representative, and  with the participation of the representatives of Samdech Chea  Sim, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, Samdech Hun Sen, and  H.E. Khieu Samphan will first discuss that minimal policy  program.    But if following a hard discussion at the roundtable at the  Phnom Penh Royal Palace there is still the same failure as at  the Chhanghsu-on roundtable in Pyongyang, I, Norodom Sihanouk,  will not propose any other roundtables.    Any person or party responsible for the war in Cambodia  [words indistinct] must be responsible for his/its actions  before the nation, people, and history of Cambodia.    I deeply regret that certain persons or certain parties  still  place personal interests and ambitions above the interests of  their own motherland, people, and race. If these persons and  parties place the noble and vital interests of Cambodia and  those of the Cambodian people above their own interests and  ambitions, Cambodia will quickly return to the noble state that  it was in the Angkorian times.    Dear compatriots, please accept my sincerity and enjoy five  blessings of Lord Buddha for longevity, social prestige,  happiness, strength, and enlightenment.</p>

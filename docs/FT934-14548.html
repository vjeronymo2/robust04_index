			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Skopbank cuts operating losses to FM870m SKOPBANK, the third largest Finnish commercial bank, cut net operating losses to FM870m (Dollars 153.17m) in the first eight months of 1993 from FM2.23bn as credit losses eased, expenses fell and income from financial operations increased. The bank said its full-year loss was now likely to be less than the FM2.1bn predicted at the start of the year. 'The need for additional capital to ensure solvency will reduce considerably,' it added. The bank, majority owned by the government guarantee fund, has already received capital injections from the state to help it weather the Finnish banking crisis. Its total income more than tripled to FM460m from FM144m.</p>

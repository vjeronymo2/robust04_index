			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Bonds: French paper under scrutiny ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market yesterday was spread across a variety of currencies, but investors focused on the French franc market, where two new issues for French financial institutions, totalling FFr2bn, met strong demand. The French bond market was widely tipped to outperform other markets at the start of the year, but initially failed to live up to expectations due to concern about currency weakness. Having put the fear of a devaluation behind them, investors have returned to the French market, which boasts strong economic fundamentals, prompting a strong rally in the last 10 days. On the back of the rally, yesterday's FFr1bn issue of 8 1/4 per cent bonds due 2000 for Banque Nationale de Paris sold out swiftly. Dealers said the issue, arranged by BNP, was considered very reasonably priced to yield 55 basis points above the comparable French government bond yield, and added that BNP, which is rated AA1 by Moody's and AA by Standard Poor's, remains a prime French bank name. A FFr1bn 10-year issue for Credit Foncier de France, with a partly-paid structure (40 per cent up front and the balance in a year) met reasonable, though less enthusiastic, demand. The structure was used by Credit Local for a FFr2bn five-year deal earlier this year. According to BNP, the structure allows investors to take a view on French interest rates. However, some dealers said the structure was of more interest when investors are concerned about currency risk. The deal was expected to appeal to retail investors. Elsewhere, Osprey Mortgage Securities launched its fourth issue of mortgage-backed securities, arranged by Goldman Sachs. The underlying pool of mortgages is originated by SFK, a subsidiary of Sweden's SE Banken. Goldman said that Moody's downgrading of SE Banken's debt last week to A2 did not affect the triple-A rating of the mortgage-backed securities. The Dollars 280m issue brings the amount of mortgages securitised by SE Banken under the Osprey programme to more than Dollars 1bn. So far, SE Banken has been the only Swedish bank to securitise mortgages, but the crisis in the Swedish banking industry is expected to encourage other banks to securitise mortgages in order to remove assets from their balance sheets. In the Eurosterling market, Confederation Life, the Canadian insurance company, launched a Pounds 100m issue of 10-year subordinated bonds which will count as lower tier 2 capital under Basle capital guidelines, which came into force at the start of the year. The 10-year bonds were priced to yield 160 basis points over the comparable gilt. The lead manager reported strong demand but some dealers said investors were concerned about the credit.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> New World Entertainment reported discussions concerning an unidentified party's  "possible interest in acquiring the entire company." The Los Angeles-based  independent movie and television producer said that "no decision has been made  regarding any such transaction." The statement was prompted by a spurt in  trading of New World's shares, which have sent its price up 60% to $5 over the  last three days.  </P></p>

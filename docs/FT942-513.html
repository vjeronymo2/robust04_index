			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Feisty Rivlin would press hard for fiscal discipline In nominating Ms Alice Rivlin as budget director on Monday, President Bill Clinton has chosen a feisty, straight-talking economist who will press hard for responsible fiscal policies. The nomination was yesterday welcomed by Washington insiders as just reward for a long record of competence in budgetary matters. Ms Rivlin gained the respect of legislators in both political parties during her long tenure as founding director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office from 1975 to 1983. She also exerted considerable influence on policy through books and articles written over several decades while a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a centrist Washington think-tank. Some observers, however, were surprised that Mr Clinton should have chosen somebody with whom he lacks a personal rapport as budget director, one of the most powerful jobs in an administration. The Office of Management and Budget director is responsible for the annual federal budget and exercises broad oversight over the main spending programmes. 'She will speak her mind even when it's not what the White House wants to hear,' said Mr Bruce MacLaury, president of the Brookings Institution. Ms Rivlin has other advantages. She is keener on deficit reduction than anybody else in the administration and her appointment is a way of signalling to financial markets the continuing importance placed on budget retrenchment. Bond prices rose following the announcements on Monday, although this probably reflected hope that Mr Leon Panetta's appointment as chief of staff would introduce some much needed discipline to the White House. Mr Clinton was also able to reaffirm his commitment to promoting women and minorities and thus to making his administration 'look like America.' If, as expected, Ms Rivlin sails through Senate confirmation hearings, she will become the first female budget director in US history. The Clinton administration will be the first to have two women in top economic policy positions, with Laura D'Andrea Tyson already chairing the Council of Economic Advisers. Ms Rivlin's most important task initially will be to try to prevent healthcare reforms increasing the budget deficit. But her ability to influence the more general course of fiscal policy will be limited. The main fiscal decisions for Mr Clinton's first term were taken in the 1993 budget: further deficit-cutting measures of any significance are improbable despite pleas for further action from bodies such as the International Monetary Fund. Ms Rivlin brings less political expertise to the job than Mr Panetta, a long-serving congressman from California. She may make good this deficiency by selecting a Capitol Hill insider as deputy.</p>

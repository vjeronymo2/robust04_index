			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: US price statistics drive share prices higher - Market Report A UK stock market trading cautiously in the first half of yesterday's session exploded with confidence after an unexpected fall in US producer price figures in September triggered a sharp rise on Wall Street and in global bond markets. After showing little change at mid-session, the FT-SE 100 share index jumped by more than 50 points on the US data, before closing a net 41.4 points up at 3,141.9. Trading volume jumped by nearly 12 per cent. The market's optimistic mood was helped by a buoyant speech at the Conservative Party Conference from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, in which he reiterated the government's firm stance against inflation. The Bundesbank's decision to leave German rates unchanged was no surprise but buttressed confidence that upward pressures on world rates are slackening. The fall of 0.5 per cent in US September producer prices, and a gain of 0.1 per cent in the core rate, reduced the threat of an early tightening in Federal Reserve credit policy and lends support to confidence that the recovery in the US economy can be achieved without increasing inflationary pressures. However, some analysts warned that today brings another round of important statistics on the US economy, including the consumer price index, industrial production and capacity utilisation numbers. These could still present a challenge to optimistic views on US economic recovery and interest rate prospects. In the early part of the session, share prices were easier until stock index futures opened firmly. Even then, however, share prices trod water, with investors appearing unwilling to drive the recovery in the stock market any further. Wednesday evening saw an apparent slackening in the pace of the stock market upswing, although traders showed unwillingness to take profits. Active features included the defence sector, where disclosure that GEC had declared interest in the VSEL bid situation alerted investors. The market appeared unsure whether GEC would bid - its shares advanced yesterday - and VSEL, although still above the British Aerospace terms, made only a modest response to the news. But the gain on the FT-SE 100 Index jumped from 3 points to 23 points within the hour which included announcement of the US price data. The chief impetus came from bond markets but the December contract on the Footsie also led the way ahead, moving above 3,178 at the day's peak and showing a good premium against the underlying stock market. The influence of the stock index future contract implied a focus on the blue-chip Footsie 100 stocks. The FT-SE Mid 250 index, taking in a range of second line issues, gained only 21.3 points for a close of 3,556.6. Trading in non-Footsie stocks made up around 55 per cent of total business yesterday. Although gains were fairly evenly spread across the range of the market, it was the US-influenced stocks which stood out at the close of trading in London, when the Dow Industrial Average was ahead by 38 points in early trading. The FT-SE 100 share index has risen by just over 185 points since its return to the bull tack a week ago. This is a heartening development for analysts who had predicted that by the year-end, the Footsie would be in the 3,400 plus range. Market traders now hope that subdued inflationary pressures will enable base rates to remain at their present levels for the rest of the year, while economic recovery shows through more clearly, bringing higher earnings and dividend payouts from leading British companies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by P. Dzambazovski: "The Two Currents Against the </F> Center"]    [Text] The PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] Congress  should take place by 15 January this year and the Preparatory  Committee is intensively engaged in it, claiming that there will  be no postponement this time. Menduh Taci, the leader of the  so-called "hard" current and president of the Tetovo branch, has  also become a member of the Committee. By the way, the delegates  and ministers consider Taci an illegitimate president of the  so-called new party leadership constituted at the Gostivar  meeting last month.    As a reminder, toward the end of last year the PDP's breakup  came to a head. The "hard" current did not give up its request  for a change in the leading structures, which resulted in the  collective resignation of the central Presidency, "in the  interest of consolidation." The group headed by Taci received  support from official Albania, which resulted in a meeting  organized in Gostivar, where the new leadership was nominated,  which was then proclaimed as illegitimate by the group of  delegates and ministers. However, it seems that a kind of a  compromise has been reached by making Taci a member of the  Preparatory committee. His nomination was made in his capacity  as president of the Tetovo branch, although the Committee  considers his office illegitimate. We discovered from  well-informed sources that such a decision was reached in order  to avoid a deepening of the conflict situation, and it was  emphasized that the Tetovo assembly was not held, and if Taci  had not been elected president of the branch, and a delegate as  well as a member of the Central Assembly, the Tetovo assembly  would not participate in the Congress.    The same sources told us that there is a growing sense  within  the PDP that the collective Central Presidency resignation was a  political error and nonsense, because there was no perception of  further activities. The division within the party was deepened,  and there was interference by official and semiofficial  political circles in neighboring Albania, thus causing total  confusion within the membership. The most surprising thing that  happened was the support that Albania gave to Menduh Taci, who  stated in Tirana that the new leadership (elected in Gostivar)  would represent a factor of stability in Macedonia, (as if the  old one had not been such a factor), while his assessments in  Macedonia were that the old leadership was too mild, announcing  a radical change in the party national policy concerning the  state institutions. It was also estimated that the division  caused a loss of confidence among the membership regarding the  different currents of the power struggle and that the so-called  center of the party, which, according to these sources, stands  firmly on an election course, is in practical terms without a  partner. Allegedly, the "hard" current does not have a precise  political platform and its campaign stems from a superficial  criticism. The group of delegates and ministers have been  deeply involved with the authorities and policy, and, allegedly,  they do not reflect clearly the wishes of the membership.    Concerning the Congress Preparatory Committee, which has the  role of temporary party leadership, it is now headed by delegate  Abdurahman Aliti, the documents are being prepared by delegate  Naser Ziberi, and the member of the resigned Presidency, Mahi  Nesimi, is engaged in the preparation of the program, and is  also going to be in charge of the press service. The  well-informed sources claim that Abdurahman Aliti is going to be  the new PDP president.  <H5>  [Box, p 4] </H5> <H5>  News Conference Scheduled but Not Held </H5>   Yesterday a news conference was scheduled in the  headquarters  of the PDP, organized by the former Party President Nevzat  Halili. At least that was the information delivered to the  press. The journalists were there at the scheduled time, but  Halili did not appear. The people in the PDP headquarters were  surprised at the presence of the journalists, and nobody could  give any explanation.    It was either because of false information given on Halili's  behalf, his inability to send information to the PDP  headquarters or his being unable to arrive at the scheduled time  -- or was it perhaps a totally different reason?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Batam, Riau, May 23 (ANTARA) -- Indonesian [RI] and  PNG (Papua New Guinea) officials Monday began a two-day meeting  here Monday to discuss security in their common border regions.    The chief Indonesian delegate, Brig. Gen. Cholid Ghozali, in  remarks at the meeting's opening, said the gathering was an  opportunity to formulate better ways of maintaining security and  stability along the border shared by the two countries.    He said talks at the meeting would also touch on the  implementation of certain portions of a memorandum of  understanding between the two countries on the establishment of  their sub-committee on border security.    Formation of the sub-committee on border security was  decided  at a meeting of the Indonesia-PNG Joint Border Committee held in  Rabaul last year, he noted.    The leader of the PNG delegation, Colonel Andrew Trongat,  meanwhile said the meeting would try to find ways of improving  security in the border region where a number of small incidents  had taken place.    Overall security in the border region, however, was "good",  he said.    What the present meeting had to try to accomplish was better  coordination between security agencies on both sides of the  border to minimize the occurrence of incidents, Trongat said.    Security in RI-PNG border regions was in the past sometimes  stirred by Indonesians crossing the border into PNG territory  instigated by the security disturbing movement, GPK.    Irian Jaya Governor Jacob Pattipi said recently these people  had been deceived by hollow promises of a better life.    Most of the border-crossers had now returned to their home  villages in Irian Jaya with the assistance of the PNG  government, he said.</p>

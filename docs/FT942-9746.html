			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: GrandMet falls on Pounds 40m hit Food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan stood out as the chief casualty among leading stocks in London as the market reacted nervously to a shock Pounds 40m charge included in trading figures announced yesterday. The results were in line with most estimates but the group reported lower stock levels at its IDV unit in the US. However, most sector specialists remained enthusiastic on the group's end-of-year figures, saying these would be helped by an unexpectedly low tax charge and a boost in profits from the Burger King subsidiary. Ms Michelle Proud of NatWest Securities summed up the general feeling: 'There was a lot of good news but the bad news hit everyone for six.' Analysts' forecasts were cut accordingly, although earnings per share estimates were maintained and in some cases lifted slightly. Kleinwort Benson moved to Pounds 959m for the current year from Pounds 979m but kept its earnings estimate to 31.9p. SGST dropped by Pounds 40m to Pounds 950m but raised the eps figure a penny to 3.2p. UBS held steady at Pounds 995m and raised its earnings to 33.4p, while NatWest Securities moved to Pounds 940m and 32p of earnings. GrandMet slid sharply to close 26 lower at 457p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 11m. Dealers said there was heavy switching into Guinness, which improved 5 to 498p.</p>

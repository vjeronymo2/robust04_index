			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lucia Domville and Jose Luis Gaona] </F>   [Text] Private sector and academic sources have predicted  that one of the last radical measures of the Salinas  administration to perfect the trade opening and balance the  deficit will be to draw up technical rulings on imports by the  nine State Secretariats.    The process of enforcing standardization measures has been  expedited since the implementation of NAFTA in an effort to  regulate trade practices. The goal is to standardize the  regulations of the signatory nations in just a few years,  perhaps five.    The Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat  (Secofin)  has published in the official gazette an agreement that  identifies 413 tariff groups for the classification of  merchandise subject to compliance with official Mexican rulings.    Nevertheless, terms for the regulation of imports are  pending  from the Secretariats of Agriculture, Communications, SEMIP  [Energy, Mines, and Parastate Industry], Health, Sedesol  [Secretariat for Social Development], Fishing, Labor, and  Tourism.    Sources from the business sector, the National Agricultural  Council, the UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico]  Legal Investigation Institute [IIJ], Canacitra [National  Association of the Processing Industry], and experts on the  issue have said that Mexico needs to create a regulatory system  like those used in the United States and Canada if it wants to  compete under equal conditions.    The IIJ authorities explained that the Mexican negotiators  did not understand until very late that pure free trade does not  exist and that governments unilaterally close or open the way  for imports to their country.    That is why the over 400 Secofin terms published in the  official gazette and the announcement of several regulatory  packages are viewed as measures to restrict the flow of imports  to Mexico and thereby control the trade deficit.    When this six-year period was initiated, many Secofin  officials were inexperienced in world trade and lacked knowledge  about how developed nations use free trade in their favor. That  is why they were determined to apply the free market doctrine  blindly, thus adversely affecting many companies.    Now, during the last leg of the Salinas administration,  Secofin negotiators have learned how to use international laws  in Mexico's favor. For many sectors, however, these measures  are coming a bit late, representatives of the Mexican private  sector have said.    The first sign Secofin gave of reversing the trade opening  initiated in 1986 was the application of compensatory taxes  against Chinese products.    Nevertheless, in these past years, the Union of  International  Trade Practices has actively sought out import products that  harm national production and dumping [previous word in English]  practices and have worked to identify sectors that require  protection for survival.    Secretariat officials have said that the standardization  process, "always operative," has been accelerated in the past  two months in an attempt to hold back massive importation.    The use of measures related to standardization takes up  Chapter IX under Article 904 of NAFTA.    In the first part, the "right to apply regulations for the  security of human, animal, or plant life and for the  environmental health of the consumer, the same as any measure  that assures its fulfillment or its application," was agreed  upon.    The second part establishes that "each party can apply the  levels of protection it considers appropriate to achieve  legitimate goals for security or protection matters."    Nevertheless, the fourth part states that the application or  creation of technical regulations or nontariff barriers cannot  be used as obstacles to trade.    Legal experts say the negotiating terms are ambiguous  because  a ruling could be interpreted for one party as falling under the  protection or security provided for in the first part of Article  904; while the other party could argue that such provisions are  an obstacle to free trade and are therefore prohibited by the  fourth part of the same article.</p>

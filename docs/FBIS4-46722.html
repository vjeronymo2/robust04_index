			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unsigned editorial: "The Signs of Time"] </F>   [Text] Last Saturday Latvia signed a treaty with Russia on  the withdrawal of that country's army, but there is no rejoicing  in Latvia itself. It is clear to everyone that the foreign army  had to withdraw unconditionally and without any reservations.  Yet in concrete politics, the Latvians had to accommodate  themselves to the realities and to make concessions to Russia.    Unlike in Lithuania's case, from where the Russian army was  withdrawn without any treaty, and the only legal document was  the withdrawal schedule, Latvia was forced to sign a treaty.  Moreover, it will have to assume obligations in accordance with  the protocol on social guarantees to the retired Russian  military personnel, who had become particularly fond of Latvia.  It is not by accident that the Latvians, who yearn for the  quickest possible disappearance of the former empire's legacy  from their land, are now experiencing a moral, psychological  injury, even a humiliation, as they are compelled to take care  also of the uninvited intruders.    Even after the army's withdrawal by the end of August, a  malignant ulcer will remain for five and a half years on  Latvia's land -- the Russian-controlled radar station at Skrunda.    Could Latvia have avoided the concessions, relying only on  "justice and law?" Hardly. Envious of the Lithuanians, the  Latvians themselves recognize that they had missed the best time  to seek the army's withdrawal, because Russia's political  attitudes toward the Baltic countries have undergone a distinct  change during the last year, with the strengthening of the  imperial and nationalistic tendencies. By the way, they might  become a serious obstacle to the ratification of this treaty in  the State Duma. There is no shortage of people there who want  the Russian soldiers never to leave the so-called "near abroad"  or wish them to remain there at least symbolically, so that in  the future they can stage a full return.    Latvia's concessions (Russia has practically made no  concessions) may become a bad precedent for the negotiations  between Estonia and Russia. Estonia is facing the same pressing  problems as Latvia (they differ only in their proportions).  Therefore Estonians can hardly congratulate the Latvians, who  have left them behind in the negotiations with Russia. The tone  of the latter toward Estonia is becoming more and more severe;  Russia's representatives are stating categorically that the  remaining military units will not be withdrawn unless a treaty  is signed and Estonia obligates itself to provide social  guarantees for retired military personnel.    It goes without saying that all these problems and the new  strategy in the relations with Russia had to be a subject of  discussions yesterday at Jurmala, where a meeting of the  presidents of the three Baltic countries took place. The unusual  thing about this meeting was its confidential character, with  even the closest advisers absent. Until now, the policies of the  Baltic countries were being coordinated publicly; therefore, the  emergence of confidentiality indicates the existence of certain  problems, which are to be resolved in a closed circle.    The Russian army was withdrawn from Lithuania one year  earlier than it will be evacuated from Latvia. As we rejoice  about that fact, we rarely pose to ourselves a natural question  -- why? Obviously, it did not happen because the Kremlin is  especially fond of the Lithuanians and has less love to spare  for the Latvians and the Estonians.    J. Paleckis, the President's adviser on international  questions, mentioned to LIETUVOS RYTAS several factors that  "contributed to an earlier withdrawal." First, Lithuania and  Russia had signed a time-table for withdrawal already in the  fall of 1992. However, Lithuania refused to sign a prepared  treaty, which made the chairman of the Supreme Council, V.  Landsbergis, feel that he was cheated. (Subsequently, the forces  of the opposition in Lithuania asserted unanimously that there  was no need whatsoever for such a treaty.)    Second, the international opinion, and in particular that of  the West, supported the just demands of the Baltic countries  (but this was equally applicable to Lithuania, Latvia and  Estonia).    Third, Lithuania's moderate position and the search for  dialogue, without responding to the psychological warfare that  was initiated by Russia.    And fourth, as in sports, there was no shortage of luck.  Otherwise, the Russian army might have remained symbolically, at  least.    A more astute individual would probably not be satisfied  with  such reasoning. The factors mentioned above might appear as only  the external (and smaller) tip of the iceberg, protruding above  the water line. Time may reveal much more complex processes that  took place behind the scenes of negotiations for the army's  withdrawal, in the corridors of the Kremlin, the Russian  Ministry of Defense, the General Staff, and the Western capitals.    It is obvious already that the emphatically good relations  between the former minister of national defense, A. Butkevicius,  and the Russian military leadership also contributed  significantly to Lithuania's success.    The scandal, which was caused when certain circumstances of  the purchase of weapons for the Lithuanian army came to light,  indicates that these relations were also based on mutual  material advantage.    It appears that the Latvians and the Estonians did not have  such clever ministers and businessmen. Perhaps this is why a  foreign army still remains in their countries?</p>

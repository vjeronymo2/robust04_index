			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Moscow, April 21 (AFP) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin and his US counterpart Bill Clinton have agreed to  hold an international summit meeting on the Bosnia crisis,  possibly as soon as next month, a spokesman said Thrusday.    Yeltsin's spokesman, Vyacheslav Kostikov, told reporters at  a  briefing that summit was discussed in a phone conversation  between the two leaders late Wednesday and would include in  addition to themselves leaders from the United Nations, the  European Union and the warring sides in the former Yugoslavia.    The two leaders, who spoke for about 40 minutes, agreed that  the conference required careful planning but stressed that the  situation was "red-hot" in Bosnia, Kostikov said.    "The assurance was given that all decisions to resolve the  conflict would be jointly taken", Kostikov added.    "Any attempt at an individual, unilateral solution is not  constructive," he said.    Yeltsin reiterated his firm stand in favor of peaceful  solutions and his rejection of "any type of bombing" by NATO  warplanes in Bosnia. [passage omitted]    In Paris, French President Francois Mitterrand expressed  satisfaction over the planned conference, which he said should  be held as soon as possible considering the urgency of the  situation, his spokesman Jean Musitelli said Thursday.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S., SOVIETS AGREE TO REDOUBLE EFFORTS;  </P> <P> UNITED NATIONS: BAKER AND SHEVARDNADZE STRESS IMPORTANCE OF SOLIDARITY IN  CONFRONTING IRAQ.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze agreed Wednesday to redouble U.S.-Soviet efforts to "tighten the  noose on Saddam Hussein," a senior U.S. official said.  </P> <P> Baker and Shevardnadze spent about half of their four-hour meeting discussing  the Persian Gulf crisis, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the  Washington-Moscow solidarity in opposition to the Iraqi president's invasion of  Kuwait.  </P> <P> The senior official said the two men considered additional economic steps to  increase the pressure on Iraq but did not talk about possible military action.  The official provided no indication of what the additional economic measures  might entail.  </P> <P> Significantly, all of the economic measures that were suggested after President  Bush's Helsinki summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  earlier this month were imposed by the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Baker scornfully rejected an Iraqi demand that the U.S. Embassy in  Kuwait provide the Baghdad authorities with the names of American citizens who  have taken refuge there and expel all non-diplomats from the premises.  </P> <P> Baker said the Iraqi demand "falls under the heading . . . of the three R's:  We've read it, it's repugnant and we reject it." He said the U.S. government  has no intention of naming the individuals hiding in the embassy building.  </P> <P> Baker confirmed that Iraq has threatened to hang any American diplomats found  harboring Americans who have gone into hiding to escape Iraq's roundup of  foreign men. The Baghdad government issued a similar threat of execution  earlier to Kuwaitis found to be giving shelter to foreigners. So far, there is  no indication that any of the threats have been carried out.  </P> <P> Asked if the latest Iraqi demand would affect U.S. policy of providing haven  for non-diplomats in Kuwait, Baker said: "Having rejected it, I think you would  conclude that it doesn't affect the policy approach that the United States is  following."  </P> <P> The Iraqi government claims that the embassies in Kuwait have lost their  diplomatic immunity because of Iraq's claim to have annexed the oil-rich  emirate.  </P> <P> The continuing crisis in the gulf overshadowed arms control, the usual staple  of U.S.-Soviet negotiations. The senior official said Baker and Shevardnadze  discussed both the conventional forces in Europe and the strategic arms  reduction negotiations but made very little progress.  </P> <P> The official said that only about an hour was devoted to the topic, and "they  simply ran out of time." He said Baker and Shevardnadze will meet at least once  more before Shevardnadze returns home, and they hope to make some progress on  arms control at that time.  </P> <P> Arms control has been an issue without a home for weeks. Bush and Gorbachev  hardly discussed the matter at Helsinki, announcing that Baker and Shevardnadze  would go into it when they met a few days later in Moscow. When the topic was  also given short shrift at the Moscow meeting, officials said it would come up  at the United Nations.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't characterize the meeting as making any progress per se," the senior  U.S. official said. He said Baker and Shevardnadze had time to do little more  than review their position.  </P> <P> The official said that U.S. and Soviet arms control negotiators are meeting in  New York to narrow technical differences before Baker and Shevardnadze meet  again, probably next week.  </P> <P> The gulf crisis even intruded on the superpower arms control agenda. The  official said Baker and Shevardnadze agreed that the two countries must give  much greater emphasis to stopping the spread of nuclear, chemical and  biological weapons and the ground-to-ground missile systems needed to deliver  them.  </P> <P> Although Washington and Moscow have agreed on the desirability of  non-proliferation measures in the past, the official said, the subject has now  forced its way to the top of the agenda.  </P> <P> "This becomes the important arms control item for the '90s," the official said.  "Iraq gives this a new emphasis because an Iraq with nuclear capability is  unthinkable. But it is not just Iraq."  </P></p>

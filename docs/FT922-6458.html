			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / As They Say in Europe: The Season in full bloom - An Italian fascinated by English roses COUNT Paolo Filo Della Torre has officially opened the Season, so, English society can proceed to enjoy itself. Count Paolo is the London correspondent of the Rome paper La Repubblica, and has been in the UK since time immemorial. He must be the doyen of the foreign press corps - and possibly the only real gentleman among the lot. Filo Della Torre was in his element on Tuesday. 'Elizabeth of England, dressed in mauve, opened the Chelsea flower show, the most beautiful exhibition of flowers in the world. It has been held since 1913 in May in the park of the Royal Hospital . . . The show, together with Royal Ascot, the garden parties of Buckingham Palace, the picnics in the garden of the opera house of Glyndebourne in Sussex, the summer exhibition of the Royal Academy, glorious Goodwood and the speech from the throne in the House of Lords, provides one of the dates of the Season.' Purists may quibble with some of this, the Queen did not exactly open the show, but that hardly matters in Count Paolo's latest celebration of Englishness. It was he who published the only known Guide to Margaret Thatcher's England; where Finchley is, how to get to Grantham, and so on. The flower show is placed in the fullest, and most elegant, context. Having described it as 'Proustian' in atmosphere, but with no need to go 'in the search of times past,' he continues: 'For the English from age three to 103, flowers are an irresistible attraction. Napoleon called the British a nation of shopkeepers, but in reality they constitute a nation of gardeners, and the most fascinating and delicate of the women are known as an 'English rose,' a compliment which is often directed at Lady Diana.' It may seem surprising that the paper should devote so much space to the Chelsea flower show but there is a good reason. Count Paolo shrewdly included a list of Italian notables who were present at this august gathering. Among them were Simonetta Scalferi and Carlo Caracciolo. On investigation they turn out to be, respectively, the wife of the editor of La Repubblica and the chairman of the board. The delights of start of the Season are a harbinger of those of summer and the week's fine weather brought out a rash of stories on holiday themes: drought, the problems of timesharing and motorway madness. In reporting the findings of the French 'Court of Accounts,' in its investigation into the finances of the autroutes, Liberation noted the marvellous business opportunities offered by feasibility studies for new motorways, opportunities which only rarely involve actual construction. In Lisieux, a series of studies had been commissioned for competing routes for the past 20 years but no decision has been reached. The toll system is the bane of British drivers in France but, now, they will be able to point to the latest report as evidence of its absurdity. Thus, Liberation notes, having once granted a concession for a toll-motorway, the local authorities are still compelled to maintain the route nationale which runs parallel in order to meet the obligation to provide a free service. The result is that the whole system seems to be bust - the paper says that the eight companies which operate it have FFr112bn (Pounds 11.3bn) of debt, FFr1.8bn of capital and receipts stand at a mere FFr15bn annually. Such figures might scupper British plans for private toll roads. And revelations in El Pais could help do the same to some Spanish time-share operations. You may have wondered what happens when Spaniards try to sell timeshares to each other. Not much, it seems - only 2,000 have invested in such projects. The account in El Pais opens thus, ''Hello, I'm Pilar.' And the charming senorita from one of those firms accompanies them into what looks like a bingo hall where Mariles and Manolo undergo two hours of sheer oppression.' Consumer organisations are up in arms about the system, there are no checks on the intimidatory techniques that the writer, Angeles Espinosa, alleges she found. The promoters, under Spanish law, are entitled to call a timeshare apartment the 'property' of the sharers, when in fact 'it is nothing more than right to use someone else's property.' I had not thought of it that way before. 'Switzerland, which one had imagined buried in cosy isolation in its Alpine treasure chest, courts the EC having allowed itself to be seduced by the IMF. The news is no more surprising than the twist taken by the debate at Westminster on the Maastricht treaty. Margaret Thatcher may well shriek in her corner, the prime minister John Major applies with total serenity the signature of his country, up to now the least 'European' of the Twelve, to the treaty which seals the political and economic union . . . Exit the archetype of splendid isolation . . . .' (Patrick Sabatier, under the headline 'The end of received ideas' in Liberation.) James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen Yonghong (7115 3057 4767) and trainee Fan </F> Zhigeng (2868 1807 5087)]    [Text] Beijing, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- At a news conference  this afternoon, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang  commented on the adoption by the Hong Kong Legislative Council  [Legco] of the partial "electoral bill" submitted by Chris  Patten and the unilateral decision by the British to make public  the contents of the Sino-British talks. He said: The door to  negotiation has been closed by the British. Responsibility for  the disruption of cooperation between China and Britain on Hong  Kong's political system rests entirely on the British.    A reporter asked: On 24 February, Legco passed the  first-phase draft legislation on the 1994-95 election  arrangements. The Hong Kong Government will next submit the  second-phase draft legislation to Legco for discussion. What  are your comments?    Shen Guofang said: Last December, before the Chinese and the  British had reached any agreement on district board election  arrangements, the British side submitted the first-phase draft  of legislation to the Hong Kong Legislative Council, thus  directly causing the termination of the talks between China and  Britain. Now, disregarding repeated dissuasion by China, and the  aspirations of every social level in Hong Kong for a settlement  of the question of the 1994-1995 election arrangements through  negotiation, the British side has had the first-phase draft  legislation on the 1994- 95 election arrangements passed by the  Hong Kong Legco and has decided to submit the second-phase draft  legislation to Legco for discussion. This fully shows that the  British do not have the sincerity to solve the question through  cooperation with the Chinese, and are bent on moving further on  this erroneous path.    Shen Guofang said: "The door to negotiation has been closed  by the British. Responsibility for the disruption of  cooperation between China and Britain on Hong Kong's political  system rests entirely with the British. The Chinese side  reiterates that, without an agreement between China and Britain,  the framework of the three-tiered political system established  through British Hong Kong authorities, legislation cannot last  beyond 30 June 1997."    Another reporter asked: The British side today published a  white paper which discloses the detailed contents of last year's  Sino- British talks. What are your comments on this?    Shen Guofang said: An understanding not to disclose to the  public the contents of the negotiations was reached between  China and Britain before the talks began last year. Britain's  unilateral publication of the contents constitutes a violation  of the understanding reached between the two sides. The Chinese  cannot but react in due course.    Asked about the comments of Australian Foreign Minister  Evans  who, in a recent television interview in Australia, expressed  strong support for Chris Patten's political package, Shen  Guofang said the current issue between China and Britain on Hong  Kong was not whether the territory should have democracy, but  whether a commitment was to be honored. There had been a series  of agreements and understandings between the two countries on  the evolution of Hong Kong's political system. But the British  were now trying to repudiate them and have their own way. This  was absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese.    He said: In the more than one hundred years of British rule  there has been no democracy at all in Hong Kong. It is with  ulterior motives that Britain is pushing Chris Patten's package  in Hong Kong before it leaves. It is futile to defend the  package.    Shen Guofang emphasized: The maintenance of Hong Kong's  social stability and economic prosperity is not only in the  interests of China and Britain, but also of those countries that  have economic interests in Hong Kong. The question of Hong Kong  is a matter between China and Britain before 30 June 1997, and  from 1 July 1997, it will be purely an internal affair of China.  It is inappropriate to make irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong  political affairs.</p>

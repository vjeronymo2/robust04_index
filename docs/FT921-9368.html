			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Action by Lloyd's Names: Praise for an individual who challenged the establishment - Pounds 116m Outhwaite settlement is significant triumph for those who acted to recover heavy losses THE TENSION of months of negotiation was only just beginning to lift yesterday morning as Mr Peter Nutting detailed the settlement reached for members of the Outhwaite syndicate. The legal dispute pitted him against the Lloyd's establishment. Mr Nutting, 56, is himself an impeccable establishment figure - an old Etonian, ex-Irish Guardsman, magistrate and Lloyd's council member. He persuaded several hundred Names to join his action, often against the advice of their accountants and other consultants. While others hailed the settlement as a stunning victory for the pressure group, Mr Nutting himself put it more modestly: 'I think it's a thoroughly satisfactory outcome of what has been a long and difficult road.' Many Names heaped praise on him yesterday. One said: 'He's a saint in my eyes. He did it all and generated the settlement. He saved me from bankruptcy.' Another said: 'The legal action was like clockwork.' But others did not want to talk publicly about the arrangement. 'When all's said and done it has been a very personal and painful experience,' said one Name who wanted to remain anonymous yesterday. 'I'm just pleased it is all over.' Mr Robert Williams, a businessman with a Pounds 60,000 share of the syndicate's income, against which he estimates he has already paid out Pounds 280,000, said: 'My first impression is that the settlement is very good. I will certainly be buying a magnum of champagne. Since Mr Williams joined as a Name in 1973 he had expected an average return of about 10 per cent over the years. 'Outhwaite was a catastrophe far beyond anything that had happened,' he said. Mr Nutting took over the chairmanship of the 1982 Outhwaite Names Association in summer 1988. Within 18 months the action group grew from just over 400 to nearly 1,000. Names were persuaded to contribute more than Pounds 2m to finance the legal fight. Late in 1990 several hundred Names sent Mr Nutting post-dated cheques to be drawn in the event of a legal defeat. The problems in determining the size of claims and therefore the value of a settlement had clearly vexed Mr Nutting throughout the discussions. He said there was 'formidable difficulty' in establishing the size of the claims. There was no visible bitterness towards Mr Richard Outhwaite. 'I have paid tribute to his efforts at damage limitation,' said Mr Nutting. 'He has done a super job. I very much hope he and his team will continue to be involved in running the 1982 underwriting year (which has still not been closed). It would be in all of our best interests. Some Names, however, were worried about the fact that Mr Outhwaite has not been able to close the 1982 underwriting year and that claims could continue to come in. One Name said, 'This is still a running sore.' 'It's a very long hard road to go down. I would say litigation is extremely unpredictable. With even a good case there's a lot of luck all round.' Mr Nutting will not be among those dissecting the settlement over the next few days. 'I'm leaving for a holiday in Barbados at 1pm,' he chuckled as he left the press conference.</p>

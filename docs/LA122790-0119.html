			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COLD KILLS SOME FLOWERS BOUND FOR ROSE  PARADE  </P> <P> The pre-Christmas cold snap killed some flowers destined for the Tournament of  Roses parade, but float builders said Wednesday that most parade-goers will not  notice any difference in the bloom department.  </P> <P> "It has us scurrying around, keeping us busy, but it's nothing serious," said  Rick Chapman, owner of Festival Artists in Azusa, which is building 11 floats  for the New Year's Day parade in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Between 5% and 10% of the flowers that were expected to be attached beginning  Wednesday were destroyed by subfreezing weather since late last week, according  to three of the largest float builders.  </P> <P> Marigolds were the biggest loss, said Felicia Berry, floral consultant for  Festival Artists, which plans to substitute carnations or yellow and gold  chrysanthemums. About 1,450 bunches of marigolds and some heather were killed,  she said.  </P></p>

Figures based on 1988 land satellite  images show that thick natural forests with more than 80 percent  canopy cover now constitute less than 10 percent of Zimbabwe.  Forests were being destroyed to make way for fields, while wood  fuel was being used for tobacco curing, burning bricks,  household needs and the building of new homes in the  resettlement areas. The Forestry Commission has stepped up  efforts to make communities aware of the need for sustainable  exploitation of forests.</p>

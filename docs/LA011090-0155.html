			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> REGULATORS ISSUE PENALTIES AGAINST SILVERADO BOSSES  </P> <P> Regulators today penalized two directors of the failed Silverado, Banking  Savings and Loan Assn. in Denver, which once listed President Bush's son Neil  as a director.  </P> <P> The directors -- Richard K. Vandapool and Robert M. Lewis -- agreed to an order  prohibiting them from working at any federally insured financial institution  without prior approval from regulators.  </P> <P> The order covers commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions.  </P> <P> No action was announced against Neil Bush, who served on Silverado's board from  1985 until August, 1988.  </P> <P> But the Office of Thrift Supervision said it is still investigating the  S&amp;L. The office said it expects to take actions against other former  Silverado directors and senior management soon.  </P> <P> Vandapool was chief operating officer of Silverado. Lewis was chief financial  officer. Both formerly were also vice chairmen of Silverado. The two agreed to  the penalty without admitting or denying the allegations against them.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VERMEIL'S ASSESSMENT OF USC IS ALL WET  </P> <P> Dick Vermeil has lost it! After Notre Dame piled up 266 yards and four  touchdowns on the ground against USC's vaunted "NFL-type defensive players,"  Vermeil says USC is No. 1. This is based on USC's victories against powerhouses  Stanford, Oregon State and Arizona, no doubt. Why bother to play the games?  </P> <P> RICH BARTON, Orange  </P></p>

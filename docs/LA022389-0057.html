			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> RUMORS ARE FLYING THAT STAR BANNING BACK SPARKS IS RUNNING TO NEW SCHOOL  </P> <P> Is football star Derek Sparks leaving Banning High School?  </P> <P> That was the rumor circulating on the Wilmington campus Wednesday regarding the  All-L.A. City running back who gained fame as one of the state's top sophomores  last season by rushing for 1,394 yards and 15 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Sparks has not attended Banning since the spring semester started Feb. 6 and is  in Texas with his mother, according to Sparks' grandmother, who lives in  Wharton, Tex. Neither Sparks nor his mother could be reached.  </P> <P> While Banning officials said they were under the impression that Sparks would  play for the Pilots next fall, sources say he plans to transfer to another  Southern California high school.  </P> <P> Here is what is known:  </P> <P> * Sparks is scheduled to appear Tuesday at First Church of God Christian School  in Los Angeles as part of a "role model" program for eighth graders, according  to Principal Feager Pertilla.  </P> <P> * Pertilla said a man who identified himself as Eric Sparks, the football  player's uncle, asked the school's permission to have news media present when  Derek appears.  </P> <P> "I said it would be OK," Pertilla said, "as long as it doesn't disrupt my  school."  </P> <P> Pertilla said she does not know any member of the Sparks family. The idea to  have Derek participate in Tuesday's program came from a student at the school  who apparently knows Sparks, Pertilla said.  </P> <P> Banning football Coach Joe Dominguez was surprised by the latest episode  involving one of his best players.  </P> <P> "I just assumed he was going to officially return here," he said. "He hasn't  officially checked out of school, but he probably is. The kid didn't miss a day  of school in the fall semester and now he's missed 2 1/2 weeks.  </P> <P> "The last time I saw him was the last day of the fall semester. As far as I  know, we treated the kid fine. The last time I talked to him he was thrilled  about being here.  </P> <P> "All I know is that we're going to continue to have a fine team here with or  without him. We're not built around one person."  </P> <P> Dominguez, who guided Banning to an 11-3 record and the L.A. City 4-A final in  his first season as head coach, said Sparks lived with his uncle Jerome in a  Wilmington apartment after moving from Texas after the ninth grade. He said the  elder Sparks has since given up the apartment.  </P> <P> "I think his two uncles are controlling his life," Dominguez said. "I think  sometimes parents or guardians are frustrated athletes, and this gives them a  chance to run with the football, so to speak. I think that might be the case  here."  </P> <P> Neither Eric nor Jerome Sparks could be reached.  </P></p>

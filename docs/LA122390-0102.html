			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIGGEST LESSON IN MUSIC WAS LEARNING TO COPE;  </P> <P> UNIVERSITY: THE BAND, ORCHESTRA AND ENSEMBLES WERE DISPLACED AND OUT OF SYNC  SINCE THE RECITAL HALL ROOF COLLAPSE.  </P> <P> The 350 music majors at Cal State Long Beach finished final exams last week in  courses ranging from music theory to opera performance, but the most difficult  lessons of the semester had nothing to do with music.  </P> <P> "We had to run all over campus for classes," said sophomore Angela Parrish of  Downey. "It really ruined my focus."  </P> <P> For Parrish and her classmates, fall semester meant coping with the bizarre  roof collapse in July of the Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall. No one was injured  in the incident, but it left much of the eight-year-old structure in ruins and  prompted the closure of several buildings in the music complex because of  safety concerns.  </P> <P> The events forced the music department to put together an academic program  without some of its most treasured facilities. The results were at times taxing  and unconventional. For example:  </P> <P> * The 60-student symphonic band, the 80-student orchestra and the 65-student  wind symphony held regular rehearsals in a closed fitness club at the Marina  Pacifica shopping mall. They moved to the former Nautilus Club after a short  stint at the Universalist Unitarian Church, where the musicians complained  about poor acoustics. They may have to move again next semester because of  concerns about liability insurance.  </P> <P> * The music department, which received an extra $40,000 this fall from the  university for equipment rentals, leases and other unexpected expenses, saw  revenue from recitals and performances drop by about one-third during the fall  semester. The decrease of about $10,000 may force the department to cut some  student scholarships next semester. "That is a real problem for us," said  department head Donald Para.  </P> <P> * Opera students settled last month into the Queen's Salon aboard the Queen  Mary for a performance of Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte," originally scheduled for  the collapsed recital hall. Although the unusual location attracted attention,  the performance lost money because the ship could accommodate only 150 people,  about half the capacity of the recital hall.  </P> <P> * A regular stream of students held recitals at the Long Beach Public Library  as well as at a host of churches across town, but in many cases, tickets were  not even printed because it was too difficult to keep track of the changing  venues.  </P> <P> * Comedian and musician Dudley Moore held a benefit concert at the university  in October to raise money to replace two Steinway pianos destroyed when the  recital hall roof collapsed. The benefit raised $13,000, but even Moore  encountered unexpected problems when a string broke on a Steinway borrowed for  his performance.  </P> <P> "All in all, we survived pretty well," said Para, taking stock of the semester  last week. "We took the attitude when everything started that you just do what  you have to do. You decide that you are not going to give in to it, that you  are going to run a program, you are going to find a way to teach and make art,  and then you do it."  </P> <P> Andrew Friedman, a junior French horn student from Irvine, said most students  learned to make the best of a trying situation. In fact, university officials  said, enrollment is up over previous years.  </P> <P> "It has been a crazy semester, but nothing we couldn't handle," Friedman said.  "It was actually great to play on the Queen Mary."  </P> <P> In a report last week to the California State University chancellor's office,  investigators concluded that the roof collapse was caused by a combination of  design, construction and maintenance problems. Cal State officials said they  were optimistic that an agreement can be reached among the architect,  contractor, roof manufacturer and the university to rebuild the recital hall  and repair the other buildings.  </P> <P> "My great objective is to get the buildings back in place, safe and sound, and  students in them," said Cal State Long Beach President Curtis McCray.  "Distributing the costs is going to be the question. First thing we have to do  is discover what needs to be done, then establish the cost, and then how do we  all ante up."  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach spokeswoman Toni Beron said that three of the six closed  buildings in the music complex may be repaired by the end of January, in time  for the start of spring semester. Work on the recital hall and two other  problem-ridden buildings, however, is not expected to be completed until next  fall -- at the earliest. Several music professors said they are not planning on  the recital hall reopening until the fall of 1992.  </P> <P> "It has all of us a little depressed -- the fact that nothing is happening too  fast," said Prof. Justus Matthews.  </P> <P> For students and faculty, the collapsed roof and closed classrooms meant  juggling the routine demands of academia with previously unimaginable problems  of logistics. Matthews spent $650 of the $800 allocated this fall for the  department's New Music Ensemble to move five pianos from one end of the campus  to the other for a concert. The money is typically used to hire professional  musicians to perform with the ensemble, Matthews said.  </P> <P> Many classes were also moved across campus -- a brisk 10-minute walk, sometimes  with musical instruments in tow -- to rooms loaned by other departments. To  help students decipher the changes, the department distributed a two-page  schedule of courses that listed "old room" and "new room" assignments. A campus  map was also posted on the department bulletin board.  </P> <P> But even with the navigational aids, a lack of parking sometimes turned simple  tasks, such as using temporary classrooms, into monumental assignments. "It  seemed like you had to park miles and miles away," said graduate student Ron  Anderson of Lynwood.  </P> <P> Some students, however, got an extra bonus from the scheduling changes.  Assistant Prof. Martin Herman moved his electronic music course to the film and  television department, giving his students the unusual opportunity to write  scores for films being produced by other students. Herman said he hopes to make  the collaboration a permanent part of the course.  </P> <P> "That (film) department is about the farthest place from the music complex that  you could be," Martin said, "but that is where the music department used to be  before they built the music complex. It was kind of like a homecoming."  </P> <P> Para, the deparment head, said the search for temporary classrooms and  performance sites for next semester is already under way. Through it all, he  said, faculty and students have kept in mind that things could be much worse.  </P> <P> "We are just thankful that nobody got hurt," he said.  </P></p>

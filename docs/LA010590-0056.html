			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO: WHAT'S NEW;  </P> <P> IT'S BACK TO BASICS FOR FANS OF ROUGH AND TOUGH ACTION  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> Did they make you mad, son? Did they make you mean mad? Mean, mad, mean,  mad-dog mean?  </P> <P> Well, cheer up, pal, your kind of movie is being featured at the video store  this week.  </P> <P> After all that syrupy Christmas junk, it's action you want -- rough, tough,  thrilling, no-weapons-barred action -- and CBS/Fox knows it. The company has  just released the latest James Bond film on tape and is offering two of the  most enjoyable secret-agent movies ever influenced by the Bond series, as well  as a price reduction on one of the meanest, maddest tough-guy hits of last  year.  </P> <P> In "Licence to Kill" ($89.98, PG-13), Bond (Timothy Dalton) sets out after the  druglord who murdered his best friend. You'll be happy to know it's one of the  meanest, toughest in the series. You also might enjoy the commercial that  precedes the movie. No, really. It's another Schweppes ad featuring John  Cleese. (The Monty Python comedian also did a funny one for the cassette  version of his own film, "A Fish Called Wanda.")  </P> <P> James Coburn was the man from Z.O.W.I.E. in a silly but largely enjoyable spoof  of the Bond series, "Our Man Flint." The 1967 film was followed by a sequel,  "In Like Flint," and each is now on video for $59.95.  </P> <P> CBS/Fox has also repriced the tensely directed Bruce Willis hit "Die Hard" at  $19.98, plus "Death Hunt," "Target," "Love and Bullets," "8 Million Ways to  Die" as well as -- hey, how did these get in here? -- "The Towering Inferno"  and "The Poseidon Adventure."  </P> <P> Not enough violent action? Also new on tape is "Jakarta" (MCEG/Virgin, $79.95,  R), a 1988 action-thriller about a CIA man who follows a mysterious woman to --  you guessed it -- Jakarta.  </P> <P> And then there's "A Chorus of Disapproval" (Southgate, $89.95, PG), a rock-'em,  sock-'em-in-the-jaw entertainment about what happens when a bunch of street  punks take some shots at the police glee club. OK, we lied -- it just didn't  fit in. "Chorus" is actually a comedy about a recent widower who auditions for  a local production of 'The Beggar's Opera' and -- yawn, 'scuse us -- gets  involved in a real-estate scandal. See what we mean? Really, though, it's based  on one of those great, funny, nasty Alan Ayckbourn plays. Unfortunately, it was  directed by Michael Winner.  </P> <P> OTHER NEW VIDEOS  </P> <P> In "Jane Fonda's Light Aerobics and Stress Reduction Program" (Warner, $29.98),  the Queen of Fitness leads us in 20 minutes of light aerobics, 20 minutes of  full-body stretching and 15 minutes of stress reduction.

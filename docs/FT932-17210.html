			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (3): Anxious start to campaign - The political line-up as Nigeria prepares for an election NIGERIA is in the final, most critical stage of a protracted transition from military to civilian rule. Last week, shortly before this survey went to press, 10,000 delegates from the National Republican Convention (NRC) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) gathered at conventions in Port Harcourt and Jos to select their presidential candidates. If all goes to plan, the two contenders face the electorate on June 12. The winner will be sworn in on August 27, exactly eight years after the palace coup in which General Ibrahim Babangida ousted General Muhammadu Buhari, who overthrew the last civilian government on December 31, 1983. Yet there is little of the optimism that infused the 1979 election campaign which ended military rule and brought President Shehu Shagari to office. Instead, many Nigerians view the months ahead with apprehension, and contemplate a civilian government with mixed feelings. Despite President Babangida's repeated commitment to a transfer of power, some well-placed figures are far from convinced that a reason will not be found to further delay the handover, already put back on three occasions. They point to a passage in General Babangida's speech of last November, when he delayed by eight months the advent of civilian rule and ordered fresh presidential primaries on the grounds that fraud had invalidated the first attempt. 'We will not abandon you unless we are able to install or guarantee the installation of a stable democratic order,' the president promise. Sceptics detect a loophole. Malpractice, real or contrived during the presidential campaign, will allow General Babangida to intervene yet again, they suggest. Why he should wish to stay on any longer than absolutely necessary is not clear, other than a reluctance to surrender power. Work on the president's retirement estate in Minna is well advanced, and his time in the presidency has left him comfortably off. There is no early or easy end in sight to the country's economic crisis. At least two other serious problems could be bequeathed to his successor: how to extricate Nigeria from its costly and unproductive involvement in Liberia; and the controversial death sentence passed on Zamani Lekwot, a retired major-general charged with murder following inter-communal riots in May last year. Nigerian forces are the mainstay of the 14,000-strong five nation force, despatched to Liberia by the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in 1990 to halt a civil war. No satisfactory resolution to the Liberian tragedy appears in sight, but the heavy cost of Nigeria's role is proving an increasing burden. Nigerian officials have been pressing for a greater UN role. In the meantime there is the danger that the military will want to make one last push against the rebels. But without a political settlement, disengagement will prove difficult, and the last push might be just another step into the Liberian quagmire. The death sentence passed on Zamani Lekwot, a Christian, is potentially the most explosive issue in Nigerian politics. The riots themselves, clashes between two communities in southern Kaduna, the Moslem Hausa and the Christian Kataf involves more than religious rivalry. There is a clash of lifestyles involving competition for land - the Hausa and their cattle, leading a semi nomadic life, and the Kataf farming community, settled on their small farms. But the case has been turned into a Moslem versus Christian dispute, with zealots of both sides fanning the flames. If sentence is carried out, Christians will be outraged; if commuted, the Moslem community will be deeply aggrieved. Either way, say concerned community leaders on both sides, an outbreak of inter-communal violence in Nigeria is a real danger. Those Nigerians who are not sceptical about the handover date are generally pessimistic about the calibre of the incoming civilian administration. The flawed transition programme based on two government-created parties has been kept alive because most Nigerians believe that the government that will emerge is, compared to the present military regime, the lesser of two evils. Few, if any, anticipate a new era free of the corruption long endemic in Nigerian society, but they do expect a more open government with greater respect for human rights than displayed by the military. The leading SDP candidates in the run-up to the conventions were wealthy businessman Moshood Abiola, 55, a Moslem from the south with a solid constituency among the Yorubas, and Baba Gana Kingibe, 48, a northern Moslem. The NRC front-runner was also a northern Moslem, Bashir Tofa, a 46-year-old banker and trader. He and Mr Abiola, say political observers, have General Babangida's blessing.</p>

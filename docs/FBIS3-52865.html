'Ammar al-Musawi, deputy head of the Hizballah political  bureau, told MENA in Beirut today that the present visit to  Damascus by a party delegation is part of the constant  consultations and meetings with Syrian officials to discuss  local and regional developments. He denied that the meetings  seek to make any contacts or arrange meetings with the members  of the Congressional delegation visiting the Syrian capital at  present.    Asked whether Hizballah has agreed to let Syrian officials  act as mediators between Hizballah and the Congressional  delegation to discuss the missing Israeli soldiers, al-Musawi  said: The brothers in Damascus have not approached us about the  possibility of holding a meeting with the Congressional  delegation or about their readiness to mediate in the matter.    Al-Musawi pointed out that the party has no objection to  discussing the issue of the missing Israeli soldiers provided  that the discussion is conducted through UN-affiliated  humanitarian organizations, like the International Committee of  the Red Cross and the Human Rights Organization.    He said that the party has repeatedly emphasized that it has  nothing to do with the missing Israeli pilot Ron Arad. All we  have are two Israeli soldiers who were taken prisoner in 1986,  he said.    The Hizballah official said the U.S. Administration and  Congress are biased toward Israel and hence not qualified to  discuss the issue of the missing Israelis, particularly since  they both totally ignore the issue of the missing Lebanese  nationals and the detainees in Israeli prisons.    The Congressional delegation arrived in Damascus yesterday  from Tel Aviv to discuss the fate of a number of Israeli  soldiers who are missing in Lebanon, in the wake of a promise by  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad to U.S. President Bill Clinton to  facilitate the U.S. team's visit.    Reports have noted that the U.S. team arrived in Damascus at  the same time as a senior Hizballah delegation was visiting the  Syrian capital. Both sides, however, denied holding meetings.    Lebanese newspaper AL-SAFIR today reports that the Hizballah  delegation had returned to Beirut the evening before last.  However, AL-SAFIR adds, the party delegation returned to the  Syrian capital yesterday in the wake of high-level contacts held  yesterday morning.    Meanwhile, official Lebanese sources refused to comment on  the possibility of a visit to Beirut by the U.S. Congressional  delegation to meet with Lebanese officials. The sources stated  that no arrangements have been made for such a visit.</p>

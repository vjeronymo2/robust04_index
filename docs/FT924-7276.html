			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (1): The going gets harder - Travel has become less fun and less safe and, as companies seek to cut costs, it is less comfortable too. Nevertheless, despite advances in technology, there is still a need to meet customers face-to-face TO MANY who only step on to an aircraft to fly to their two weeks in the sun, the life of the business traveller must seem enticing: first class seats, luxury hotels, and a different city every week. Those who spend lonely nights in identical hotel rooms crunching peanuts from the minibar and watching inferior television in languages they do not understand know that the reality is different. The excitement of new cities, taxis and people certainly exists, but there is little time for sight-seeing and the novelty soon wears off. For many, business travel is not fun - and is probably now less fun than it was. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe has taken travellers to cities they have never visited before, some of them beautiful. But the infrastructure needed to support business travel is often not there. Throughout the world, travel is now less safe than it was. There are not many cities in which travellers can confidently set out for a night-time stroll. For women travellers, the confinement to hotels is all the greater. One travelling woman executive said she had been attacked twice in recent years, once in Rome and once in Paris. In the Paris attack, the assailant was a policeman, ostensibly breaking up a demonstration. Above all, in these difficult economic times, many travel in less comfort than they used to. The recession has resulted in companies looking at how much they spend on foreign travel and whether savings can be made. They can, and business travellers are living with the results. 'If you asked companies five years ago how much they were spending on travel they would look at you blankly. Now they can tell you, not quite to the last dollar, but almost,' says Mr Anthony Keeler, chief executive of Business Travel International, an alliance of travel groups including Hogg Robinson of the UK and Kuoni of Switzerland. Before the recession, flying first or business class and staying in luxury hotels were seen as perks of the job. Mr Keeler says: 'When times are good and staff are in short supply, companies offer the sort of package that will attract people. It is different when times are tough and there are a lot of people out there looking for work. 'The travel authorisation process has become much tougher. In years gone by, it was easier to get a first-class ticket to Tokyo than get a new chair for your office. You have no control over the chair, or the desk, or the carpet that you have in your office. In this hard world, travel is now no different. One customer said to me: 'I don't want to spend a penny on travel  -let's start from there.' Travel is a cost and, like any cost, it can be controlled.' A recent survey by Mori for Wagons-lits Travel found that nearly half of the 400 senior executives and secretaries surveyed said their companies were instructing travellers to use cheaper hotels and flights. Mr Richard Lovell, Wagons-lits Travel managing director, says: 'While there is belt-tightening and budgets seem to be reduced, travellers are learning to build business from the back of the aircraft.' Nearly 40 per cent of staff responsible for booking trips say their companies are sanctioning fewer business trips. About 30 per cent, however, say there has been no change in the number of trips taken. Cost-cutting has resulted in some trips being shorter. To save money, however, some are staying away for longer, fitting more cities and appointments into each trip. Mr David Miller, director of Midland Securities Services, a division of Midland Bank, says he keeps his trips to the continent short. If he is travelling to New York, on the other hand, it seems a waste not to schedule meetings in Boston and other North American cities at the same time. Mr Keeler believes that to compensate for the hardships, business travellers are receiving better service everywhere from hotel and airline staff who need to compete more keenly for customers. 'There's a lot better understanding of where their money is coming from,' he says. Not all travellers agree. A senior London-based executive at Salomon Brothers says: 'The only place that works properly is the Far East. Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and I would even include Australia, are in a class of their own. 'Eastern Europe is at the other end of the scale. So is Latin America. Western Europe is not as good as the Far East in overall service, efficiency and design of hotel rooms. The airlines in Europe are better than the hotels  -I'm a big fan of British Airways. 'I find America worse than Europe. In many hotels in New York and Washington you don't even get minibars. And unless you come out with a serious tip on the first day you don't get good service.' She adds that hotel rooms outside the Far East are still not designed for women travellers. 'There's a shaving socket, but there's nowhere to plug in your hair dryer. You find me a woman who uses the hotel hair dryer - they don't. There's nowhere to plug in a contact lens boiler either. In the Far East you find facilities like that.' In a Tokyo hotel she told the management that she needed a hairdresser before her appointments started and not later in the day. The hotel opened its salon in the early morning. Despite the drive to cut costs, few business travellers believe that the fax machine, telephone or video conferencing facilities have proved adequate replacements for travel. It is still necessary to meet customers face-to-face. Mr Miller said, however, that he had noticed an increased tendency to plan trips properly in advance. 'Our own sales team used to make trips that involved cold-calling. We're now making sure that more of the earlier work is done over the phone and by correspondence. Now, flying out to visit someone is something you do further down the line rather than as a first step. There's much more planning and much more asking 'what do I want to achieve from this trip?'' Arriving at face-to-face meetings with more advance information about a customer's requirements has proved beneficial, he says, which raises the question of how many of the changes in business travel over the past two years will turn out to be permanent. The Wagons-lits survey found that about 30 per cent of companies do not expect to increase their business travel in the next two to three years. Of those who did, 30 per cent expected to be doing more travelling to the US, 29 per cent to the Far East, 24 per cent to France, 22 per cent to Germany and 19 per cent to eastern Europe. Mr Bill Kirkwood, sales and marketing director of Thomas Cook Travel Management, argues that now that companies have discovered they can drive down travel costs, they are unlikely to return to the easy-going days of the past, even when the recession is over. Mr Miller has his doubts. 'When the good days come again, it wouldn't surprise me if cost controls were relaxed, human nature being what it is.'</p>

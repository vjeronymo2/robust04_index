			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLDEN OLDIE  </P> <P> Regarding "George Burns: Golden Oldie" (by Margy Rochlin, Jan. 8): I have been  a fan of George Burns since his radio days, and I love him as much as anyone  else and admire and envy his longevity. However, I am a junior high health  teacher who teaches an extensive unit on drug abuse. I am glad to see Burns  question how John Lennon could be a drug user; he can't see how anyone for  whatever reasons would use drugs. What he fails to see (and most people do),  though, is the hypocrisy of condemning "drug" use when he admits to using two  of the most abused substances -- nicotine (20 cigars) and alcohol (at least six  drinks daily). There is no difference between these drugs and the drugs Lennon  used. But with the mentality that alcohol is not a drug, Burns will never  believe this.  </P> <P> The article sends a mixed message.  </P> <P> MICKEY MANDELL  </P> <P> West Hills  </P></p>

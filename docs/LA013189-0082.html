			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITTAKER CORP. SAYS IT EXPECTS CHARGES IN PROBE OF PAYMENTS  </P> <P> Whittaker Corp., a Los Angeles defense contractor, said Monday that it expects  to be criminally charged by the federal government in connection with payments  made by employees to a government official.  </P> <P> In a terse announcement, the company said that last Friday Justice Department  attorneys presented evidence to Whittaker indicating that certain employees and  consultants "caused money to be paid to a government employee in connection  with certain government contracts in violation of law."  </P> <P> All of the individuals involved no longer are with Whittaker or have been  suspended without pay, the company said.  </P> <P> The company repeatedly declined to identify the employees and consultants or to  disclose which of its contracts and subsidiaries may be involved. But the  matter is believed to be part of "Operation Ill Wind," the ongoing Pentagon  procurement investigation.  </P> <P> Whittaker's now-closed Communications &amp; Control Systems unit in  Fayetteville, Ark., was among the more than one dozen defense contractors whose  premises were searched last June when the Pentagon procurement scandal first  became public.  </P> <P> A source close to the probe said investigators have checked to see whether  payments made on behalf of that subsidiary were made to Jack A. Sherman, a  former Pentagon procurement officer who pleaded guilty last Friday to accepting  bribes from consultants.  </P> <P> In the wake of the guilty plea, the Marine Corps moved Monday to remove Sherman  from his job.  </P> <P> According to investigative sources, FBI agents in Fayetteville found memos,  government contracts and other documents showing recent contacts between  Sherman, a veteran Marine Corps contracting official, and Scott M. Lamberth,  one of the three co-founders of Lee Telecommunications Corp., a company that  Whittaker purchased in 1986.  </P> <P> Sherman and Lamberth had served together at Marine headquarters in Washington  in the early 1970s, military records show.  </P> <P> Records available to The Times showed that the small Arkansas firm received  $1.9 million in defense contracts in 1986 and about $1 million in 1985. In  1984, the firm received about $4 million, much of it for technical and  engineering services in the development and modification of the Marine Corps  command, control and communications systems.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, on Monday, defense contractor Unisys said it expects to soon enter  into substantive discussions with prosecutors in the government's investigation  into defense contracting practices.  </P> <P> Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys, one of the nation's largest computer makers, said  it is cooperating fully with the federal government and will continue to  cooperate. The company has not yet begun settlement discussions, it said.  </P> <P> The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that settlement discussions had begun  and that they could involve a payment of at least $30 million to the  government.  </P> <P> A former Unisys official and a former consultant to the company pleaded guilty  Friday to bribery and conspiracy in connection with the Pentagon's probe into  possible fraud in defense procurement.  </P></p>

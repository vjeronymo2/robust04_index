			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Tower Hamlets loss fails to crush BNP Labour, back in power at Tower Hamlets after eight years, rejoiced yesterday over the double defeat of the Liberal Democrats and the far-right British National party. The east London borough, where the number of Liberal Democrat councillors dwindled from 29 to seven, had been the only big inner-city authority run by the party. But Labour's joy at humiliating the Liberal Democrats will be tempered by an assessment of the performance of the BNP, which campaigned under the slogan Rights for Whites. An intensive Labour campaign involving national political figures and a special manifesto succeeded in unseating Mr Derek Beackon, who became the BNP's first councillor in a by-election in the Millwall ward in September. But Mr Beackon and other two other Millwall BNP candidates polled more votes than at the by-election. Compared with the 1990 elections, the improvement in the BNP's vote was dramatic. Mr Beackon stood as a BNP candidate in Tower Hamlets' Redcoat ward in 1990 and received just 93 votes. He won last year's by-election in Millwall with 1,480 and polled 2,041 there yesterday. BNP candidates in other parts of the borough showed similar growth in support - the party's vote in St James ward, for example, rose from 93 in 1990 to 653. Last night anti-racism campaigners urged the main parties to continue the fight against racism in spite of Mr Beackon losing his seat. The BNP, on the strength of its results in Tower Hamlets, is likely to conclude that although it lost its only council seat it is worth maintaining a high level of activity in the borough. But one unique attraction of the borough - its decentralised structure, under which the BNP would have needed only three seats to gain control of the Isle of Dogs neighbourhood - will disappear with the transfer of power from Liberal Democrat to Labour. The Liberal Democrat majority group had devolved budgets and decision-making to seven neighbourhoods. Mr John Biggs, Labour leader, said yesterday the system had created 'intense parochialism' and had undoubtedly been a factor in the rise of the BNP. Labour would retain local offices and encourage a sense of local identity within the borough, but would not maintain the Liberal Democrat structure of devolved decision-making. 'The Liberal Democrat party nationally has commended the Tower Hamlets decentralisation as a model for other councils it controls,' said Mr Biggs. 'I think experience here shows that they should go back to the drawing board.' The BNP, too, can claim to have played a part in the Liberal Democrat demise. Mr Beackon's by-election win prompted an inquiry by the national Liberal Democrat party which found that some Tower Hamlets members had pandered to racism. This caused divisions within the local party, and tensions with the national one, from which Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrats never recovered. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's election co-ordinator in London, said: 'The first question Paddy Ashdown has to answer is how does he explain the disaster in Tower Hamlets? Losing 22 seats to Labour was the worst result in any council in England.'</p>

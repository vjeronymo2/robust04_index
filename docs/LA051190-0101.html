			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS STUMPED BY RETURN OF MARAUDING SEA LIONS  </P> <P> First Gumby was spotted taking a nap on a platform in Puget Sound near Seattle.  Then Colin and Vern showed up at a popular sea lion hangout north of the city.  And this week, to the dismay of weary marine biologists, George was found in  the Columbia River between Washington and Oregon.  </P> <P> One by one, four of six California sea lions -- packed up by Washington state  officials in March and sent back to their birthplace near the Channel Islands  off Ventura County -- have returned to feast on the northwestern state's  precious steelhead trout.  </P> <P> And Hondo and Sandy, the two other mammals, are expected to reappear in the  Northwest soon. In fact, one of them was recently spotted on an island off the  San Francisco coast, marine officials said.  </P> <P> "This is getting increasingly frustrating," said Doug Zimmer, spokesman for the  Washington state Department of Wildlife. "We're at the point where our  steelhead trout cannot take much more abuse, and we're running out of options."  </P> <P> Since sea lions became a protected species in 1972, their West Coast population  has virtually exploded. They have been running amok from Fisherman's Wharf in  San Francisco to the waters of Washington state.  </P> <P> In Seattle, the sea lions have eaten so much steelhead trout on their way to  spawn in tributaries of Lake Washington that the run at the Ballard Locks canal  has shrunk from about 4,000 fish annually to only 2,000.  </P> <P> Two Indian tribes in Seattle, the Muckleshoot and the Suquamish, have federal  treaty rights to fish for the trout and have pressured the state and federal  governments to do something about the carnage.  </P> <P> But nothing seems to keep the animals away, said Martin Fox, a biologist hired  by the Suquamish.  </P> <P> State and federal officials decided to detonate firecrackers underwater to  scare away the sea lions, but after a couple of years, the animals became used  to the sound.  </P> <P> At one point, biologists fired plastic arrows at them, but "they got used to  being bonked on the head," Fox said.  </P> <P> Officials then turned to feeding them fish laced with a non-lethal substance  that makes them vomit. But the animals were able to detect the tainted fare  after a while.  </P> <P> So, in March, Washington wildlife experts decided to capture the six sea lions  and ship them back to California to see how they would react.  </P> <P> Within a month, Gumby, Colin, George and Vern -- named by Washington wildlife  officials -- had returned. They could be detected because radio transmitters  had been glued to their backs.  </P> <P> "We were surprised they came back so fast," said Joe Scordino, a deputy chief  with the National Marine Fishery Service in Seattle. "I guess they like the  food up here better."  </P> <P> Scordino said marine officials are now looking for other options to control the  beasts, which number up to 1,000 in the Seattle area alone.  </P> <P> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is considering asking the  federal government to allow it to kill the bothersome mammals, an idea that has  been sharply criticized by environmentalists.  </P> <P> "We're in a bind," Fox said. "We have our fish to protect, but we want to  protect the animals too."  </P></p>

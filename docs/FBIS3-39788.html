			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara, Feb 21 (AA) -- President Rauf Denktas of  the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] who arrived in  Ankara on Monday [21 February] for a series of talks with high  level Turkish officials said 'we will discuss confidence  building measures with Ankara'.    Denktas is accompanied by Prime Minister Hakki Atun,  Minister  for State and Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur, Minister for  Foreign Affairs and Defense Atay Ahmet Rasit.    Denktas said during his first official visit to Turkey with  the new coalition government they will coordinate efforts as the  new rounds of Cyprus talks which are scheduled to take place  under the auspices of the United Nations.    TRNC president said the talks in Ankara will focus on the  package of 'confidence building measures,' adding 'we will  inform the Turkish Government about our thoughts on the  measures'.    He said TRNC is ready to say 'yes' to a satisfactory,  balanced and stable solution to the Cyprus problem.    Denktas said a positive result could only be taken if the  Greek Cypriots show the same good will.    U.N.-sponsored intercommunal talks on Cyprus were  interrupted  last July.    Cyprus has been practically divided since 1974 when Turkey  conducted a peace operation to the island following a  Greek-backed coup which attempted to annex the island to Greece  and to annihilate its Turkish Cypriot population.    The TRNC came to existence in 1983.    Denktas as well as Prime Minister Atun and those  accompanying  them will return to Cyprus on Wednesday after their talks in  Ankara.</p>

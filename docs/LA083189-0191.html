			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MYSTERY WOMAN SOUGHT;  </P> <P> POISONED CAKE SPOILS A PARTY  </P> <P> Police are looking for a woman who delivered a poison-laced chocolate cake to a  retirement party for a county's sanitation supervisor last week, causing nine  people to become ill.  </P> <P> The cake, with chocolate icing and a "Happy Retirement" inscription, was  dropped off before work hours at the offices of the Orange County Sanitation  Districts at 10844 Ellis Ave. in Fountain Valley last Thursday, said Fountain  Valley Police Sgt. Larry Griswold. The delivery person, a young woman, gave the  cake to a worker and drove off.  </P> <P> The worker then brought the cake to the desk of retiring supervisor William  Clarke.  </P> <P> "It was kind of a bonus since we were going to have a bigger cake later in the  day," said Clarke, 60. "I figured, 'Well, let's eat it.' "  </P> <P> Within two hours, Clarke and seven others had diarrhea, nausea and headaches.  No employees were hospitalized, although one sought medical treatment.  </P> <P> "I only took a few bites when I realized it had some chemical in it," said  Randy Harris, a maintenance foreman. "It had a bitter taste to it."  </P> <P> Police said the woman, described as white, standing 5 feet, 2 inches and in her  mid-20s with brown hair, drove away in a dark-colored Ford Ranger.  </P> <P> It is not known yet what tainted the cake, pieces of which were taken to the  Orange County Health Care Agency for analysis, Griswold said. Police say the  woman was attempting to poison the employees, although they don't know why or  who she is.  </P> <P> "Over the years, I probably made some enemies," said Clarke, a 29-year employee  who retired as superintendent of operations and maintenance at the sewage  treatment plant. "If I found out who did it, I'll be screaming mad."  </P> <P> Some employees said they thought the cake contained a laxative, because  reactions were quick. But that doesn't explain the other symptoms, said Blake  Anderson, director of technical services at the plant.  </P> <P> "We're still not sure if this was intentional," he said. "But it's rather  suspicious."  </P> <P> Clarke, who supervised about 300 people, said he had no idea who brought the  cake.  </P> <P> "It disturbs me that someone did this," said Clarke, of Buena Park. "I thought  of myself as a good boss."  </P> <P> Bob Ooten, who had some of the cake, said Clarke was a "likable" supervisor.  </P> <P> Harris said his 24-hour illness taught him "to find out where food comes from  before I eat it."  </P> <P> Clarke figured the baker eventually will be discovered.  </P> <P> "Someday, someone will brag about it," he said.  </P></p>

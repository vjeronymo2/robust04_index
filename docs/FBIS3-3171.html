Xu Liangying, who last week  initiated a petition to the authorities to free all political  prisoners, said yesterday he was suffering from heart disease  and he needed to go out to replenish his medical supplies.    After American Secretary of State Warren Christopher  departed  yesterday the authorities in Shanghai freed two activists, Yang  Zhou and Wang Fuchen. The two expressed worries they might be  subjected to "police harassment" any time the authorities saw  fit.    Speaking in his Beijing apartment, Mr Xu, 74, an  internationally known historian of science said there were still  around 20 policemen in his compound. "They have started letting  my friends come in to see me," Mr Xu said. "But this morning  when my wife and I wanted to go out to take a walk, the police  stopped us." Mr Xu said police gave him no indication when his  house arrest would end. "I have had heart disease for some  time, and I have taken extra doses of medicine the past few  days," he said. The scholar said it was lucky that two staff  from his unit, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, had brought  along some medicine when they visited him yesterday.    Mr Xu said Mr Christopher's visit had been a failure because  it had only provoked the Chinese leadership into saying they  would never accept the "Western" view of human rights. While he  hoped it would get Most Favoured Nation status, Mr Xu said China  had to make improvements in human rights to earn it.    In Shanghai, Mr Yang and Mr Wang were set free hours before  Mr Christopher left Beijing. "The U.S. should keep up the  pressure ... I believe China should at least release more  dissidents who are being locked up for political reasons such as  Fu Shenqi and Zhang Xianliang," said Mr Wang. "I am not afraid  of them (police), I can't lie and I cannot speak against my  conscience," he added. According to Mr Wang, he was kept under  constant surveillance during his detention. "I could not even  go to the toilet (on my own)," he said. He was not treated  badly, but said the detention was nonetheless illegal.  Throughout his captivity, Mr Wang was never given any documents  to explain why he was detained. "They only said I should know  why," he said. "I am going to write to the National People's  Congress to complain about my treatment. I am a law- abiding  citizen. I haven't broken any law and they can't do this to  me," Mr Wang said.    According to Mr Yang, who was taken away every night for the  past three days, his treatment at the police station was  acceptable. He was allowed to read newspapers every morning and  was even offered a packet of cigarettes every day. But the  police also reminded him that he must "repent" or risk going to  jail. "They told me that they could 'reform' even old men -- 70  or 80 years old -- and I would not be an exception," said Mr  Yang. "But I told them I am 50 years old and I won't change."</p>

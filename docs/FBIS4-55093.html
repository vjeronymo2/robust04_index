			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 6 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic and  Britain agree that the question of stability of Central and  Eastern Europe is important for the continent, but differ in the  accent on what is the cause and what is the consequence, Czech  Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told CTK today. He was  referring to his talks with British Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd earlier today during which the European security and  stability pact was also taken up.    An international conference on the pact will be held in  Paris  at the end of May. The pact, proposed by French Premier Edouard  Balladur last June, is to ensure stability and security in  Europe, protect economic and trade interests, and result in the  conclusion of agreements on good neighborhood and respect for  the rights of ethnic minorities.    Zieleniec said all European countries, including the Czech  Republic, espoused the goals set by the European Union (EU) --  finding a way of making Central and Eastern Europe a genuine  part of the continent and gradually integrating it into the EU.    He stressed that views on ways of achieving these goals were  not always entirely identical. The Czech Republic stresses the  Western experience that the problems of ethnic minorities are  best solved within a democratic and law-abiding state which has  a well functioning economy based on private ownership.    Zieleniec said it was very difficult to treat the minority  issue as an isolated one in a multilateral international  agreement, without stressing the need for democracy and a  law-abiding state.</p>

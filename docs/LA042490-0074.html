			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> AMBULANCE FIRM TO OPEN STATION  </P> <P> Months after Moorpark officials criticized the slow response of emergency  crews, a Thousand Oaks ambulance company is planning to open a new station as  early as mid-May.  </P> <P> A temporary station for Pruner Ambulance will be set up at the old Sheriff's  Department station on Olsen Road between Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, Ventura  County Emergency Medical Services Administrator Barbara Brodfuehrer said  Monday.  </P> <P> Brodfuehrer said a new radio communications system will be installed at the  station. The addition of a new station closer to Moorpark is expected to cut  down response times, she said.  </P> <P> Moorpark residents and City Council members have increasingly complained over  the past year about ambulance crews taking up to half an hour to respond to  emergency calls.  </P> <P> Mayor Paul Lawrason said the station may open as early as mid-May and will be  staffed with paramedics. Although the station will be set up for 90 days, the  city will pursue plans for a permanent station, Lawrason said.  </P> <P> City officials believe the new station will help reduce response times of  ambulances and paramedics, cutting down the average to about eight minutes, he  said. Previously, ambulances on average had been responding to emergencies  within 11 minutes, according to county emergency medical service reports.  PSYCHE PASCUAL  </P></p>

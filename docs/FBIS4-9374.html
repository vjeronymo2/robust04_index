			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the National </F> Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], by  Neli Koleva in Sofia on 15 April: "Only International  Organizations Can Stop the Yugoslav Conflict From Spreading"]    [Text] [Koleva] In the course of today's debates on the  permission that parliament was asked to grant for the transit of  UN property through our territory, you mentioned the danger of  military expansion that Bulgaria faces, against which only  membership in the United Nations and NATO could provide any  guarantee. Does such a danger really exist, and from where will  it come, in your view?    [Dimitrov] Everyone is well aware that since the conflict  began in Yugoslavia, risks exist for Kosovo, for Macedonia, and  hence for Bulgaria as well. This is why my lips are tired of  repeating that intervention by international organizations and  effective groups that can really achieve something, namely NATO,  is necessary. I have been repeating this since 1991 and have  been saying it almost daily since the conflict broke out in  Bosnia. In the final event, thank God, it turned out that the  policy followed by the SDS government was a sensible one. We  recognized the [former Yugoslav] republics, following which  others recognized them as well, thus demonstrating that this is  the way to prevent the conflict. We have been attacked for  recognizing Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM], but, in the end, everyone recognized this republic  because they realized that this is the only sensible way to  guarantee tranquillity. Our government wanted blue helmets and  observers to be sent to the FYROM, and the FYROM got them  because this is the way to guarantee that there will be no  expansion of the conflict.    Naturally, these actions are being carried out because  everyone realizes that it cannot be excluded that an  unpredictable communist regime like Milosevic's may do anything.  If it does something that leads to an expansion of the  conflict, there is a very big risk of that our Bulgarian home  will be set on fire. Bearing in mind these dangers, which are  not immediate at the moment, we should do everything within our  powers to ward off this possibility. I am glad that the NATO  forces are in [the former] Yugoslavia. They are a guarantee  that any such expansion will be checked.    [Koleva] Can we regard the stance adopted by the SDS  parliamentary group today as a kind of vote in favor of the  policy that your government followed?    [Dimitrov] Today's vote does indeed show that the SDS fully  supports the positions that the SDS government defended with  much effort and at no little risk.    [Koleva] How do you explain the position of the Socialists  in the parliamentary debate when they voted en bloc against the  UN request?    [Dimitrov] I think they are acting as agents of an  imperialist expansionist policy advocated by certain circles in  Russia that hope that the heightening of tension in the Balkans  and the intensification of Serbian expansion might bring in  Russia to act as an arbiter in this region.</p>

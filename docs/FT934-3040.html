			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: LIG Having lavished much time and money on building up its photo-processing business, London International Group has concluded that its disposal is now essential. That complete reversal of strategy highlights the financial depths to which LIG has sunk following its unexpected Pounds 5m half-year loss. With increased borrowings of Pounds 154m supported on shareholders' funds of just Pounds 109m, LIG badly needs to raise money. The additional cash costs of its drastic rationalisation programme will have to be funded from selling toiletries brands. LIG's plight has been compounded by the alarming deterioration in its health and personal products business, where operating profits have slumped from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 3.5m. But it now transpires that the comparable half-year's figures were boosted by special factors not previously disclosed. The devaluation of the pound created a Pounds 3m windfall profits gain on foreign currency holdings. LIG also booked Pounds 2m from the release of surplus provisions. It seems astonishing LIG did not reveal such important factors at the time. The more prudent accounting practices now adopted would have depressed last year's profits by a further Pounds 2m. But even so, it is hard to comprehend the severe slide in the division's underlying profits on 3 per cent higher sales. The 20 per cent fall in LIG's shares yesterday was a rather muted response.</p>

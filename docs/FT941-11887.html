			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Labour fighter for women dies at 70 Ms Jo Richardson, the leftwing Labour MP for Barking, best known as a campaigner for women's rights, diedyesterday after a long illness aged 70. Her death, which increases the government's Commons majority temporarily to 19, leaves the Conservatives facing the prospect of two by-elections in quick succession in safe Labour seats. They come in the run-up to this year's local and European elections. Mr James Boyce, the Labour MP for Rotherham, died just a week ago. The Conservative party's low standing in opinion polls and the location of Ms Richardson's seatin east London may cause concern that the contest could produce another strong electoral showing by the extreme right. Last September, the far-right British National party won its first-ever local authority seat in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets. Ms Richardson, who entered parliament 20 years ago this month, held her east London seat in 1992 with an increased majority of 6,268 over the Conservative candidate. The extreme right did not fight the seat. A life-long leftwinger, she sat on Labour's national executive committee for 12 years until 1991 and was a member of the shadow cabinet from 1987 to 1992. She would probably have been Britain's first minister for women if Labour had won the last general election. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said yesterday: 'No one in the history of our party has fought harder or to greater effect on behalf of women.' In 1986, she opposed the expulsion from the Labour party of alleged members of Militant in Liverpool City Council.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Bank of Japan Governor  Yasushi Mieno indicated Tuesday [19 April] the central bank  would soon declare the economic recession over.    Speaking at a luncheon meeting in Tokyo, sponsored by the  Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, Mieno said there were  signs of improvement in the domestic economy, centering on  personal consumption. Mieno, however, said the central bank is  still unable to determine an economic pickup before key  indicators are analyzed closely.    Steady progress in stock adjustments suggests the groundwork  is being laid for economic recovery, he said.    Mieno also said the central bank sees no need to change the  official discount rate for now from the present 1.75 percent per  year.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Roll-Royce link with GridCo REYROLLE, part of the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, and the National Grid Company are forming a joint venture to bid for work on electricity transmission systems worldwide. Called International Power Systems, the new alliance is looking to benefit from the big power infrastructure programmes under way in fast developing countries of South East Asia and Latin America. Opportunities are also seen in eastern Europe where privatisation of electricity supply is planned by a number of countries. IPS will combine Reyrolle's expertise in making high voltage switch gear with National Grid's experience in operating the 7,000km power transmission system in England and Wales since privatisation in 1990.</p>

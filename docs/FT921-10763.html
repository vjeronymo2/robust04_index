			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Japanese interested in video delivery system SEVERAL significant Japanese companies are expressing interest in a revolutionary new system of delivering feature films direct to homes. Electronic video hire could turn out to be a powerful rival to both satellite subscription film channels and shops. Mr William Kraven, an American entrepreneur and founder of EMC2 - Entertainment Made Convenient - is hoping to get his business off the ground in Japan and then move to joint ventures in the UK and other European countries. Under the EMC2 proposal, a customer would be able to order a film and have it downloaded to a special receiver in five minutes. Using the capacity of six satellite channels, 200 different feature films could be delivered electronically to customers across a continent. 'We don't see ourselves as being in the movie rental business. We are in the digital distribution business,' said Mr Kraven, who emphasised that the technology - digital compression - already exists to turn his venture into a reality. Mr Kraven, who has been working on the idea for more than three years, is currently in negotiations with Bandi, the large Japanese toy company; NTT, the national telecommunications organisation; and several leading Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers. Sanwa Bank has also expressed interest and has introduced Mr Kraven to other potential investors in Japan.</p>

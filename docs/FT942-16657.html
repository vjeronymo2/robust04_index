			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong rebound by BP A firmer oil price combined with an upbeat annual meeting helped British Petroleum shares to recover from recent uncertainty and to end the day as the top performer in the FT-SE 100 Index. The price of one-month Brent crude, which slumped to Dollars 13.15 just after the recent OPEC meeting decided that output levels would be maintained, had recovered to Dollars 14.75 by the close of dealing in London yesterday. Dealers in the US said Metallgesellschaft, the German oil and metals company which was very badly hit after buying into oil futures just before the market tumbled, had finally liquidated its long position. Meanwhile Lord Ashburton, BP's chairman, told the agm the company's financial health and balance sheet had improved greatly over the past year and it was beating its targets on debt, profit and investment in spite of oil price weakness. Credit Lyonnais Laing shifted its recommendation from 'underweight' to overweight' arguing that the shares would hit 500p over the next 12 months and Lehman Brothers raised forecasts for several US oil stocks. BP bounced 14 to 371p on turnover of 11m shares Other leading oil groups took heart from the statement. Shell Transport gained 11 to 682p while Enterprise recovered 10 to 428p.</p>

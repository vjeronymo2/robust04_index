The northern key development zone  expected to cover Hanoi, Haiphong and Hon Gai (to be renamed Ha  Long soon), will play an important part in the implementation of  the strategy for socio-economic development of the north and the  whole country as well. The zone concentrates major industrial,  activities and communication and transport junctures of northern  Vietnam. It has a great economic potential in the way of  natural resources, workforce, and tourisms. It has 300-km  coastal line with deep gulfs favourable for sea port  construction. In addition, the zone's hydro-electricity  potential accounts for 60 of the country's reserves. It has  175,000 ha of forests, 318,000 ha of farm land, and 226,000 ha  of bare hills. About 90 of its population are literate  [sentence as received]. By the end of last year some 162  foreign investment projects had been licensed in this zone with  a total investment capital of USD 1.63 billion: Hanoi has 120  projects with USD 1.04 billion, and Haiphong 24 projects with  USD 523.5 million. The development orientation of all branches  of activities in the zone from now to the year 2000 and 2010 is  to change the economic structure in conformity with the market  economy to increase the proportions of industrial production and  services, and to encourage the development of non-governmental  economic sectors and foreign investment into this zone.</p>

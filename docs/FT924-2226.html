			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Observer: Tempus Fugit It is corporate diary time again and a couple of US diary dates catch the eye. National Condom Month falls in February, and Global Understanding Day on March 26 should be fruitful. Americans are exhorted to spend April 2-4 soberly, as it's Alcohol-Free Weekend. And get the brain clear for April - Mathematics Education Month. Can't wait.</p>

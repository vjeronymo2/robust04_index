			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / US society 'divided by skills' The middle class in the US is being divided by its levels of education and skills, according to Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary. In a pre-Labor Day speech on the state of the workforce yesterday, Mr Reich said: 'The deepest divisions (in US society) aren't based on race or on national origin or on geography. They're based on the ability of individuals to make their way in an increasingly turbulent society.' Whereas in 1979 a 'middle class' male with a college degree earned 49 per cent more than one with a high school diploma, by 1992 the college graduate was earning 83 per cent more. The unemployment rate for college graduates has stayed at around 3 per cent but for those who did not finish high school it has jumped from 7 per cent in the 1970s to 12 per cent last year.</p>

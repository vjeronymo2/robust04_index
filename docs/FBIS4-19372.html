			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today was  reelected chairman of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] by  a voice vote from those attending the party's third congress.  In his speech, which closed the congress, Papandreou said that  Greece with PASOK in the government is ready to enter the new  century with security, prosperity, and democracy. PASOK is  modern, united, collective, strong, democratic and open to the  people. PASOK is ready to win the many successive battles that  it will face in the near future.    Papandreou said that PASOK was not born to become a [word  indistinct] star in the country's public life. PASOK cannot be  given away or inherited and will not be broken into pieces. Our  congress' decision shows a return to the collective PASOK.  Together we will guarantee, now and in the future, that this  PASOK will have a direction and certain prospects. Papandreou  concluded: We still owe this country a lot. With our congress,  we have made another step forward. I am optimistic that despite  the uncertainties of our times we will achieve our goals. Hope  can become reality with a new PASOK that we will build together.  It will be the PASOK of our dreams and our people's aspirations.    During his departure from Athens' Olympic Stadium, Prime  Minister Papandreou replied to a question about his trip to the  United States. Papandreou said that he will stage a big battle  [to explain his views on current issues], a friendly one of  course, because the climate during the discussion of our  national issues will be a friendly one. Of course, there will  be an attempt to improve Greek-U.S. relations, which are good  but could be better, he added.    Replying to another question on the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Papandreou said that the latest developments  are very serious. I know that for the time being there is a  cease-fire, which means that some people are using their heads,  he said. However, the balance is very delicate, he added, and we  cannot know what will happen from one moment to the next.  Papandreou concluded by saying that Yugoslavia is one of the  issues he will discuss with U.S. President Bill Clinton at the  White House.</p>

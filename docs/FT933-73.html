			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (5): A little polish for images - The trend towards investor relations divisions CORPORATE Japan, battered by the high yen, a sluggish economy and a spate of scandals, and struggling for a new image, has turned to investor relations. Raising funds through the stock market has become difficult due to a lack of investor confidence, while the unravelling of cross-shareholding arrangements between corporations is emphasising the need for companies to attract new investors. Investor relations divisions are being set up in many of the leading companies, while publishers are contemplating investor relations magazines. Fuji Bank, a leading commercial bank, held an overseas investor relations campaign in the US and Europe last July. Such programmes are part of an effort to lift the profiles of Japanese banks, which have been battered by scandals and mounting bad loans. Mitsubishi Research Institute started a service monitoring over-the-counter companies' investors relations activities and assisting with corporate data presentations. Meanwhile, tougher rules for corporate disclosure and an easing of filing requirements for shareholder litigants are also expected to boost companies' awareness towards shareholders and encourage efforts to improve investor relations. A change in the commercial law in October will allow shareholders with a 3 per cent stake, rather than the present 10 per cent, to look at corporate records, will increase the number of auditors from two to three, with at least one being an outside auditor, and will reduce the cost of lawsuits by shareholders to Y8,200. The reduction of litigation costs is expected to increase the number of lawsuits, where shareholders sue directors for breaches of trust on behalf of the company. If the shareholders win, damages are forwarded to the corporation. Earlier this month, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled that six former executives of Mitsui Mining must pay Y100m in compensation to the company for manipulating its share price. Janome Sewing Machine is being sued by a former employee for its involvement with Mr Mitsuhiro Kotani, the stock market speculator, who has been convicted for stock price manipulation. The focus toward better investor relations has coincided with calls by industrial and financial companies for corporate integrity. The Japan Securities Dealers Association lectured presidents of publicly-owned companies on corporate disclosure, while Nomura Securities held seminars for better corporate governance. The Keidanren, the leading business organisation, wants companies to become more like their western counterparts, providing better information and giving shareholders more rights. It believes better corporate governance is the answer to the US revisionists claims that Japanese companies are different from those in the west. However, while on one hand companies try to impress investors with their campaigns and new investor relations departments, on the other, many still choose to keep information to themselves. Nomura Securities and Daiwa Securities turned a deaf ear towards California's Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), which suggested the need for independent board members to prevent scandals. Calpers also sent letters in August questioning management policies of 17 leading companies. It received only one reply. More than 1,900 companies held their annual shareholders' meetings on the same day last June. By holding the meetings at the same time, companies can keep sokaiya, or racketeers, from asking embarrassing or pointless questions. However, this has also kept legitimate shareholders from making comments, and shareholders' meetings have become a mere formality for both company and shareholder. Last June 29, most of the 1,900 companies finished their meetings within an hour. These included leading construction companies implicated in illegal political donation scandals. Leading companies have made illegal pay-offs to gangsters that threatened to disrupt annual meetings. Employees at Kirin Brewery, the country's largest beer maker, were arrested last July for making such payments over the past decade, while the president of Ito-Yokado, a leading retailer, resigned last year for its illegal payments to extortionists. Dividends remain low, with the dividend yield for the Nikkei average around 0.8 per cent. Companies have argued that earnings should be retained for future investments and research and developments, rather than given to shareholders. Their argument against high dividends was that shareholders already have capital gains on stocks. Many corporations are bracing themselves for the spate of shareholder litigations next month and executives are contemplating buying liability policies. Japanese companies which have ignored investors, may finally be forced to acknowledge their existence.</p>

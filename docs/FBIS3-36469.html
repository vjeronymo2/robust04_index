			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] A NATO mission is currently on a tour presenting  in more detail the opportunities available through and the aims  of the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program. The mission wants  to present a clear picture of how prepared different countries  are to take part in the program. Today, the NATO mission is in  Estonia. Urmas Loit reports.    [Begin recording] [Loit] Joining the Partnership for Peace  program is Estonia's first step towards becoming a full member  of NATO. This was said at a news conference today, given by the  NATO mission, which is presenting to Estonia the principles and  opportunities of the partnership program. NATO representatives  had a meeting with Defense Minister Indrek Kannik; Defense  Forces Commander Aleksandr Einseln; Peeter Lorents, Riigikogu's  state defense commission's deputy chairman; and Foreign Ministry  Chancellor Alar Olljum. Defense Minister Indrek Kannik will sum  up what was said.    [Kannik] During the meetings today, the Estonian side has  been speaking about the aspects we ourselves consider most  important in the PFP program. Talking about the political  aspects, one must emphasize a consultations mechanism included  in the PFP program. We consider the possibility of holding  political consultations with NATO -- in a situation of a serious  crisis -- extremely necessary in our view, and we see it as an  essential mechanism.    The Estonian side has been talking at today's meetings also  about the need for military cooperation. It is precisely joint  exercises we have in mind here. Of course, in this context the  question will arise immediately as to how Estonia can pay for  her expenses. As is known, the PFP program states very clearly  that both parties, NATO as well as a NATO partner, must pay for  their own expenses. But I believe that here, too, solutions are  possible. For example, even in the course of the discussions  today our colleagues, our friends from NATO suggested that some  exercises may take place on Estonian territory that would  substantially reduce our expenses. We also consider the  opportunity to have Estonian officers trained very important for  us within the PFP program.    [Loit] A Defense Ministry, the defense forces headquarters,  and the Foreign Ministry working group will be drawing up the  Estonian view of concrete cooperation within the next couple of  months. Evidently as early as the second half of February  another NATO mission will arrive to advise our politicians. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Cash in hand The government may be inclined to blame the demands of institutional investors for high dividends, but rising pay-outs are now being fuelled by companies' improving balance sheets and cash flow. The aggregate gearing of the equity market is probably now below 30 per cent, having fallen from more than 40 per cent at the trough. Against that background it is hardly surprising that dividend growth has outstripped the most optimistic City forecasts this year, even though earnings are growing in line with expectations. But aggregate figures disguise the number of companies which have - or will soon have - net cash. Many are in sectors such as retailing or pharmaceuticals which invested heavily in the 1980s. Utilities privatised on favourable terms, such as the regional electricity companies and power generators, and established hoarders such as Associated British Foods are also on the list. But companies as diverse as De La Rue, BET, Tomkins and Whitbread must also be included. On the fringes are industrial giants such as Imperial Chemical Industries and RTZ which now boast very low levels of gearing by historic standards. While that points to big dividends to come from some companies, including one-off payments, the overall position could change quickly. Despite the government's concerns, investment intentions are not especially weak for this point in the economic cycle. If physical investment starts to rise and acquisitions return to the corporate scene, dividend growth across the market would soon revert to a more normal rate.</p>

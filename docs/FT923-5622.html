			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent ends mostly steady after volatile week BOURSES closed mostly steady after a volatile week, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT managed to erase early losses by the close but trading remained nervous with some analysts noting that the market seemed to be testing the 1,500 support level on the DAX. After a fall of 15 points in the DAX during the first 30 minutes of trading, some confidence returned and the blue-chip index closed the day 3.05 higher at 1,515.47, barely changed on the week. The FAZ index was 2.37 lower at 593.85 by midsession. Turnover fell to DM4.7bn from DM5.7bn. Early activity focused on BASF as Thursday's interim results were subjected to closer scrutiny. Worries that the chemical group may have to cut its dividend prompted heavy selling, and the shares closed down DM2.90 or 1.3 per cent at DM208.50, but off an intraday year's low of DM201.20. Other chemical stocks were better off, with Bayer up DM1 at DM265.80 and Hoechst 60 pfg better at DM238.50. Elsewhere, Asko leapt DM24 or 3.7 per cent to DM660 although there was no news to prompt the rise while Daimler gained DM3.20 to DM614, still buoyed up by its interim results earlier in the week. MILAN retained some of its early gains by the end of the session. The Comit index rose 0.31 to 393.60, down 3.1 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at less than Thursday's L49bn. But then renewed rumours about Mediobanca's honorary chairman Mr Enrico Cuccia pulled Mediobanca's shares down by L95 to L10,535, unsettling the market. Italcementi and its holding company Italmobiliare were out of favour after a newspaper report suggested that Italcementi may have to pay more for Ciments Francais because the latter's rights issue had been heavily under-subscribed. Italcementi fell L350 to L9,250, while Italmobiliare lost L800 to L38,600. AMSTERDAM remained quiet ahead of the weekend with the CBS Tendency index unchanged at 110.1, but 1.2 per cent lower on the week. One of the highlights of the day was a 10 per cent rise in shares of Internatio Muller, advancing Fl 6 to Fl 61.50 on good interim results released after the close on Thursday. DAF weakened as speculation that Daimler-Benz might be interested taking a stake in the group waned. Its shares closed down Fl 1.20 or 6.4 per cent at Fl 17.60. VNU was another gainer, up Fl 3.30 to Fl 76.80 as its first half earnings improved over 5.6 per cent while Aegon's interim figures helped its shares to put on 40 cents to Fl 61.80. ZURICH advanced moderately with the SMI index up 5.1 to 1,745.7 but down 1.27 per cent on the week. Among active issues Brown Boveri bearers were up SFr90 to SFr3,650 and Nestle bearers gained SFr70 to SFr9,100. Banks and insurers were mixed with UBS bearers up SFr5 at SFr680 and Zurich Insurance bearers SFr55 firmer at SFr1,820. Adia bearers rose SFr16 to SFr203 after the employment group reported better half-year figures. BRUSSELS improved although Petrofina again went against the trend, falling BFr120 to BFr8,640 on fears that it may have to cut its dividend following a sharp fall in earnings. The Bel-20 index advanced 3.09 to 1,062.13, but was 4.6 per cent lower on the week. Banks were generaly stronger, with Generale de Banque up BFr110 at BFr6,560. STOCKHOLM declined in moderate trading after two days of strong gains. The Affarsvarlden General Index fell 6.9 to 780.0, steady on the week, as turnover slipped to SKr532m from SKr815m. HELSINKI closed higher as investors continued to buy shares after the heavy losses earlier in the week. The HEX index closed 0.72 per cent up at 571.8, down 6.3 per cent on the week. OSLO dipped in nervous trading after Thursday's gains. The all-share index fell 2.44 to 333.0, but was 2.7 per cent higher on the week, in turnover of NKr997m. MADRID's general index closed down 0.15 at 205.61 for a fall of 2.2 per cent on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 28                            Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open     10.30am   11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1007.64  1007.42  1008.06  1010.79  1012.39  1013.68  1012.47  1013.54                 Day's High  1014.20    Day's Low  1007.02         Aug 27     Aug 26     Aug 25      Aug 24      Aug 21        1017.14     997.98     993.01     1010.52     1039.54  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (6): Novelty of a network in insurance / Profile of Banco Mello NEWLY-created Banco Mello is one of Portugal's smaller banks but its owners believe it is poised to make an important impact on the financial sector. The family bank has two major factors in its favour - it belongs to the financially- astute Mello family and is being developed hand-in-hand with the clan's other big asset, Portugal's top insurance company, Imperio. 'When we acquired the bank in May 1991, it was nothing more than a bank with a licence and a team of people,' says Mr Vasco de Mello, the bank's 36-year-old president. 'We implemented a new strategy. 'We decided it was important to change the bank's name - it was called Sociedade Financeira Portuguesa - and adapt to a new culture,' he says. 'We wanted to be a market player in corporate business, in personal business and in the capital markets.' One of Portugal's leading financial families before 1974, the Mellos saw a left-wing revolution whittle away most of their wealth through nationalisation. Mr Jose Manuel de Mello was one of the country's leading businessmen in pre- revolutionary Portugal, controlling the largest economic group, Companhia Uniao Fabril, which had interests in shipping, banking and insurance. The family dispersed after the 1974 coup and headed for more financially-sound centres such as New York, London and Switzerland. But they never quite turned their backs on their homeland. Today, with a stable democratic government in office, the Mello family has returned in force. The govern- ment, embracing capitalist ideals and a free market ideology, has helped pave the way for their comeback. Through his personal holding company, Uniao Internacional Financeira, the family patriarch Mr Jose Manuel de Mello regained more than 90 per cent of SFP shares when the institution was reprivatised in May 1991. SFP, granted the status of a special investment company, was originally created in 1969 by the former right-wing dictatorship as a public limited company, mainly as a vehicle to support industrial and development projects in Portugal and its African colonies, particularly Angola and Mozambique. The group changed the name to Banco de Mello six months after the purchase. Last November, Mr Jose Manuel further tightened his grip on Portugal's financial world by regaining control of the country's largest insurance company, Imperio, buying a 65.55 per cent stake at its reprivatisation. For the past two years, the reorganisation of the Jose de Mello Group has centred round the fledgling Banco Mello. Today the bank with a 204-strong workforce has graduated from a small to a medium-sized institution and is ready to climb further. The Mello family plans to use the already established Imperio network, with its 700,000 clients and 80 branches, to expand throughout the country, initially focusing on Lisbon and Oporto. 'The main difference is in the concept of banking,' Mr Vasco de Mello explains. 'We aim to distribute in other ways rather than act like a traditional bank. 'Imperio changes our way forward dramatically,' he says. 'We plan to do the opposite from other banks by devel- oping banking products to add to a distribution network already there. It has a certain novelty - insurance contributing a network for a bank.' Mr Vasco de Mello, the eldest son of shipping tycoon Mr Jose Manuel de Mello, says that there are clear similarities between Imperio and the bank and the family decided it was possible to develop a joint distribution network, using the physical facilities of Imperio, to get closer to a more personal market. Banco Mello, still the child of the financial sector of the Jose de Mello Group, is just one aspect of an integrated group which is organised into three main financial fields: banking, insurance and investment management. The bank's cash flow for 1992 increased 14.8 per cent to Es1.9bn (Pounds 8.32m), while net assets jumped 72 per cent to Es92.4bn. However, owing to large investments, mainly in personnel and information technology, net profits were slightly down. The group hopes to open three more branches by the end of June, with an additional nine six months later. By the end of 1994 Banco Mello is expected to have opened facilities in all Imperio branches. Although banking comp- etition is intensifying and economic activity has slowed, the group is positive about the development of the bank. It has the advantage of knowing that Portugal's insurance market is expected to show the biggest growth rates in the EC this year. In 1992, Imperio remained the leading insurance company with a total market share of 12.9 per cent. Net profits were up 8.2 per cent to Es690m while cash flow increased 43 per cent to Es2.6bn. The group is moving into chemical companies and shipping, as well as maintaining its presence in financial services through Banco Mello and Imperio. 'History doesn't repeat itself, but there are opportunities,' says Mr Vasco de Mello. 'We're just trying to develop those opportunities.'</p>

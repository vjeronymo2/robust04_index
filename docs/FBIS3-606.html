			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jose Eduardo dos Santos' army is moving large  quantities of troops and war materiel in the diamond-rich area  of Canfunfo in Lunda Norte Province. According to our  correspondent in the area, the movement has been ordered by  disillusioned Generals Sukissa and Luis Passeira. Preparations  for a military offensive against diamond-producing UNITA areas  have been going on for some time. The Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FALA] has warned government troops not to  accept such adventures because they will receive shameful and  sad lessons since FALA will not tolerate any kind of aggression.</p>

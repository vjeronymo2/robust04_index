			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Autonomous Regional Foreign Propaganda  Bureau held a farewell meeting for all members of the Chinese  Tibet Art Troupe prior to their departure for a performing visit  to Austria, at the Tibet Guesthouse in the afternoon of 11 May.  Speaking at the function, Autonomous Regional Chairman  Gyaincain Norbu said: After meticulous and thorough  preparations, the Tibet Art Troupe will soon be leaving for  performances in Austria. The troupe is thus far Tibet's largest  cultural troupe to be dispatched for overseas performances,  serving not only as a key foreign propaganda project for Tibet,  but also a major cultural exchange program with foreign  countries. Gyaincain Norbu stated: We should, through visiting  performances, widely publicize Tibet's realities, including  political stability, economic development, social progress,  nationality solidarity, ever-enhancing living standards,  protected Zang culture, and freedom of religion achieved under  the correct central leadership and with the vigorous support of  people of all nationalities across the country in the past  40-odd years since its peaceful liberation, particularly since  launching of reform and opening up, so that more Zang  compatriots overseas and people all over the world will have a  correct and full understanding on Tibet -- a bid to project a  correct image of a new socialist Tibet to the world and to  enhance friendship between the people of the Chinese Tibet and  that of other nations through friendly exchanges.    Gyaincain Norbu said: The Tibet Art Troupe will not only  function as Chinese ambassadors responsible for conducting  cultural exchanges with foreign countries with the missions of  spreading friendship and broadening overseas publicity, but will  also be given the important responsibilities of studying,  drawing experience from, and absorbing the fine cultures of the  people of other nations. The autonomous regional party  committee and government hope that all members of the art troupe  will be united as one in completely fulfilling their glorious  and arduous missions entrusted by the party and the people of  the motherland.

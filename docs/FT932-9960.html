			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI leaps on US demand US INTEREST drove ICI shares higher once again. Traders took their cue from Friday's dealings in New York and marked up UK prices at the start of dealing yesterday. The shares remained strong throughout the day and closed 41 ahead at 1284p. However, turnover of 1.3m shares was thin even for a highly priced stock and suggested more of a reaction than genuine interest. The price has been volatile ahead of the detailing of the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue, believed to be the biggest ever, to fund the impending demerger. ICI's board will meet at 7.00am tomorrow and is expected to announce a one-for-three cash call at around 600p a Zeneca share. Subsequently dealing in the unofficial 'grey' market in the new ICI and Zeneca shares will begin at 2.30pm. US investors, who unusually are able to take part in the rights issue, have been very positive about the prospects for the demerged companies, particularly Zeneca, which generates 40 per cent of its sales in the US. However, even optimistic houses in the UK financial community unconnected with the issue believe that the shares are expensive above 1250p.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPRINKLER SYSTEMS  </P> <P> I certainly agree with your editorial (Dec. 24) about mandatory sprinkler  systems for homes, but before this can be done, the installation cost must be  reduced and the insurance companies made to provide the reduced rate you seem  to think exists. An estimate I received recently for a new home put the price  of sprinklers over twice what you estimated. I have yet to find an insurance  company that gives a reduced rate for sprinklers in a home.  </P> <P> BRUCE M. STARK  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

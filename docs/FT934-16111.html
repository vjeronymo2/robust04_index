			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Caracas bombings linked to share price manipulation VENEZUELA'S police believe a small group of people placed at least one of a series of bombs that exploded in the capital city in recent months in an attempt to manipulate Caracas stock exchange prices, according to local press reports yesterday. If the theory proves to be true, it would represent one of the most audacious cases of stock manipulation on record. Mr Carlos Delgado Chapellin, minister of the interior, said people with 'links to Venezuela's financial sector' were suspected of planting a car bomb that damaged a Caracas shopping centre on August 18. The authorities also suspect that the group, reported to be made up of at least five civilians, two navy officers and a member of the state security police, were behind other bombings in a series which began in mid-July. It was widely believed that the bombings were politically motivated and aimed at destabilising the government. No one has admitted to them. However, the police are now looking at the theory that the group planted at least one bomb to depress share prices on the already nervous Caracas exchange. They then bought shares at low prices, and sold when they recovered. The authorities are said to believe the bombings may also have been used to manipulate the price of Venezuela's external debt bonds on international markets. However, the police have not rejected the possibility that one or more of the bombings (especially a July 19 letter bomb blast at the High Court which injured an employee) were indeed carried out for political purposes. The bombings came at a time of social and political unrest in Venezuela. The country weathered two attempted coups last year and has been in a state of political turmoil for over two years.</p>

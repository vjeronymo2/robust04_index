			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has expressed  concern over Washington's move to renew Super 301 trade  legislation that authorizes the U.S. Government to retaliate  against nations which erect barriers to American products, and  is even considering multilateral action against future U.S.  application of the trade act.    The U.S. Government is yet to officially confirm the  reinstatement of the Super 301 clause, a government official  said Thursday.    Nevertheless, Seoul has already told Washington that  reintroduction of the retaliatory trade act runs counter to the  multilateral dispute settlement capacity of the World Trade  Organization [WTO], which will replace the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) after the Uruguay Round pact is signed  next year.    The American press reported that President Bill Clinton has  decided to reauthorize Super 301 in an executive order raising  tariffs on Japanese imports following the collapse of  Washington-Tokyo trade talks last month.    Though initially aimed at Japan, Super 301 will eventually  be  used to widen U.S. access to Korea and affect Korean advancement  into the American market.    Washington has made it clear that it will apply Super 301 on  non-WTO-bound countries and areas so that its impact is less  pronounced, the official said.    The 1988 omnibus trade act was largely denounced as the most  retaliatory U.S. tool against countries with which it suffered a  trade deficit and was finally killed toward the end of 1990.    Korea will seek multilateral steps and act strongly against  any unilateral retaliation by the United States, he said.</p>

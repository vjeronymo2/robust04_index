			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Mayhew declines to elaborate on 'chain of communication': Unionists demand resignation After months of denials, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, admitted yesterday that the British government had been in contact with the IRA leadership through a 'chain of communication'. As unionist MPs demanded his resignation, Sir Patrick hastily convened a press conference at Stormont Castle in Belfast for what most political observers saw as a damage-limitation exercise. Yes, a message had been sent to the IRA but no, there had not been talks or negotiations with terrorist leaders and no one from the British government or civil service was authorised to conduct such talks. Sir Patrick said a message was received from the IRA at the end of February to the effect that 'the conflict was over' and asked for advice on how to bring it to a close. The government responded by demanding a 'genuine ending of violence' before there was any question of talks. Sir Patrick said: 'Nobody has been authorised to enter into discussions with the IRA. The people of Northern Ireland do not want peace at any price and in my judgment the IRA should not be offered a price.' He firmly rejected questions about the nature of the 'communication channel' as it could 'endanger lives'. 'There is a chain of communication. I am not prepared to enter into discussion or description of that chain. To do that could endanger lives,' Sir Patrick said. He disclosed that the chain had been in place for a number of years and remained confidential. But it was on the question of the government's reluctance to acknowledge the existence of the contact with the IRA that Sir Patrick found himself under most pressure. At one point he was asked: 'Do you accept that you deceived people in Northern Ireland?' He rejected the suggestion. Another questioner asked him to elaborate on the difference between talking to and writing to the IRA. He replied: 'Well, you use your mouth when talking.' The Northern Ireland secretary revealed that contacts had taken place recently. He disclosed that another message from the IRA was received on November 2, two days after the Greysteel massacre and after one of the worst months of violence in the Northern Ireland troubles. Another reply was sent on November 5. The Democratic Unionist deputy leader, Mr Peter Robinson, reacted angrily to the disclosures and said unionists no longer trusted the government. Mr Robinson claimed it was inconceivable that one of the most sophisticated terrorist organisations in the world would ask the government for advice on ending violence. In an effort to reassure MPs, Sir Patrick said the correspondence to date would be placed in the Commons library as soon as possible. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the contacts had been authorised by the prime minister as well as Sir Patrick. But Mr Adams disputed the government's version of events and said that at no point was there any communication from the IRA stating that the conflict was over.</p>

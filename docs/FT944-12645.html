			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Heath wants part of cash probe in public Sir Edward Heath, the former Conservative prime minister, last night raised the pressure on the Commons committee of privileges to hold at least part of its inquiry into the 'cash for questions' affair in public. He said that the departure from precedent this would involve was necessary in order to redress the slump in public confidence in the Commons. Sir Edward told the Commons that the presence of Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, as a member of the committee should ensure that witnesses were not unfairly treated. He declined to go as far as Mr Tony Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, who wanted the views expressed by committee members as they debated their conclusions to be heard in public. Mr Benn made clear that while he remained a member of the committee he would provide his own report on all its proceedings. Mr John Prescott, Labour deputy leader, called on MPs to accept it was in their interest that 'malpractice is rooted out and guidelines devised which are easily understood by both us and the public'. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, said that all the evidence heard by the committee would be published, along with its conclusions, and then debated by the Commons. Commenting on the possibility of a 'half-way house' with some of the committee's proceedings being conducted in public and others in private, Mr Newton said: 'I do not see how such an arrangement could be made to work.' A Labour motion urging the committee to examine witnesses in public, except when reasons of natural justice dictated otherwise, was defeated by a majority of 37 (301-264). A government amendment reaffirming the committee's right to decide for itself whether to sit in public or private was carried without a division.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government, which is working on the tariff  schedule for 1995, is considering raising the tariff rates on  apparel, footwear and toys up to 15 percent from the current 8  percent level.    Though it is set to accommodate tariff concessions it has  committed itself to under the Uruguay Round accord, the  government has room for tariff rate increases for apparel,  footwear and toys, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday.    Under the Uruguay Round accord concluded last December, the  ministry said, Korea is set to cut the tariff rates in the years  ahead, not from the current 8 percent level, but from the 20  percent level in the 1986 base year.    The ministry said the government will consider industrial  competitiveness in readjusting tariff rates and that tariff  rates on apparel, footwear and other light industrial products  are far lower than in other countries.    In Japan, for example, tariff rates on apparel, footwear and  toys exceed 20 percent, the ministry said.    The government, it said, will be able to lower tariff rates  on heavy-chemical industrial products.    The 1995 tariff schedule will include yearly cuts in tariff  rates that are set to decline to zero percent or to a minimum  level in five to 10 years under the Uruguay Round accord, the  ministry said.    Those items whose tariffs are scheduled to be eliminated  during the next five to 10 years include computer input and  output devices, printers and semiconductors.    To reduce the impact of the opening of the domestic farm  market, the ministry said, the government plans to introduce  specific tariff rates on certain farm products.    The government will also consider applying the higher rates  of the ad valorem and specific rates on certain other farm  products, the ministry said.    Specific rates will help curb low-priced imports as they are  applied to the volume of imports in contrast with ad valorem  rates applied to the value of imports, the ministry said.    The government will no longer prepare a five-year tariff  reduction plan, the ministry said. The second five-year tariff  reduction plan ends this year.    When tariffs were high, the government was forced to  announce  long-term tariff reduction plans. The average tariff rate,  which stood at 21.9 percent, has been cut to 7.9 percent as of  this year.    "Even without a tariff reduction plan, Korea is set to cut  tariff rates under the Uruguay Round accord," said an official  from the ministry. "In addition, we do now know that will  happen during the next five years."    The ministry said the government will prepare a draft tariff  schedule for the 1995 during the first half of this year and  send it to the National Assembly for approval in September.    A committee set up to work on the draft schedule, chaired by  Ku Pyong-hoe, chairman of the Korea Foreign Trade Association,  held its first meeting yesterday morning. Committee members  include government officials, economists and business  representatives.</p>

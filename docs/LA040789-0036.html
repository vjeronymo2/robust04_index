			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MT. CARMEL'S LEE STILL HARASSING POWAY  </P> <P> On a day like Thursday with inland temperatures nearing or exceeding 100  degrees, it seemed appropriate that the Sundevils of Mt. Carmel High School  defeated Poway, 6-1, in a Palomar League baseball game at Poway.  </P> <P> It was even more appropriate that Sundevil left fielder Marcus Lee delivered  the big hit, a three-run homer in the fourth that broke open a 2-1 game.  </P> <P> Last year, Lee hit two homers as Mt. Carmel defeated the Titans at Poway. One  is still discussed; it easily cleared the 365-foot sign in right-center field,  a grass area and embankment on the other side of the fence and finally landed  on the far end of an adjacent parking lot.  </P> <P> Thursday's was in the same direction but with considerably less distance.  </P> <P> "This was just a ho-hummer compared to (last year's)," said Rudy Casciato,  Poway coach. "He always seems to hit one or two every time he plays here. Maybe  he should transfer here."  </P> <P> Said Lee, a senior, of his fourth home run of the season, "I knew it was gone.  It was a good feeling. There are some you aren't sure about. But I knew this  one was gone."  </P> <P> Last year, Lee missed the first part of the season with a broken wrist but hit  four home runs in 12 games. This season, he was hitting .360 before Thursday's  game, in which he went two for four. Possibly his hardest hit ball was right at  Poway first baseman Alon Banks, who turned the line drive into a double play.  </P> <P> His home run would have been a grand slam, but one pitch earlier, Brad Scott  was thrown out at the plate trying to score on a wild pitch.  </P> <P> After Lee's homer, starter Doug Hill (5-0) had more than enough cushion. He  allowed just four hits and was aided by three double plays.  </P> <P> "He struggled early in the year," said Sam Blalock, Mt. Carmel coach. "But he's  been very sharp his last three or four games."  </P> <P> Mt. Carmel (13-2, 2-0 in league) have been sharp all season. "We're playing  real steady," Blalock said.  </P> <P> And that is bad news for the rest of the Palomar League. Mt. Carmel has won or  shared eight league titles since 1979, including last year, when the Sundevils  tied Poway at 10-2.  </P> <P> Mt. Carmel played like a champion again Thursday with a run in the second,  third and sixth innings to go with Lee's three-run homer in the fourth.  </P> <P> Poway (7-6, 1-1) got only one run in the third on a triple by Chris McDermott  (two for two) and a ground ball by Doug Schwenke. Hill, in control throughout,  did not pitch to more than four batters in any inning and faced just two more  than the maximum 21 batters.  </P> <P> "We have a very mature group," Blalock said. "Our kids have played in a drizzle  this year, in the cold, with a 50 mile-an-hour wind in our face and in the  early morning after traveling."  </P> <P> And in heat. JIM LINDGREN  </P></p>

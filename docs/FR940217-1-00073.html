			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed regulations would also make clear that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual, State, or organization that engages in an excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function is still considered to be a third-party servicer with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to any other function that constitutes the administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a Title IV, HEA program performed under a contract with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary further proposes to remove the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> designated department official, initiating official,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> show-cause official  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> from subpart G of this part and place them in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.2, because this section contains the general definitions applicable to all of part 668 and to all of the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 668.11&blank;Scope.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer's violation of an applicable provision of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart B of the Student Assistance General Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations may subject the servicer to a proceeding under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart G. This change implements the statutory authority under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 487(c)(1) of the HEA to provide for the accountability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a third-party servicer's administration of any aspect of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart G governs emergency actions or fines against an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution and the limitation, suspension, or termination of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposes to add references to a third-party servicer in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart G so as to provide for emergency actions and fines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against a third-party servicer or the limitation, suspension, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination of the servicer's eligibility to contract with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to administer any aspect of the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in a Title IV, HEA program (see the discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning with &sect;668.81).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also proposes to provide that if a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer violates an applicable provision of this subpart, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary may also initiate an emergency action, a fine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeding, or a limitation, suspension, or termination action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against any institution under whose contract the servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violated that provision. Because an institution has agreed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with all applicable Title IV, HEA requirements in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement with the Secretary, and because the institution must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate under &sect;668.12 the capability to administer the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs, the Secretary emphasizes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is always responsible for the actions of any of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees, officers, or agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 668.12&blank;Institutional participation agreement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposes to require an institution to agree, in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation agreement, to be liable for all misused Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA program funds, including those received on the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behalf by a third-party servicer, and to be liable for refunds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including those that a third-party servicer was required to pay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the institution's behalf. This provision emphasizes that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is always liable for the actions of its employees,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officers, and agents regarding its participation in a Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also proposes to amend this section by adding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new paragraph (b)(2)(vi) to reflect a new statutory directive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the HEA governing the past performance of individuals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, or organizations affiliated with an institution. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 487(a)(16) of the HEA, an institution may not knowingly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract with or employ any individual, agency, or organization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that has been or whose officers or employees have been convicted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of, or pled  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> nolo contendere  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> or guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of Title IV, HEA program funds or been judicially determined to have committed fraud involving Title IV, HEA program funds. An institution may not contract with another institution or a third-party servicer that has been terminated under section 432 of the HEA involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of funds under the Title IV, HEA programs, or that has been judicially determined to have committed fraud involving Title IV, HEA program funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary's proposed rules, in accordance with the consensus reached at the negotiated rulemaking sessions, would apply the prohibitions not only to instances of judicial determinations of criminal or fraudulent activity, but also to administrative determination of fraud and judicial or administrative determinations of any other material violations of law. Administrative proceedings are more frequent and often occur well in advance of related court proceedings. The Secretary believes that administrative proceedings afford sufficient due process, including notice, hearing, and review, to be relied upon for excluding individuals, agencies, or organizations under these provisions from applicable employment or contracting, if such a determination of culpability has been made. The Secretary believes that the reference to material violations of law is necessary, as Title IV, HEA funds are also endangered by the employment of those determined to have violated laws governing the handling of those funds, even if those violations do not rise to the level of fraud. For example, an institution should not employ a person or organization that has failed to pay refunds required under law.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

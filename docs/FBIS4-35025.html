			<p>BFN     [Text] The PRC health minister is discussing the sale of  PRC-made medicine to the country with Brazilian officials. The  cost of these medicines is low, particularly because they are  produced in large amounts.    [Begin Flavio Figueiredo recording] Brazil may import  medicines from the PRC. The issue was discussed on 23 June by  PRC Health Minister Chen Minzhang and Brasilia Health Ministry  representatives. The Chinese assert that the medicines will  reach Brazil at prices much lower than those on the local market.    According to Minister Chen Minzhang, the PRC produces  medicines at a lower cost because the country manufactures them  in huge quantities and has high technology for obtaining raw  material.    Adinei Moraes, Health Assistance Secretariat chief of staff,  said importing would be an alternative way of solving the  problem of high medicine prices in Brazil. He added that this is  why the government is analyzing the PRC proposal's feasibility.  [end recording]</p>

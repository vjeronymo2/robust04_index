			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Akio Tamesada; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 4 Jun Morning </F> Edition]    [Text] Vienna, 2 Jun--In reference to the conclusion  reached by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 2  June that effective inspection of fuel rods in experimental  reactors has become impossible, a DPRK (North Korea) source in  Vienna on 3 June once again insisted that the fuel rods taken  out by North Korea are being stored in "a way to make future  IAEA inspections possible."    The North Korean source said the IAEA was informed of this  in  a letter dated 2 June.</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Unit swap deal offered by City of London trust City of London Investment Management is offering unit holders in its Emerging Markets Country trust the chance to swap their units for shares in a parallel new investment trust. It is also planning to raise additional capital through an issue of C-shares in the newly-formed Emerging Markets Country Investment Trust. This is thought to be the first time that an investment trust has been created from a unit trust, though unitisation is a relatively common fate for struggling investment trusts. The move is intended to attract new investors who are barred from investing in open-ended funds, and also give a choice of investment vehicles to existing investors. Unit holders in the Pounds 43m fund have until July 22 to decide whether to exchange their units for shares, in the ratio of five units for five ordinary shares plus one warrant. The costs of the transfer will be covered by the investment managers rather than the investors. The proposals for the new trust are conditional on the exchange of at least 30m units, currently worth 53-56p each. The C-share issue is planned for early September, and will take the form of a placing, with no public offer. It aims to raise up to Pounds 24m before expenses. The articles of the new trust include a promise that if its shares trade at a discount to net asset value of more than 5 per cent for an entire year, proposals will be made to liquidate, restructure or unitise it. Other emerging market investment trust shares have tended to trade at or above net asset value, but wide discounts could be a problem if the sector fell out of favour. The new investment trust will follow the same principles as its forebear, and its initial portfolio will be almost identical.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RAPPER FACES CHARGES OF SEXUAL ABUSE  </P> <P> A member of the rap group The Fat Boys and two members of the group's entourage  have been charged with sexually abusing a minor at a suburban Philadelphia  party.  </P> <P> Singer Darren Robinson, 23; his brother and manager, Curtis Robinson, 27; and a  bodyguard, Pell Wimeley, 31, all of New York City, face a Dec. 20 preliminary  hearing on the charges.  </P> <P> The three were freed on bond after they surrendered to state police in  Coatesville on Wednesday.  </P> <P> A fourth man, Edward Kelso of Coatesville, a friend of the band members, was  also charged in the case.  </P> <P> They were charged after state police received a videotape of an August party  the men attended.  </P> <P> Police documents indicate that the videotape showed Curtis Robinson and Wimeley  exposing their genitals and dancing with a nude 18-year-old woman, and several  of the men watching while Kelso had sex with a 14-year-old. Darren Robinson  allegedly recorded the videotape.  </P> <P> The men say the 14-year-old and a 16-year-old companion lied to them about  their age. They told police the girls consented to both the sex and the taping.  </P> <P> The Fat Boys are best known for their comic appearances in rap films, including  1985's "Krush Groove," and their starring roles in 1988's "The Disorderlies."  </P></p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Arafat insists Israelis stick to deadline Rising Arab-Jewish bloodshed and deepening tension between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation threatened the Israeli-Palestinian peace process yesterday as Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, insisted Israel stick to a deadline six days away for the start of military withdrawal. One Palestinian and two Israelis were shot dead in separate incidents of violence. Mr Arafat's demand that Israel keep its promise and start withdrawing troops from the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho next Monday was rejected yesterday by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, who said a delay of two to three weeks was inevitable because both sides have yet to reach agreement on security, military and economic issues. Israel meanwhile welcomed two humanitarian gestures made by Syria, which will grant exit permits to Syrian Jews and co-operate in the search for seven missing Israeli soldiers. The moves were widely interpreted in Jerusalem as confidence-building signs of progress on the stalled Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which are the focus of current Middle East shuttle diplomacy by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. In Amman Mr Arafat, who met Mr Christopher yesterday, said he had asked the US to put pressure on Israel to meet its obligations under the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord and start a phased troop withdrawal next Monday. Mr Christopher called for 'timely implementation'. Mr Arafat's insistence on the December 13 deadline follows a week of violence between Israelis and Palestinians amid fears that extremists on both sides are stepping up tension. Yesterday, gunmen fired on an car, killing two Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank town of Hebron. Israeli undercover troops shot dead a Palestinian as he sat in front of his house in a West Bank village. In Cairo, where the two sides are discussing military and security issues, Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said the talks were at a standstill. The two sides have yet to agree the size of the Jericho area and who will control border crossings. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said the two sides were near to agreement providing for Israeli control of the crossings but with a Palestinian presence. In Paris Mr Avraham Shochat, Israel's finance minister, met Mr Ahmed Qurie (also known as Abu Ala) to examine the future relations between Israel and the Palestinian economy. Disagreements focus on an Israeli proposal for a customs union with the harmonisation of taxes and duties. Mr Rabin said the Syrian gesture on Israeli soldiers was 'an important step forward'. After talks with President Hafez al Assad of Syria on Sunday Mr Christopher said Damascus had agreed to help with the search for seven missing Israeli soldiers and to grant exit visas by the end of the year to all Syrian Jews who wished to leave the country. Mr Christopher said he would return to Damascus on Thursday after holding a second round of talks with Israeli leaders this morning.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Axa Yesterday's convertible bond from Axa suggests its investment in Equitable Life is starting to look less of a steal. The US business was always going to require additional capital. Even so, the market might be forgiven for worrying that the final bill will run into hundreds of millions of dollars. Axa is being understandably vague. It cannot itself assess the precise impact of proposed US capital adequacy regulations or the final extent of provisions on the investment portfolio of junk bonds and mortgages. Having taken its US ambition thus far, though, Axa can hardly let Equitable Life fall into disrepair. With US buyers of life assurance taking a keen interest in financial strength, that means keeping credit ratings and solvency well up with the pack. By injecting funds into its US operation last year, Aegon is setting a fast pace. If others follow, Axa may end up facing a choice between losing market share and injecting still more capital. With its shares trading at a three-year high, Axa had a natural opportunity to raise cash. As recession looming at home, it may not get as good a chance again.</p>

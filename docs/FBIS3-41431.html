			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Coca Plantations and Environmental </F> Degradation'']    [Text] Between 1987 and 1991 more than 17,000 hectares of  coca plantations were declared to have been eradicated in the  Chapare under the Alternative Crop Planting Programs, and, until  the end of the previous administration, it was maintained that  the eradication program and the DESAL's [Center for Latin  American Socioeconomic Development] operations had been a  success.    Now, it is reported that satellite photographs show 47,000  hectares under coca cultivation, hence an actual increase. The  United States Embassy has set a 1994 deadline for completion of  the eradication, since it has been found that only 10 percent of  the production has a legitimate use, and that the rest is used  for the manufacture of cocaine base.    The foregoing indicates the scantiness of the information  filtering down to the public on the subject of coca cultivation.  Since the topic is intertwined with police and diplomatic  issues, the information being released is incomplete; and it  still cannot be said that there is a strong current of public  opinion in favor of replacing the coca economy.    The fact that has been given the least importance is that  the  Chapare is an ecosystem of approximately 2.5 million hectares  that is in the process of being destroyed by coca cultivation  and the use of chemical precursors.    Coca is necessary for soil preservation in the Yungas of La  Paz, according to reports by LIDEMA [League for the Protection  of the Environment]. But in the Chapare, farming techniques,  lack of crop rotation, and weeding with the grubbing hoe, have  all accelerated erosion and done away with the thin layer of  topsoil.    In 1991, the degradation of the soil that was found to have  occurred in the eradicated areas of the Chapare was such as to  require a waiting period estimated at 10 to 15 years for its  recovery.    But the problem is not only coca itself. According to data  released to the press in 1991, the drug producers have, each  year, been spraying between 121,000 and 127,000 tons of leaves  with 278 tons of sulfuric acid and approximately 12 million  liters of gasoline, kerosene, and jet fuel. Since coca  cultivation has now expanded, it must be assumed that these  figures have also grown. Even though not the entire measure of  contaminants reaches the Chapare's soil or its rivers, it is  known that lime and sulfuric acid drastically modify the pH of  soils and waters. And the kerosene, spreading out into rivers,  seriously contaminates the waters. Antidrug police forces have  destroyed tens of thousands of vats and laboratories in the area.    The coca plant is not the only link in the chain, and,  within  the ambit of shared international responsibility for curtailing  the drug traffic, the positions being taken against its  cultivation are increasingly aggressive. This is not the case,  however, with respect to the traffic of the chemical  contaminants. Without coca there is no drug, but neither is  there drug without precursors. In Bolivia alone there are four  legally established enterprises for the manufacture of sulfuric  acid, hydrochloric acid, and ammonia, although the industrial  demand for these products is insignificant.    It seems that nations that manufacture chemicals have not  shouldered the responsibility devolving upon them to control the  trafficking in these products. Records show that precursors are  arriving from Germany, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, United States,  Holland, Peru, Switzerland, Italy, England, France, and others.  Legally or illegally imported, they are entering through Chilean  ports.    Furthermore, all production increases when demand requires  it. And while the Alternative Crop Planting Program has been a  failure, the campaigns to curb the dealing and use of drugs in  consumer countries have also been a failure.</p>

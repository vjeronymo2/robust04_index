They are expected to appear in court within  days. According to opposition spokesman Abass Youssouf, these  arrests are a simple maneuver orchestrated by President Said  Mohamed Dhojar's regime to destabilize the opposition. Here is  Abass Youssouf speaking to Mohamed Yusufu Saliou.    [Begin recording] [Youssouf] One has the impression that  what  they really want is to put political leaders under arrest so  they are looking for an excuse. The very day of the arrests the  government issued a communique over the radio attacking [words  indistinct] and myself. So one has the impression that the  government is panic-stricken and is simply seeking to arrest  people.    [Saliou] In the face of this situation what is the reaction  of the opposition that you represent?    [Youssouf] The opposition [words indistinct] because the  radio is gagged by the government. There is no (?written  press), they closed down all the radio stations close to the  opposition, and we in Moroni have called dignitaries and  religious leaders to meet on 22 and 23 March to deny the  allegations. We plan to hold a rally on 23 March, and it will  be followed up with other rallies in Grande Comore to try to  explain the situation to the people. We have convened political  leaders [words indistinct].    [Saliou] So in your opinion, there was no plot, but it is  rather the state which is trying to arrest opposition leaders  with flimsy excuses?    [Youssouf] Oh yes, that is quite clear to everybody. Even as  far as the people are concerned, you can be sure. [end recording]</p>

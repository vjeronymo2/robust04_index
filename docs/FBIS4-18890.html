			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Apparently, there is now a clear  upward tendency in the west German economy after all. It is,  above all, stimulated by foreign demand. As compared to the  previous month, in February the industry in the old FRG, with  price and seasonal adjustments, had a 3.1-percent increase in  orders. As the FRG Economics Ministry reported on Thursday [7  April], orders from abroad increased by 3.8 percent and domestic  orders by 2.7 percent. As compared to February 1993, total  orders received increased by 3.2 percent.    As compared to December, the January result of west German  industry has meanwhile been corrected from an increase by 1.8  percent to 0.8 percent. In February, with an increase of 3.8  percent as compared to the previous month, the capital goods  sector, which is important for the economy, reported the  greatest increase in demand, which even increased by 9 percent  in the sector of cars and other road vehicles.    In the two months' comparison between January/February and  November/December of last year, the processing trade received  altogether 1.5 percent more orders. As compared to January and  February 1993, it was approximately 2.3 percent more, with  foreign countries accounting for a 9-percent increase and  domestic orders decreasing by 1.3 percent. As compared to the  two previous months of November and December, domestic orders  were still stagnating, while foreign orders increased by 3.5  percent. Orders for basic materials and producer goods  increased by about 3.5 percent and for consumer goods by about 3  percent. The industry producing capital goods had to put up  with a slight decrease by 0.5 percent. As compared to the two  previous months, the changes are as follows (in percent):    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |January and February 1994/January and February 1993|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Volume                   |Value                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Processing trade as a wh-|+ 2.3                    |+ 2.1                    |  |ole                      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |-- Germany               |- 1.3                    |- 1.9                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |-- foreign countries     |+ 9.0                    |+ 9.7                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Basic materials and prod-|+ 7.0                    |+ 5.5                    |  |ucer goods               |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Capital goods            |+ 0.5                    |+ 1.4                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Consumer goods           |+ 0.2                    |- 0.4                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Ford talks fail to avert strike FORD's 8,000-strong white-collar staff will go ahead with a planned 24-hour strike tomorrow in protest at the company's threat of compulsory redundancies. The decision followed a fruitless meeting yesterday between union representatives and Ford managers. The white-collar workers voted to support strike action in ballots held earlier in the month. Mr Jim Thomas, national official with the MSF union, warned: 'We are now on a collision course, and if anyone is made compulsorily redundant further industrial action will be taken.' The disruption at Ford's 21 UK plants, involving foremen, computer operators and salesmen, will coincide with the official launch of the Mondeo replacement for the Sierra. The unions plan to lobby Ford dealers and march from Brentwood, Essex, to Ford's European headquarters nearby at Warley. The company told union officials yesterday it could not meet their demand for a guarantee of no compulsory white-collar redundancies. Managers also disclosed that they had found volunteers for all but 88 of the 2,200 redundancies required, with 101 staff being redeployed or transferred. The company said 'every effort' would be made to achieve the full redundancy target by March 30. If this was not reached compulsory redundancies would be imposed on April 16.</p>

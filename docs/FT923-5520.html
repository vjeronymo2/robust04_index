			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Crown selling French interests CROWN Communications, the USM-quoted commercial radio group which owns LBC, is close to selling its loss-making French radio interests. Mr David Haynes, chief executive, whose Australian company Darling Downs TV owns 37 per cent of Crown, said the deal would reduce the group's debt of nearly Pounds 16m and remove a drain on cash. RFM's main asset is a radio masthead, valued at nearly Pounds 12m in the September 1991 accounts. Price Waterhouse, the auditors, qualified the accounts because it could not say whether the value was fairly stated. While the sale price, to a French company, was not disclosed yesterday, Mr Haynes said it would be less than Pounds 12m, so there would be losses. Last year RFM accounted for nearly half the group's pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.79m. It was also a significant loss-maker in the six months to March 31, when the deficit amounted to Pounds 5.58m. Mr Haynes said LBC, which runs the London radio stations, was cash neutral and would soon move into a small surplus. That would be the 'only major asset left' after the RFM disposal and the planned sale of a majority stake in IRS, the advertising sales business. The RFM sale is conditional on approval from the French radio authority.</p>

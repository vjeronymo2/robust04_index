			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Unstable coalition predicted in Japan JAPAN could face another general election in the next year as the poll later this month is likely to create an unstable coalition government with a limited life, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former Liberal Democratic party powerbroker, forecast yesterday. Campaigning has begun for the July 18 election, but Mr Ozawa, the force behind the new Japan Renewal party, said the LDP would not gain a clear majority and an opposition coalition, including the JRP, would have difficulty staying together. A Japanese television news poll yesterday found the leader of the JRP, Mr Tsutomu Hata, was the most popular choice for the next prime minister. Mr Ozawa said his party would consider a coalition with the opposition Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party, as long as Mr Hata controlled the cabinet. Mr Ozawa predicted this month's election would be the start of a transitional period of instability, with the possibility of further splits in the LDP and SDP, the creation of new parties, and the collapse of the next government leading to a new election in the next year. 'If we have a non-LDP administration, the priority must be reform of the political system, and then there will be real changes in the political world,' Mr Ozawa said. By reform he meant redrawing of electoral boundaries and replacement of the present multi-seat constituencies with single seats. But he saw these structural changes as only the starting point for political change which would end when there was a change in Japan's political consciousness. 'We need to have a political system in which politicians are responsible and take responsibility.' He suggested the current election campaign was cheaper to run than those in the past because of the rise of new parties and general enthusiasm for reform, reducing the importance of corporate donations. Mr Ozawa was famed at the LDP for his fund-raising abilities. 'It's different from past elections - we can feel the reform wind and it is helping our campaign,' he said.</p>

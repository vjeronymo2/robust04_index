			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tsutomu Yamaguchi from Washington; part one of </F> three-part series entitled "North Korea's Suspected Development  of Nuclear Arms: The Crisis Structure: The United States Is  Becoming Restless at the Stalemate"; first paragraph is YOMIURI  SHIMBUN introduction]    [Text] The issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected  development of nuclear arms has suddenly been launched into even  greater confusion with the DPRK's unexpected replacement of fuel  rods from its experimental nuclear reactor. The focal issue  will now be what will come out of multilateral discussions at  the UN Security Council, apart from how North Korea, which  maintains a confrontational attitude toward the nuclear  nonproliferation regime led by the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA), will behave from now on. Will the UN discussions  lead to a breakthrough in the situation or will they lead to an  even more dangerous direction? Let us look at the structure of  this crisis, including how Japan is coping with the situation.    "Since June last year, we have carried on negotiations with  the DPRK, with patience and flexibility. But the question was  returned to the UN Security Council because the DPRK had  destroyed the basis for the IAEA to determine how much plutonium  had been diverted." On 3 June, the IAEA reported to the UN  secretary general that the inspection of the fuel rods became  impossible. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci  (special envoy on North Korean nuclear matters) held a news  conference and his face reflected fatigue and disappointment.  He was on record only a week ago making public a prospect that  the third-round of high level talks with the DPRK might be held  in early June. It was going to be a successful overcoming of  domestic hawks' criticism of "appeasement."    At that third-round of talks, the assistant secretary of  state said both countries were scheduled "to talk over the total  settlement of the nuclear problem and the problems related to  normalization of relations between the two countries." Was it  not what the DPRK nuclear diplomacy intended -- bringing the  U.S. Government to the negotiating table by declaring its  intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  [NPT] in March last year?    At this vital time, why did the DPRK dare to remove fuel  rods  from a reactor? Although what had happened behind the scenes  was shrouded in mystery, the assistant secretary of state's  words sounded as though he was greatly mortified. Well-informed  people in the United States are now divided into two groups in  their interpretation of the suspected DPRK nuclear arms  development program with which the DPRK has been playing with  the United States, a super power. One is the nuclear card theory  that the DPRK is using the suspicion itself as an allurement to  win the largest possible compromise out of the West. Another is  an argument that the DPRK is attempting to establish military  predominance in the region and to get economic as well as  diplomatic compromises by eventually possessing a nuclear  capability.    The six policy options mentioned in a report titled "The  North Korean Nuclear Program and U.S. Government Policy Options"  published on 1 June by the Congressional Research Service  strongly reflect polarization of views on the DPRK. While the  first option says to await the collapse of the Pyongyang regime,  which cannot survive until the DPRK's nuclear capability becomes  a serious threat, the second option suggests a policy of making  a package settlement of the problems pertaining to the Korean  peninsula and it has become the basis of the foreign policy the  Clinton administration has pursued so far.    The third option is about the UN-imposed economic sanctions  now under hot debate. These sanctions are anticipated when  diplomatic efforts mentioned in the second option fail.    The remaining choices are related to military options: the  fourth suggests reinforcement of the U.S. military presence in  the Korean peninsula, including redeployment of tactical nuclear  weapons and the fifth contains a tough proposal to launch  limited attacks on the suspected nuclear facilities. The fifth  was exactly what hawkish Republican Senator John McCain had  proposed in a letter to the President late last month. It may  be difficult to get the support of Japan and the Republic of  Korea, who do not in earnest wish to intensify tension in the  Korean peninsula situation, for the fourth and fifth options.    As a result, the report insists on a sixth option, a gradual  withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the ROK. It amounts to an  abandonment of mission and the East Asian stability centered  around the Korean peninsula will be greatly harmed.    The congressional report that dared to mention "abandonment"  as the last option most eloquently reflects the irritation and  the state of running out in countermeasures on the U.S.  Government's part.    Now the situation is heading toward the third option -- UN  imposed sanctions, but President Clinton on his European tour  said: "There is still time to avoid UN sanctions," indicating  his wish to avoid stepping into the unpredictable next phase.    Since its start, the Clinton administration has pursued  diplomacy based on three pillars -- human rights, economic  security, and nuclear nonproliferation. But, the human rights  diplomacy suffered a big setback by extending the  most-favored-nation treatment to China and economic security has  not yielded any conspicuous success. For Clinton's diplomacy,  the last fortress is nuclear nonproliferation for which a talk  is scheduled next spring to negotiate whether the NPT should be  reexamined or unconditionally extended.    There is no guarantee that the DPRK would make a compromise,  even if the U.S. Government succeeded in getting support on  imposing the UN sanctions. It will not be long before President  Clinton has to make a painful decision whether to defend the  last fortress or to pull back.</p>

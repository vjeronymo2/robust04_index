			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Employers' bodies seek one voice THE Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers' Federation yesterday announced a fresh attempt to work together more closely in a move to create stronger and more effective links between industry and the government. The two industrial organisations are commissioning McKinsey and Company, the consultants, to identify ways in which industry can better represent itself. The announcement raised speculation that the study could be the first step in a merger of the two bodies. The federation, and most of its large members, belong to the CBI, but one observer said yesterday: 'It's not a takeover.' The two bodies held exploratory talks in 1991 to identify a basis for greater collaboration but these fell through. To the federation's surprise the CBI then set up its own National Manufacturing Council, with which the federation has been co-operating. With two new heads appointed since 1991 - Mr Howard Davies at the CBI and Mr Neil Johnson at the federation - it was considered sensible to re-examine closer links. The two bodies said: 'We hope this study will lead to a stronger voice for industry, the closest possible collaboration between two leading industrial organisations, and improved services to our members.' McKinsey will start work immediately and is expected to make a preliminary report in June. Officials of the two bodies yesterday described the status of the discussions as preliminary, so it was not possible to say exactly where they would lead. However both are clearly attaching some importance to the study. A steering group has been set up to guide it, made up of Mr Noel Davies, chief executive of VSEL Consortium; Mr Ian Dixon, chairman of Willmott Dixon; Mr Tony Hales, chief executive of Allied Lyons; Sir David Lees, chairman and chief executive of GKN; Mr Graham Mackenzie, chief executive of United Engineering Steels; and Mr Nigel Whittaker, group corporate affairs director at Kingfisher.</p>

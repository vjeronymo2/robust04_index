			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation in the north of Kazakhstan, at  Semirechye, remains extremely tense. This was reported to an  RIA correspondent by Vladimir Naumov, first deputy ataman of the  cossacks' union. According to the information from him, mass  arrests are being made among Cossacks in the Cossack villages of  northern Kazakhstan. Even now the Cossack stanitsas [large  Cossack villages] of Topolovka and Pokatilovo are completely  blockaded by the local OMON [special purpose militia  detachment]. The local authorities are also subjecting  activists of the congress of Russian communities to arrest. In  particular, Boris Soprunyuk, one of the heads of that  organization in Kazakhstan, has been arrested. Standard  accusations are made during the arrest -- either of attempts to  disrupt the unity of the Republic or of a striving to whip up  interethnic strife.    The atamans of a number of the Cossack troops have sent a  message to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. They request him to  use all of his influence to put an end to the lawlessness.</p>

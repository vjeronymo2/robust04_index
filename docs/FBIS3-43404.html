			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] It took a lot of persuading to get the fighting  forces in Mozambique to go to the United Nations assembly points  for disarmament and demobilization, especially, it seems, the  Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] rebels. They finally  began turning up at the camps before Christmas, but apparently  didn't like what they found or did not find, in particular the  poor facilities and the lack of food, water, and clothing. Now,  up to 600 Renamo soldiers are reported to have walked out of the  camps in central Sofala Province. On the line to Maputo, Dan  Isaacs asked Tom Cadel of the UN mission, Unomoz, who is in  charge of the demobilization operation how he responded to the  Renamo complaints.    [Begin recording] [Cadel] Yesterday, we have identified this  problem and it was informed to Renamo delegation. The Renamo  delegation at the Cease-Fire Commission said that they were not  aware of this problem and that it would immediately check and  then take appropriate action.    [Isaacs] Now, this isn't the first time that this has  happened. Renamo soldiers a few weeks ago apparently went on  hunger strike, complaining about the quality or the lack of  food. Do you think that there are real problems getting enough  food to the assembly areas?    [Cadel] I don't think there are any problems at all. There  is a basic agreement between the World Food Program which is  providing food to the assembly areas and the government. Unomoz  offered that in the cases where there are difficulties in  logistics that it could help. At the same time, on Renamo side,  we had proposed, in the additional funding that Unomoz obtained,  to provide some additional items, like dried meat, dried fish,  and salt to Renamo assembly areas.    [Isaacs] And yet there do seem to be problems because Renamo  personnel are walking out of assembly areas. Clearly, they are  upset about something?    [Cadel] My position here at the moment, I am not aware of  the  exact reason, nor Renamo head of delegation yesterday in the  Cease-Fire Commission was able to explain to the commission what  reason could be.    [Isaacs] Now, apart from these problems there do appear to  be  a large number of Renamo and government soldiers arriving in  assembly areas. What are the latest figures on those?    [Cadel] The latest figures are that on the government side,  8,334 soldiers have arrived. On the Renamo side, 4,632, adding  up to a total of 12,966.    [Isaacs] Now, that is quite a large number but it is slower  than the UN had anticipated. Do you think the proposed election  date of October of this year is possible, given those  limitations?    [Cadel] I think from the demobilization point of view,  definitely, it is very well possible. Of course, it depends  here on the inputs from both parties to provide the information  on which people are going to the new army and which people, they  will be demobilized and this can be a fact that it will delay a  little bit, but in the overall planning, technically, we still  have a [word indistinct] of one month spare, we can call it.  So, we are still confident that we can finalize the  demobilization till the end of May.    [Isaacs] And therefore elections are possible in October?    [Cadel] And therefore elections should be possible in  October. [end recording]</p>

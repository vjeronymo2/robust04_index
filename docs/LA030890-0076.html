			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> NEIL RUTMAN AT USC  </P> <P> Not every piano sweepstakes contender makes his way to the glittery A-circuit  of the winners' circuit -- some, like Neil Rutman, do nicely at a sub-stratum.  </P> <P> At his recital Monday night in Hancock Auditorium at USC, the San Francisco  native demonstrated the partial right stuff for either track: a powerful  technique and the concentration for delivering whiz-bang accounts of big  showpieces.  </P> <P> Honoring Donald Crockett of the USC School of Music faculty, Rutman played that  composer's "Pilgrimage," a lively piece animated by staccato chords warring  with dense passagework, percussion with silence. The pianist did much to ensure  its identity as a mildly frantic but nonetheless agreeable soundscape.  </P> <P> He also nodded to the USC "Copland at 90" Festival, playing "Night Thoughts," a  study the venerable composer wrote for the 1973 Van Cliburn Competition. Somber  yet quirky, it has a characteristic spareness that proved a tonic for the  contestant at hand.  </P> <P> Less persuasive was his way with an opening group by Jean-Phillipe Rameau. Here  he created a swath of sound, rather than note-by-note clarity, pedaling heavily  on an instrument already unsuited to Baroque niceties.  </P> <P> Giving full vent to this tendency in the following B-minor Sonata of Liszt,  Rutman mercilessly pounded what was now a tubby, clangorous piano to a nearly  painful din. But he drove the score's melodramatic points home and lavished his  tender all on the dreamy passages, though without much sensuality.  </P> <P> Matters improved with Clara Schumann's Variations on a Theme by Robert  Schumann, which favored controlled, rather than poetic, introspection and pro  forma, rather than wild, exuberance.  </P> <P> In Ravel's "La Valse," one heard the whole gamut of Rutman's musical persona: a  forceful, excited immersion into the physicality of the demands, but a  self-conscious articulation that stopped him from delivering the score all of a  piece.

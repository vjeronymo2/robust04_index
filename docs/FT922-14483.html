			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / The battle to breathe new life into Asda: The problems facing the UK grocery chain Mr Archie Norman, youthful chief executive of Asda, has few illusions about the scale of problems facing the struggling Yorkshire company which forms the UK's fourth biggest grocery chain. 'We are standing in the way of an avalanche,' he says, reflecting on his impressions after three months in the job. 'We will lose Pounds 250m of sales next year to Tesco and Sainsbury and we have to change our business comprehensively.' Mr Phil Cox, the new finance director, chips in: 'In spite of the recent right issue, we have still got borrowings that are uncomfortably high given how we are trading. We are still shipping water at the moment.' Such comments summarise Asda's dilemmas: first, how to prevent the company's financial leakage stemming from its Pounds 650m of debt; and, second, how to develop a long-term trading strategy to ensure survival in the competitive grocery market. It will not be easy, as the fresh-faced team of directors admits. But if they succeed in reviving Asda it will rank as one of the most remarkable turnarounds in UK corporate history. Asda's problems were not created overnight; nor can they be solved within such a timescale. Mr Norman believes it will take three years to stabilise the business and up to five years to achieve real results. After leading the grocery superstore revolution in the 1970s, Asda lost its way in the 1980s and lacked the management capability to create the sophisticated infrastructure to support a modern food retailing operation. The acquisition of 60 Gateway superstores for Pounds 705m in 1989, largely financed by short-term borrowings, precipitated a financial crisis that resulted in a Pounds 357m rights issue rescue last October. The cash infusion eased Asda's financial strains but did not solve them. Mr Cox says Asda cannot trade its way out of its difficulties and suggests the company will have to look for another means of driving down debt. This may come from the proposed flotation of MFI, the debt-ridden private furniture chain in which Asda retains 25 per cent, or the possible sale of Allied Maples, its home furnishings subsidiary, or the Gazeley property business. However, it is difficult to see any ready buyers in current market conditions. Some Asda stores may be sold to competitors although the company is reluctant to strengthen its rivals' hands. Without these options, Asda is likely to make a convertible bond issue. While there is no danger of the company going under, Mr Cox says: 'We have to develop a three-year strategy and we have to find the financial headroom to achieve it.' Such financial flexibility would give Asda a chance to restore the fortunes of its core 206-store chain. Mr Norman believes 100 of Asda's more modern superstores can hold their own, although 50 older outlets are trading poorly. About half a dozen are decribed as 'walking wounded' which will have to be put out of their misery. The Asda team has already taken action to energise its trading fortunes. A price freeze was announced before Christmas to sharpen the company's value-for-money image and Asda claims it is trading at price parity with its rivals, having drifted out of line over the past few years. The product range is also being reviewed, particularly the viability of Asda's extensive homeware and George clothing ranges (designed by George Davies, erstwhile head of Next). Some homeware products may be shed; even if not they are likely to be reconfigured. 'Making people walk into our stores through non-foods gives us a real difficulty,' says Mr Norman. Because of its wide range, Mr Norman says shoppers spend longer in Asda's stores than in rival chains - on average 45 minutes to an hour. He is therefore keen to make the stores pleasant shopping environments. Mr Norman points to human contact with customers at Asda's design-your-own pizza counters as an example of the relationship. The management team stresses that Asda's future lies in returning to its heritage as the provider of the no-nonsense, good-value, weekly family shop. Mr Allan Leighton, the marketing director recruited from Mars, says: 'Asda is an earthy, sensible, traditional, value brand. We have to look to our traditional customers to determine what to do rather than Sainsbury and Tesco.' Asda, in conjunction with McKinsey, the management consultants, is agonising over whether to launch stores at the discount end of the market. A pilot is promised in June with a rapid roll-out should it prove successful. But Asda will have little time to test such formats. Every day exacerbates its position. Analysts already expect Asda to take a write down of perhaps Pounds 100m to Pounds 200m on the value of its Gateway stores. And its assets are being further eroded by competitors' openings near its existing stores. A glimpse of the scale of the threat was provided last week by Mr David Reid, Tesco's finance director, who told a retailing conference in London that his company would open a further 100 stores by 1996, spending more than Pounds 800m a year. Tomorrow Tesco is expected to announce a near-30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 540m. Mr Norman may be clutching at stores but he believes Asda is confronting the problem which will afflict the whole sector by mid-decade: how to increase profits from existing assets. 'We are a microcosm of what is going to happen to the whole grocery industry. Demand growth will now slow and every year more stores will compete head-to-head with each other. We have got to face the problem now because we are not opening any more stores. Our watershed has just come early,' he says.</p>

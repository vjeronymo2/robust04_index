			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Fees for Irradiators <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter indicated that underwater irradiators should not be placed, for fee purposes, in fee Categories 3F and 3G, the same category as ``panoramic'' or ``cell'' type irradiators, because the amount of regulation pertaining to unshielded source irradiators is much greater than that which applies to underwater irradiators. The commenter believes the license should be classified as Category 3E, a self-shielded irradiator. The commenter states that the relative complexity of the two designs dictates that this be the case. Therefore, licensing, inspection, and other NRC activities dealing with underwater irradiators must consume much less time and effort compared to their ``cell'' or ``panoramic'' counterparts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission will continue to place underwater irradiators in fee Categories 3F and 3G. Although the sources are not removed from their shielding for irradiator purposes, underwater irradiators are not self-shielded as are the small irradiators in fee Category 3E. The underwater irradiators are large irradiators and possession limits of thousands of curies are authorized in the license. As a result, more regulatory effort is required to regulate underwater irradiators than is required to regulate the small irridiators in fee Category 3E. For example, the provisions of 10 CFR part 36 apply the same requirements to both the underwater irradiators where the source is not exposed for irradiation and the exposed source irradiators. The average cost of conducting license reviews and performing inspection of the underwater irradiators where the source remains shielded during irradiation are similar to the costs for irradiators where the source is exposed during irradiation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Specific Fee Issues_Part 171  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Exemption From Fees for State-Owned Reactors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters supported the proposed exemption from annual fees for State-owned research reactors. These commenters indicated that the reactors are used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes and contribute significantly to the national research effort and thereby provide significant externalized benefits to society.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC, in this final rule, will amend both &sect;&sect;170.11(a) and 171.11(a)(2) to provide that State-owned research reactors used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes will be exempt from fees. The proposed rule would have amended only 10 CFR part 171. The NRC believes that both of these changes are consistent with the legislative intent of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 that government-owned research reactors be exempt from fees if they meet the technical design criteria of the exemption and are used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Annual Fee for Uranium Recovery Facilities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While supporting the NRC's proposed first-time assessment of a $1.5 million annual fee to the Department of Energy (DOE) for Uranium Mill Tailing Control Act (UMTCA) activities, several commenters strongly objected to the proposed annual fees for uranium recovery licensees. They agree that the NRC should be reimbursed by the collection of reasonable fees commensurate with services provided but indicated that the proposed fees are not equitable or reasonable and have not been implemented in a fair and equitable manner. They believe that the Class I fees for mill licensees are entirely disproportionate to the degree of NRC's involvement with the uranium recovery sites. Commenters indicated that the large increases in fees for FY 1994 (approximately $36,000 per mill) demonstrate again the inconsistent and fluctuating nature of the NRC fee system. These licensees asserted that they have no means of anticipating or budgeting for the fees and therefore large increases are unacceptable. One commenter stated that the NRC's argument that the fees have increased because the initial licensing of Envirocare's 11.e(2) facility is complete is irrelevant and without merit because Envirocare's license is a Class 4D byproduct disposal facility and not a uranium recovery license. Commenters note that while the amount to be recovered from uranium recovery licenses was $465,000 for FY 1993, the amount to be recovered for FY 1994 increased to $2.1 million_a 350 percent increase. Commenters state that regulatory services to the industry have not increased from FY 1993 to FY 1994. Commenters find this situation particularly troubling as they believe the costs for uranium recovery facilities should have decreased with the closure of the Uranium Recovery Field Office (URFO) in Denver, Colorado, which was described by NRC ``as a cost reduction measure to uranium recovery licensees''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter argues that the annual fee of $8,700 for a Category 4D license is not justified when one considers the fee of $94,300 for a mill license, a difference of $85,600. The commenter states that this disparity is so great that it cannot be explained as anything short of arbitrary and capricious. The commenter asserted that to be equitable, Category 4D licenses should be assessed the same fees as a mill in fee Category 2.A.(1), Class I, because commercial byproduct disposal sites are analogous to uranium recovery tailings impoundments and essentially require the same regulatory oversight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter was concerned that the new fees collected from DOE will not be used to decrease the fees placed on other uranium recovery licensees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

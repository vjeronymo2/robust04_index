			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HER WORLD: WHAT'S INN IS SOLITUDE  </P> <P> Wilmington -- and most of Delaware -- had been left behind as my husband and I  drove north toward Pennsylvania that night. Our destination was Mendenhall,  Pa., a hamlet near the state line where we had a reservation.  </P> <P> A cashier at a gasoline station looked blank when we asked directions. But a  customer heard our query and said: "Follow me. I can save you 10 miles."  </P> <P> He left the bright highway and cut west on a curving, pitch-black lane. There  was no moon; only his headlights and ours punched holes in the dark and struck  at the trunks of old trees. The wind began howling. The road dipped downward,  as steep as a toboggan run.  </P> <P> No signs appeared, either for speed or direction. No mail boxes hinted of  habitation. As we raced after the stranger, I remembered that Edgar Allan Poe  wrote some of his horrific tales while living in Pennsylvania. Had he known  these woods?  </P> <P> Finally we came to an intersection. It was Route 52. The local driver rolled  down his window. I cracked mine an inch.  </P> <P> "Sorry if it was scary," he called, "but it does save time. I turn left here.  You turn right." With a wave he disappeared.  </P> <P> Three miles beyond, we came to our destination: the Fairville Inn. It was after  9 p.m., but a porch light was on. The man at the desk of the 1820s house was  kind. He showed us to a parlor with a glowing fire and offered cinnamon tea and  homemade cookies. Life, once again, seemed cozy.  </P> <P> Our room (No. 3) was in the former carriage house, with a fireplace, cathedral  ceiling and high-paned windows. The English country look of Laura Ashley was  apparent in lace-trimmed pillow covers, a snow-white comforter and a billowy  peach canopy over the queen-size bed.  </P> <P> With dawn we peeked out at the rolling fields, woods and ponds of this land  that could be Sussex. We went for a walk before breakfast, passing white board  fences and pastures of sleek horses.  </P> <P> That morning we met Rita Martelli, a cheery woman who bakes for the inn. She  was responsible for the pumpkin and lemon bars, the moist macaroons and crunchy  chocolate-chip cookies that had been served to us at bedtime.  </P> <P> The Fairville Inn is certifiably romantic, a bed and breakfast establishment  that welcomes you warmly and then leaves you alone -- no forced togetherness,  no family tables, no hovering.  </P> <P> Its location on Route 52 is convenient for touring a number of area  attractions, including: the 350-acre Longwood Gardens, at the former country  estate of Pierre S. duPont, near Kennett Square, Pa.; the 200-room American  furniture collection at the Winterthur estate of Henry Francis duPont, and the  Wyeth family art -- as well as other American masters -- at the Brandywine  River Museum in Chadds Ford.  </P> <P> Another winsome hideaway in Pennsylvania is Highland Farms, near Doylestown in  Bucks County. This three-story, 18th-Century home was the country estate of the  Broadway lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II. In its parlor, he wrote the memorable  songs for "Oklahoma!," "Carousel," "The King and I," "South Pacific" and "The  Sound of Music."  </P> <P> I drove up the farm lane at 70 East Road and innkeeper Mary Schnitzer came to  the door. She wore a powder-blue warm-up suit and was in her stocking feet.  </P> <P> "Welcome," she said with a grin. "It's crazy this morning. As soon as our last  guest checked out, we began stripping the music room floor."  </P> <P> Schnitzer and her husband, John, bought Highland Farms four years ago, filled  it with Hammerstein memorabilia and opened it for bed and breakfast. They are  still refurbishing the last of the eight bedrooms.  </P> <P> Stephen Sondheim has been a guest, and James Michener -- whogrew up in  Doylestown -- has stayed in the suite named South Pacific.  </P> <P> Beyond the dove-gray house, with its white pillars and black shutters, is a  grape arbor (where, they say, Henry Fonda was married) and a pen of sheep (who,  reportedly, have come to like beer and pretzels). A tennis court and swimming  pool are artfully hidden on five tidy acres.  </P> <P> My only disappointment with Highland Farms was the fact that I discovered it on  the morning that I had to leave Bucks County for New York City.  </P> <P> Worse, it was the morning after I had stayed -- in tired desperation -- at the  Courthouse Motel in Doylestown, the only vacancy sign in town.  </P> <P> I slept restlessly and with good reason -- the room was not clean, the air  conditioning was noisy, the lights of the Coca-Cola machine shone through the  window, and a woman yelled "rape!" in the night, then burst into laughter as  footsteps pounded by our door.  </P> <P> It was a far cry from the old sweet songs of Rodgers and Hammerstein.  </P> <P> For more information: Fairville Inn, Route 52, Box 219, Mendenhall, Pa. 19357,  (215) 388-5900; Highland Farms, 70 East Road, Doylestown, Pa. 18901, (215)  340-1354.  </P></p>

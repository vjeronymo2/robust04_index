			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Palestinians hedge optimismon Israeli plan THE Palestinian delegation at the Middle East peace talks yesterday described the first detailed Israeli proposals for the future of the occupied Arab territories as 'a very maximalist position'. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, said the tone of the first two rounds of talks with Israel offered some grounds for optimism, but added: 'There are actually more grounds for being very cautious and treading very carefully on terrain that might be a minefield.' She said the most important issue to be addressed was Jewish settlements and human rights in the West Bank and Gaza. She was sharply critical of President George Bush for proposing to give Israel Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees while the construction of 11,000 housing units continued. Describing these units as '11,000 obstacles to peace', Mrs Ashrawi added: 'If the US is rich enough to start distributing billions of dollars, at least it should make sure that these dollars are not used to violate its own policy and to undermine the peace process.' She added that the credibility of the US as an even-handed peace broker could be at stake. Israel is understood to have submitted three documents setting out proposals for the administration of the occupied territories over the next five years. During the final two years of that period it is proposed that negotiations would be held over the final status of the West Bank and Gaza. In line with ideas put forward by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, Israel is proposing the election of a 15-member administrative council to run such activities as health, education, social welfare and transportation. The elections could be held as early as next March or April. Mrs Ashrawi welcomed Israel's acceptance of the need for elections, but said the new government was sticking to the old policy of suggesting elections for administrators and functionaries. 'These are not people to be elected', she said. 'You do not run national elections in order to appoint administrators. You have elections for a representative body which becomes the source of authority and which, in itself, appoints people who are administrators on the basis of merit and ability.' The Palestinians say that there must be 'a meaningful transfer of authority'. In proposals put forward at previous talks in March, the Palestinians sought national elections for a 180-seat legislature and the subsequent appointment of an executive and a judiciary. The negotiations in Washington are scheduled to continue until September 23 and are being held in parallel with talks between Israel and delegations from Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) leader Yassir Arafat yesterday told a UN conference on the Palestinian question in Geneva that American bias in favour of Israel was a 'cause to abort' the US-sponsored peace talks. The PLO is officially excluded from the talks.</p>

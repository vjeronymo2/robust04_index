			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Motoring: Ferrari - The ultimate executive toy CAR MAKERS, keen to let motoring correspondents try their latest products well away from radars and flashing blue lights, often let them loose on private circuits. It is lovely idea, but it sometimes ends with the makers shooting themselves in the foot. A car may ride superbly and have courtly manners on the road. Driven unrealistically hard on a track it can feel blancmange soft, cart-horse clumsy and desperately unhappy. Conversely, one that goes like a dream on a circuit might prove insufferable on a long journey because the tyres would thump and roar badly enough to put dental fillings at risk and make radio listening impossible. To all but fanatical enthusiasts, these things matter. So what does a motoring journalist do? First, hope the new model is to launched in Germany, where much of the autobahn is still free of speed limits though a 130 kph (81 mph) maximum is recommended. Another option, of course, is to enjoy, and then largely forget, a bash round a circuit. A third is to break the law on public roads in the service of one's readers and hope for the best. This I consider no longer acceptable. I am not sure that it ever was acceptable, although all of us did it when roads were less crowded and penalty points had not been invented. But there are exceptions to every rule. The car I sampled in Italy a couple of weeks ago was absolutely wonderful to drive on a private circuit because it was the only place one could possibly begin to appreciate its potential. It was a Ferrari; the new 512 TR coupe developed from the Testarossa. It looked purposeful, even intimidating. Rather like one of those US spy aircraft that fly to the edge of space at twice the speed of sound. On the company's own test track I discovered at last what it was like to drive a Ferrari untroubled by conscience or inhibited by fear of getting caught. While clearly a very close relative of the Testarossa, the 512 TR has been improved in every department. The 12-cylinder 'boxer' (horizontally opposed) engine located behind the seats has been developed to deliver an awe-inspiring 422 horsepower at 6,750 rpm. Yet the clutch is surprisingly light and the ride, on a smooth track at any rate, far less harsh than a Testarossa's. When you give the 512 TR its head and the tachometer needle swings round the dial, the acceleration is not just urgent but violent. The traditional Ferrari exhaust note - a cross between the bellowing of an enraged bull and the sound of a sail splitting - has been muted. Massive catalytic converters needed to make it usable in places like the US and Switzerland are to blame. At the end of the short straight I had to brake hard at about 125 mph (200 kph) for a series of right- and left-hand hand bends ranging from first or second gear hairpins to sweeping third-gear curves. By comparison with Ferrari test driver Dario Benuzzi, who showed me how it should be done in an even fiercer Ferrari F40, I was driving the 512 TR quite gently. He left his braking later than I would have dared, peaking at 135 mph (217 kph) on the straight. And he powered his car through the bends far more quickly and smoothly than I could, steering as much with the throttle as by turning the wheel. Even so, I was able for the first time to appreciate the design and engineering excellence of a Ferrari. Sadly, little of this is revealed on public roads. On the autobahn, I have driven Ferrari Boxer Berlinettas and Testarossas at over 160 mph (260kph). It was exciting, of course, but gave one little idea of the enormous reserves of handling and roadholding - though it did of the braking - so expensively built into these cars. On normal roads full of traffic, I have reckoned Testarossa, which is more than 6 ft (197.6 cm) wide unpleasantly bulky and been bothered by poor all-round visibility from the driving seat. Unless one changed gear with great care, there was a slight crunch every time. The lever still works in a miniature version of the gate found in old Scammell lorries. Before driving the 512 TR I had a look round the nearby Maranello factory. It was an education. I had imagined a cottage industry operation. But since Ferrari was taken over by Fiat four years ago, money by the bucketful has been spent on equipping it with the world's finest machine tools and new production facilities. By any normal business standards, it cannot possibly be economic, because only 4,000 Ferraris are made each year. This is partly to keep the market hungry. But if cars are produced to aerospace tolerances - which Ferraris are - high volumes are neither possible nor desirable. Although control ultimately rests with its Fiat paymasters, Ferrari is left to run its own affairs. Gruppo Fiat clearly sees it as the brightest jewel in its crown. It hopes that its mainstream products - the Cinquecentos and Tempras, Lancia Dedras and Themas, Alfa Romeo 155s and 164s - will bask in Ferrari's reflected glory. All of which begs a crucial question. When one has bought a Ferrari (prices from about Pounds 66,000 for a 3.4 litre V8 Mondial to over Pounds 200,000 for the F40, which is just going out of production) what can one actually do with it? A scarlet Ferrari - the colour chosen by 90 per cent of buyers - stands out like a sore thumb. On the rare occasions one sees a Ferrari on a British motorway it is being driven sedately, mobbed by young sales reps in speeding Ford Escorts and Astra diesel vans. The French autoroutes (130 kph or 81 mph limited) crawl with police. There was a shock for a Ferrari owner unwise enough to drive seriously fast on a Dutch motorway recently. He was mortified to discover the law allowed the court to confiscate his car, sell it and hand the proceeds to the government. Ferrari people privately concede that most of their cars are bought as symbols by men (and very occasionally women) eager to demonstrate their machismo or financial status or both. Rarely, if ever, are they driven in a manner that exploits the qualities so lovingly and expensively built into them. The only way they can legally be let off the leash is through organisations like Britain's 96 Club (11 Gloucester Road, London SW7 4PP). They rent racing circuits on which members can purge their motoring systems of frustration in a glorious, pipe-opening blast. Ferrari recognises that the day may come when supercars like the 512 TR will no longer be road legal. Even so, it plans to replace the F40 with am even wilder dream machine and will launch a new model (not the F40 successor) at Paris Show in October. Still more are in the pipeline. The youthful and charismatic president of Ferrari, Luca di Montezemolo, is confident demand for his cars will continue. 'They are unique . . . and men desire them as they would a beautiful woman,' he told me. And what if they cannot drive them on the road any more? 'Then they will use them on a track. Our strategy will not change,' he said. I am sure he is right. But it does seem a shame that Pounds 130,000 worth of magnificent high speed machinery like a Ferrari 512 TR is really no more than the ultimate executive toy.</p>

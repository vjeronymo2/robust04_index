			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Yesterday NATO members agreed on a plan  to bomb Bosnian Serb targets unless Serbs withdraw heavy weapons  from around Sarajevo or place them under UN control within 10  days. The Canadian Government had opposed air strikes, out of  concern for the safety of its 800 peacekeepers on the ground in  Bosnia. But Prime Minister Jean Chretien said Canada had  changed its position, in order to protect the civilian  population in Sarajevo.    [Begin recording] [Chretien] The Bosnian Serbs have accepted  to see the Canadians replaced by the Dutch before the end of  this month. So, the situation is progressing normally there,  and according to the news that I've heard a few minutes ago the  Serbs have agreed to accept the ultimatum in relation to  Sarajevo. So there will be no need for air strikes, but indeed  we are [as heard] accepted, in order to protect the civilians in  Sarajevo and not to see the repetition of the massacre of the  last weekend. [end recording]    [Announcer] Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Canada's  foreign affairs minister, Andre Ouellet, says a major factor in  Ottawa's reversal against the air strikes was a promise by U.S.  President Bill Clinton. He telephoned Prime Minister Chretien  twice yesterday to give assurances that the U.S. will be very  involved in the process to ensure a peaceful solution to the  conflict.</p>

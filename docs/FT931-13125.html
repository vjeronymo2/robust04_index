			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: GEC Alsthom in talks over German group GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French power and transportation equipment company best known for the TGV high-speed train, has opened preliminary talks aimed at buying Deutsche Waggonbau, the large eastern German railway equipment group. If the negotiations between GEC Alsthom and the Treuhand privatisation agency are successful, GEC Alsthom would gain an important foothold in the German rail equipment market and double the size of its transport division, which had sales of ECU1.41bn (Dollars 1.73bn) in 1991-92 and nearly 17,000 employees. 'We are very interested in DWA,' GEC Alsthom said yesterday. The Anglo-French group makes locomotives and all types of passenger rolling stock, while DWA makes non-powered passenger vehicles, freight wagons, bodies and passenger coach equipment. DWA is one of Europe's largest rail equipment manufacturers and employs more than 16,000 people. It is one of the few enterprises in eastern Germany recording a profit. The company had turnover last year of DM2bn, and achieved a profit of DM20.6m despite being forced to find new markets both in Germany and European Community countries when trade with the countries of eastern Europe virtually collapsed after 1990. Until then, more than 80 per cent of DWA's exports went to east European markets, but now over 40 per cent of its exports are sold to western German and EC markets. GEC Alsthom, owned jointly by GEC of the UK and France's Alcatel Alsthom, does not face tough competition from German companies. The Federal Cartel office has ruled out Siemens or AEG, the most obvious purchasers, from buying DWA. Treuhand officials had recently questioned whether it would be possible to sell off DWA given that it had lost its large Russian market, or whether any foreign company would want such a large concern that could not be easily sold off in separate tranches.</p>

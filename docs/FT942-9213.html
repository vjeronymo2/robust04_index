			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: De La Rue confirms talks with Portals Shares in Portals, the security and specialist paper maker, jumped another 40p to 805p yesterday after De La Rue, the banknote printer, confirmed that the companies were in talks which might lead to an offer for Portals. Neither company would elaborate on the one-line statement, which came after mounting speculation about the identity of a potential bidder. Portals' shares gained 99p on Friday after the group, which also includes environmental protection and control products operations, disclosed that it had received an approach. Market speculation quickly focused on De La Rue, one of Portals' main customers. It has a Pounds 200m cash pile and has made no secret of its intention to make acquisitions. Yesterday its shares closed down 21p at 857p amid market concerns that it might be tempted to pay too much in order to secure the approval of Portals' board, which analysts believe might have to be up to Pounds 10 a share, valuing Portals at about Pounds 650m. The two companies have regular discussions about commercial matters; however, the latest move by De La Rue has taken analysts by surprise. The acquisition of Portals, which controls 50 per cent of the world market for bank note paper, would transform De La Rue into an integrated security paper maker and printer. However, some analysts believe that there are strong commercial reasons against a merger. In particular they fear that Portals' other customers would balk at purchasing paper supplies from a rival. Since Mr Jeremy Marshall, the ex-Hanson man, became chief executive of De La Rue in 1989 profits have quadrupled following a tough programme of disposals, closures and efficiency improvements. Its biggest purchase to date was the Pounds 94.7m acquisition of Inter Innovation, in 1991. See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Acting Chinese  Premier Zhu Rongji today conferred with visiting Australian  Governor-General Bill Hayden on the promotion of Sino-Australian  economic ties and cooperation and other issues of common  interest.    As Chinese Premier Li Peng is abroad on official visits to  four Central Asian countries and Mongolia, Zhu is presiding over  the State Council's work and serving as acting premier.    During the meeting, Zhu recalled his visit to Australia in  1992, saying that since that visit, bilateral relations of  economic and technological cooperation have soundly developed,  high-ranking officials exchanged visits frequently and bilateral  political ties improved further.    He said China and Australia are mutually complementary in  economic structures. Australia produces iron ore and wool, both  of which are largely exported to China. At the same time, the  two countries can cooperate in the deep-processing of  commodities.    As long as Australian products maintain competitiveness and  australia provides China with advanced technology, the prospects  for bilateral cooperation in this regard are broad, he said.    Zhu noted that the joint ventures run by the two countries  in  Australia are successful.    "It is China's hope that efforts should be made not only for  the enhancement of cooperation between the two governments, but  also for the promotion of cooperation between the enterprises of  the two countries," he said.    Hayden said he was deeply impressed by achievements that  China has made in economic construction, adding that Australia  places great importance on its economic relations and trade with  China.    He expressed satisfaction with bilateral trade in the fields  of iron ore and wool and agreed to China's views on giving full  play to their advantages and conducting cooperation in products'  deep- processing.    During the meeting, the two also briefed each other on the  respective countries' domestic economies.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: New faces on the bench - European Court The European Court of Justice has been re-constituted. Six members have retired, one has moved from the post of advocate-general to that of judge, and three new judges and three new advocates-general have been appointed. None of the appointees, announced last week, were women, leaving the Court once again all male. One of the Court's first tasks was the election of its president. Spain's Judge Rodriguez Iglesias was chosen to replace the retiring Judge Ole Due. Judge Rodriguez Iglesias was an academic prior to joining the Court in 1986. The new judges are Antonio La Pergola, Jean-Pierre Puissochet and Gunter Hirsch, together with Claus Gulmann, who moved from advocate-general to judge. The new advocates-general are Georgios Cosmas, Philippe Leger and Michael Elmer. The new appointees come from a variety of legal backgrounds, but all have judicial experience in their own countries. Community preference in the banana market lawful In one of the last judgments of the old Court, the European Union's 'common organisation' (CO) of the banana market was held to be lawful in spite of the preferential treatment given to traditional banana producers from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. The CO banana market was established in 1993. Prior to the CO's formation, member states followed different rules on banana imports. Some states placed restrictions on non-EU or non-ACP bananas, others did not. Germany, in particular, imported bananas from non-ACP sources. Because of structural deficiencies in their markets, EU and ACP bananas were more expensive than those from third countries. The CO set up a quota system under which traditional ACP producers enjoyed duty-free access to the EU market for a specific quantity of bananas. Quotas were also established for bananas from third countries and non-traditional ACP producers. All third-country bananas were subject to import duties, while banana imports from non-traditional ACP producers were liable to duty once the relevant quota had been exhausted. The effect of these changes was to increase the price of bananas in, for instance, Germany. As a result, Germany lodged an application to annul the quota system. Germany alleged that the new system had led to procedural violations. These included the Council of Ministers' adoption of regulations which were contrary to the European Commission's original proposal, without first receiving a modified Commission proposal. The Court ruled the Commission had agreed to a modified proposal being put before the Council; the fact that such an agreement was not in writing was irrelevant. The Court said the EU's legislative process was characterised by an informality which was necessary if a convergence of views was to be achieved between the EU's institutions. However, this approach was not relevant to actions which directly concerned individuals, for which strict rules were necessary. Germany also alleged there had been breaches of the Rome treaty, such as those those relating to the provisions on agriculture as well as the principle of 'non-discrimination' and 'proportionality'. The Court said the agricultural objectives of the Rome treaty had to be seen in the context of the EU market as a whole, not in the context of a single member state. On the issue of non-discrimination, the Court ruled that although the new system treated banana importers differently, such differentiation was inherent in the CO's objective of integrating previously closed national markets. On proportionality, the Court found that although other methods of attaining the same goals could not be ruled out, on the particular issue of the adequacy of the measures taken, the Court could not substitute its views for the Council's. Germany also alleged breaches of the Lome Convention for trade with the third world, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the banana protocol for the EU's overseas territories. None was upheld. C-280/93: Germany v Council, ECJ FC, 5 October 1994.</p>

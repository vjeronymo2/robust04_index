			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Jian: "Trend of U.S. Trade Policy in the </F> 1990s"]    [Excerpts] I believe that the major trend of the  trade policy of the Clinton administration is not protectionist,  although it has a strong protectionist flavor and some  protectionist ingredients in many areas. It should be realized  that there is a difference in principle between the "fair trade"  promoted by the Clinton administration and trade protectionism.  They are absolutely not the same. "Trade protectionism" is to  erect tariff or nontariff barriers on the U.S. market to prevent  foreign goods from entering the market to achieve the goal of  protecting the American domestic market. To promote "fair trade"  is to ask U.S. trade partners to open up their markets to U.S.  goods and provide U.S. goods with an equal opportunity to enter  foreign markets while keeping the U.S. market open for  merchandise from other countries. It seeks to open up the closed  markets of other countries and expand the scope of free trade  instead of sealing up the U.S. market. Therefore, "fair trade,"  the purpose of the trade policy of the Clinton administration,  is definitely not a facade of trade protectionism just like what  some people believe. In essence, it is even closer to the  principle of free trade instead of the principle of trade  protectionism.    When we talk about "fair trade," one of the questions that  we have to answer is: Does the principle of reciprocity  demanded by those who promote "fair trade" run counter to the  basic principle of free trade? Another question is: Since the  United States promotes free trade, should it still follow the  principle of reciprocity? Many theoreticians believe that the  principle of reciprocity is incompatible with the principle of  free trade. Since the Clinton administration emphasizes the  principle of reciprocity (I open up my market to you, you should  also open up your market to me), it has given up the principle  of free trade. I think that this kind of inference is  over-simplified. In general, the principle of reciprocity  emphasized by the Clinton administration in its "fair trade"  policy has not violated the basic principle of free trade. It is  perhaps better to say that this is precisely what free trade is  about. In essence, the principle of reciprocity is the principle  of equality and mutual benefits. It demands that trade partners  on both sides enjoy equal status and equal rights in their trade  activities, and that both sides reap benefits. This is precisely  what free trade demands and stands for. Trade activities cannot  last very long, if they are not built on the basis of equality  and mutual benefits. It is reasonable for a sovereign state such  as the United States to demand that trade partners should share  equal benefits and obligations in doing international trading.  This is not an excessive demand. As far as the contents of its  demands are concerned, they are also not something of a  protectionist nature. Naturally, they also differ from the  completely unconditional free trade policy which the United  States had promoted for a considerably long period after the  War. Relying on its absolutely predominant economic position in  the world between the end of the War and the 1970s, the United  States had implemented an unconditional policy for free trade,  and set the example for other nations in taking the road of free  trade. During this period, the speed and extent of the U.S. open  market had greatly exceeded other nations. The United States had  not strongly demanded that other nations open their markets the  way the United States did, because its products which were  extremely competitive could easily enter and seize the markets  of other nations. What the United States promoted during that  period was a one-way unconditional free trade policy. It is  somewhat of a "preferential" nature. To a considerably great  extent, the United States "tolerated" the unfair trade which  foreign nations imposed on the United States. After the 1970s,  Europe and Japan have rapidly caught up. The U.S. absolute  predominance no longer exists. The United States has lost its  position of strength in carrying out one-way unconditional free  trade policy. Therefore, beginning from the 1980s, it has called  for "free and fair trade," keeping the U.S. market open, while  asking other nations to open up their markets in the same way.  In despite of the fact that the proposal of "fair trade"  signifies the relatively weak U.S. economic position in the  world, it has not weakened to the extent of erecting a trade  barrier and practicing protectionism in an overall manner. The  United States still has the strength to uphold free and open  trade policy. The principle of "reciprocity" stressed by the  Clinton administration means to eliminate, not erect trade  barriers. It is aimed at mutually opening, not closing markets  to each other. What the Clinton administration demands does not  run counter to the principle of free trade. It is a two-way,  conditional free trade policy. In despite of the fact that it is  no longer a totally unconditional free trade policy, it still  falls within the major scope of doing free trade. We should not  brand such policy as protectionist.    The major trend of the trade policy of the Clinton  administration is free trade, not protectionism. Nevertheless,  it is not because Clinton favors free trade, while detesting  protectionism. The objective situation has made him do so. The  objective conditions at home and abroad which have made the  Clinton administration oppose trade protectionism and uphold  free trade are as follows:  <H5>  I. Demand for Global Economic Integration </H5>   Right now, global economic integration has reached a high  degree. The world economy has become an entity of interrelation,  interaction and mutual reliance. A single country cannot  possibly separate itself from the world economy and operate on  its own. A free, open international trading system is an  indispensable condition for the smooth economic operation of the  United States. This is precisely why the United States must  implement a free, open trade policy. The Clinton administration  also clearly understands that trade protectionism is a  double-edged sword, which may harm its trade partners and  finally hurt itself. Protectionism will only escalate the trade  war. As the largest trading nation, the United States will bear  the brunt and suffer the greatest damage when a global trade war  breaks out.  <H3>  II. United States Still Has Economic Strength in Carrying  Out Open Trade Policy </H3>   Under the new world economic situation, the United States  still has the economic strength needed to implement an open  trade policy, despite the rise of Japan and Germany, which has  weakened the U.S. economic position in the world. The U.S.  leading role in world economy and its potential to maintain this  leading role in the foreseeable future constitute the foundation  of the Clinton administration in upholding free trade policy. In  particular, we must point out that the United States possesses  the greatest ability in carrying out scientific research,  developing technology, and blazing new trails in the field of  economy. This is of great significance in an era in which  science and technology constitute the primary productive force.  It is the basic advantage of U.S. economy. It is closely related  with the unique U.S. social and historic conditions (social  diversity, compatibility, openness and mobility). No other  nation has this kind advantage. Right now, the United States is  way ahead of other nations in the world in terms of labor  productivity, which plays an important role in becoming  competitive in world economy. In the global competition for high  technology which affects the future of the world economy, the  United States is also predominant. We should also realize that  the advent of the information society and the post industrial  era has further strengthened, not weakened, the dominant  position of the United States. It has provided the United States  with even more favorable conditions than other nations, because  the present economic competition in the world is one of science  and technology, one of blazing new trails, one of intellectual  resources and qualified and trained personnel. The United States  is strong in all these realms.    From the development of an international trade point of  view, the share of the trade of products (visible trade) drops,  while the trade of services (invisible trade) is rapidly rising.  This situation is compatible with the development of the  information society. The dominant position of the United States  in international competition is more distinct in those fields  which are closely connected with the new technological  revolution, such as the realms of intellectual property rights,  service trades, technical transfer and international  investments. This predominance has demonstrated tremendous  potentials in the 1990s when the era of information society and  soft economy is rapidly approaching. This is precisely what the  Clinton administration keeps in mind and expects in upholding  its free trade policy.  <H3>  III. The United States Has Improved Its Situation in Foreign  Trade; It Is Not Weak or Uncompetitive. </H3>  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |U.S. Foreign Trade Situation in Past Decade                               |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Items         |Total Volume  |Total Volume  |Deficit in Fo-|Share Deficit |  |              |of Imports    |of Exports    |reign Trade   |in GDP        |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year          |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1983          |2017          |2689          |671           |1.9 percent   |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1984          |2199          |3324          |1142          |3 percent     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1985          |2159          |3380          |1221          |3 percent     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1986          |2233          |3684          |1450          |3.4 percent   |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1987          |2502          |4097          |1596          |3.5 percent   |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1988          |3202          |4471          |1270          |2.6 percent   |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1989          |3617          |4774          |1157          |2.2 percent   |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1990          |3887          |4976          |1089          |2 percent     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991          |4160          |4897          |734           |1.3 percent   |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992          |5325          |4482          |843           |1.3 percent   |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source of reference: Economic Indicators January 1993                     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Many theoreticians regard the tremendous amount of trade  deficit that the United States had since the 1980s as important  evidence for the inevitable protectionist trend in formulating  its foreign trade policy. Their deduction is that the tremendous  amount of trade deficit totaling tens or hundreds of billion  U.S. dollars shows the increasingly deteriorating U.S. situation  in foreign trade and its weakness in meeting world competition  and that only by relying on this "straw" of protectionism, will  it be possible to reverse this trend. Is this deduction correct?  It will be very clear if we earnestly and realistically analyze  the actual situation in U.S. foreign trade during the past  decade.    From the aforementioned reference material, we realize that  in the mid-1980's the U.S. foreign trade situation had seriously  deteriorated with the trade deficit rapidly increasing. The  trade deficit reached a peak of $159.6 billion in 1987. The U.S.  foreign trade situation has improved since 1988 with its rate of  growth in exports increasing, the rate of growth in imports  decreasing, and its trade deficit continuously dropping with the  exception of one single year. (The trade deficit in 1992 was  greater than that in 1991, mainly because the economic  depression in Japan and Germany had affected U.S. exports.) The  share of its trade deficit in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  decreased every year. The actual situation indicates that the  U.S. foreign trade situation has improved, not deteriorated,  since the late 1980s. Despite the fact that its trade deficit  still amounts to tens of billions of U.S. dollars in recent  years, it only accounts for 1.3 percent of its GDP. With its  huge GDP which exceeds $6,000 billion, the United States is  still able to withstand such a trade deficit. From this, we can  see the kind of arguments saying that the situation in U.S.  trade is deteriorating in each passing day, that the United  States is too weak in foreign trade to meet world competition  and that only by relying on protectionism can it manage to  support itself, are unrealistic. In fact, the U.S. situation in  foreign trade confronting the Clinton administration is less  grim than that during the days of the Reagan and Bush  administrations. Therefore, there is no need to risk everything  and implement the extreme policy of trade protectionism which  may play the role of a double-edged sword.    It is precisely this kind of objective economic situation  that decides the orientation of the foreign trade policy of the  Clinton administration, makes the administration follow general  trends of free trade, and prevents it from taking the wrong road  of trade protectionism in despite of the fact that the Clinton  administration exhibits a more distinctive protectionist color  than the Bush administration.    By analyzing all aspects in breadth and depth, we have  studied the nature and the basic trend of the trade policy of  the Clinton administration. Our conclusion is that instead of  being protectionist, the trade policy of the Clinton  administration closely follows the basic principle of free  trade. There is a difference in principle between protectionism  and the "fair trade" which is the purpose of the trade policy of  the Clinton administration. The trade policy of the Clinton  administration is closer to the principle of free trade than  that of protectionism. We like to point out that we are only  talking about the basic nature and the major trend of the trade  policy of the Clinton administration. We do not want to deny the  fact that such trade policy is imbued with protectionist  ingredients. In fact, the trade policy of the Clinton  administration is tainted with a deep protectionist color and  composed of many protectionist components. These protectionist  components are mainly manifested as follows:    The Clinton administration seems to make more direct  protectionist means to deal with the "unfair trade actions" of  its trade partners. For example, its "war of steel" with Japan  and the European Community was an action it took to greatly  increase its import duties to sanction their dumping activities.  It also tried to increase its government subsidy to wage an  "aircraft war" with the European Economic Community.  Particularly it had time and again talked about its intention to  even more strictly implement its "quota system for imports,"  asked its trade partners to exercise "self-restraint" and  imposed excessively high sanitary and environmental standards on  them. All these are typical trade protectionist measures,  because all of them are used to prevent and restrict foreign  goods from entering the U.S. market.    Therefore, when we say that the major trend of Clinton's  trade policy upholds free trade, we absolutely do not imply that  it has no protectionist ingredients at all. To deny or cover up  this "negative" aspect of the trade policy of the Clinton  administration is an equally unrealistic analysis. In short, we  must, on the one hand, understand that the basic nature and  major trend of the trade policy of the Clinton administration  follows the principle of free trade, while on the other hand we  must also realize that such policy of the Clinton administration  is tainted with more protectionist color and composed of more  protectionist ingredients, and that it adopts an even more  uncompromising stand in foreign trade. From an overall point of  view, the Clinton administration may uphold the free trade  policy under general conditions. In certain realms (such as  automobile, textile and steel industries) and under certain  conditions (especially conditions which will deeply affect labor  employment), it may also adopt some protectionist measures. Only  by seeing these two aspects of the trade policy of the Clinton  administration and realizing that such policy has dual  characteristics (naturally one is primary, while the other  secondary), will it be possible for us to completely and  accurately understand the trend of U.S. trade policy in the  1990s.

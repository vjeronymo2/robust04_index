			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Lin Hongmei (2651 4767 2734)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 29 May (XINHUA) -- Since its implementation  seven years ago, the nationwide bumper harvest projects for  agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry have  succeeded in introducing a great number of scientific and  technological achievements and advanced, workable skills to  agricultural production, bringing about not only a more  bountiful farm products market but also substantial incomes  among the vast number of peasants.    According to information provided by the Agriculture  Ministry's Bumper Harvest Projects Office, currently grain,  cotton, and oil-bearing crops cultivated with the new skills  promoted under the bumper harvest projects have reached 1  billion mu in total acreage. Grain production for the past seven  years has increased by 23.8 billion kg, ginned cotton by 556  million kg, oil-bearing crops by 2.3 billion kg, sugar crops by  7.5 billion kg, vegetables and fruits by 1.8 billion kg; meats,  poultry, and eggs by 620 million kg; aquatic products by 400  million kg, and milk by 28 million kg, with the increase in the  output value of these products totalling 26.8 billion yuan.    The nationwide bumper harvest projects for agriculture,  animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry -- which were jointly  initiated and promoted by the Agriculture and Finance Ministries  in 1987 with all-out participation by 30 provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions throughout the country --  have thus far promoted 147 new technological items, including  new, good crop varieties; new, good poultry and livestock  breeds; dry-land farming; simulated agricultural cultivation;  water-conserving cultivation; cultivation using plastic  sheeting; horticulture; improvements in fertilizer formulas;  comprehensive crop disease, pest, weed, and rat control; straw  ammoniation; feed and additive formula improvements; high-yield  aquatic breeding; fresh-keeping, storage, transportation, and  processing of farm products; agricultural mechanization in  cultivation and breeding; and rural energy development. Backed  by special funds and pushed hard by government actions, these  new technologies have been promoted rapidly at the agricultural  production level and have had huge benefits. The 20 projects  implemented last year under the nationwide bumper harvest  projects for agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, and  forestry have resulted in an increase of 1.98 billion kg in  grain production, 47.6 million kg in ginned cotton, and 179  million kg in oil-bearing crops -- respectively 23 percent, 3.3  percent, and 20 percent more than the planned targets -- and an  increase of 3.74 billion yuan in output value. Practice has  shown that bumper harvest projects have turned out to be an  important means in speeding up the transformation of China's  agricultural scientific and technological achievements, in  guaranteeing its agricultural production, and in promoting the  development of rural productivity.    The bumper harvest projects have been a major state plan in  enhancing the level of rural productivity. For the past seven  years, a total of 16.5 billion yuan have been invested in the  project, of which 180 million yuan were state revenues, while  the remainder were made up of local funds and loans. The state  has specifically formulated a guiding group for the projects.  In attaching importance to their implementation, governments at  provincial, prefectural, and county levels have adopted a  contract management system to ensure success. Last year, 197  first-tier contracts were signed between the Agriculture  Ministry and various provinces, regions, cities, and cities with  provincial-level economic powers, while 950 second-tier  agreements were entered into between provinces and counties,  with personnel being designated at each and every level to  guarantee the successful promotion of all new skills at the  peasants' level.    Through explorations and summing up amid practice, the  bumper  harvest projects have developed an effective, regulated, and  institutionalized management pattern of their own. From the  very outset, the nationwide bumper harvest projects have adopted  a competitive mechanism by singling out for promotion scientific  and technological achievements which have a bearing on the  national economy and the people's livelihood and which are  capable of enhancing the economic results of China's  agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries industries, as well  as of stimulating the development of the three aforementioned  industries. In the course of their implementation, project  contracting units must present periodical progress reports to  parties offering such contracts. Before a project is concluded,  all interested parties will undertake the appraisal and summing  up process according to project and contract requirements.  Circulating funds handed down together with appropriations are  to be utilized on a rolling basis, under which repayments must  be made in time. Defaults in repayment may result in the  suspension of appropriations for the next project. These rigid  management rules have provided a new say to better manage  China's agricultural funds under market economic conditions.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Societies call off merger in conflict over styles: Leeds Permanent and N&amp;P union fails at eleventh hour THE Leeds Permanent and the National &amp; Provincial building societies yesterday called off their attempt to create the biggest ever society merger after discovering a clash of management styles. The decision, which follows two months of negotiations, is a significant setback for attempts by medium-sized societies to join forces to challenge the dominance of banks and life insurance companies in retail financial services. The merger was called off only days before the managements of both societies were due to present a joint business plan to their boards. The plan's abandonment means there are now uncertainties over the direction of several of the 10 largest societies. The planned merger, announced in August, would have created the third largest society, behind Nationwide and Halifax. It would have combined the Pounds 18.3bn assets of Leeds, the fifth largest, with the Pounds 12bn of N&amp;P, the eighth largest. The seriousness of the division over management style was shown by the fact that the merger foundered in spite of agreement over many difficult issues, including the name, a head office and who would become chief executive of the merged society. The two societies said in a joint statement that they had decided not to try to reconcile their two 'distinct approaches' to business, and that the proposal would not be put to the societies' members for approval. Mr Malcolm Barr, Leeds chairman, and Mr Richard Newton, N&amp;P chairman, said they thought it would be too difficult to combine the different cultures, on top of the efforts needed to bring together two complex businesses. Leeds is seen in the industry as having a more traditional and hierarchical management structure, while N&amp;P has adopted an approach which is based more on teamwork, and emphasises a focus on the customer rather than on the product. Mr David O'Brien, who has led this management approach as chief executive of N&amp;P, would have been chief executive of the merged society, and some senior managers of Leeds were thought to have expressed unease at his appointment. Mr O'Brien said full agreement would have been needed to bring about the merger's benefits including a planned loss of 1,600 jobs. 'If you do not have that, you compromise the ultimate success of the merger,' he said Mr O'Brien's redesign of the management structure at N&amp;P since he became chief executive in 1990 has produced a sharp reduction in the number of management grades. Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS, said that although the societies would be denied the added strength they would have derived from being larger, they were both still 'very strong' and could prosper alone. The Leeds will be under pressure to act swiftly to end uncertainty over who will be in charge, either by confirming the appointment of Mr Roger Boyes, acting chief executive, or by appointing a new candidate from outside. Apart from Leeds and N&amp;P, there has also been speculation over whether Bristol &amp; West, the tenth largest society, will seek a merger. Its former chief executive, Mr Tony FitzSimons, departed abruptly a month ago. Lex, Page 18</p>

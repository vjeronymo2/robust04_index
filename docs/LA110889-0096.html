			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> More Indictments Expected in Futures Probe: Federal prosecutors said they will  charge more traders from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Swiss franc futures  pit as a result of the government's probe of illegal trading. Prosecutors said  in August that their undercover probe of the Chicago Board of Trade and the  Chicago Mercantile Exchange would spread beyond the 45 traders and one clerk  initially charged with racketeering, fraud and violating commodity laws. A  defense attorney representing some of the defendants in the case said he  expected four to six more traders from the Swiss franc pit would be charged.  </P></p>

One of the first decisions made today by acting Prime  Minister Matinchev is connected with a personnel change. Mr.  Bakov, who until now has been in charge of the Council of  Ministers General Office, has been relieved of his post and  replaced by Dimitur Khristov, who previously served as an  official in the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price fall forces cut by biggest platinum producer RUSTENBURG PLATINUM, the world's largest producer, yesterday sent a strong distress message to the market by announcing its first production cut in 12 years. Rustenburg said the Boschfontein trackless mining shaft would be closed 'because the current low level of platinum and rhodium prices has rendered production from Boschfontein uneconomic'. The announcement adds that at current price levels it is cheaper to purchase metal in the market than to mine it. Apart from seeking to protect its financial position - a fall in interim profits recently forced a cut in the dividend - Rustenburg is clearly trying to restore some stability to a market that has been volatile and depressed in recent months. It is also seeking to convince customers that the financial health of the industry requires higher prices. The effect of the production cut is that Rustenburg's contractual commitments will be greater than its reduced level of production. The group will be purchasing metal from the market to make good the shortfall. Although Rustenburg did not detail the extent of the cut, analysts estimated that it would be about 10-15 per cent of annual production of 1.4m troy ounces. The announcement follows a sharp weakening recently in platinum group metal prices that placed severe strain on South African producers, which account for about two-thirds of world production. The cut at Rustenburg will probably be a little less than the production coming on stream in the second half of the year from PPRust, the new producer in the Johannesburg Consolidated Investments group. Rustenburg is also in the JCI group. From the group point of view expensive production is being replaced by cheaper production as PPRust is lower down the cost curve than Rustenburg. Rustenburg and Impala, the second largest producer, were last forced to announce production cuts owing to weak markets in 1981. Production was then cut by 15-20 per cent, and it took the industry about four years to return to prior production levels.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / The Markets: Productivity and pay - Economic Eye The chancellor of the exchequer does it; industrial leaders do it; even striking signalmen do it. What do they do? They all argue that people should be rewarded for increased productivity. Can they all be wrong? Yes, they can. Under Kenneth Clarke's pay policy for the public sector, pay can rise only if financed by higher productivity. Now the British travelling public finds itself deeply inconvenienced by arguments over what this means, with the signalmen insisting that they are owed money for having accepted new technology and working practices. This consensus that pay should be linked to productivity is not a harmless cliche. It is a damaging mistake. Suppose an employer invests in a powerful new machine. Why should he pay more merely because output per worker has risen? If he were to summon the courage to lay off his redundant workers, why should he have to increase the pay of those who stay? To do so is merely to reward workers for creating inefficient work practices. There is only one good reason for a company to reward higher productivity: if the increased pay is both incentive and reward for more effort. Otherwise, employers should pay people as market conditions dictate. 'Market, plus motivation' is the right slogan, not 'more productivity, higher pay'. Kind-hearted people will object that it would be unfair not to reward workers for producing more. In fact, it would be quite unfair to do so. Output per person in UK manufacturing rose by almost 70 per cent between 1979 and 1993 (see chart). But real wages in manufacturing rose 'only' 42 per cent. Meanwhile, output per person in the whole economy rose a little less than 30 per cent, while real wages rose 36 per cent. Thus real wages in manufacturing have lagged well behind increases in sectoral productivity, overall real wages have risen a little more than overall productivity and real wages in manufacturing have risen only a little faster than in the whole economy. Sectoral productivity has, it turns out, not been linked closely to sectoral pay. Rightly so, since it would be ridiculous for the pay of electricians in motor-car plants to rise faster than that of those in hospitals. People of a given level of skill and motivation should be paid roughly the same, wherever they work. The alternative would indeed be unfair. It would also be inefficient, with too few people employed in dynamic, high-paying industries. Companies appear to have ignored the nonsense about linking pay to productivity in each activity. Meanwhile, real earnings in the economy have risen roughly in line with overall productivity, as they should. So is there a problem? Unfortunately, there are two. First, there have been large increases in pay inequality in the UK, as in the US, during the 1980s. A recent report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies notes that most of the increased inequality has reflected increased variability in the wages of people with similar education and experience.* The likely explanation is that workers have shared in the 'excess' profits of more dynamic companies, at the expense of the shareholders of such companies, and their growth. Second, even if industry-specific productivity growth has not, in the event, been matched by higher wages, the attempt to achieve this objective risks higher inflation, higher unemployment, or both. Suppose dynamic companies do share excess profits with their workers. Labour market competition and bargaining over pay relativities will then induce employers in less dynamic activities both to pay more and to employ fewer people. If governments respond to higher unemployment with monetary laxity, an inflationary spiral will ensue. If they respond to higher prices with deflation, the result will be rising unemployment. This will cease only when the pressure of the unemployed halts the undue rise in real wages. In the long run, overall labour-productivity growth cannot be lower than that of real wages, without there being a profits collapse. If company-specific productivity bargaining does push up overall real wages, productivity growth will tend to rise, as less productive workers are pushed out of the labour force and more capital-intensive techniques are used. The rate of productivity growth will then be too fast, a fact shown in rising unemployment. That is precisely what has been happening in the UK since the late-1970s. Productivity has been growing too swiftly, largely in response to excessive increases in real wages. Real wages have risen too fast partly because employers who can afford to pay more have felt obliged to do so, while the laggards have felt compelled to match them. One answer is pay co-ordination around a 'going rate' that reflects an inflation objective and the increase in real wages consistent with full employment. The alternative is a truly competitive labour market. Employers would then pay their workers no more than needed to keep and motivate them. They would not lay off redundant workers and then pay those who remain more, just because they are more 'productive'. They would, instead, lay off redundant workers and refuse to pay those who remain any more. Thereupon, it would become profitable for them to employ additional people. British employers have, in short, failed to grind the faces of their workers. They have been too soft, at the expense of the unemployed. * What has happened to wages?

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: COUNTY IS DOING ITS PART FOR LEGISLATIVE DRIVING  </P> <P> It's often said that San Diego County doesn't count for much in the state  Legislature.  </P> <P> A crass canard, that. A libel upon our dedicated public servants.  </P> <P> Just look at the list of fancy cars leased by the state so legislators can  cruise in style while pondering which health and education programs to slash in  these lean times.  </P> <P> The most expensive car in the state Senate is the 1990 Lincoln Towne Car leased  for Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Bonita), valued at $30,811.  </P> <P> The most expensive car in the Assembly is the 1989 Cadillac Allante leased for  Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), valued at $44,530.  </P> <P> No local angle with Brown, you say. Oh ye of little faith.  </P> <P> Brown's Cadillac, the sporty Mercedes-like model, is leased from De la Fuente  Cadillac of El Cajon, owned by Brown's political friend Roque de la Fuente.  When De la Fuente opened his business park in Otay Mesa, Brown was an honored  guest.  </P> <P> The state pays the maximum allowable under legislative rules: $446.50 a month  for Deddeh's Lincoln, $400 for Brown's Caddie. Insurance is also provided.  </P> <P> (Since the leases exceed the state maximum, Deddeh pays another $347.49 a month  from his own pocket, and Brown pays $668.83.)  </P> <P> Deddeh said the Lincoln is strictly for safety.  </P> <P> "I want something very heavy, because I drive a lot on the freeway," Deddeh  told The Times' Ralph Frammolino.  </P> <P> He said he drives 18,000 to 22,000 a miles a year, mostly around his district  on weekends: "The only time it is non-business is when I go to church or go to  the grocery, and, even then, someone stops me and asks about a piece of  legislation."  </P> <P> About half of the legislators take the maximum car allowance.  </P> <P> One who doesn't is Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside). It costs the state a  crummy $200 a month to lease a 1985 Oldsmobile for Craven.  </P> <P> Maybe the roads in North County are less dangerous than those in South Bay.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Lawyer's Revenge  </P> <P> The practice of law and other things.  </P> <P> * San Diego defense attorney Charles Sevilla is already working on a sequel to  his satiric novel, "Wilkes: His Life and Crimes."  </P> <P> In the new effort, a judge gets bumped off, and Sevilla's anti-hero, defense  attorney John Wilkes, is an obvious suspect.  </P> <P> Only the cops are too dumb to realize it.  </P> <P> * Tall story.  </P> <P> NBA stars are coming to San Diego for a benefit game next Tuesday at the Sports  Arena. The waterfront San Diego Marriott is playing host and providing a  hospitality suite.  </P> <P> Then somebody discovered that the luxury suite has a very low ceiling. That  could be a problem for a bunch of giants.  </P> <P> A new suite has now been found. The view isn't as good, but the ceiling is a  regulation 10 feet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> To the Winner, the Spoils  </P> <P> That was then, this is now.  </P> <P> During last year's City Council election, Linda Bernhardt sent out a mailer  blasting Ed Struiksma for taking contributions from, among others in the  building industry, executives of the La Jolla development firm Oliver/McMillan:  </P> <P> "Over the past eight years, Ed Struiksma has sold our district to the highest  bidders."  </P> <P> Since her victory, Bernhardt has been hustling to reduce a $155,000 campaign  debt.  </P> <P> Disclosure forms filed last week show that Bernhardt received post-election  contributions from, among others in the building industry, executives of  Oliver/McMillan.  </P> <P> The firm also hosted a Bernhardt fund-raiser.  </P> <P> The debt is now down to $90,000. And Bernhardt just sent a letter to previous  contributors (and their spouses) asking for more money and pledging fealty:  </P> <P> "Please make a contribution to the campaign deficit. Be assured that I will do  everything in my power to continue to serve you in the best possible way."  </P></p>

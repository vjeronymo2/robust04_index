			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Defence issue fails to heat the debate 'I DON'T know why they did not say more about defence,' said a puzzled French naval officer after a two-hour rally in Vincennes, east of Paris, on Monday night. Speakers including ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and other pro-Maastricht UDF leaders mentioned not a word about the treaty's provisions for common European defence. Defence has, indeed, been the dog that did not bark in the referendum campaign. Last year France fought successfully, chiefly against the Atlanticist UK and Dutch governments, to include language in the treaty which could presage the eventual replacement of Nato by the Western European Union (WEU), as the military arm of the European Community. Yet, come the referendum, this diplomatic success seems to have neither added to the Yes camp nor detracted from the No forces. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, tried to kick the issue into life with a speech to France's defence college, lauding the Maastricht treaty as 'an additional guarantee for lasting peace'. His defence minister, Mr Pierre Joxe, followed up with a Le Figaro article in which he warned that a No to Maastricht 'would clearly halt the dynamic' towards closer European military collaboration. But the word security in the French referendum campaign has tended to become diffused in more immediate concerns such as police security against the spread of the Mafia in a frontierless Europe. Where it has taken on a more concrete military meaning, it has become identified with the Community's failure to send sufficient forces to pull warring former Yugoslavs apart. The theme of Maastricht as keeper of the peace is easily satirised. 'Is it really likely that Germany will take back Alsace and Lorraine, Britain reoccupy the Guyenne, Italy the region of Nice or even Luxembourg Thionville?,' wrote ex-General Pierre Gallois, once one of France's leading nuclear theoreticians and a staunch Maastricht opponent, in Le Figaro last week. But the debate has been a sideshow. Few seem to care much one way or another about Maastricht's defence provisions. A rejection of Maastricht would prompt two possible conclusions. Either, the French electorate is not as anti-American in security matters as many of its leaders have assumed. Or, these very leaders will have made an historic mistake, comparable to France's rejection in 1954 of the European Defence Community.</p>

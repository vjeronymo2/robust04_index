			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: RBoS profit-taking The market appeared to have lost its affection for Royal Bank of Scotland. Neither a 25 per cent dividend increase nor a doubling of profits was able to help the share price. Both the dividend of 13.75p and the profits of Pounds 532m were at the top of the range of analysts estimates. Nevertheless, the feeling that earnings from RBoS's insurance arm Direct Line were about to peak saw the shares fall 20 to 400p. Credit Lyonnais Laing, the leading supporter of the stock, maintained its comparatively high Pounds 635m profits forecast for the current year and said 'long term buying from the quality funds' had been offset by short term trading. It added that, as the stock was the most volatile in the sector, it was historically the most affected by broad market moves. Detractors said the bank's premium rating could only be maintained if Direct Line continued to grow. Mr Rod Barrett of Goldman, who held his current forecast at Pounds 595m, said: 'Underlying growth out there is not happening.' Some added that operating profits were disappointing and a large property revaluation had not been addressed. The market was disappointed with the net asset valuation from property group MEPC, which reported full-year profits in line with expectations. The shares retreated 18 to 385p as analysts downgraded nav figures for the current year. James Capel cut its nav forecast by 40p to 500p, citing the lack of significant rental growth and continued high real interest rates. However, the broker has moved its recommendation to a hold from a sell. Sentiment in MEPC spread to Hammerson and the shares fell 12 to 314p, and British Land gave up 8 to 357p. Land Securities tumbled 16 to 576p. Plumbing specialist Spring Ram was the day's most active stock with 29m shares - 8 per cent of the equity - traded. The heavy volume rekindled the inevitable speculation that former chairman Mr Bill Rooney had disposed of part of his 13.5 per cent stake in the company. The shares remained at 44p An upbeat interim statement boosted plasterboard specialist BPB Industries by 2 to 295p and led to a modest amount of profits upgrading by analysts. UBS edged ahead by Pounds 5m to Pounds 155m for this year and translated BPB's commitment to a 'progressive' dividend policy into a total 1994-95 payout of 9p, up from 8.1p last time. Elsewhere among building materials shares, Anglian tumbled 25 to 175p on the back of weak interim earnings and a warning of lower full-year profits. There was a mixed reaction to full-year figures from food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan which brought heavy turnover of 14m as the shares closed 5 lower at 378p. Rank Organisation was among a handful that managed to resist the poor market trend. It edged up a half-penny to 412 1/2 p in trade of 4.3m, with a line of about 1m shares said to have been switched from Granada Group into Rank as part of programme trading executed on Wednesday evening. A further boost to sentiment came when Kleinwort Benson reiterated its positive stance on the stock. Mr Paul Slattery at the securities house believes: 'The prospects for earnings growth at Rank are double the level for the market.' Granada receded 11 1/2 to 510p as uncertainty over the value of its stake in broadcaster BSkyB continued to overhang sentiment. Food manufacturer United Biscuits eased only a penny to 316p, after NatWest Securities advised investors to 'add' to holdings. The securities house said: 'There are early signs that the measures to improve the group's competitive position are beginning to pay off.' Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson improved 8 to 481p in response to its purchase of a 20 per cent stake in LaSalle Partners, of Chicago. Singer &amp; Friedlander saw 16m shares traded after institutional investors bought into the diversified group following the acquisition of broker Carnegie. Broker BZW argued that the deal was a 'fairly significant enhancement of earnings'. The shares hardened a penny to 84p. Health care group AAH fell 48 to 336p after a drop in interim profits and a projection of a decline in full-year results. Buyers of utilities continued to chase the regional electricity companies and water stocks, helping several resist the market slide. Eastern gained 3 at 805p and Scottish Power, which announced a new chief executive, finished 4 ahead at 357p. The market had discounted the favourable figures and 21 per cent dividend increase from Seeboard. The shares ended a penny easier at 424p, with Yamaichi advising investors to switch into Yorkshire, 5 up at 513p, and Southern, a penny down at 555p. Engineering group GKN was one of the few Footsie stocks to finish up on the day, gaining 2 1/2 at 626p in modest 1.2m turnover. There was said to be switching out of troubled T&amp;N, down a further 6 at 160p. APV put on 3 at 64p, with the market starting to anticipate the long awaited restructuring package. Control Techniques rose 7 to 521p following a bid of 525p a share from US group Emerson, which moved into the market to boost its stake in the company to 37.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russia's Choice faction has doubts in terms of  the signing of the agreement on civic accord. At the special  meeting on Tuesday the faction discussed the draft statement  which says that on April 25 the president's administration  agreed to groundless concessions to the separatist tendancies of  regional elites, by excluding from the text the unconditional  priority of the Constitution of the Russian Federation over the  constitutions of the Federation's constituent members. In view  of this, the faction said that this violated the will of the  people of Russia who voted on December 12, 1993 for the  Constitution of the Russian Federation. The statement says that  the faction can sign the treaty without the above changes.    Faction members have proposed several wordings. Deputy Gleb  Yakunin proposed to recommend that the Russian president  postpone the signing ceremony before the treaty's text is fully  coordinated.    The faction will make the final decision on the signing  before its morning meeting on Wednesday.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EL TORITO'S CEO RESPONDS  </P> <P> I enjoyed your article, "Consistency Links Restaurant Chains" (by Max Jacobson,  Calendar June 17). I appreciate your selection of El Torito as one of the five  restaurants you visited.  </P> <P> There are a couple of corrections I would like to bring to your attention,  however, just for the record.  </P> <P> The first El Torito opened in 1954 in Encino, and we were acquired by W.R.  Grace in late 1976. In 1986, we again became a privately owned company. In  addition, earlier this year we switched to cooking with 100% vegetable oil,  which means no "heavily larded beans."  </P> <P> I thought your assessment of the various chains was accurate and fairly done.  However, your statement in the opening paragraph, (that) the "big companies are  so successful that they couldn't care less," isn't true. I would like to assure  you that we do care; providing our guests with the best in service, food and  ambience has been our primary objective for 36 years.  </P> <P> MARTIN M. CASEY  </P> <P> President and chief executive officer  </P> <P> El Torito Restaurants Inc.  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

This was  Anatoliy Chubays' comment at a Goskomimushchestvo [State  Committee for the Management of State Property] collegium  session on Moscow's intention to do away with voucher  privatization. The last of the reformers promised to protect  Muscovites from the capital's government. In his opinion,  Goskomimushchestvo has enough levers of power to exhibit  Moscow's largest and most attractive enterprises at the  forthcoming check auctions. Otherwise the authorities will have  to explain themselves to the president.    The collegium spent the entire session in optimistic mood,  anticipating a quick finish to voucher denationalization of the  state economy. Goskomimushchestvo Deputy Chairman Dmitriy  Vasilyev reported that 900 enterprises a month are being sold  off for vouchers at auction. Which means that before 1 July  another 4,500 firms will go under the hammer and we will be able  to kiss good-bye to the state sector altogether.    Perhaps the most absorbing question for everyone at the  collegium was this: Where have all the vouchers gotten to? A  group of directors from Tula is thoroughly exasperated by the  local citizens who have absolutely no desire to surrender their  checks to state enterprises.    Such is life! It seems the vouchers have sailed away to  other, more distant climes. One of the bosses of "Alfa-Kapital"  frankly confessed in his speech to the collegium that there are  almost 1 million vouchers lying in his storage vaults! Other  speakers calculated that the largest commercial structures have  relieved people of more than 20 million vouchers alone, and  approximately 900 check and investment funds of various kinds  popped up in 1993.    However, "Alfa-Kapital" may appositely be compared to a big  and hypertrophied version of Plyushkin [miser in Gogol's "Dead  Souls"], hiding its vouchers in barns and lumber rooms.  Businessmen are currently backing these structures in order to  tap into the tastiest industrial morsels that will soon be up  for grabs.    Herein, basically, lies all the tension of the present  moment: Who will get their hands on the state property? The  refashioning of the state sector is almost over: Sector chiefs  and Moscow mandarins are about to be deprived of their strongest  authority -- the right to manage real estate. This authority is  about to be transferred to independent commercial capital.</p>

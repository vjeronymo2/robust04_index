			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> To that end, the third draft incorporates various of the comments received through the earlier notice process and the public forums, as well as those received from individual members of ITS AMERICA, a broad-based, non-profit organization that also serves as a utilized Federal Advisory Committee under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 2). ITS AMERICA will also be distributing copies of the Plan to its membership and preparing consensus comments on the Plan; therefore, member comments to ITS AMERICA need not be duplicated in comments to the DOT docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Plan is intended to clearly present the ITS program to Congress, other government leaders, and private sector entities. It is intended to guide investment decisions in the development and deployment of ITS products and services to be made by private entities, the Federal government, and local governments; to facilitate prioritization and coordination of ITS development activities; to reduce duplication of effort; and to ensure ITS program activities are directed toward deployment of ITS services in a nationally compatible intermodal system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These services have been grouped into the following categories or ``bundles'':  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Travel and Transportation Management <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , which would improve the flow of traffic and provide travel-related information to the public;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Travel Demand Management,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which would reduce vehicle demand by encouraging modes other than the single occupancy vehicle;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public Transportation Operations <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , which would assist in delivering improved public transportation systems;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Commercial Vehicle Operations <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , which would improve the efficiency and safety of commercial fleet operations;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Electronic Payment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , which would allow travelers to pay for transportation services with electronic cards or tags;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emergency Management <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , which can be used by police, fire, and rescue authorities to improve their management of, and response to, emergency situations; and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Advanced Vehicle Control and Safety Systems, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which would provide improved vehicle safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The deployment of these user services will depend on a range of issues that will be assessed in formulating and implementing the Plan, including cost, public acceptance, the maturity or availability of the technologies, and regulatory issues. The Plan will also serve as the framework for a continuing process that will assess progress and allow government and private sector investment decisions to be made after the views of all interested parties have been considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the Plan is being developed with the user as the focus, the Department is interested in participation from a broad range of individuals and organizations including, but not limited to, public officials from State and local governments, consumer groups, vehicle manufacturers and other private sector entities, transit authorities, toll authorities, small businesses, academic institutions, associations, and individual citizens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is the third notice on the Plan. The first notice, at 58 FR 65814 (December 15, 1993), contained background information on the national ITS program, including a detailed description of the user services. The second notice, 59 FR 26552 (May 20, 1994), announced a series of five public forums (held around the country in June 1994) to obtain input on the Plan development. Comments received in response to both notices, and the public forums, have been utilized in preparing the third draft of the Program Plan that is now available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This draft of the Plan has been substantially revised from the previous draft, and edited to reduce its length and remove redundancies. A new chapter has been added that discusses the societal, economic, legislative, and other forces that led to the ITS program. User Service Integration and National Compatibility have been divided into separate chapters, and the discussion of telecommunications issues has been expanded. The Deployment and Deployment Support chapters have been substantially revised to reflect 5-, 10-, and 20-year deployment scenarios, provide an analysis of the potential affects of different levels of public and private sector participation in ITS deployment, and a description of program initiatives to address deployment barriers. A new Travel Demand Management bundle has been created that encompasses the Pre-Trip Travel Information, Ride Matching and Reservation, and Demand Management and Operations user services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to a number of comments, a Synopsis of the Plan has been developed and is included with the third draft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This third draft is intended to be the final draft before publication of the first edition the Plan in March, 1995. The Plan will then be updated periodically to reflect changes in the development and deployment of the ITS program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Information Requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is especially interested in public comment on Chapter 6, Deployment, and Chapter 7, Deployment Support, the deployment scenarios presented, the analysis of the effects of different levels of public and private sector participation in ITS deployment, and the discussion of program initiatives to address deployment barriers. Respondents are also asked to indicate their agreement with the publication of this document, following the comment period and with comments considered, as the first edition of the National ITS Program Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any additional information, suggestions, opinions or other comments that would assist in further developing the Plan would be welcome. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  23 U.S.C. 315; 49 CFR 1.48; Pub.

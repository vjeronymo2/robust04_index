			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Georgiy Kunadze, Russian ambassador to ROK, </F> by reporter Pak Tu-sik on 24 May at the Russian Embassy in  Samsong-tong, Kangnam-ku, Seoul]    [Text] [Pak Tu-sik] How do you predict the outcome of the  upcoming ROK-Russia summit?    [Georgiy Kunadze] The two heads will exchange views on a  wide  range of matters including the international situation and  methods for cooperation. Also, in most of the issues they  discuss, they will be able to confirm that they have similar or  the same points of view. I hope that this will be an  opportunity in which the relationship between the two countries  will be enhanced to a level of "a mature partner relationship."    [Pak] Among the many pending issues between the two  countries, what attracts our interest the most is the issue of  the $3 billion economic cooperation loan we provided to Russia  when No Tae-u and Gorbachev were presidents. What is Russia's  position at a time when Russia has not repaid the principal sum  or the interest?    [Kunadze] I would like to make one thing clear. Our side's  debt is half of the $3 billion. The other half was frozen by  the ROK Government last year (in August 1993, Hong Sun-yong, the  then vice foreign minister, announced that the execution of the  loan of $1.53 billion would be stooped except for the already  executed loan of $1.47 billion). We were dissatisfied with such  a measure because it was a one-sided one, conducted without even  receiving our consent, but Russia recognizes the duty of  repaying the debt made during the old Soviet period. However,  we are of the position that the repayment method must not run  counter to the conditions that were promised at the Paris Club  (a meeting held by Russia's creditor countries). I expect that  this issue will be resolved in the near future.    [Pak] Russia is succeeding the "treaty on mutual assistance"  with North Korea concluded during the old Soviet period. In  this treaty, there is an article which stipulates that if there  is a dispute on the Korean peninsula, Russia will automatically  interfere. This is bringing about concern.    [Kunadze] Many people in Russia as well as the ROK talk  about  this article, but in reality I think there are many people who  do not have a correct understanding of the original text. There  is no phrase in the original text that refers to Russia's  "automatic interference." Our interference is limited in the  case of a non-provocative incident. Even if an incident occurs,  Russia will make an independent decision regarding the situation  and not insist on taking action according to the treaty. The  position of the democratic Russian Government is that  implementation of any treaty must be approved by the parliament  and that the international law and the UN Charter must be put  before the mutual treaty.    [Pak] When you were the vice foreign minister early last  year, you visited North Korea and presented the issue of  revising this treaty. Will this issue be dealt with at the  upcoming ROK-Russia summit talks?    [Kunadze] Russia will not raise this issue first. This is  an issue between Russia and North Korea. The ROK is only a  third party. If the ROK side raises this issue, we will explain  our position.    [Pak] Recently, some North Korea loggers who escaped from  logging camps in Siberia defected to the ROK. What is the actual  situation of the North Korean loggers in Russia and how does  Russia plan to deal with them?    [Kunadze] There is not even a single case in which a North  Korean logger is under the control of the Russian Government.  Therefore, we do not know how many of them want to defect to the  ROK. The issue of the status of the North Korean loggers is an  issue from the human rights level. The Russian Constitution  guarantees foreigners from coming and going freely. Therefore,  if the North Korean loggers want to go the ROK, this is  completely their personal problem. We have nothing to do with  this problem.    [Pak] Recently, the Russian Government expressed great  dissatisfaction over the ROK media's report on the issue of the  North Korean loggers.    [Kunadze] We have never expressed dissatisfaction. We are  only dissatisfied with the ROK media which is reporting as if  Russia was interfering on how to deal with the North Korean  loggers. Without even sufficiently explaining our position, the  ROK media reported that the Russian Government is not allowing  the North Korean loggers from leaving the country and that they  are sending the loggers back to North Korea. I have never heard  that a North Korean logger was sent to North Korea by force.    [Pak] When Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu visited Moscow last  year, Russia promised to forward to the ROK documents on the 25  June war. Will this promise be kept?    [Kunadze] There is no difficulty in delivering the material.  Since the amount of material is enormous and research over this  matter is difficult, I believe it would be good if a special  committee was formed between the two countries to work on this  jointly.    [Pak] What is the level of North Korea's nuclear development  to the knowledge of Russia?    [Kunadze] According to the information Russia has, there is  no possibility that North Korea produced nuclear weapons.  However, we believe that North Korea must unconditionally  implement the duties of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Our  position has been since last March that we are not providing any  atomic energy technology to North Korea as long as North Korea  does not implement the treaty.    [Pak] What is background for having proposed an eight-party  meeting of the South and North Korea, the United States, Japan,  China, Russia, the United Nations, and the International Atomic  Energy Agency to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue?    [Kunadze] This proposal is beneficial to all. A new form is  being added to the existing framework of the talks. It will be  an opportunity for the South and North to have contacts with  each other at a time when the South-North dialogue has broken.</p>

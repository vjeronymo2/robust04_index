			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Placing and intermediaries offer values SeaPerfect at Pounds 59m Investors with a yen for molluscs are being offered a stake in SeaPerfect, the world's largest controlled producer of shellfish, for 120p a share. The price values the seafood farmer at Pounds 59m. SeaPerfect, which was founded by a US computer entrepreneur in the 1980s, is coming to the market through a placing and intermediaries offer of 20.8m shares. The issue will raise Pounds 25m, of which Pounds 18.4m will go to the company and Pounds 6.6m to existing shareholders. Of the offer, 15.6m shares, or 75 per cent, have been placed firm, with the balance placed conditionally and made available to intermediaries. SeaPerfect farms shellfish in Chile, Florida and South Carolina, producing seed in its hatcheries and setting the young clams and scallops in protected coastal areas. Mr Bill Lord-Butcher, chief executive, argues that with declining stocks of shellfish in the wild due to overfishing and pollution, controlled farming is the only way to meet rising demand. The company is forecasting a loss this year of not more than Pounds 1m, after 1993's deficit of Pounds 2.7m. However, Mr Lord-Butcher has said the company is making a profit in the final part of this year. Sir David Orr, former Unilever chairman, is chairman and Mr Andre Benard, the former co-chairman of Eurotunnel, is a non-executive director. The issue has been fully underwritten by Williams de Broe, the stockbroker.</p>

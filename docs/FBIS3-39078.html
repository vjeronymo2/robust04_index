			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Slovakia became the seventh country officially  to join the Partnership for Peace plan today. This initiative  will enable us to take part in joint military exercises and in  NATO peace missions. As Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar stressed  before departing by air for Brussels, it is important for  Slovakia, within the framework of Partnership for Peace, to try  to make the potential of its arms industry available to  all-European cooperation.    Departing for the Belgian capital with Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar, Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Prokes, and Defense  Minister Imrich Andrejcak, was our editor Agata Stanekova. Here  is her first report:    [Stanekova] The plane with the Slovak delegation on board  landed at Brussels airport at 0900 today. Shortly after  arriving at NATO headquarters, Vladimir Meciar and Defense  Minister Imrich Andrejcak met Sergio Silvio Balanzino, NATO  first deputy secretary general. The official proceedings for  signing the Partership for Peace document followed. The festive  act of signing took place at exactly 1030. [passage omitted]    Shortly before the treaty signing, NATO Secretary General  Manfred Woerner said that Slovakia is one of the youngest  democratic countries in Europe. He said: As a state, you are  therefore facing many political and economic changes. Your early  decision to participate in Partnership for Peace is a clear  indication that you are not limited by your independence. In  the world of today, gains from independence can only come in  cooperation with others. By signing this document, therefore,  you declare that you have opted for cooperation in the name of  peace and stability.    As Vladimir Meciar said at a brief news conference, by its  membership of Partnership for Peace, the Slovak Republic is not  only giving but also taking. It is an opportunity to acquire  rapidly the principles and methods of building NATO armies. On  our part, we are interested in joint planning and in preparing a  unit that could serve common actions, if necessary. We are  offering our training areas, we would welcome a training center  for officers to suit the needs of these units in Central Europe.  We are offering our arms industry potential to build the future  unified Army of NATO countries.    As Vladimir Meciar said, Slovakia understands this plan as  the beginning of its journey toward full membership in the  alliance. Partnership for Peace guarantees security and  opportunity for all and creates scope for preventing two  Europes, Vladimir Meciar said.</p>

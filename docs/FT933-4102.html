			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Subsidy call for 'clean' burning which requires electricity producers to buy a portion of their power from such sources as nuclear and hydro-electric - should be extended to clean-coal projects in order to generate market enthusiasm for new coal-fired plant, Mr Neil Clarke, the chairman of British Coal, said yesterday. Mr Clarke said that the large role foreseen for coal in this week's World Energy Council report on the future of energy supplies meant that greater emphasis should be given to clean-coal technology. The higher costs of the non-fossil fuel obligation are met by a 10 per cent levy on electricity bills which produces about Pounds 1.3bn a year. The WEC report said coal was among the world's most plentiful energy resources, and that it would play an important role in long-term energy supplies. It estimated that future investment in world coal projects would account for 13 per cent of energy investment. This would secure a market share in excess of 20 per cent. Mr Clarke said commitments to build coal-fired power stations in the west and in developing countries suggested that coal was seen as the fuel of the future. However, the proposed privatisation of British Coal would restrict its ability to take an adequate part in developing long-term technologies.</p>

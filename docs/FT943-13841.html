			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Management: TECs - the perfect after-dinner topic Did you know that last week was the TECs' annual conference? Do you know what TEC stands for? Can you name two British figures who are important in training? Can you say anything cogent about the training debate at all? Do you care? Good for you if you can confidently answer yes to all of the above. I do not usually advertise my ignorance, especially on a subject that we are told is the key to the country's competitiveness/to all our tomorrows etc etc. But I have done some soundings and found that my blind spot on training is shared by a large number of otherwise well-informed people. At the first mention of TECs (Training and Enterprise Councils), NVQs or IIP, we go blank. And by the time the conversation swings round to CENs, let alone EBS, or FCWG, we have unplugged ourselves altogether. If this crucial subject is not treated as a yawn, it is regarded as a laugh. My husband recently gave an after-dinner speech to a group of personnel managers in the City. He started with the usual jokes, which met polite laughter; moving along rapidly to the serious part of the speech he mentioned TECs. This brought the house down. The poor old TECs have been valiantly trying to raise their image. They have retained Des Wilson, the most fanatical campaigner of them all, and a team of highly paid PR people at Burson-Marsteller. But so far, the only big publicity they have had was a television programme alleging that some TEC money had been handed out to dodgy trainers. The problem is partly one of presentation. The general talk about training is full of platitude and hyperbole. Take David Hunt's sentimental speech last week about how training matters because it is the future of his 13-year-old daughter. (I have a hunch that his daughter will be OK whatever the TECs are up to in the year 2000.) Everyone knows that training is vital, to go on saying that is not interesting. But once you get to the meat of the discussion, it quickly becomes technical and complex. The subject is dry, incremental and full of initials: a crashing bore to all but the faithful. And the faithful themselves don't help. There is a missionary zeal about them: a chance encounter with a training expert full of talk of 'competences' and I start feeling like the wedding guest in Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Maybe none of this matters. It couldn't be less important whether the chattering classes are preoccupied with training. What matters is that someone is getting on with doing it. And the news from last week's conference that 12 per cent of the British workforce is involved in Investors in People sounds encouraging. I still don't really know what IIP is, but so long as the companies involved are enthusiastic that is what counts. Returning to the subject of speeches that do not go quite according to plan, a management consultant friend recently addressed a group of senior managers on the subject of partnership sourcing. He felt he had acquitted himself with credit and was therefore a little put out to get a letter a couple of days later informing him that his audience had rated him seven out of 10 on content and five out of 10 on presentation. This is performance measurement run riot. The craze for appraising and grading employees on every aspect of their jobs is bad enough, but the idea of ranking guest speakers is dotty. Maybe the conference organisers feel it is necessary in order for them to know who to ask back next time. But why on earth would the speaker want to hear the verdict, especially one expressed in a meaningless number? Next time I have a dinner party I shall ask my guests to grade their fellow eaters, and give marks for the food, too. And then we'll all know in a handy modular way what others think of our small talk and of our cooking. The traditional macho manager will be extinct by the year 2001. He will be replaced by a natural team leader who is loved and respected by colleagues. He - or just as likely she - will be a class communicator, responsive to change, a whiz at strategic planning, good at coaching and delegating - a true hero or heroine. I can't help feeling there is some wishful thinking in this picture, as presented in today's survey from the Institute of Management. The number of women managers is, if anything, falling and it is hard to believe that an explosion of numbers is on the way. Moreover, the changes being forced on managers are just as likely to turn them into nervous wrecks as into rounded collegiate players. So far, restructuring has meant executives taking more load on themselves, going through the nasty business of firing others and worrying about their own jobs at the same time. The IM survey thinks management training will shape the brave new boss. But as I read about the MCI, about transferability/accreditation of skills, I find my mind going regrettably blank . . .</p>

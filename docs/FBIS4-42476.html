			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Xavier Gautier: "Foreign Minister Answers </F> Critics -- Bosnia: France Intends To Set Example"]    [Text] Called a "politician that thrives on abdication" by  Bernard-Henry Levy and a "coward" by Andre Glucksmann, Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe took advantage of the 63d French-German  summit to launch his counterattack.    First by insisting on the "determined" policy of the French  Government in Bosnia: "Once again setting an example, France  has just contributed 25 million francs for the reconstruction of  Sarajevo. The money will be used to restore the power  distribution network, following an EDF [French Electrical  Company] evaluation mission in the city." The minister added:  "To my knowledge, we are the prime contributor of funds to  Sarajevo."    Then, having learned of the withdrawal of the "Europe Begins  in Sarajevo" list while he was still in Mulhouse for the summit,  he turned on the acid tap: "The saga ends in farce," the  minister taunted. "I have only one other thing to say:  Bernard-Henry Levy's list's motto must have been something like  'let us be brave and run away from voters!'"    The foreign minister emphasized that current talks are based  on the "Juppe-Kinkel plan" developed in December 1993, which  made it possible to bring the Bosnians back to the negotiating  table. The plan, Mr. Juppe went on, places the city of Mostar  under European (specifically French and German) control as part  of UN Resolutions 900 and 908. "This is a highly symbolic  operation," Mr. Juppe said in Mulhouse, since the person put in  charge of it is former Bremen Mayor Hans Koschnik.  <H5>  Support From Sarajevo </H5>   Although Paris has been preparing to "redeploy its forces  around Sarajevo," as President Mitterrand put it, France still  has some 7,000 blue helmets in Bosnia and Croatia. France is  "the leading contributor of troops for peace keeping" in the  former Yugoslavia, the foreign minister reminded his audience.    In an interview with LE FIGARO, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic praised the "new accents" of French policy. At the  time when Gorazde was being besieged and the United Nations  refused to strike Serb positions, Sarajevo's strongman stated:  "We are grateful to the French Government for its firm stand in  favor of the use of force to bring this war to an end." The  Bosnian prime minister maintained that Mr. Juppe "knows the  situation inside out."    This does not mean that there have been no contradictions in  France's position. Indeed Muhamed Secirbegovic, Bosnia's  ambassador to the United Nations, pointed out that France  simultaneously hosted two conferences on central European issues  last week. "While one, the Balladur plan [for stability in  Europe] in Paris, insisted on border inviolability and minority  rights, the other, in Talloires, completed the job of carving up  Bosnia."    Nevertheless, U.S. President Bill Clinton told France that  it  should "continue" its efforts and "remain in Bosnia as long as  all potential avenues for settlement have not been explored."  Mr. Clinton, who was speaking on the eve of his trip to Europe  to celebrate of the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landing,  said that "it is still possible that the belligerents realize  that they may keep fighting into the next century without being  able to solve their problems through the use of arms."</p>

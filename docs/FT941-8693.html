			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / People: MD moves from Electrolux to 'information warehouse' Kevin Walsh, appointed managing director of the new retail division of On Demand Information, believes in wearing what he describes as 'visionary spectacles'. He will find them necessary in his new job where he will have to persuade down-to-earth retailers that they can save money and sell more goods by renting space in his 'information warehouse'. ODI is a new kind of company, which floated on the London market last year. Its founder, Graham Poulter, has developed an information system combining sound, text and pictures on a screen - multimedia, in other words. The retail division is about multimedia for the shop floor. Walsh, only 40 years of age but a veteran of the retailing business, had spells at Reed Group, Kenwood and Singer before spending seven years at Electrolux where he is currently managing director of the domestic appliances division. He likes the 'big group' feel of Electrolux, but the challenge of being in at the beginning of a new industry persuaded him to move to ODI. He envisages retailers installing modified personal computers in their shops able to receive over telephone lines a stream of information from the 'information warehouse' - essentially a large computer memory. Customers will be able to inspect products on the screen, receive interactive training in their use and order them directly from the manufacturer. Walsh thinks that operations like ODI could render obsolete the use of CD-ROM systems in electronic retailing.</p>

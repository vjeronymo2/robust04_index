			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 28 June TASS -- The Dniester  Republic favours the development of close economic cooperation  with Russia, the Republic's parliament chief Grigoriy Marakutsa  told ITAR-TASS.    At the same time he is of the opinion that the relations  with  Russia, with which markets of commodities, raw materials and  technology are linked, are being restrained by the Dniester  area's uncertain status. For example, Marakutsa said, "we agree  to independently repay debts to Russia for gas but the Russian  Gazprom signed an appropriate agreement only with the Moldavian  [Moldovan] Government."    In connection with the fact that the Dniester Republic,  which  has not been recognised by Moldavia, cannot pay with its own  products and money for gas supplied by Russia, Marakutsa  suggests taking the road followed by Baltic states, Ukraine and  Byelorussia [Belarus]. His opinion is that one can pay for the  supplied raw materials and energy resources by property, the  establishment of joint ventures and apply other economic forms  of cooperation.</p>

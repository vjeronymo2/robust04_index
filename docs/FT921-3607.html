			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / The Property Market: An ambivalent attitude The property industry has an uncomfortably ambivalent attitude to the main political parties ahead of the UK general election on April 9. It has reason to distrust the Tories for orchestrating the most damaging boom and bust for decades; and Labour for its traditional antagonism towards developers At the same time, the sector cannot view the prospect of a hung parliament with equanimity. Such an outcome would give investors and prospective tenants an excuse to continue dithering. 'The worst result would be no result,' says Mr Chris Bartram, managing partner of Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyor. The differences in policies between the two parties pale into insignificance compared with the need for a decisive result that injects confidence into the financial markets. Above all else, the fortunes of the property industry are yoked to gilt yields and interest rates. Any increase in rates would deter investors, hinder refinancings, clobber valuations, weaken revenue accounts and undermine the occupation market. The industry's main fear is that the next government might be forced to increase interest rates to bolster its own credibility. Kleinwort Benson Securities says that long gilt yields would be 200 basis points higher if the election resulted in a Labour-led hung parliament compared with an outright Tory victory. That would translate into a decline in net asset values of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent, Kleinwort adds. The constraints of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System limit both parties' room for manoeuvre on economic policy. The soaring inflation of the 1970s, which enhanced the appeal of property to investors, is unlikely to be repeated. The scope for boosting the economy and investing in infrastructure is limited and the introduction of Labour's minimum wage policy might further hinder growth, particularly in the retail sector. On planning matters, the property industry's attitude to Labour is ambivalent. In some respects, it remembers past Labour governments with affection, because the tight controls on planning boosted property values. For example, the ban imposed on the construction of offices in London by George Brown, Labour's secretary of state for economic affairs, in November 1964, sent rents and values spiralling upwards. Labour still takes a tough line on planning matters. It will not, for instance, brook any development in the green belt. But the differences with the Conservatives have narrowed: the Tories have shed the laissez-faire attitude towards development, most commonly associated with former environment minister Mr Nicholas Ridley. Both parties emphasise the need for sustainable development and anti-pollution measures. The industry is sceptical about how far Labour has moved away from its hostile 'pip-squeaking' attitudes of the early 1970s. Labour has sought to reverse this image and its 'planning a new agenda' document declares that 'Labour is not anti-development'. However, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, a professional body, is not entirely reassured. Mr Christopher Jonas, senior vice-president of the RICS, says Labour's proposal to introduce a 'third party right of appeal' against the granting of planning permission that cuts across an agreed development plan could make a developer's life 'a nightmare'. Labour's proposals to end the automatic right of planning appeal and to re-introduce separate categories of use for light industry and offices have also come under fire. The idea that development plans should be reviewed every two years is unrealistic and Labour condemnation of urban development corporations is too sweeping, says the RICS. It also dislikes the opposition's proposals to impose time limits on planning permission to discourage speculators from hoarding land. The RICS is not entirely negative about Labour's plans, however. Mr Jonas says that Labour has 'hit the nail of the head' in its emphasis on regional and local plans and the need to integrate planning and transport policies. It applauds the idea of regional planning and welcomes the notion of urban regeneration zones, which will have strong local authority involvement. Past governments have had a drastic, often unwitting, influence on the property industry. Today, however, the government's ability to interfere is limited by the rigours of the ERM and the glut of empty properties. It is the legacy of the late 1980s, rather than the promises of politicians, that is likely to shape the property market in the near future.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: A faulty mechanism The ERM is clinging to life, but there can only be limited hope of remission. There have long been only two ways of laying European currency tensions to rest. Either Germany changes its mind on interest rates, which seems ever more remote given the weakness of its bond market and of the D-mark against the dollar and the yen, or France leaves the system so that it can cut interest rates sharply enough to revive its recession-bound economy. Perhaps the political capital at stake is too great for European governments to grasp this nettle. Perhaps they are simply too stunned by the extent of the crisis that has enveloped the system. Technical adjustments like a unilateral upward revaluation of the D-Mark or a widening of bands within the system could never be anything other than a temporary solution. As long as the interest rate problem is not addressed the markets will quickly resume their attack. As this thought sinks in, those involved must turn their attention to who receives the blame. It would be some consolation for France if the ERM failed because Germany's fears for its own money supply forced it to withdraw intervention support for the franc. Indeed the Bundesbank looks to have lost in terms of credibility. Its failure to appreciate the international consequences of Thursday's refusal to cut its discount rate appears naive. Conflicting statements by Bundesbank council members yesterday over the conduct of day-to-day money market operations underline the disarray at the top. Independent central banks are fine as long as they are perceived to be in control. Markets have grounds to worry when they are not.</p>

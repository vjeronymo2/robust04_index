			<p>BFN     [Text] After several weeks of negotiations, the government  and coca growers have finally reached an agreement.    According to coca grower leaders, 80 percent of their  demands  will be honored with the signature of the agreements at dawn  today. It is hoped, however, that these agreements will indeed  be put into practice.    The negotiations with the government have resulted in one  decree and two ministry resolutions. The decree establishes the  equal participation of coca growers in the National Development  Fund, Fonaral. One of the resolutions provides for the  compulsory eradication only of new plantations; the second  resolution, to be implemented immediately, provides for the open  marketing and industrialization of coca leaf. The peasants, in  exchange, have agreed to lift the road blockades. [recorded  passage indistinct]    This morning the coca grower leaders traveled to El Chapare  and the coca production areas to announce the agreement reached  with the government and to suspend the pressure tactics, such as  road blockades, adopted by the peasants.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US fails to put worker rights on WTO agenda A US attempt to put worker rights on the negotiating agenda of the new World Trade Organisation was rebuffed by trading partners yesterday. Trade negotiators rejected a demand for a reference to the link between labour standards and trade to go into the political declaration being drafted for ministers to endorse when they meet next month in Marrakesh to sign the Uruguay Round trade liberalising accords. 'The US had no support at all,' said one trade official at the talks. While the European Union in principle favours a discussion of the worker rights issue, it did not back the US in requesting specific language in the draft ministerial declaration. In any event, this could never have won the support of developing countries, especially in Asia, which are strongly opposed to labour and human rights appearing on the trade agenda. They fear that such moves will provide new pretexts for trade protection in the industrialised world. Washington must now decide whether to give in and allow an agreed draft ministerial declaration to go forward without a reference to worker rights, or stand its ground at the risk of precipitating a row at Marrakesh. A meeting of the trade negotiations committee, which supervises the 120-nation Uruguay Round, is scheduled for next Wednesday when all the agreements, decisions and declarations for the Marrakesh meeting are supposed to be finalised. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said on Wednesday that the Clinton administration would be seeking some understanding at Marrakesh on the need for labour standards to be addressed. 'What we are trying to achieve is to tie internationally recognised labour standards to trade,' he told a House of Representatives commerce sub-committee.</p>

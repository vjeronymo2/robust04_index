			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Let us listen to a report from Ibajete Hajrullahu  about the problems within the Party for Democratic Prosperity  [PDP] in Macedonia and the suspension of the Macedonian  parliament session, scheduled to discuss the census bill:    [Hajrullahu] After many efforts to reach an agreement  between the two factions in the PDP, this was attained in the  meeting held in Tetove. On this occasion, a joint council made  up of representatives from both former councils was formed to  make preparations for the early congress. The council also  comprised one representative from every PDP branch.    This council will hold its first meeting on 3 February at  the  PDP headquarters in Tetove. Meanwhile, the Macedonian Assembly  continued its suspended proceedings regarding the government's  proposal to discuss the census law. The discussions by  Macedonian deputies displayed the fear that by conducting an  objective census, the number of Albanians will turn out to be  greater than the present one, which the Macedonians used to  manipulate. However, in drafting the law the government's main  aim is not that it should be acceptable for Albanians as well.  The Albanian deputies again presented their remarks requesting  no more than a real and objective census and the return of lost  belief in the Republic's Statistics Department. The debate was  again suspended.</p>

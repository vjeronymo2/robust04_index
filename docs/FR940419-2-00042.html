Section 5117c(d) to mean a center providing temporary emergency services and care for children. Crisis nurseries are child care facilities which protect children by providing a safe environment at a time when the chances of neglect or abuse in the home are increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The programs offer parents the option of ``time out'' as a preventive measure in reducing the incidence of child maltreatment. They are designed to: (1) Develop a safe environment as a resource for children at risk of abuse; (2) deliver non-punitive, non-threatening services as a resource to caregivers of at-risk children; and (3) utilize existing community-based services to further diminish the potential for the maltreatment of children in families experiencing crisis. Services funded under 42 U.S.C. Section 5117b must be provided without fee and may be provided for a maximum of 30 days in any year. Crisis nurseries must also provide referral to support services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

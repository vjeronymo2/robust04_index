			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Cripton Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Latin American narcotics chiefs agreed to create an  organization to fight the scourge of drug trafficking, which is  increasingly more interconnected with another illegal business:  gunrunning from Europe to Latin America. The decision was  adopted at a meeting in the Dominican Republic. Here is a  report by Chelo Garcia:    [Begin recording] [Garcia] There is concern that the ties  between Latin American drug traffickers and gunrunners are  getting increasingly closer. They work in teams and support  each other. Sophisticated long- and short-range weapons of  every caliber, mostly from Europe, are flooding Latin American  black markets. The Latin American narcotics chiefs decided to  make efforts to break this deadly alliance during the drug  summit held in the Dominican Republic.    [Colombian counternarcotics chief Colonel Leonardo Gallego]  The most important things were the plans for new methods and  means to strengthen this struggle against drug trafficking.    [Garcia] It was also proposed at the drug summit that the  Latin American countries form a single bloc of support to  control drug cultivation, production, processing, and  trafficking. They will also work shoulder to shoulder to  prevent the use of aircraft, vessels, and ground transportation  to supply materials that Latin American drug traffickers need to  produce drugs.

			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Scottish shipyard wins court reprieve FERGUSON Shipbuilders, a Scottish shipyard, has been granted an interim order in the Jerusalem high court which may help it win a Pounds 10m contract to build two tugs for state-owned Israel Electric. The court instructed Mr Israel Kessar, minister of transport, not to award a contract for the tugs to state-owned Israel Shipyards or any other company. The order also applies to Israel Electric and the port of Hadera, where the tugs would operate. Ferguson, which is based at Port Glasgow on the lower Clyde, believes its tender for the contract to build the tugs was 23 per cent lower than the Dollars 16.7m (Pounds 11.2m) bid by Israel Shipyards. About 14 shipyards initially submitted tenders. Mr Kessar had told the Israeli press he intended to grant the contract to Israel Shipyards to protect domestic jobs. His intentions were said to have been criticised by officials at the ministry of finance and at Israel Electric. Ferguson is understood to have felt it had been used as a price marker in an expensive and time-consuming charade. Judge Michael Cheshin gave Mr Kessar 10 days to respond to the order. The issue will be considered by three judges in the Israeli Supreme Court, probably within a few weeks. Ferguson, a privately owned company purchased from British Shipbuilders in 1989, builds specialised small ships such as ferries, dredgers, research vessels and tugs. It has been owned since early 1991 by a consortium chaired by Sir Ross Belch, who once managed the Scott Lithgow shipyard at Port Glasgow, now closed. It is currently constructing two ferries for the Red Funnel line which operates to the Isle of Wight. Ferguson made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.04m on sales of Pounds 16m in 1992. It employs 230 people.</p>

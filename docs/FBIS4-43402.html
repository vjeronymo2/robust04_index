			<p>BFN     [Text] The talks between UN officials and the Turkish  Cypriot side on the confidence-building measures [CBM] package  were concluded today.    President Rauf Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side  has  accepted all of the United Nations' requests and that now the  requests of the Turkish Cypriot side should be accepted. He  added that the rights granted to the Turkish Cypriot people  should be included in the 21 March document. Denktas noted that  the next phase will deal with the preparation of the draft  agreement, adding that the ball is now in the court of the  United Nations and of Greek Cypriot administration leader  Kliridhis.    Denktas received Gustav Feissel, UN secretary general's  deputy special representative in Cyprus, at 1030 today and  conferred with him for on and one-half hours. Also present at  the meeting were Feissel's secretary; Atay Ahmet Rasit, the  minister for foreign affairs and defense; Ozer Koray, under  secretary of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministry; and  presidential political advisers Necati Munir Ertekun and Ergun  Olgun.    In a statement given to reporters after the meeting, Denktas  said the main problem facing the Turkish Cypriot side is to  prepare and sign the agreement on the CBM's as a single text.  Reiterating that the Turkish Cypriot side wants the rights  specified in Vienna to be included in the agreement, Denktas  said: We cannot accept any other alternative on the issue.  Pointing out that the Turkish Cypriot side does not accept  artificial proposals, such as letters written by the UN  secretary general and approved by the UN Security Council,  Denktas added: We are ready to conclude an agreement that will  be formulated and prepared for signature through negotiations to  be held with us. This is our right. This is what we promised  our people. We cannot accept any other kind of agreement. At  this point, we are defending our rights.    Denktas said that the United Nations wants the Turkish  troops  to withdraw 1 km from the Dherinia road and that the Turkish  Cypriot side has accepted this request. He added, however, that  Feissel was told that the withdrawal would place the troops some  200 meters from the Greek Cypriots and that the correct and  appropriate thing would be to remain in the middle. Denktas  said: Our condition, however, is that the agreement be  concluded as a whole. The agreement should be prepared for  signature. Noting that the issue of the access road and the  distance has thus been resolved, Denktas added that the Turkish  police station east of the road will be relocated to the west,  provided aid is extended for the construction of the new police  station. He added that the Turkish Cypriot side has also agreed  that the issue of Turkish troops crossing from the east to the  west via the Dherinia road will be solved through negotiations  to be held by the officers on finding a suitable route and  method.    Denktas said: We have actually agreed to everything they  requested. The only thing we want is to have a concrete  agreement written as a single text. This shows that the ball is  in the Greek Cypriot court.    In reply to a question on whether all the United Nations'  requests were accepted and whether the United Nations had any  additional requests, Denktas said: We believe that through the  negotiations we have been holding for some time now at the  request of the United Nation, we have secured concrete  advantages for our people. We now want them to materialize.    Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Feissel said that  the Turkish Cypriot side gave the necessary responses to the  United Nations' requests and that he will convey them to the UN  secretary general. In reply to a question, Feissel said that  the UN secretary general will determine whether the Turkish  Cypriot replies are satisfactory. He concluded by saying that  he believes they are constructive.</p>

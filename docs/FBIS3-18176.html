			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] has  approved the recommendation submitted by the Prime Minister's  Office regarding the extension of the state of emergency, in  force in the 10 provinces, by another four months as of 19 March.    The Assembly convened yesterday evening under the  chairmanship of Vefa Tanir and discussed the recommendation  regarding the extension of the state of emergency in force in  Batman, Bingol, Bitlis, Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Mardin, Siirt,  Sirnak, Tunceli, and Van.    Expressing the views of the government regarding the  recommendation, Interior Minister Nahit Mentese said that the  state has the right to legally defend itself against those that  want to attain political gains by means of terrorism. Mentese  further explained that the state is waging this struggle within  the framework of international rules. Stressing that the  terrorist organization is perpetrating ruthless actions in the  country causing great sorrow to the nation, Mentese remarked:  Should not everyone be reacting to these actions? All the  parties, especially those that take advantage of the legal  system to hide behind these laws, should react to these actions.  The leader of the party that receives money from the budget  will probably make fun of this situation [as heard]. Our  reaction to these actions -- inhuman actions -- is to rise  against them together and show the necessary rage.    Mentese also indicated that the terrorist organization is  trying to put the pressure on the candidates and the people with  the approaching regional elections. Explaining that every  measure possible has been taken in order to avoid this pressure,  Mentese said that the terrorist organization is showing great  fear due to the extension of the state of emergency at this  period when the national conciliation is at its peak. Noting  that intensive efforts are conducted to eradicate the issue of  terrorism from the country's agenda, Mentese stressed that they  are determined and decided on their struggle.    Mentese said that the state of emergency should be extended  once more -- within the unity and political will displayed at  the TGNA -- in order to properly fight terrorism and thus  establish public security, protection of human rights, and  respect of the law.    Following Mentese's statement, discussions on the  government recommendation began. Oral Gullu, Usak deputy of the  Social Democrat Populist Party [SDPP], expressing his party's  views, stated that nobody has the power to divide the Turkish  Republic.    ANAP [Motherland Party] whip Hasan Korkmazcan, stated that  they agree with the reasoning of the government regarding the  recommendation but that they are against this issue being  exploited politically by the goverment.    Prosperity Party Bitlis Deputy Zeki Ergeten stated the  government is not taking any measures to prevent terrorism  adding that Western countries are behind the terrorist actions.    Murat Karayalcin, SDPP leader, state minister and deputy  prime minister, stated that terrorism which started in 1984 has  been institutionalized by politicians who underestimated it as  the work of three to five bandits. Explaining that the  statement he issued a couple of days ago was erroneously  interpreted by the press, Karayalcin reiterated that he has  never used the word coup and that he has never linked anything  to the chief of the General Staff or other military forces  commanders. Karayalcin pointed out that he interprets some of  the recent incidents as the ploys of those that want to obstruct  democracy.    Ismail Kosebe, True Path Party [TPP] Erzurum deputy,  expressing his party's views, said that significant developments  were achieved as a result of the government's determination and  that the brains behind the PKK have been destroyed. The TPP  deputy also stressed that 1994 will be the end of terrorism.    Answering criticisms and views on behalf of the government,  Mentese said that the military forces, the gendarmerie, and the  security forces serving in the state of emergency region are  working in coordination adding that they are inflicting great  losses to the separatist organization. Indicating that the  government is decided on eradicating this issue from its roots,  Mentese added there is a significant decrease in the number of  bandits as a result of the government's determination and the  success of the security forces.    Noting that tranquility has been established in the  southeast  Anatolia cities, Mentese announced that the bandits will be  wiped out in extensive operations which will be conducted in the  coming days. On the lifting of the immunities of the deputies  who support the PKK, Mentese said that the Assembly will fulfill  its historical responsibility on this issue. [passage omitted]    Following the discussions, voting took place and  subsequently  the recommendation submitted by the Prime Minister's office was  approved.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In the routine Japan-U.S. talks on plant quarantine  held in Tokyo, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and  Fisheries [MAFF] has studied quarantine measures to lift the  existing ban on imports of U.S.-produced apples, and has  concluded that there should be no danger of blight worms coming  in with the imported apples.    In the recent talks, the ministry has become convinced that  there is no problem with the United States' insecticidal and  disinfecting technologies, as well as with its inspection  methods. A similar judgment has been passed by the United  States on the Japan-produced apples. Accordingly, it has become  certain that the ban on trade regarding apples between the two  countries will be lifted. The MAFF intends to hold public  hearings during the coming summer and to decide on formal  lifting of the ban by autumn.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / France to take firm line on spending France's 1995 budget will give priority to cutting public sector deficits and reducing social security charges, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, budget minister, said yesterday. Mr Sarkozy, who is aiming to reduce the budget deficit to FFr275bn (Pounds 33.6bn) from a targeted FFr300bn this year, added that income taxes would only be lowered if deficit targets were not jeopardised. He took a tough line on reducing expenditure to prevent a rise in interest rates and support France's economic recovery. 'Today, growth is there, but we must consolidate. To do that, we must avoid an increase in interest rates by controlling indebtedness and reducing the deficit,' he said. French long-term interest rates have already risen by more than 2 percentage points this year, partly because of the turmoil in international bond markets. The strong performance of the German economy, which has raised concerns about the Bundesbank's willingness to reduce interest rates further, has also prompted economists to question the scope for cuts in France's short-term borrowing costs. Mr Sarkozy is due to present his budget proposals at the end of September and is seeking to reinforce an impression of fiscal discipline ahead of next spring's presidential elections. Said one economist at a French merchant bank: 'The government is anxious to demonstrate its credibility. That means talking tough and sticking to their targets.' The minister played down the significance of a fall in manufacturing production in June, claiming that the underlying trend had shown steady improvement. The fact that 92,000 jobs had been created since the start of the year demonstrated that government policy was yielding results. Next year's budget plan is believed to based on 3 per cent growth in gross domestic product, compared with 2 per cent this year. Economics ministry officials declined to comment on the growth projections, but said the economy had recovered more quickly than expected this year. France's Socialist party, banking on worsening rivalries within the ruling centre-right, may delay choosing a presidential candidate until next year, Mr Henri Emmanuelli, party leader, told Le Monde newspaper yesterday. The presidential election is due next April. Although neither has formally declared his candidacy, the Gaullist prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, and former premier Mr Jacques Chirac are engaged in a bitter rivalry for the conservative nomination.</p>

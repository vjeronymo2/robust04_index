			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, the proposal would require in paragraph (c)(5) that the fan monitoring system provide monitoring, records, printouts, and signals at a surface location at the mine where a responsible person designated by the operator is always on duty and where signals from the monitoring system can be seen or heard while anyone is underground. For the purpose of the standard, a responsible person would be one who receives the signal and makes proper notification. As with the requirement that fan stoppage signals be given at a surface location at the mine, this proposed requirement is not intended to preclude the data from the fan monitoring system from also being provided elsewhere as long as it is provided at the surface location at the mine. Also, as with the requirement for two-way communication at the location where fan stoppage signals are monitored, the proposal would require in paragraph (c)(5) that the person at the designated surface location have two-way communication with working sections and would extend the requirement to established locations where persons are normally assigned to work, such as belt transfer points and shops. This requirement is consistent with existing Subpart Q_Communications, but may require the installation of a limited number of mine phones at locations off the section. Many of these locations are routinely equipped with two-way communication even though it is not required by the existing standard. It is not intended that this communications capability be provided in areas where persons are assigned to work temporarily, such as areas where secondary roof support is being installed or where rock dust is being applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.311&blank;Main Mine Fan Operation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency has received comments that notification of mine management officials, having sufficient authority to initiate corrective actions is needed to assure that repairs are undertaken and to assure continued reliable ventilation of the mine. Paragraph (d) would be revised to provide for immediate notification of the mine superintendent, assistant mine superintendent, or mine foreman if any unusual variance in the mine ventilation pressure is observed, or if an electrical or mechanical deficiency of a main fan is detected. The standard would require appropriate action or repairs to be instituted promptly. The Agency would expect that any necessary arrangements for repair personnel and replacement parts would be promptly completed, once the problem or need for repair was identified. One of the actions appropriate to an unusual variance in pressure would be an immediate investigation into the cause. Notification of mine management is intended to assure that the appropriate actions are taken and that any necessary repairs are completed as soon as possible. Both the requirement for notification of mine management and the requirement for prompt initiation of corrective actions were included in the previous regulation. Although no change was intended, it was suggested that these requirements be reinstated so as to eliminate any possible confusion that might exist. After reconsideration, the Agency agrees that the existing standard could be interpreted contrary to the intent and therefore, is proposing the changes discussed. Since the current ventilation standards became effective on November 16, 1992, questions have arisen concerning the operation of back-up fans. The following discussion is intended to address the questions received by the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a back-up fan operates in place of the main mine fan, the back-up fan is considered to be a main mine fan and all subpart D requirements for main mine fans are applicable. These requirements include: the installation requirements of &sect;75.310, the operation requirements in this &sect;75.311, the examination and recordkeeping requirements of &sect;75.312, and, the unintentional fan stoppage requirements of &sect;75.313, which would apply should a back-up fan fail while persons are underground.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A typical back-up fan application is where a back-up fan producing an air quantity comparable to the main mine fan is substituted upon the unintentional failure of the main mine fan. Section 75.313 would require withdrawal of the miners if the backup fan, or main mine fan, is not started within 15 minutes. If the back-up fan is started within 15 minutes, however, normal work may resume after an examination, since the air quantity would be provided. An example would be two identical fans at a shaft where one operates as the main mine fan while the other is available to back up the main mine fan. Typically, the usage of these fans is alternated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A repelling secret - Clive Fewins meets Rufus Stone, soldier, sailor, policeman, engineer, surveyor, salesman and potion mixer Rufus Stone is unlikely to forget the day he received an early-morning phone call from a tea planter in Assam. Wild elephants were using the timbers supporting his main tea-grading shed as scratching posts. One building had already collapsed and his staff feared for their lives. The caller had heard of a magic potion called Curb that would repel the intruders if sprayed on the buildings. Could Rufus send some some urgently? The carefully-contrived cocktail was urgently despatched, and proved effective. The elephants went. Stone's company, Sphere Laboratories (London), has dealt with tigers in Malaysia, gerbils in Israeli desert settlements, pigeons in Trafalgar Square, moles in parks and sports grounds, and, recently, football pitch invasions for Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers. Both clubs' newly-laid turf were being damaged by birds. Lt Colonel Rufus Stone RE has done many things. He was born 81 years ago on a farm in mid-Devon and has worked as a seaman, an inspector in the Metropolitan Police and a regular soldier. During the war he worked on the Mulberry Harbour off the coast of Normandy during and after the D-Day landings in 1944. He has no formal training but has worked as an agricultural feedstuff salesman, an engineering designer, a consulting engineer and a surveyor. From 1959-63 he worked for the Cyanamid Corporation as UK general manager and then as European director of the agricultural, foodstuffs and veterinary division. Soon after he was made redundant by Cyanamid at 51, a chance meeting in a London pub led to a request for him to tackle the problem of horses *something in here (HP) * chewing the woodwork in their stables at a racing stud. 'I had always been passionately fond of animals, but from my experience in the veterinary and agro-pharmaceutical field I had also developed a pretty good idea of what substances they found repellant,' said Stone, who runs the one-man business from his 16th-century cottage in the village of Chilton on the Berkshire Downs. 'I did a bit of ringing round and experimented with a substance I concocted, based on aluminium ammonium sulphate. It was a powder mixed with water that I painted on the looseboxes. After a bit of experimentation I managed to find a formulation that worked. 'I had a hunch that I was on to something big, so in 1967 I took out patents, and registered the main product under the name Curb. 'Then, without doing any formal marketing - all I did was some phoning round  -I managed to interest a host of important people in the agricultural and horticultural world. Some people in the field of domestic animal repellants heard about Curb and were attracted by the powder form. 'I soon realised that Curb would stop pigs from tailbiting, birds from pecking crops, dogs from fouling footpaths and rats from jumping on poultry and killing their victims.' Soon he was selling Curb to seed companies, local authorities, government departments, and export agents. 'All sorts of big companies buy it from me and sell it under a variety of fancy names. It also sells under different names in France, Germany, Italy, Austria and in the East,' Stone said. The patents cost Stone Pounds 7,500 and covered 25 countries, but they proved to be the wisest move he made. 'I raised Pounds 15,000 from a loan company - the only money I have ever borrowed - to help me develop the enterprise at this important stage and you could say the sphere was really rolling,' he said. Sphere has been rolling productively - and profitably - ever since. Stone can be seen at all hours mixing his secret potion in the 2,000 sq ft industrial unit - a former wartime explosives and mixing store at Milton Park near Abingdon that he has rented since 1970. 'It is only four miles from my house so I just drive down and mix to order. If there is a rush I have a few part-time helpers I can call upon. 'Annual production is about 50 tons and at Pounds 2,000 a ton that means I turn over about Pounds 100,000. Profit runs at 20-25 per cent of turnover and my main overheads are materials at about Pounds 20,000 a year and my annual rent, which is Pounds 12,000.' But after 30 years of making and selling Curb doesn't he want to do something new? 'I find it so interesting that I never want to retire. My father was playing golf to a 16 handicap at 86, although I have given up riding and shooting I should like to develop the company further,' Stone said. 'I find the calls I get and the problems to be solved immensely fascinating. I have given papers at scientific meetings in the USA and Europe, and I meet all sorts of interesting people on my troubleshooting trips in this country. 'A few months ago I had phone calls from Sweden and Eire on the same day. Both callers rang to tell me they had discovered Curb will stop birds pecking putty out of window frames. Soon after the big putty manufacturers got on to me. Now I sell to them, and so it goes on.' There are two more things Stone wants to do. The first is to make his stepsons, Sean and Simon, who he hopes will take over the business, fully conversant with Curb's secret formula. The second is to develop neem oil, a natural extract from India. 'The insect-repellant qualities of this substance have been known to mankind since 500 years before Christ, but it has yet to be exploited to its full potential,' he said. 'It will repel, and if necessary kill, just about every type of insect known to man. The Americans are now growing it and say it is going to be very big in harmless insect control over the next 100 years. Some experts say it has a part to play in preventing the spread of HIV, while it can also be used to repel organisms that cause barnacles to form on the outside of ships. 'I am keen for the British to exploit neem oil. All I need is to find somebody with a few million to put into it.' Sphere laboratories, The Yews, Main Street, Chilton, Oxon OX11 ORZ. 0235-831802.</p>

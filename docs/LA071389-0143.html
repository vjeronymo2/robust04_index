			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIME INC. BATTLE;  </P> <P> PARAMOUNT SCORES TIME'S EXECUTIVES IN COURT FILINGS  </P> <P> Paramount Communications Inc., hoping to stop Time Inc. and Warner  Communications Inc. short of the altar, made a number of harsh allegations in  its written pleadings to a Delaware judge this week, including the suggestion  that Time's managers were prepared to adjust the company's price to advance  their own careers.  </P> <P> Hundreds of pages of documents became available this week in Paramount's  challenge to Time's anti-takeover maneuvers. Paramount's $200-per-share offer  has been rebuffed by Time because Time's directors maintain that the company  isn't for sale. Instead, Time prefers to press ahead with an acquisition of  Warner.  </P> <P> A ruling in the case is expected by Friday, but until then, other lawyers,  investors and reporters are searching for clues in the massive court filings.  </P> <P> In a real "page turner" of a brief, Paramount's lawyers presented their version  of Time's recent corporate history, in which they claim Time's top executives  were preoccupied with fending off takeovers and preserving their own jobs.  </P> <P> Using excerpts from memos and depositions, Paramount recounted how Time's chief  strategist and general counsel, Gerald M. Levin, was charged with the task in  1987 of finding companies to acquire. If Time became larger, the reasoning  went, it would improve its chances of remaining independent.  </P> <P> On Aug. 11, 1987, Levin sent a confidential memo to Time Chairman J. Richard  Munro and president Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr., recommending that the company set  a long-term goal of combining with Warner and Turner Broadcasting System. (Time  has since secured an important ownership stake in Turner.)  </P> <P> With some irony, the Paramount legal team noted that Levin "concluded that if a  union with Warner was not possible, Time should explore a combination with  Paramount."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Retirement an Issue  </P> <P> But talks did proceed with Warner in 1987, initially centering on a joint  venture in cable, programming and films. By the summer of 1988, the focus  shifted to a complete merger. Prior to a July 8, 1988, meeting between Munro  and Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross, Levin "ranked as a top priority" the  establishment of shared power between the two men, and the succession of  Nicholas as co-chief executive once Munro retired, the Paramount brief said.  </P> <P> "Levin noted that although the exchange ratio for an exchange of Time and  Warner shares should be based on market values, 'We should be flexible' if Ross  agreed to share power and retire soon," according to the Paramount account.  </P> <P> Time's legal filings contained no direct response to this one point, but Levin  was willing to respond in general terms Wednesday. "When you have an  acquisition, there normally is a premium paid," Levin said, adding: "We wanted  Time Inc. to be the ultimate survivor."  </P> <P> In August, 1988, negotiations broke off, largely because "Ross refused to  promise to retire within five years after the merger," the Paramount brief  said. When talks began anew in January, the negotiating teams' first issue was  the matter of succession and the executives' contracts. (Ross agreed to give up  the co-chief executive's job after five years but would continue as chairman  for another five.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stock Swap Abandoned  </P> <P> Ross and Time's three top executives each received 10-year contracts.  </P> <P> In their brief, Paramount's attorneys strove hard to create the impression that  Time was out-negotiated when it agreed to swap 0.465 of a Time share for each  share of Warner.  </P> <P> The 0.465 ratio "was far more than Warner expected to get," Paramount lawyers  said. "In fact, Warner's financial advisors advised Warner that anything over  .40 was fair and anything over .45 would be 'a hell of a deal.' "  </P> <P> (After Paramount made its cash offer, Time abandoned the stock-swap plan, which  required shareholder approval. Instead, it decided to make its own cash tender  offer for Warner -- a move not subject to a shareholder vote.)  </P> <P> Among other things, Paramount claimed that Nicholas, Time's president,  "negotiated the final .465 exchange rate in one meeting. He did not have his  investment advisor present."  </P> <P> Levin responded: "The exchange ratio was arrived at through a process of  intense negotiation designed to compensate Warner for the value of the assets  that were being acquired . . . and (Nicholas) wasn't alone."  </P></p>

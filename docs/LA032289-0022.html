			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 U.N. SOLDIERS KILLED BY LAND MINE IN LEBANON  </P> <P> Three Irish members of a U.N. peacekeeping force were killed Tuesday when their  vehicle ran over a land mine in south Lebanon.  </P> <P> An Irish officer said the mine exploded near Braachit on the edge of Israel's  self-declared security zone just north of the Israeli border. More than 160  U.N. servicemen have been killed since the 6,000-member peacekeeping force was  assigned to Lebanon in 1978.  </P> <P> The officer said the attack was aimed at U.N. troops, and U.N. Secretary  General Javier Perez de Cuellar ordered an investigation. But an Israeli  official said the target was probably the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army  militia.  </P></p>

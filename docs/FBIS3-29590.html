[passage  omitted]    The independent federal Elections Commission later declared  the PBS the winner with 25 of the 48 seats in the state  legislature, after a bruising campaign. The remaining 23 seats  went to the National Front of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed,  who had vowed to hound Kitingan out of office for deserting the  federal coalition on the eve of parliamentary elections fours  ago.    In Kuala Lumpur, Mahathir accused Kitingan of "unlawfully  locking up" PBS legislators who wanted to switch their  allegiance to the National Front. "The PBS should allow them to  decide. Give them the freedom to move," he said. Mahathir also  said that his National Front would not form a coalition with  Kitingan, adding "There is no stalemate. It is up to the  governor to decide" (who to swear in).    Kitingan told reporters early Sunday after that the  governor's aides had told him through the locked gates that the  governor was too sick to receive him. He accused the National  Front of using money -- some "dropped by helicopter" -- to buy  votes.    He also claimed that large numbers of Filipino and  Indonesian  immigrants were intimidated into voting for the federal  coalition to avoid expulsion. "The elections were not fair," he  said. The lock out was a virtual replay of Kitingan's first  stunning election victory in 1985, when he was also refused  entry into the then-governor's residence, and Muslim leader  Mustapha Harun was sworn in as chief minister.    This time, the 76-year-old Mustapha, frail and ailing,  briefly joined Kitingan outside the governor's residence on  Saturday and again on Sunday in a show of support for his  one-time Christian enemy.    Kitingan said he feared his elected assemblymen might buckle  under pressure and defect. "We have heard that there may be  some attempt to get our people to go to the other side," he said.    The election outcome showed a marked swing away from the PBS  among Muslim and ethnic Chinese voters although Kitingan  performed well in his traditional, mostly Christian,  strongholds. Those areas are dominated by the Kadazans, the  largest of several indigenous groups.    Mahathir had warned Sabah's almost 600,000 voters that a PBS  victory could bring racial and religious strife between  Christians and Muslims. He said the PBS had fanned racial,  religious and parochial sentiment in the run up to the polls.  "Does the PBS want to turn this country into a  Bosnia-Herzegovina or Northern Ireland or Kashmir?" he said in a  statement released Thursday. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In preparation for the possibility of a large-scale  oil spill in the territorial waters off the Korean peninsula as  a result of the increasing amount of oil transport via the sea,  the government has decided to make efforts to establish a  Northeast Asian cooperative system to prevent ocean pollution.  These Asian countries include the ROK, North Korea, Japan,  China, and Russia.    The relevant ministries, including the Ministries of Foreign  Affairs and Environment and the Korea Maritime and Port  Administration, said on 9 January that for this end, the  government would participate in the Northwest-Pacific Ocean  protection program, a regional cooperative system jointly led by  the UN Environment Program and International Maritime  Organization, and that it is positively considering signing an  agreement to prevent ocean pollution.    Accordingly, the government will participate in a meeting of  the program led by those five countries. This meeting is  scheduled to be held in May for the first time. In the meeting,  the government will ask other participating countries to  establish a comprehensive information management system  regarding the maritime environment in the Northwest-Pacific  region, including the East Sea and the Yellow Sea, and to  formulate an inter-state cooperative plan to prepare for a  large-scale oil spill. It will give a high priority to this  project.    Also, the government will hold the first working-level  contact with Japan in Tokyo next month and mainly discuss plans  to cooperate with Japan to prevent oil spills. The discussions  will include ``the conclusion of an agreement, the exchange of  technology and information, and the exchange of manpower and  equipment between the ROK and Japan for the prevention of ocean  pollution'' in case there is a large-scale oil spill on the  waters.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wood pulp producers announce more rises Several North American wood pulp producers have announced their fourth price increases this year amid growing fears of a strike later this summer by pulp-mill workers in British Columbia. The latest rises, which are due to be implemented in July and August, will bring the price for northern bleached softwood kraft pulp, the industry's staple product, up to about USDollars 620 a tonne, from the current level of Dollars 560. Prices sank as low as Dollars 390 a tonne a year ago. Mr Rodney Young, president of Resource Information Systems, a US consultancy, linked the proposed price increase mainly to forthcoming negotiations on a new labour contract in British Columbia. But he also pointed to 'booming' markets in south-east Asia, and a pick-up in European and Japanese demand. Canada's pulp industry, which makes up more than a quarter of world pulp shipments, is currently operating at full capacity, up from 80 per cent a year ago. Many paper mills are cushioned from rising pulp prices by having access to their own raw-material supplies. But a trader at Trebor, a New Jersey-based paper broker, said that the surge in pulp prices had squeezed some producers, especially of tissue, who are struggling to pass the increases on to their customers. Uncertainty about shipments from British Columbia has been heightened by a dispute that has broken out in advance of the actual contract negotiations. Two unions representing 12,000 BC pulp mill workers have so far rejected management efforts to move from an industry-wide agreement to mill-by-mill bargaining. The BC Labour Relations Board is expected to rule on the dispute within the next few days.</p>

His Excellency candidly answered all of our questions, which  are being pondered by many businessmen and industrialists and  gave precise replies dealing with a number of issues that are of  concern to these sectors of the economy as well as to a large  number of our citizens. He concluded by saying that Saudi  Arabia's industries are marching in the direction of progress,  guaranteeing the nation a bright future that will bring  prosperity to our country and its citizens.    [Al-Qaysi] First we would like to have Your Excellency  review  the developments that have taken place in the industrial and  electrical sectors of this wealthy nation under the  circumstances of the tremendous growth that it has experienced.    [Al-Zamil] It is a pleasure for me to review with you some  of  the basic features of the development of industry and  electricity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. There is no doubt  that Saudi Arabia has made great strides in the field of  industry and electricity. I would like to begin by talking about  industry and providing a brief introduction before mentioning  the achievements of industrial development in Saudi Arabia.    First I would like to point out that the basis for, and  essential element of, industrial development in Saudi Arabia is  the fact that Saudi Arabia totally adheres to the principles of  Islamic law. The government of the Custodian of the Two Holy  Mosques has taken upon itself to translate these principles into  reality such that they guarantee complete freedom of action for  Saudi Arabia's individuals and citizens. This freedom has  provided investors with a feeling of security and thus unleashed  all manner of intellectual capacities and given them all  possible chances to seek different opportunities. Investors,  whether citizens or non-citizens, have begun to feel a sense of  responsibility, starting with the projects that they are  concerned with. The role of the state has basically consisted of  providing a suitable investment climate, basic arrangements and  facilities, and some incentives. These arrangements, facilities,  and incentives have created a suitable natural environment in  which investors can operate and begin to carry out their  activity.    These arrangements and facilities consist of the creation of  the industrial cities, the provision of land necessary for the  industrial projects, and the necessary utilities for the  establishment of these projects, in addition to the availability  of the necessary loans for industry and customs exemptions for  the equipment and raw materials necessary for these projects.    These arrangements, facilities, and incentives, along with  the principle of a free economy, constitute the foundation that  has impelled businessmen to get moving and start seeking  industrial projects. The result of this has been noticeable  industrial growth, consisting of more than 2,036 industrial  projects in various areas of Saudi Arabia in which 140 billion  riyals [R] have been invested. They have produced products  valued at more than R50 billion, including R10 billion of  products that have been exported to other nations.    All of these tangible results and achievements have come  about as a result of the efforts of our citizens and investors  operating in a climate of unlimited support provided by the  state. These enterprises have not been merely a facade to boast  about, but also have come about in order to satsify market  demand and were set up in accordance with international  specifications in order that they compete in the domestic  market, which is an open market. Consequently, we expect a  continuation of the natural growth of this industrial progress  in the years to come.    [Al-Qaysi] Saudi Arabia follows the principle of a free  economy, and industry is the backbone of the economy of the  advanced nations. Why, then, is industry not given free rein to  develop more widely, by means of the unrestricted and  unconditional granting of licenses?    [Al-Zamil] I would not be exaggerating if I said that  investors are complaining about the great degree of flexibility  shown by the Ministry in granting industrial licenses. Many of  the investors with whom I have met on numerous occasions in  various areas of Saudi Arabia have had complaints about the high  degree of flexibility shown by the Ministry of Industry and  Electricity when it comes to giving out industrial licenses, and  this means that there is lots of competition. Things have  reached the point where as many as 15 competing enterprises are  producing the same product. This is why they have demanded that  the Ministry put a limit on these licenses. The Ministry's  position in this matter is, to a large degree, in accordance  with what I mentioned concerning the fact that there must be  flexibility and an open-door policy, because the investors, to a  great extent, know best what is in their own interest,  especially if they have the capability of investing large  amounts of money. But it is necessary for the Ministry to  provide information to a given investor and to clarify it for  him as well as to tell him that the product he wishes to  manufacture is, for example, already being produced by 15 other  enterprises, and that this production covers the needs of the  nation.    But such an investor might have a point of view that can  persuade the Ministry to change its mind. In such a case his  application is accepted if it is proved that he has a new brand  that will have a market share or particular demand, or if he has  information concerning domestic or foreign markets that the  Ministry does not have.    Perhaps the greatest proof of what I have said is the fact  that, in addition to licenses for the currently existing 2,036  enterprises, the Ministry has issued a total of about 1,400  licenses for new, future industrial projects.    [Al-Qaysi] To what extent has the Ministry completed the  project to link electrical power networks throughout Saudi  Arabia, and what alternative solutions are there in case of  power failures such as the one that occurred recently in the  power line between the eastern and central regions?    [Al-Zamil] The state has spent large amounts on the  electrical sector, and has provided electrical service in all  areas of the country. At this point I would like to mention that  the number of persons who received electricity by the end of  last year totalled more than two milllion customers, and that we  have covered all the main cities and villages. Electrical  service now, praise be to God, has become a basic service, and  the state is providing this service at rates that are quite a  bit below actual cost. This is in keeping with King Fahd's  directives to make life easier for our citizens.    Our power linkage system is considered to be an advanced  system that utilizes high technology. At this juncture I would  like to point out that most of the technicians working in the  electrical sector are Saudi personnel.    As for the projects dealing with linking electrical power  among the various regions, they have already begun to be  implemented some time ago. The project for linking the eastern  region is already finished, and work in all its areas is nearly  over, with the exception of the power line between Dammam and  Hafr al-Batin, which will be finished within four months. We  have also finished the power network inside the central region,  that is, the power line which links Riyadh to al-Qasim and  Sudayr. And now there is a program to link Riyadh to al-Aflaj,  and this will mean that the network in the central region will  be all linked together except for Wadi al-Dawasir.    We have also finished the power network inside the western  region since Jeddah, Mecca, Medina, Yanbu', and al-Ta'if are now  linked. Currently efforts are also being made to finish the  power linkage projects inside the southern region, and, in fact,  al-Bahah has been linked to Bishah and we are now working on the  link between 'Asir and Najran.    When the networks inside the regions have been completed, we  will concentrate on linking the regions with each other. We have  already begun the step of linking the eastern region to the  central region, and they already exchange power loads. Also,  Riyadh is linked to al-Qasim. Furthermore, a study has been made  concerning linking al-Qasim to Medina, and this will result in  the eastern, central, and western regions being all linked to  each other. And in the future, God willing, there will be a link  between the western and southern regions.    At this point I would like to stress the importance of these  linking networks. They have been operating with a high degree of  efficiency. In spite of the incident that you mentioned, I  assure you that this incident only serves to clearly show how  rarely such incidents occur. We praise God that throughout the  last ten years since the project was first put into operation  the electrical power networks have operated at a high degree of  efficiency and they have never been down. Many people have not  realized that Riyadh gets its electricity from the eastern  region and that Mecca receives its power from Rabigh.    Here I would like to mention one important point, which is  the fact that there is no system anywhere in the world that is  totally immune from such power outages. This is something that  is impossible. But there are systems that operate at high  efficency. I don't think there is any system that can operate  for 10 years without some incident happening and not be  considered to be indeed an efficient system. So we are gradually  putting our systems into operation, and we will continue to work  on perfecting them.    [Al-Qaysi] And what if such an incident does happen?    [Al-Zamil] This is to be expected. There are additional  solutions that might be costly, but sometimes it is important to  use them. These solutions involve increasing the generating  capacity in some of the regions so that power is transmitted at  the lowest possible level. We have already taken this matter  into consideration. We generate power in Mecca, Medina, and  al-Ta'if. But we cannot, for example, generate all the power  necessary for Mecca or even for the city of Riyadh, for which we  are now planning to construct a ninth generator station. All the  generator stations that are being put into operation are  considered to be support for the current linking and network  systems.    [Al-Qaysi] Does the Ministry intend to establish an  apparatus  to finance and guarantee exports?    [Al-Zamil] The Ministry is devoting a great deal of its  attention to the matter of exports. As I have mentioned  previously, industrial exports are experiencing noticeable  growth. There is a table showing how this growth of exports is  taking place.    Petrochemical and fertilizer exports now total more than  R6.5  billion. As for the other industries such as those which  manufacture carpets, cables, electrical appliances, etc., their  exports total R3.5 billion, and they are continuing to grow.    There are two sources for the financing. The first one is  the  Islamic Bank program, and it is available to all Saudi plants  and provides the necessary financing. The second source is the  Arab Monetary Fund in which there are special amounts set aside  for Saudi industry. There is also the possibility of increasing  the sources of this financing, although it is abundant at the  present time.    As for the matter of guaranteeing exports, there exists a  joint Arab authority whose job it is to do this. But its capital  is limited and it does not meet the need. Actually there is a  need to make a study concerning alternatives for this purpose.  In our meeting with the authorities concerned with exports about  a month and a half ago, I asked them to study various  alternatives. In this regard, the commercial banks are prepared  to provide financing for exports, and it is also possible for  the banks to make special expertise available to exporters just  as they do for importers.    This matter, in fact, is of concern to the Ministry and the  Ministry is keeping track of it.    [Al-Qaysi] We notice that ministerial decisions are being  issued concerning exempting some raw materials from customs  fees, and then the investors are unexpectedly told by the  Customs Administration that these exemptions are being denied.  Does Your Excellency wish to comment on this?    [Al-Zamil] The Ministry might, in some cases, have some  points of view that differ from those of the Customs  Administration. What I said is accurate. But this happens on a  very limited scale, and these cases involve only 5 percent of  the exemption decisions.    [Al-Qaysi] Saudi Arabia is experiencing a high degree of  advanced industrial progress, and hundreds of plants are being  built every year. But the Saudi market is still absorbing  foreign products, and this is having an effect on domestic  production. How do you think this equation can be solved such  that protection can be provided for domestic products and in  order to enable them to develop so that they can compete with  foreign goods?    [Al-Zamil] We in Saudi Arabia do not follow the policy of  central planning. There are nations who planned and prescribed  their economic policy on the basis of replacing imported goods  with domestic goods at any price. And the price was very high  for these nations and their citizens. What was the result of  this policy? The result was high-cost industries of poor quality  that had to be endured by those nations' citizens. Then the time  came when this reality had to be dealt with. This is what  happened after the collapse of communism, and it also happened  in the case of nations such as India and Brazil, whose  industries were established on the basis of the imposition of  high customs fees on imported products. When the hour of  liberation from these policies arrived, all of these industries  began to collapse and they began suffering because of the  competition. The reason is that they were trying to pursue an  unnatural existence, and their industrial development became  something that was merely tantamount to slogans. There are those  who said: "We will produce everything from safety pins to  missiles." Statements like these might keep people quiet and  satisfied for a while, but surely they will discover that they  cannot be true and will not yield good results.    On the basis of this fact, if I could not produce safety  pins  economically, then I should feel free to import safety pins from  abroad. If I could produce other goods competitively, then I  should concentrate on the industries that produce those goods.  This also applies to other things.    This being true, we should be realistic and not attempt to  rely on slogans in the field of growth and development. Growth  and development are the basis of reality, and reality is  something that cannot be wiped out by any slogans.    It is true that there are a lot of foreign products in the  Saudi market. But there is a difference between what the  situation used to be 15 years ago and what it is today. Domestic  products are steadily increasing. The value in sales of these  products 15 years ago was R10 million, but today this figure is  R50 million. This is not something that happened in a vacuum. It  was the result of tireless labor.    At this point I would like to say that the Saudi economy is  an enormous one and that petroleum is still an international  commodity and will remain Saudi Arabia's main source of income.    The basic point that I want to indicate is that for Saudi  industry to remain vigorous, it has to develop on sound economic  bases. And that is what is happening right now.    This is why I do not hesitate to cancel any licensed project  if it was not implemented. There is no emotional tie between me  and a project. The proprietor of a project is the one who  decides whether or not the project or enterprise is profitable.  The result of this is that you will encounter new Saudi products  in the future. If we visit industrial exhibits every year, we  find that there are new Saudi products and that industry is  continuously developing.    Our basic task at the present time is to develop this  industry. For example, when we found that we possessed an  advantage in the chemical industry, we began undertaking it on a  grand scale, and we became one of its chief exporters. The same  applies to fertilizers and other products. Who would have  expected that Saudi Arabia, which used to import 100 percent of  its electrical cables, now exports about 30 percent percent of  its electrical cable production?    We will gradually set up more industries in order to reach  the stage of self-sufficiency in a well-researched and  scientific manner.    [Al-Qaysi] Electricity still has not reached a number of  villages in Saudi Arabia. How does Your Excellency explain this,  especially in emergency cases?    [Al-Zamil] Saudi Arabia lived through an emergency--the Gulf  war--which could be considered to have been an extremely  difficult circumstance. In that emergency, Saudi Arabia proved  how strong its basic utilities were, whether electricity,  telephones, or other utilities. Electricity was never cut off  during the war, but rather was available wherever it was needed.  As for the matter of providing electricity for all villages and  agricultural settlements, the fact is that more than 92 percent  of all of Saudi Arabia's cities, villages, and agricultural  settlements have power.    Right now we have a program called the "generator program."  It is by means of this program that some remote agricultural  settlements are borrowing electricity generators that belong to  the Ministry. This program actually has to deal with great  difficulties, because it is hard for the parties who borrow the  generators to operate and maintain them, and this results in a  lot of problems. Definite conditions are attached to obtaining  the generators. Any agricultural settlement using a generator  has to have at least 20 residences and some basic institutions  such as schools or a mosque. These generators are distributed  according to need and priorities, and not every request can be  complied with in a short period of time.    [Al-Qaysi] How has Saudi Arabia been able to maintain its  strong economy in spite of the fact that it has had to deal with  numerous crises, including such things as the brutal Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait and the sharp decline in oil prices, and in  spite of the fact that the process of growth, development, and  modernization is still going on and requires certain  well-thought-out expenditures?    [Al-Zamil] In fact, the Saudi economy has gone through  various phases and has met with obstacles. We had, for example,  the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the consequences of this brutal  invasion. Saudi Arabia had very great commitments to contend  with as a result of this invasion that called for total  expenditures of billions of dollars. These commitments directly  affected the nation's economy and budget. At the same time there  was a sharp decline in oil prices. The wisdom and directives of  King Fahd constituted the main guideline for overcoming these  difficulties. They were tremendously effective in correctly  steering the ship of Saudi Arabia's economy. I believe that this  year's budget has quite clearly demonstrated to the world that  King Fahd's government is determined to wipe out the negative  effects of the situation as well as the consequences of the  Iraqi invasion and the decline in oil prices. The budget has  shown that the state itself is beginning to cut out unnecessary  expenditures and concentrate on services that are important to  our citizens. The budget has provided the world with a  comprehensive indicator concerning Saudi Arabia's intention to  reduce its deficit to the lowest possible level. This is a  reflection of the decision made to have the budget be 20 percent  lower than last year's budget.    In his orientational speech on the occasion of the  publication of the budget, King Fahd said that the exchange rate  of the riyal would not be affected and that its value would not  go down. These measures taken in accordance with King Fahd's  guidance will strengthen our economic situation both  domestically and abroad.    [Al-Qaysi] Many factory owners are complaining about a lack  of incentives provided to them by the state, for example,  hooking up electrical service to the plants. This forces them to  spend huge amounts of money to obtain such service, as in the  case of the second industrial city in Riyadh. What are your  comments about this?    [Al-Zamil] The plants in the second industrial city in  Riyadh  really did have to deal with an electricity problem, since the  city had only one transformer station. But due to the huge  increase in demand by the industrialists, an urgent need arose  to construct another transformer station. Actually agreement was  reached to construct two stations--one of them during the second  phase, and the other one during the third phase. Construction of  the second phase's station will be completed in the upcoming  month of Shawwal [April and May of this year]. Furthermore, the  third phase's station will be put into operation four months  after that.    After these stations have been put into operation, the  plants  will no longer have an electricity problem. At this point I  would like to indicate that the number of plants affected by the  power problem do not total more than two or three. The other  plants are still in the construction phase or else are just now  being completed, and thus have not yet reached the production  phase. God willing, the electricity problem will be solved  before these plants reach the production phase.    [Al-Qaysi] Industrial and economic analysts are of the  opinion that Saudi Arabia has made great strides in the field of  consumer industries and aspires to create industries involving  inventions and discoveries. But there is no guidance in the  field of investment industries such as the spare parts industry  for vital enterprises like the desalinization plants and others  which, if they ceased operations, would bring the country's  economic activity to a halt. What are Your Excellency's comments  about this? Does the Ministry have guidance to offer the  investment industries?    [Al-Zamil] In spite of the great efforts being made by the  [industrial] exhibits, Saudi industries still are not  sufficiently well known. There is no doubt that our industry is  growing in normal fashion, and in accordance with the needs of  the market. At first the orientation was toward consumer goods.  We began producing them according to the same specifications  found in imported goods. Many of the people who own enterprises  that produce goods were originally importers who then became  industrialists, and this is an encouraging trend. In the case of  many products, our Saudi citizens believe that they are  imported, and it is only after using them that they discover  that they were made in Saudi Arabia.    This enormous process took place gradually until it reached  the point where we now have an industry that is on the highest  of levels. This is something that earned the admiration of the  Greek minister of industry when I accompanied him on a visit to  the Isma'il Abu-Dawud plant, which makes disposable children's  diapers in Jeddah and which is considered to be one of the  world's four largest plants in this field.    There is a clear trend in the direction of investment  industries. This was clearly in evidence in Riyadh's first  engineering industries exhibit that opened recently, displaying  the products of many investment industries. For example, we have  two very advanced plants in al-Jubayl and Yanbu', which were  constructed via a Saudi-Italian partnership. These two plants  produce many parts that go into the components of industrial  plants. Here I would like to point out that [the components of]  many of the SABIC [Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation]  plants and their expanded units were manufactured in Saudi  Arabia. Also, the spare parts that used to be imported are now  being manufactured domestically. At the present time there is a  clear trend in the direction of manufacturing these  semi-finished products. The Ministry is encouraging this trend,  which saves our country huge amounts of money and also  contributes toward transferring high technology to our nation.  So there is an obvious effort being made to concentrate on  beginning the process of constructing plants that will produce  industrial spare parts in various fields.    [Al-Qaysi] There are initial indications concerning the  construction of a plant in the eastern region to manufacture  tires for vehicles. As Your Excellency knows, the tire-producing  industry requires big quantities of water. To what extent is  such an enterprise useful to us in light of the fact that the  Arabian Peninsula is experiencing a water shortage?    [Al-Zamil] There is a study and a plan concerning the  construction of a tire plant. God willing, I hope this project  will become a reality, especially since SABIC, last month, began  producing the raw materials, i.e., synthetic rubber.    As for the consumption of water, the fact is that most of  the  consumption will be covered by the recycling method. In other  words, the same water will be used again, and purified water  will be used in the cooling process. This means that it will be  possible to use purified sewage water in this process since it  is not a manufacturing process, but is instead basically a  cooling process.    Riyadh and Jeddah both have complete sewage water  purification plants, and this water is used in the cooling  process. The result is that fresh drinking water is used only in  the food and medicine industries. On the strength of this one  can say that the tire industry uses purified water, via  recycling, and thus does not consume large quantities of water.    [Al-Qaysi] We see that Saudi industry has made great strides  that have been first-class. But the industrialists and  businessmen have been complaining a lot, even though they are  earning lots of money without providing the nation with anything  in return--such as training Saudi personnel and other activities  that serve as an impetus for the wheel of progress. What is Your  Excellency's opinion about this?    [Al-Zamil] There is no doubt that the industrialists and  others are constantly being asked to include the interest of our  nation among their priorities. The basic issue is perhaps that  an employee, whether he be in the industrial sector or some  other sector, not forget that it is his job to serve his  country, whether this be by making the jobs of [Saudi personnel]  easier for them or by training them, in accordance with  available capabilities. In all frankness I must tell you that  the proportion of Saudis working in the industrial sector is  higher than the proportion of Saudis in any other sector. Even  so, I am not satisfied with what this proportion is. I hope that  our industrialists will intensify and concentrate their efforts  on attracting young Saudis and a Saudi work force. Actually this  is a trend that has begun to take shape. The Ministry has begun  to intensify its efforts, together with the various  industrialists, to help Saudi citizens in various fields. Of  course, the proportion of Saudis in the big plants is a high  one. Most of the technical workers in SABIC are now Saudis. I  remember when we began working with SABIC, the first thing we  did was to hire 1,400 young secondary school graduates and  persons who had completed qualification courses. We concentrated  on giving them technical training inside Saudi Arabia, in  cooperation with technical institutes. Then we sent them to the  United States, Europe, and Japan for training in technical  professions and vocations. When they returned, they proved their  efficiency and capability, and they came to have a special  status in al-Jubayl and Yanbu'. After that there was no need to  send people abroad for training. The training and education is  now done in Saudi Arabia.    I believe that gradually--and we can benefit from the  experience of SABIC in this realm--the time will come when we  will see young Saudis occupying their place in all realms of  industry. Of course the Ministry, constantly and on every  occasion, is urging businessmen to open their doors to young  Saudis to become affiliated with industry.    [Al-Qaysi] Everything has both its positive and negative  aspects, and three negative aspects concerning the Ministry of  Industry are the following:    1. The foreign work force in our small industries  constitutes  95 percent of the work force. Why are there no particular  clauses that stipulate the granting of licenses, which require  their recipients to hire a certain percentage of Saudi employees?    2. There are industrial projects for which licenses have  been  granted, but they have not been exploited and remain merely ink  on paper. Why are such licenses not taken back and then given to  other citizens who are capable of implementing such projects?    3. Plots of land in the industrial areas have been granted  to  investors for them to set up plants there, but some of them have  then sold the land. What about this?    [Al-Zamil] Concerning the first question, a job seeker  naturally prefers that his job be in the large- and medium-sized  industries, rather than in the small industries, because of the  advantages that would be offered to him. The Ministry is  encouraging such people to become affiliated with any industry.  But they do have freedom of choice. The important thing is that  there be a job opportunity.    As for your second question, I would like to point out that  the Ministry, after granting a license for any project, follows  up on that project, and if the project is not implemented, it is  very easily cancelled.    And as for your third question, the sale of land in such  cases is considered to be a violation and a punishable offense  for anyone who commits this violation, whether he is a buyer or  seller, because it is rented land and not allowed to be sold.    Naturally there are exceptions, such as when the proprietor  of the project has already built installations on the land, put  equipment and machinery there, but, for some reason, was not  lucky or successful with his project. In such a case he has the  right to recover the amount paid for the buildings and  equipment. But the actual sale of the land is a punishable  offense.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Yeltsin urges creation of pro-reform political party RUSSIAN president Mr Boris Yeltsin called yesterday for the establishment of a pro-reform political party, of which he pledged to be part. He made the call as it became apparent that his government has no effective agreement with the Civic Union centrist bloc on the eve of a critical Congress of People's Deputies session which starts tomorrow. Civic Union support is thought to be essential if the government is to avoid defeat. Democratic Russia, the group which supported Mr Yeltsin in his successful bid for the presidency last year, has split into a number of factions, and prospects for effective unity among reform forces with weak party structures are remote. As reformists and the Civic Union continue to trade charges and veiled threats, Mr Yeltsin told a meeting of his supporters in Moscow that a reformist party must be created - and that he 'would be with that party and in that party'. To applause from the audience of representatives of democratic groups from all over Russia, he said that 'economic reform at the beginning of this year looked more dead than alive - but now, market mechanisms are beginning to fully work'. Civic Union leaders spoke in different tones yesterday, but it was clear that no final deal on the shape of the government reform package and on the membership of the cabinet has yet been reached. Mr Alexander Vladislavlev, leader of the Renewal party within the Civic Union and deputy head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, said he believed that the government saw the need for a stronger and more interventionist state - a key demand of the Civic Union - and that the administration should not resign as long as it introduced 'corrections' into its reform programme. However, Mr Vassily Lipitsky, head of the executive committee of the Party of Free Russia, was quoted by the official news agency Itar Tass as saying further cabinet changes were required. Government ministers appeared to accept that no agreement had been reached and that none was likely. Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, told the democrats' conference that behind the Civic Union's words of support for reform lay an attempt to take the economy back to administrative control. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, used the same gathering to appeal to 'democratic allies' in the west for 'more participation and a more serious approach to what is happening in Russia'. The fate of Mr Yeltsin's government might also be affected by today's constitutional court ruling on his decision to ban the communist party following last year's failed coup attempt. A ruling in his favour would provide a moral boost to his authority. A decision against him could provide grounds for impeachment. The seventh Congress brings together some 1,045 deputies, many elected under a Soviet system which meant their candidacies were selected by the Communist party or one of its affiliated organisations. The Congress will focus on the economic programme, but it is also expected to discuss a new constitution and a law which would determine the powers of the parliament and the president. The news agency Interfax reported yesterday that Mr Yeltsin had sent back to parliament a bill passed by the deputies which curtails the president's powers to appoint ministers.

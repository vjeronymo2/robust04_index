			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Milosevic calls early poll in Serbia PRESIDENT Slobodan Milosevic last night dissolved Serbia's parliament and called elections for December 19. The move follows the collapse of the unofficial coalition between his ruling Socialists and the ultranationalist Serbian Radical party of Mr Vojislav Seselj. Mr Milosevic has seized the initiative by calling elections three years early and before facing an economic deluge brought on by two years of war and 17 months of United Nations sanctions. Nevertheless, he is confident that the Socialists will win a majority they lost last month after falling out with Mr Seselj. Mr Milosevic will not be up for election himself. He needs to get rid of Mr Seselj, once his favourite 'opposition' politician who also commands a fierce paramilitary unit, in order to clean out nationalist extremists who would block a political compromise that might permit the lifting of sanctions. The UN imposed sanctions on Serbia for its role in the violent carve-up of Bosnia. Inflation is running at 2,000 per cent a month, shops are empty and Serbia's cities this winter are likely to be without heating or public transport. However, Mr Milosevic appears to be counting for victory on the level of fear and uncertainty among the increasingly discontented 9.8m population. 'He is staying a step ahead of the collapse of the government. He knows that winter elections favour his governing party. They might not win in the spring,' said a western diplomat. Also, his pre-emptive strike exposes a quarrelsome and disorganised democratic opposition which will be hard-pressed to mount a serious challenge to the Socialists. Mr Milosevic probably has a few tricks left up his sleeve to further discredit Mr Seselj, who has been the victim of a smear campaign on state-run television over the past month. Speaking last night on Television Serbia, the president blamed unnamed parties for 'blocking parliament' calling on Serbia's citizens to elect 'a parliament which they could take pride in'.</p>

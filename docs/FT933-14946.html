			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Police face up to being measured: The implications of service contracts for constables AS LAST week's Association of Chief Police Officers conference considered a potential new world of short-term contracts and performance-related pay, a single chief constable spoke from experience. He was Mr Desmond O'Brien, chief of the British Transport Police, which already has all its senior officers on fixed-term contracts with performance review related to pay. It is the only force in the country to be operating a procedure which the government-appointed Sheehy committee has recommended should apply throughout the police service. Mr O'Brien, his deputy and assistant chiefs transferred voluntarily to the system three years ago. Mr O'Brien said it had proved that measurable performance indicators could be set for the police. He told his fellow senior officers at the conference: 'In dealing with under-performing constables, we should also cater for under-performing chief constables.' British Transport Police provides police services for British Rail and London Underground. Under the performance review system, Mr O'Brien agrees personal objectives with his deputy and four assistant chief constables annually, and each May gives them performance ratings that are reflected in their pay awards. Mr O'Brien's own personal objectives are agreed with the chairman of the police committee. Individual objectives relate to police management issues. But, Mr O'Brien said, the force had to ensure that it met its customers' expectations. To help achieve this a budget group, consisting of the managing directors of the rail businesses and the chief constable, produces a contract setting out operational objectives and priorities - the current objectives relate to crimes of violence, obstruction of railways, actions which endanger customers and staff, graffiti and disruptions to services by suspect packages. The contract is used by the police committee, railway businesses and customers as a means of measuring the force's performance. Mr O'Brien believes that the establishment of a clear means of focusing on specific objectives has contributed to a reduction in crime levels and an increase in detection rates over the past three years. When British Transport Police advertises for senior officers it makes clear that - unlike the rest of the police service - successful applicants will be on fixed-term contracts and performance-related pay. 'There is no shortage of applicants willing to accept posts on these terms,' Mr O'Brien said. 'It is surely wrong that an officer should be appointed to a senior post at the age of 40 and remain in it for the next 20 years without any specific assessment of performance.' This is certainly the view of Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries and of the committee of inquiry into police pay and responsibilities whose report is being considered by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary. Sir Patrick believes the pay of senior officers, in particular, should be performance related, and this is unlikely to meet serious resistance in the police service. Chief constables are, however, much more apprehensive about the implications of extending some of the same principles - particularly fixed-term contracts  -to lower ranks. The Sheehy committee recommends that police officers should serve on initial 10-year contracts, subsequently renewed each five years. Some senior officers believe their ability to attract sufficient high-quality recruits, both graduates and non-graduates, would be undermined by the fear of possible dismissal after 10 years. They say all that is needed is a procedure making it easier for the service to shed under-performing individuals.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / US concern over chip exports The US will request special consultations with Japan over falling sales of US semi-conductors in the Japanese market, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington. With the Uruguay Round negotiations mostly behind them, US officials expect to focus on the thorny trade relationship with Japan, including the failure of Japanese companies to reserve at least 20 per cent of the Japan semi-conductor market for imports, as specified under the 1991 Semi-Conductor Arrangement. According to Miss Charlene Barshefsky, deputy US trade representative, the foreign market share for the third quarter of 1993 is believed to have fallen to about 18.5 per cent, down from 19.2 per cent during the second quarter and 20.2 per cent in the first quarter. US and Japanese officials are to meet this week to evaluate the numbers. In the special consultations, the US will present 'a variety of steps which we believe they can take to rectify the situation', said Miss Barshefsky. In a speech last week she said the area of greatest US concern was a proposal by the Japanese Cultural Affairs Ministry to permit a broad right of reverse engineering of computer software. 'This is not the law in the US; this is not the law in Europe. Any attempt to embark upon this course, which has very serious implication for our software producers and for US creativity and ingenuity in this area, would be met with great seriousness on the part of the US,' she said. She indicated dissatisfaction with the results of a bilateral agreement on Japanese government procurement of super computers. US super computers have won a few contracts but mostly when they were in partnership with Japanese companies or the US bids were uncontested. Miss Barshefsky also called into question Japan's commitment to ease foreign access to its cellular telephone market. It had agreed to develop an analogue cellular system in the Tokyo-Nagoya corridor which would then be supplied by foreign cellular telephone producers.</p>

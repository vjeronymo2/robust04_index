			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DRIVE-BY SHOOTING ENDS IN SECOND GANG-RELATED DEATH OF WEEKEND  </P> <P> One gang member was hit in the head and killed and a second was wounded early  Sunday by bullets fired from a passing car, authorities said.  </P> <P> The killing was the second gang-related death during the weekend. A 6-year-old  boy died Saturday of wounds he suffered in a Pomona drive-by shooting that was  apparently directed at a gang member nearby, police said.  </P> <P> Three other people were wounded in unrelated gang shootings, including a  15-year-old shot in the back and critically wounded in the Atwater Village area  of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In Compton, two men were in front of 210 E. Johnson St. when they were hit by  gunfire from a passing vehicle, Sgt. John Garrett said.  </P> <P> Both men were taken to the Dominguez Medical Center where a 23-year-old man  died of a gunshot wound to the head, he said. A 19-year-old man was treated for  an arm wound.  </P> <P> Both victims were identified as members of a local street gang and police  believe the attack was gang-related, he said. No arrests had been made.  </P> <P> A 16-year-old boy arrested in the Pomona shooting, which occurred Tuesday and  sparked a community march through a gang-infested neighborhood, will face  murder charges, police said.  </P> <P> The victim, Daniel Rodriguez, was wounded in the head by bullets that were  apparently intended for a gang member who was near him on the porch of a home  in the 300 block of East Monterey Avenue, Sgt. David Johnson said.  </P> <P> Rodriguez died at Pomona Valley Community Hospital about 1:45 a.m. Saturday,  Johnson said.  </P> <P> Also wounded in the attack was Olga Perez, 23, who lived at the home. She was  reported recovering from a head wound.  </P> <P> Just hours before the boy died, several hundred people carrying candles and  signs marched through a drug- and gang-infested neighborhood in Pomona.  </P> <P> In the Atwater Village area of northeast Los Angeles, a 15-year-old boy was  shot in the back and critically wounded in a drive-by shooting along La Clede  Avenue late Friday, Sgt. J.J. Cerniglia said.  </P> <P> In southwest Los Angeles, two men were slightly wounded in a drive-by shooting  along West 25th Street Friday night.  </P> <P> In a shooting that so far has not been linked to gangs, a man was killed on a  South-Central Los Angeles street corner and detectives had no motive for the  slaying, authorities said Sunday.  </P> <P> Nicky Miller, 31, was shot as he stood on the corner of Florence Avenue and  Cimarron Street about 5:45 p.m. Saturday, Lt. George Godwin said.  </P> <P> Miller died at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, he said. Detectives had not  established a motive for the killing and no arrests had been made, he said.  </P></p>

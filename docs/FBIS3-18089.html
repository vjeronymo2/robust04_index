			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Now to Brussels and the Swedish EU negotiations.  Less than an hour ago the decisive final negotiations were  started, and heavy going is expected in the case of the budget,  where the EU has said no to lowered fees and, instead, is  offering Sweden an extra sum of money.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] It takes two to tango, Swedish  Minister for Europe Ulf Dinkelspiel said in Brussels today at  his international news conference. [passage indistinct]    Sweden is negotiating with 12 countries who are having their  own internal games, but today the EU countries were finally  united on their offers. It is still a clear no to Sweden which  hoped for a lowered membership fee during the first few years.  Instead, Sweden is being offered a sum of money which is about  four million Swedish crowns, less than one-third the rebate  Sweden was hoping to get. Despite this, Sweden is still the  country with the best negotiation situation. Is Sweden going to  sign the deal without the other countries seeking membership, if  the other candidates stay behind, Minister for Europe Ulf  Dinkelspiel?    [Dinkelspiel] If we reach a satisfactory agreement and both  parties feel that it is time to sign the agreement, then we will  sign the agreement. But, our ambition and the ambition of the  EU is that all candidate countries will be able to conclude at  practically the same time, and we are going to work towards this  end.

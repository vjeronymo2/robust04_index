			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Exchange set to lose role in settlement The London Stock Exchange is likely to lose its lucrative role in equities settlement when the Crest computerised settlement system is in place. Yesterday the Bank of England announced that Swift, the international bank payments messaging system, and a consortium comprising Thomson Financial Services and Syntegra, a BT subsidiary, were the two finalists in the race to become the network provider within Crest. The successful bidder will carry electronic settlement and other messages to and from Crest and its users. The exchange has withdrawn its own bid. Following the collapse of the exchange's Taurus project for paperless share settlement, the Bank of England took responsibility for developing Crest, a more modest system to speed settlement. The exchange, which currently has sole responsibility for share settlement, has been seeking a role for itself since then. Earlier this year the Bank rejected a request from the exchange to purchase a 30 per cent stake in the Crest holding company. Had the exchange been successful in its bid to become the network provider, it could have secured a source of income to replace its current earnings from securities settlement. In the year to March 31, these were Pounds 55.8m, roughly a quarter of its revenues. A key factor in the exchange's decision to withdraw its bid is thought to be the Bank's insistance that it could not rely on the exchange's Sequal system, which confirms individual share transactions - a vital step in the settlement process. Sequal does not have the capacity to give and accept messages from all international participants in the London market and would have required significant investment in order to adapt to the needs of Crest. The exchange said: 'Our conclusion has been that the business case was not justified.' However it is still interested in becoming the operator of the Crest system.</p>

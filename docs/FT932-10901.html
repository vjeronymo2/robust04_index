			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Italian downgrade squeezes foreign investor base THE REPUBLIC of Italy's foreign currency debt rating has been lowered from Aa3 to A1 by Moody's, following a review by the US rating agency, but the decision is not expected to halt the Republic's plans to tap the global bond market. Italian officials have been considering a dollar-denominated global bond for some months, but were waiting for the result of the Moody's review, announced in March. However, the reduction means that the potential investor base for Italian debt will shrink, as some fund managers cannot buy debt rated below AA. Italy's foreign debt is still rated AA by Standard &amp; Poor's, which is widely viewed as less aggressive in its policy than Moody's. Dealers do not expect Italy's funding costs in the global bond market to rise further as a result of the downgrade, but the potential size of the issue may have to be reduced. Italy is expected to raise roughly Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn in the international capital markets this year, of which it has already issued about Dollars 3.5bn. Dealers said the downgrade had been largely discounted. In the dollar market, Italy's 8 3/4 per cent Eurobonds due 2001 widened from 100 to 107 basis points over the comparable US Treasury yield following the announcement. After the poor performance of Italy's debt at the end of last year, yield spreads widened dramatically and only steadied when the debt started to be asset-swapped. This means that, unlike most high-quality debt, gauged in terms of its yield spread above the relevant government bond, it is treated as a high-yielding floating-rate asset, viewed in terms of the margin over Libor produced by asset-swapping. In these terms, Italy's Eurobonds are trading at 50 basis points above Libor. The downgrade came a day before Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, former governor of the Bank of Italy, was due to present as prime minister his government's political and economic programme. Mr Ciampi is likely to use Moody's decision to underline the need for parliament to back continued austerity. Moody's said that the new government is committed to controlling the bloated public sector deficit, but 'the continuing uncertainty regarding the ability of future governments to maintain the required austerity over an extended period of time is higher than appropriate for a AA rating'. The out-going Amato government has already laid the basis for a L13,000bn mini-budget to correct a projected overshoot in spending in the 1993 budget and made plans for the 1994 budget to be drawn up by July. Mr Ciampi is expected to repeat these pledges and outline details on privatisation in order to recoup international credibility. Mr Ciampi was chosen as a non-parliamentarian to head Italy's 52nd post-war government, in part because of his clear identification to a commitment to fiscal austerity and improving Italy's public finances. Moody's also lowered the foreign currency debt ratings of Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Crediop, Banca Nationale del Lavoro, Banca Commerciale Italiana, Credito Italiano, Cassa di Risparmio di Torino, Cariplo and IMI to A1. Mercato Italiano Futures, the Italian screen-based futures exchange, plans to introduce new mechanisms for trading the spreads between different contracts. A calendar spread page, allowing investors to roll over from one contract month to the next, will be introduced on May 20. This will reduce the cost of rolling over contracts, which was previously more expensive than on the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange. A second spread page, allowing investors to trade the spread between the five and 10-year Italian government bond contracts, will be introduced at a later date.</p>

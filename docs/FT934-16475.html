			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK housebuilders The latest confusing house price figures from the Halifax illustrate the difficulty of trying to assess the health of the housing market. Part of the trouble is that no-one can remember what a 'normal' market should feel like, given the mind-bending experiences of recent years. The monthly comparisons are vaguely disappointing, the annual comparisons encouraging. Yet it should be remembered that last September, many house owners thought the UK economy had just fallen off the edge of the world as interest rates - momentarily - shot skywards. Nevertheless, the survey confirms the anecdotal impression that the housing market is gently drifting upwards, although not sufficiently quickly to have a significant impact on the prices either of houses or the materials used in their construction. Turnover remains muted for a variety of well-rehearsed reasons: the threat of unemployment has not abated; the negative equity trap still grips many; looming tax increases are unsettling confidence; real income growth remains depressed. Such a backdrop must be beginning to worry those investors who have bid up the construction and building materials sectors so enthusiastically. At present, the market seemingly wants to have it both ways on inflation. It partly justifies housebuilders' high P/E ratios because of the historically low cost of money which it believes will stimulate the market. But it conveniently overlooks the fact that the anticipated earnings recovery for housebuilders will crucially depend on the return of house price inflation.</p>

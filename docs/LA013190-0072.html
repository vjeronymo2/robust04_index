			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> ALBUM DEBUT IMPRESSIVE BY STEVIE SALAS COLORCODE  </P> <P> Island Records has just released the debut album by Stevie Salas ColorCode, the  rock 'n' roll power trio fronted by the Oceanside native.  </P> <P> Judging from the album, the 26-year-old guitarist and cohorts C.J. deVillar on  bass and Winston A. Watson on drums just might steal the show from Joe  Satriani, for whom they're opening Saturday and Sunday at the California  Theater downtown.  </P> <P> It's not just an impressive debut, but an impressive album, period. The 10  songs, all either written or co-written by Salas, are rooted in gut-smacking  hard rock (borderline heavy metal), but steeped in sweltering funk. This isn't  really surprising, given that two of the first people Salas worked with after  moving to Los Angeles in 1985 -- he spent the first half of the decade plying  the North County bar scene with This Kid's -- were George Clinton and Bootsy  Collins.  </P> <P> Collins, in fact, contributes a brief "long-distance telerap" to "Two Bullets  and a Gun," one of the album's standout tracks. The ingredients are all there:  a catchy melody, a ferocious beat, and Salas' delirious guitar pyrotechnics.  Other songs on which Salas' fingers do exceptionally fine gymnastics on the  frets are the funky, Living Colour-ish "Stand Up!" and "The Harder They Come,"  reminiscent of Aerosmith's "Walk This Way."  </P> <P> That Salas is an incredible guitarist is old news. After all, he spent nearly  two years on the road with Rod Stewart, playing the immortal licks, riffs,  solos, and fills originally laid down by Jeff Beck and Ronnie Wood.  </P> <P> The new news is that Salas is also a pretty amazing singer (all the other stuff  he's done, both on the road and in the studio, involved only his guitar). Salas  is certainly not your typical androgynous-sounding hard-rock shrieker; his  voice is rangy and resonant.  </P> <P> Indeed -- he's a veritable vocal chameleon, sounding, at times, like Prince  ("Just Like That"), the late Jimi Hendrix ("Indian Chief"), and even Joe Cocker  ("Over and Over Again").  </P> <P> Many San Diego acts have been signed to major labels in the last few years, but  very few have actually succeeded in making a national name for themselves.  Salas certainly has the talent and the credits to be in this elite minority.  </P> <P> The Progressive Stage Company downtown is now featuring live music every  Tuesday night. Rick Saxton and partner Rob Flury, working together as Uncle  Mother Productions, are producing concerts featuring local, original-music acts  you're not likely to see anywhere else in town.  </P> <P> Past performers include progressive funk-rock band Daddy Longlegs, veteran folk  singer Sam Hinton, acoustic folk-and-comedy duo the Rugburns, and topical  singer-songwriter Deborah Liv Johnson.  </P> <P> "They'd play the bars if they could, but the bar scene revolves around Top 40  and discos where people don't come out to hear music, but to have a social  scene," Saxton said. "Here, the music comes first -- no one's worried about  booze sales or picking up on somebody."  </P> <P> Appropriately enough, the Progressive Stage Company -- at 433 G St. -- holds  just 50 people and doesn't have a liquor license. The cover charge is $5.  </P> <P> "It's more of a concert scene," Saxton said. "The atmosphere we're trying to  create is completely different than Diego's."  </P> <P> Saxton and Flury initially began producing original-music concerts together  last summer, at the weekly Underground at the Lyceum in Horton Plaza. Last  November, they were hired to produce the Progressive Stage Company's Homegrown  Festival.  </P> <P> "We did all sorts of theater pieces and concerts, and when the festival ended,  we were asked to continue doing the Tuesday night concerts," Saxton said.  </P> <P> "And the response has been really good, both from the musicians and from the  crowds. There's so much great talent in San Diego, particularly from the  songwriter angle, that gets too little exposure."  </P> <P> Tuesday, the Progressive Stage Company will host a double bill: Latin-folk band  Kumara, from Tijuana, and the Transylvania String Quartet, which plays ethnic  folk music from Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: San Diego ticket brokers continue to accept "deposits" on choice  seats for upcoming local concerts that have yet to be booked, much less  announced -- more than likely, to improve their cash flow. Among the  speculative shows they advertised in last Thursday's Reader are might-happen,  might-not-happen appearances by Paul McCartney, the Grateful Dead, and New Kids  on the Block (Ideal Ticket Agency); Billy Joel, Eric Clapton, and Madonna  (Atlas Tickets); and Tom Petty, Billy Idol, and U2 (Trip Tickets). . . .  Surprise guest at last Friday's Afropop Dance Party at the Bacchanal in Kearny  Mesa: Zairean soukous superstar Tabu Ley, with seven musicians and dancers. . .  .  </P> <P> Jonathan Richman will be making a solo concert appearance Feb. 11 at the Belly  Up Tavern in Solana Beach. Richman is the former leader of the Modern Lovers, a  quirky New England band from the 1970s whose charter members include Cars  drummer Dave Robinson and Talking Heads keyboardist Jerry Harrison. . . .  Soundgarden, the hot new grunge-rock band from Seattle that Spin magazine  recently predicted "could become the metal band for people who hate metal,"  will be appearing Feb. 16 at Iguanas in Tijuana. The group's drummer, Matt  Cameron, is from San Diego. . . .  </P> <P> The Belly Up is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the  recovery of a black 1964 Fender Stratocaster guitar and a Fender Twin Reverb  amplifier stolen from the club on Jan. 5. The stuff belongs to Rosie Flores'  guitarist. . . . Actor-cum-rocker Dennis Quaid's expected one-night stand  Monday at the Belly Up has turned into a two-nighter. He'll perform Sunday  night as well. . . .  </P> <P> Best concert bets for the coming week: Molly Hatchet on Thursday at the  Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; the Beat Farmers, also Thursday, at the Belly Up; the  Jesus and Mary Chain and Nine Inch Nails on Friday at the California Theater;  Nite Soil Man, also Friday, at the Casbah in Middletown; the Pandoras Saturday  at the Spirit in Bay Park, and Leslie West on Sunday at the Bacchanal.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with heads of communist party delegations to </F> coordinating conference in Moscow on 21-22 May, by Yu. Igonin:  "We Are United by a Great Goal"]    [Text] Our correspondent asked the heads of the  communist party delegations two questions. FIRST: What are the  primary objectives of the communists of your party? SECOND: What  will it take to reestablish the Union of Soviet Socialist  Republics?    [R.G. Akhmedov (Azerbaijan)]    1. We are trying to build a strong organization under the  conditions of a brutal dictatorship and to strengthen our  influence in labor collectives, particularly among workers.    In spite of G. Aliyev's declaration that he will not allow  the resurgence of communist influence in Azerbaijan, we are  gaining more prestige each day, and our organizations have been  restored in almost all rayons, cities, neighborhoods, and  enterprises. We are now publishing the GOLOS KOMMUNISTA news  bulletin and have already submitted a registration application  for the KOMMUNIST newspaper.    2. During the establishment of a new type of union, we must  take the actual situation in each of the former republics of the  USSR into account. After all, conditions in our republics differ  widely, but there is also the main thing that unites us all: our  desire for unity and for the restoration of Soviet rule and the  socialist foundation.    [S.G. Badalyan (Armenia)]    1. We want to remove the ruling elite from power (legally, I  stress) and gradually emerge from the crisis.    The Communist Party of Armenia is in favor of united action  by the fraternal parties on an equitable basis, because we had  already announced our autonomy as early as 1990, at the 29th  Congress, and we have our own charter. This will not interfere,  however, with our membership in the Union of Communist Parties.    2. We are in favor of the creation of a new single union of  Soviet states, with a common economy, defense, transportation  network, and energy supply and a coordinated foreign policy, but  with the retention of sovereignty, although we know that we will  have to give up part of it. In principle, we are in favor of the  Leninist plan of confederation.    There is another important consideration: The formation of  the new union should be preceded by the retirement of Russia's  present rulers. After all, Russia is the basis of the new union.    [V.I. Novikov (Belorussia)]    1. Our main goal is to strengthen the party and enhance its  prestige among the workers. To this end, we are gradually moving  our organizational and propagandistic work directly into the  labor collectives.    The presidential election will be an important stage of our  work. I am my party's candidate for this office. What are our  chances? The polls indicate that they are not bad. In any case,  we collected more than twice the necessary 1,000 votes for  registration. We have a simple campaign slogan: We will return  what the "reformers" took away from the people and reestablish  the great nation of the Soviet Union.    Local government elections and the reestablishment of the  soviets will be the second stage of our work. This will be a  serious test for the party.    2. All of the communist parties of the former union  republics  must surmount the discord in our ranks and unite their efforts  in concrete action. This could include, for example, concerted  effort by parliamentary factions. We can work with our  supporters toward the denunciation of the Belovizh "accords" and  arrange for referendums in our republics on the reestablishment  of the USSR. According to various surveys, 86 percent of the  population of Belorussia is in favor of a renewed Soviet Union.    [I.G. Tsikhlauri (Georgia)]    1. We communists must inform the people of what is really  going on in Georgia. Like the parties in other republics, our  Communist Party was banned and we still have not reregistered.  Our main goal today is the restoration of party structures:  raykoms, gorkoms, and primary organizations, and we are  succeeding in doing this. Another goal is successful  participation in the upcoming elections, which will be fostered,  we hope, by the recently revived KOMMUNIST newspaper.    2. We know, of course, that the reestablishment of the  Soviet  Union will be impossible without the communists of the former  republics, but the ambitions of some leaders within the  communist movement must be set aside and we must agree on united  action.    The reestablishment of the Soviet Union should be initiated,  in my opinion, not by the center--not by Moscow or Russia--but  by another former union republic. I think this will serve our  cause better.    [K.A. Azhibekova (Kirghizia)]    1. Our main short-term goals are the restoration of party  structures and aggressive action to keep the "predatory  privatizers" from robbing the people.    Propagandists from the party are infiltrating enterprises  (although this is not a simple matter) and explaining to the  people there that only their active efforts can change things  for the better. To tell the truth, however, the communists have  won the strongest support in rural communities. Our raykoms  there are operating more effectively.    2. The former union republics are still too divided. This  means that we communists have to conduct painstaking work to  sway public opinion in support of united effort to revitalize  the USSR.    [I.V. Lopatin (Latvia)]    1. We want to continue establishing the structures of the  Union of Latvian Communists and hold the second republic  conference of the ULC this summer. We want to expand the social  base of our union, primarily by encouraging more workers to  join. We want all residents of Latvia to join the  struggle for the restoration of civil and political rights. We  will continue our efforts to register the ULC with the Latvian  Ministry of Justice.    2. In view of the present situation, Latvia's return to the  future union could be accomplished gradually through economic  alliances with other republics, participation in the union with  the status of a confederate member, and membership in the  federation.    Obviously, the decision in all of these cases must be made  by  the residents (or citizens) of Latvia by means of a referendum.    [Representative of Communist Party of Lithuania]    1. The ban on our Communist Party is recorded in the  constitution. That is why we have to stay so far underground.  What are we doing now? At this time we are restoring certain  organizations, and their members are opening people's eyes to  what is happening in Lithuania. This is producing results,  although they are still not that impressive. In conversations  (highly intimate ones between fewer than three individuals)  people are increasingly likely to say: "They should give us back  what we had in the USSR."    2. The unification of all of the communist parties of the  former union republics in a single fist would give us strong  leverage for the reestablishment of the USSR. After surmounting  our differences, we must make every effort to unite in a single  union of communist parties.    [A.K. Negutsa (Moldavia)]    1. We hope to register before 1 August and then hold a  congress of the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova  in fall. Now we are reestablishing structures on the local level.    2. The rebirth of the union will necessarily require us to  surmount the separation between the parties with communist aims.    [G.A. Zyuganov (CPRF)]    1. We feel that our main present goal is concerted effort by  leftist and patriotic forces and the coordination of our actions  in the struggle against the anti-people regime. During this  process, we must use legal parliamentary and extra-parliamentary  methods.    2. The restoration of the USSR and the Soviet Government is  the main purpose of CPRF activity and our highest priority. In  the recently published policy-planning documents of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation, we stated that "we  are in favor of cooperation by communist parties active in the  Russian Federation, on the condition of the  acknowledgement of the need to reestablish the union state  on a voluntary basis; the restoration of the soviet system of  government...."    [M.A. Rotko (Turkmenistan)]    1. We want to enhance the party's prestige among the  workers,  who have, we can report with pride, retained their respect for  communists for the most part; preserve the Leninist creative  legacy; lower the average age of party members and encourage VUZ  instructors and students to join our ranks (which is already  occurring); and acquire stronger influence at enterprises.    2. The reestablishment of the USSR should begin with the  establishment of close economic ties between former union  republics and the consolidation of friendship between our  peoples. This will be followed by the political aspects of the  process.    [Sh.D. Shabdolov (Tajikistan)]    1. Our immediate objective is to attain power legally  through  parliamentary elections. Our chances are superb. Suffice it to  say that we already have the largest faction in the present  parliament--more than 40 percent of all the deputies. Our  raykoms, gorkoms, and obkoms are active on the local level. The  average age of our party members is around 40.    We also have another goal: We want to win local elections. I  think we will.    2. As for the reestablishment of the USSR, we have formed  special councils on the rayon, municipal, oblast, and republic  levels to unite the efforts of the workers for this purpose.    People are attracted to us and are pinning their hopes on  the  communists.    [A.I. Martynyuk (Ukraine)]    1. The presidential elections and the election campaigns for  the Supreme Council in 112 districts will be held soon. We are  getting ready for them.    Another of the party's goals is to make the necessary  preparations for elections to local councils, which will get rid  of the president's "appointees" on the local level. This is  where many decisions are being made now that the government in  Kiev is almost paralyzed (and this is a fact!).    2. Unity is the only thing that will save us all,  but this process must not be forced (although the communists  should not "doze off" either), because the different conditions  in the former union republics of the USSR must be taken into  account.    [Representative of the Communist Party of Estonia]    1. Our main immediate objective is the legalization of the  activities of our Communist Party, which was banned when the  bourgeois government took power. Another objective is the  restoration of party structures on the local level. This is a  difficult job, but it can be done.    Another important part of the work of Estonia's communists  entails efforts to secure dual citizenship for individuals of  non-native nationalities and the approval of the Russian  language as a language of interpersonal communication.    2. It is time for all of the communist parties of the former  union republics to agree on a single stance on this  matter. Obviously, the distinctive features of the current  situation in different regions of the former USSR must be taken  into account. Furthermore, the existence of so many communist  parties in Russia can only hurt our common cause. It is time for  the comrades who are wasting their strength and energy on  self-assertion to realize this.</p>

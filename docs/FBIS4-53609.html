			<p>BFN     [Text] On 16 May, the government decided it should not be  too insistent in mentioning the pending Japan-Russia issue over  the northern territories in a statement to be adopted at the  Naples summit (seven industrialized nations talks) in July.  This was disclosed by a Foreign Ministry source.    Giving a reason for this decision, the source noted the  "Tokyo Declaration" issued by Japan and Russia last October  confirms the validity of the 1956 Japan-Soviet Joint  Declaration, which clearly states the return of two of the  northern islands to Japan. The source said: "Basically, this  is an issue that should be discussed bilaterally from now on."  The government also appears to be thinking that separating the  territorial issue from the Russian aid question would be more  helpful in gaining understanding of the international community  [on its policy over Russia].    Words of support for a "settlement" of the northern  territories issue have been included in political declarations  and chairmen's statements three times since the Houston summit  (in the United States) in 1990. But at the Tokyo summit held  last year, direct reference to the dispute was avoided on the  ground that "this was already a known fact among G-7 (seven  industrialized) nations." Instead, a political statement issued  by the summit expressed hope that Russia will "promote diplomacy  based on the principle of law and justice."    The issue of how to handle the matter was raised again this  time because Russia is now expected to take part in political  discussions in the Naples summit.    However, the government apparently has arrived at the  decision because "the course of negotiations has already been  set" (according to the source) by the Tokyo Declaration issued  when Russian President Boris Yeltisn visited Japan last fall.  The government is also aware that the summit-participating  nations want to keep declarations and statements issued simple  this time, and appears to be giving consideration to Russia,  which is expected to join political discussions at the summit.</p>

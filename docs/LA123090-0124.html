Rancho  Santiago led, 51-36, at the half and just kept rolling.  </P> <P> Every Rancho Santiago starter was in double figures as the starters combined  for 89 points.

San Antonio 64 -- Edmond Johnson made six free throws and  Ray Ankton four in the final two minutes for Saddleback (9-7).  </P> <P> Mt.

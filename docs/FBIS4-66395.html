			<p>CSO     [Text] China is about to embark upon the construction of  the largest transonic wind tunnel in Asia. The contract-signing  ceremony for the construction of the facility took place in  Chengdu on 15 April [1994]. Vice Minister Shen Chunnian of the  Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National  Defense and Ma Lin, deputy governor of Sichuan Province were  among those who attended the ceremony.    The wind tunnel is an indispensable piece of ground  simulation equipment for research on aircraft and space vehicles  and provides aerodynamic data on these flying bodies under  different speeds and flight conditions. It is possible to  satisfy the requirements for aerodynamic testing of flying  bodies only with a large-scale wind tunnel that provides  realistic model aircraft, good flow field conditions and high  measurement accuracy.</p>

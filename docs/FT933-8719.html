			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): UBS delights Swiss bank supporters HIGHLIGHTS of the day included reaction to the UBS results in Switzerland and the consolidation of overnight gains in Germany, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH powered ahead after UBS unveiled a net profit rise of 89 per cent, confounding even the most optimistic estimates of around 50 per cent. The SMI index rose 39.3 or 1.6 per cent at to an all-time high of 2,450.0, amid broadly based buying by domestic and foreign investors. UBS added SFr22 to SFr1,221 after a record intra-day high of SFr1,235 and the upbeat mood spilled over to the other banks which are also due to report soon. SBC rose SFr14 to SFr478 and CS Holding was SF80 ahead at SFr2,860. Among industrials, Sandoz registered shares added SFr115 to SFr3,165 as the group confirmed that it was expecting a stronger second half performance. FRANKFURT incorporated Wednesday's post-bourse climb to 1,894.63 as the DAX index broke 1,900 to close 39.15, or 2.1 per cent higher at 1,904.95. It appeared to be going for a repeat performance yesterday afternoon as the the Ibis-indicated DAX approached 1,920, although it subsided later to 1,908.76. Turnover jumped from DM8.4bn to DM12.2bn. Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities said that any time the market has faltered recently, American buyers have come in - compensating for potential currency losses on the rising dollar by buying dollar-sensitive, German exporters. One of Germany's super-sensitive stocks, Volkswagen, showed the American effect yesterday, rising DM15 to DM384.50 over the official session, and as high as DM399, 8 per cent up on the day in the post-bourse before easing to DM393. Other cyclical exporters like Daimler, engineers and steels showed up well, Thyssen in particular climbing DM12.50 to DM218. Mr Nigel Longley, at Commerzbank, said that UK and, later, US buying yesterday left domestic traders effectively short. 'They didn't have the shares to cope with US afternoon demand,' he said. MILAN held up firmly for much of the session but some late profit-taking left shares off their best levels and the Comit index finished just 2.18 better, at a high for the year of 590.96. Ferruzzi and Montedison resumed trading after their two-day suspension. Analysts believed that short covering helped Ferruzzi to recoup a large part of its early losses to finish L120 or 28.6 per cent lower at L299. The shares were marked 75 per cent down at L101 in early trading. Montedison fell 20 per cent at the opening, but finished L59.5, or 7.7 per cent lower at L710, its announcement of an increase in first-half operating profit giving support. Olivetti, L56 higher at L2,115 and its parent, Cir, L70 higher at L1,700, were unable to maintain their best levels of the day. Both had gained strongly in recent days on renewed rumours that DEC of the US might want an increased Olivetti stake. AMSTERDAM continued its record breaking run, but closed below its best in busy, volatile trading. The CBS Tendency index rose 1.3 to 128.40. KLM set an intra-day high for the year of Fl 38.90 after reporting a small rise in first quarter net profit. But profit-taking trimmed the gain to Fl 1.00 at Fl 37.60. Fokker closed Fl 1.70 firmer at Fl 23.00 on news of a US order. Hoogovens, the steel and aluminium group, closed Fl 1.20 lower at Fl 50.10 after a wave of profit-taking which pushed it to a low of Fl 47.10. Continuing demand for cyclicals pushed Akzo, the chemical group, up Fl 3.40 to Fl 173.90 and KNP BT, the paper maker, Fl 1.30 higher to Fl 38.90. PARIS ended weaker after setting a record intra-day high, dealers blaming profit-taking as the CAC-40 index closed 5.52 lower at 2,161.87 after an earlier peak of 2,179.04. Turnover stayed high at FFr5.6bn. Michelin, one of the week's strong performers, lost FFr3.70 at FFr195.50. Gains remained in laggards like Club Mediterranee and Eurodisney, up FFr18 to FFr447.90, and FFr2.40 to FFr65.50 respectively. MADRID set a new 1993 high, the general index closing 4.30, or 1.6 per cent higher at 278.48 as turnover rose from Pta20.7bn to Pta25.4bn. In banks, Banesto extended Wednesday's climb on its funding successes, rising Pta325 to Pta3,000 for a two-day gain of 12.9 per cent; this time it was followed by Argentaria, Pta200 higher at Pta5,950. STOCKHOLM rallied after the central bank lowered its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 8.0 per cent. The Affarsvarlden index rose 26.8, or 2.1 per cent to a year's high of 1,287.1. COPENHAGEN climbed in lively trading with exporters benefiting from the lower krone and the KFX index rose 1.49 to 96.18. Novo Nordisk slipped DKr2 to DKr545 as foreign investors took profits. OSLO soared 3 per cent in record volume as hopes built up for lower interest rates. The all-share index jumped 16.96 to 580.59 turnover of NKr1.14bn. BRUSSELS turned its attention to industrial stocks, and the market closed sharply higher but off morning record levels after some profits were taken. The Bel-20 index rose 15.83 or 1.2 per cent to 1,365.70 in turnover of BFr1.9bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August 12                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1280.44     1280.22     1280.44     1279.42 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1363.13     1360.64     1359.91     1359.41  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1278.91     1281.51     1282.59     1280.84 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1357.28     1359.62     1361.42     1359.88  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Aug 11    Aug 10     Aug 9     Aug 6     Aug 5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1274.70   1261.80   1269.95   1272.34   1268.56 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1354.98   1348.51   1352.97   1348.44   1340.80  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1283.43; 200 - 1363.18 Low/day: 100 - 1278.63  200 - 1356.61.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Bundesbank's faith in M3 creates schism: The smashing of the central bank's 'plaster saint' The Bundesbank, arguably the most respected institution in Germany, was given a toasting by its warmest supporters yesterday; the local media's financial commentators. The target was the central bank's reliance for monetary guidance on its prized but eccentric monthly M3 money supply figures. The Suddeutsche Zeitung's crisp assessment - 'a compass that swings to every rusty nail is not much use' - was widely shared, if not always so succinctly put. Like the best criticism, the judgements were sharp but well-intentioned. Brickbats from left and right seemed intended to warn the central bank that its credibility - its greatest asset, as it says itself - was being tarnished by its over-reliance on wonky M3 data. Nor was its dignity helped by the need to issue tortuous explanations of why the figures never quite seemed to come under control. Damage assessments in the wake of the whirlwind unleashed on financial markets by Wednesday's figures, showing 20 per cent annualised monetary growth in January, agreed that experience showed the early figures in any year were not worth the beans they were counted on. But enough was enough for the left-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau. 'After 20 years the Bundesbank can stick its money supply concept in the shredder,' it suggested. Handelsblatt, the financial daily, agreed in its own quiet way. 'German money supply policy is threatened with a fate similar to that of attempted monetary steering in the US and Britain,' it said. Reminding readers that Germany and Switzerland were the only countries still sticking to a policy based on money supply, it said such a concept could work only if the relationship between money supply and inflation was clear and stable. 'But a monetary policy loses its rudder when the relationship keeps collapsing,' it added. In these circumstances, the desire of the Bundesbank to have its faith in M3 taken seriously was not easily fulfilled. The Suddeutsche Zeitung, sharpest of all, said financial markets looked up to M3 'like a plaster saint' precisely because the bank continued to hold it in such high esteem. 'The market hardly noticed the warning signs (about an inflated January figure) put out by the Bundesbank itself: even experts cannot change their views so swiftly. 'Now everyone has received the bill. But the gentlemen of the central bank council are apparently still trying to stick their plaster saint together again.' The Suddeutsche's view reflected a consensus that the Bundesbank was unlikely to be persuaded to change its ways, least of all under pin-pricks from the press. Handelsblatt, too, expected it to hold on, hoping that M3 would regain some value as an indicator, at least until the time came for European monetary union. There was some evidence that a pan-European money supply aggregate was more stable than that of a single nation, it suggested, offering a sop to the bank's ambitions to have its methods adopted by Emu. 'Until then, we will have ample opportunities to witness 'monetary pragmatism' at work at the top of the Bundesbank: that is, the art of presenting a policy in a different light whenever circumstances require it.'</p>

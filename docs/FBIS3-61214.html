[Text] Academician Mikayel Kotanyan, a well-known  economist in this republic, heads the National Academy's  Institute of Economic Sciences. At a time when the young and  inexperienced leaders in power were breaking all economic ties  with Russia one after another, in the naive belief that this  meant liberation from colonial rule, M. Kotanyan was one of the  few economists to raise a voice against that naive policy, the  bitter fruits of which we are now tasting. It is not too late to  make use of his knowledge and experience. We present below an  interview with Mikayel Kotanyan by Candidate of Economic  Sciences Suren Gevorgyan.    [Gevorgyan] Mikayel Khachiki, it has been almost three  years now that the republic's leadership has been trying to  change over to a market economy. What is the present level of  the economy?    [Kotanyan] First of all we must bear in mind that  in governmental and economic policy the market is not simply a  goal but rather a means of achieving improvement in public  affairs, of raising living standards, and of satisfying needs.  Therefore the transition to a market economy must be  accomplished by means of raising the level of prosperity, not by  worsening living standards. Living standards have declined in  particular this past year. This was a result of an incorrect  economic policy. Under conditions of freeing of prices and an  economic decline, retail prices on necessities sharply increased  in comparison with the same period last year. Armenia showed the  highest prices for foodstuffs among all the CIS member states.  It was calculated that, according to figures for the first  quarter of 1993, the per capita cost of a minimum market basket  in Armenia amounted to 12,476 rubles per month. And this was in  conditions where the average pay for a state employee for the  first quarter of 1993 was 4508 rubles, an average of 2500 rubles  per person per month, while consumer spending was a mere 950  rubles (1490 rubles when counting in the month of June).    Unemployment in this republic is growing day by day. These  government figures represent the true state of affairs as  regards the people's living standards. All this attests to the  fact that this republic is at a critical point in the decline of  living standards.    [Gevorgyan] The government considers transition to a  market economy to be the cornerstone of privatization....    [Kotanyan] Ensuring diversity of property  ownership is one of the important conditions of a transition to  a market economy. The issue at hand is by what method diversity  of property ownership is being accomplished, by what principles  of social justice, and under conditions of what socioeconomic  situation. To accomplish this, those conditions selected as a  point of departure must not worsen the condition of the people,  but should ensure a stable rise in living standards, rather than  putting additional stress into the social situation. Thus  privatization and multiple ownership is merely a precondition  for transition to a market economy, not a solution to the  problem, as is naively believed by the top people in our  republic's economy. They believe that privatization will solve  the problems of transition to a market economy and that we shall  immediately find ourselves in a common market-economy  association with countries that enjoy a high level of  production, technological sophistication, and civilized  socioeconomic relations. All this is merely a pipe dream. There  are many countries in the world that have private ownership of  one type or another but still cannot even think about  transitioning from a simple bazaar-type economy to sophisticated  market relations.    [Gevorgyan] Are the results of land privatization not  proof of what you say? The republic's agriculture has been  thrown back to the level of the 1960's.    [Kotanyan] Land privatization in this republic was  carried out in a most unsophisticated fashion; its purpose was  not so much the development of agriculture as the speedy  dismantling of the existing economic system. This task was  entrusted to persons who had no knowledge whatsoever of the  village or of agriculture. The land, livestock, and property  were simply squandered, farms and agricultural complexes ruined,  with nobody giving any thought to the question of what food  supplies the government would use to feed the urban population  and the military or what raw materials would be supplied to  light industry and food processing industry still under  government operation. Incidentally, land privatization has not  been carried out at such a bold pace and scale in any other  country. Even in the German states following reunification, in  conditions of a powerful West German economy, East Germany's  economic structures were not demolished. They have been  maintained, and are gradually being restructured. 80 percent of  the farm operations are being maintained, in spite of the fact  that the state is providing economic incentive to stimulate  development of the farm economy. This is due to the fact that  certain economic conditions are necessary for transition to a  privatized farm economy, and certain economic conditions are  essential as well to ensure that people are psychologically  prepared to work as independent individuals.    [Gevorgyan] Efforts are presently being made to argue  that if collective farms and state farms had been preserved, by  now they would have been looted and plundered. Is this not an  involuntary admission of the government's powerlessness to  preserve state property?    [Kotanyan] That is truly a result of self-delusion  and ignorance. Even today the state farms which were preserved  to one extent or another are the only sources for replenishing  meager state food supplies. One can read statistics to become  convinced of this. The fact is that state farms, in addition to  "feeding" themselves, also allocate food supplies to the state,  while the contemporary farmer is accumulating assets; the farmer  has forgotten his duty to give a portion to the state....    On the whole the economy has become a system out of control,  which is careening toward the abyss. Suffice it to note that  generated national income in 1992 was approximately equal to the  1975 level, declining by 42.6 percent in comparison with 1991,  while gross output has dropped correspondingly by 39.4 percent.    [Gevorgyan] This decline has continued in the first  quarter of this year, while the newly-appointed prime minister  had promised to halt the economic downswing within this period  of time.    [Kotanyan] That is absolutely right. According to  the 1993 socioeconomic development program submitted by the  government, the target is to boost industrial output volume 32.3  percent, while according to figures for the first quarter it  amounts to only 48.6 percent of the total for the corresponding  period in 1992. This means that the new government has failed to  halt the swift decline of the economy. All figures pertaining to  economic results in comparison with the previous year are  negative numbers. There is no point in speaking about growth or  even about stabilizing the economy.    [Gevorgyan] Incidentally, the prime minister has  addressed the Supreme Council requesting postponement of this  month's accountability report....    [Kotanyan] He is doing the appropriate thing,  since he has nothing to say.... The previous prime minister  resigned because of the flimsiness of the present prime  minister's submitted plan, which was approved by the  parliament.... The new prime minister, however, has not  implemented any part of this plan. None of the economic  statistics are positive. This, as well as what the people think  about the situation, are of no importance to the prime minister.  Of importance is the fact that the president of the republic is  pleased with his work. It is "God's" will, not the people's  will....    It is simply amazing how, after all of this, government  officials, including the president and the prime minister, can  calmly tell the people that progress has occurred in our  societal and economic affairs. Can they really believe that the  people have lost their ability to reason and that they believe  "their chosen saviors"?    [Gevorgyan] Mr Kotanyan, do you see any way out of this  difficult economic situation?    [Kotanyan] Ensuring the physical survival of the  people and solving the fundamental issue of social protection  have become a matter of paramount importance in this republic  today. In past years, however, this issue was not substantially  addressed in the government's plan of action, while it was  totally absent in the plan for 1993. The goal can be achieved  through a system of state guarantee of minimum means of  existence. There must be established on the one hand a certain  relationship between prices for the minimum means of existence  and fixed prices, and on the other hand between wages, minimum  pension and subsidy amounts. Each and every citizen must be  provided with foodstuffs of various types, in a guaranteed  manner, by the state, and this also applies to an assured annual  ration of clothing, including footwear, which should be provided  at very low prices on a quota basis to every citizen of this  republic, with the addition of a system of compensation for paid  and municipal services. The state must take over the task of  solving the problem of ensuring physical means of existence,  securing the necessary resources by means of state procurement,  humanitarian aid, and other means. This is the foremost, urgent  item in this republic under present conditions.    The next most important issue is the drawing up of a complex  program of the republic's economic development. This must be  grounded on the preservation and further development of the  genetic resources of our people. With its centuries-old history,  the Armenian people have proven that it displays exceptional  skills in the fields of science and education, literature and  music, the applied arts, aesthetics and sculpture, architecture  and construction, engineering, and commerce. Securing and  further development of the above by the state is the most rapid  and reliable way to implement reforms in this republic and to  make an early entry into the world market. Unfortunately the  state is promoting primarily an unregulated, profiteering system  of commerce, and this greatly aggravates the social situation.    Finally, one must clearly recognize that the long duration  of  the process of worsening of the people's standard of living and  the absence of programs to correct the situation at the present  time seriously endanger the prospects of transition to a market  economy, and it becomes unacceptable to people. This situation  essentially means collapse of the process of reforms, and this  can be of fateful significance to the future of the republic.    [Gevorgyan] Development of the economy is essentially  dictated by the system of government management. Can one  consider the presently functioning system to be productive?    [Kotanyan] Essentially the republic and economic  management model is a repeat of the Russian Federation model.  Russia is an extremely large state, with its population as well  as its resources and territory. It therefore definitely needed  substantial decentralization of the economic management system  and a broadening of local (state, autonomous republics, etc)  functions, in order to give many of the entities below the  national level a status of specific economic management and  regulation. This is a characteristic of a multinational state  which possesses ethnic and territorial integrity.    The Republic of Armenia is a small state, which assumes,  based on the scale of the state, a state system of government,  and therefore it requires a very limited decentralization of  economic management. If we add to this our distinctive, specific  geopolitical requirements, it will become apparent that the  Russian variation of decentralization of economic management is  unacceptable for our republic. The group which is carrying out  our "economic reforms," however, lacking knowledge of our  republic, failed to grasp those distinctive features and was  unable to tailor legislative formulations to these features. The  only solution was to repeat (with cursing and adjustment to the  Armenian pattern) the Russian orientation, Russia's adopted  resolutions, laws and decisions.    One other important and disturbing question deals with  choosing a system of state management which will further promote  democratization of the country's political and economic affairs  and will ensure further growth. We should note in this regard  that none of the CIS countries, including Armenia, is ready for  a presidential system of government.    Presidential government requires an appropriate political  sophistication, an arena for economic and law-related activities  in which each citizen, political and public organization  functions only following laws developed on the basis of a  democratic constitution, and where there is no possibility of  violation of the constitution at all levels of government. In  order to create such a situation, a certain period of time is  required for psychological restructuring of the people.    This applies in equal measure both to the masses and to  officials involved in economic management. It follows from this  that in Armenia the parliamentary system of government must be  maintained for the foreseeable future.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Kobe Steel Ltd. became the last of Japan's big integrated steelmakers to join  with a comparable U.S. producer when it announced a joint venture with USX  Corp. in Pittsburgh. Kobe will pay an undisclosed sum to buy half of USX's  Lorain, Ohio, plant. The deal is at least the 11th such joint venture completed  or under consideration. Analysts said the Japanese seek the ventures because  import quotas and unfavorable currency exchange rates make it hard for  foreigners to penetrate U.S. markets. American firms see the Japanese as a  source of capital and expertise in producing high-quality steel for autos, the  metal's biggest end use.  </P></p>

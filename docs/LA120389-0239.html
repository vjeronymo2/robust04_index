			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISNEYLAND FREEDOM BOWL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> IRVINE MISSES CHANCE AS TIME RUNS OUT  </P> <P> An aggressive, brash UC Irvine team took the Bren Center court for the  Disneyland/Freedom Bowl tournament championship game against Tennessee  Chattanooga Saturday.  </P> <P> The Anteaters, brimming with confidence after their first victory of the season  Friday, ran out to a quick lead.  </P> <P> But things changed dramatically late in the first half. Point guard Rod Palmer  sprained his right knee trying to take a charge against the Moccasins' Derrick  Kirce with 4:43 left and sat out the rest of the game.  </P> <P> Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan replaced him with Dylan Rigdon, a freshman from  Mater Dei High School.  </P> <P> The Anteaters were never the same after that. If anything they played harder,  but still lost, 74-72.  </P> <P> Irvine fouled guard Eric Spivey with 10 seconds left in the game. He missed the  front end of the one-and-one and the Anteaters rushed the ball upcourt.  </P> <P> They worked the ball to streak-shooting guard Justin Anderson, who drove toward  the basket. He tossed up an off-balance 15-footer as he crashed into a couple  of Tennessee Chattanooga defenders.  </P> <P> The shot was off the mark but the Bren Center crowd of 2,281 cheered wildly,  anticipating a foul that would put Anderson on the line with two seconds left.  </P> <P> But Anderson was called for charging, and Tennessee Chattanooga hung on for the  victory.  </P> <P> "We ran what we call a made shot (fast)break," Mulligan said. "(Rob) Doktorczyk  throws it to Rigdon. He's supposed to drive. And we have (Jeff) Herdman and  Anderson on the wings."  </P> <P> It worked perfectly to that point.  </P> <P> "Justin's going to put it up or drive," Mulligan said. "He just ran over the  guy. It was a good call."  </P> <P> The loss drops Irvine to 1-3. Tennessee Chattanooga is 4-0.  </P> <P> In the consolation game, Bucknell defeated Navy, 67-66, on forward Greg  Leggett's 10-foot jumper at the buzzer.  </P> <P> Despite losing, Mulligan was encouraged by the way the Anteaters played without  Palmer, who averages 16 points and five assists.  </P> <P> "We were more emotional in the second half," Mulligan said. "We were ready to  play."  </P> <P> Without Palmer, who will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging examination  Monday, Mulligan turned to his bench and got a big lift from three freshman,  including Rigdon.  </P> <P> Rigdon, who scored two points and had three rebounds in 21 minutes, Craig  Marshall (five points) and Jeff Von Lutzoq (two points) had "a real baptism" as  Mulligan put it.  </P> <P> Ricky Butler led the Anteaters with 23 points and 13 rebounds, both season  highs. Butler, a 6-foot-7 center, has played well since taking off the heavy  bandage that had been protecting his broken hand.  </P> <P> "He's been fine since he got that garbage off his hand," Mulligan said.  </P> <P> Anderson added 12, Herdman had 11 and Doktorczyk 10 for the Anteaters.  </P> <P> Kirce, named the tournament most valuable player, led the Moccasins with 23  points. His two free throws gave Tennessee Chattanooga a 74-70 lead with 27  seconds left.  </P> <P> Anderson scored on a follow shot with 13 seconds left, then the Anteaters  fouled Spivey, whose miss gave them one last chance at sending the game into  overtime.  </P> <P> "Not having Palmer hurt us," Mulligan said. "But you have to adjust. People  look in the paper and they see we lost, 74-72."  </P> <P> Irvine trailed by only 35-32 at halftime despite shooting 38% from the field.  They improved to 46% for the game.  </P> <P> Until Palmer was injured, the Anteaters had played well.  </P> <P> They slowed Terry Brent, who was averaging 21.5 points coming into the game to  lead the Moccasins in scoring.  </P> <P> He had just six at halftime, 13 for the game, and was not a factor late in the  game.  </P> <P> Irvine led by as many as five points, the last time after Butler's follow shot  made it, 18-15.  </P> <P> Tennessee Chattanooga rallied to take the lead, pushing its advantage to 35-29.  </P> <P> But Anderson's three-point basket just before halftime cut it to 35-32. The  Moccasins had one last chance to score, but reserve guard Tyrone Enoch,  apparently unaware time was running out, dribbled out the final seconds without  trying to shoot.  </P> <P> "We shot poorly from the free throw line," Mulligan said of the Anteaters' 60%  mark. "He had too many turnovers (18). Things like that hurt."  </P> <P> So, too, did not having the steadying influence of Palmer for more than half  the game.  </P> <P> Anteater Notes  </P> <P> Rod Palmer was not the only injured Anteater Saturday. Reserve guard Ben  Rishwain, a walk-on who's become something of a cult hero to the Bren Center  fans, broke the index finger on his left hand in the first half. . . . The  all-tournament team: Justin Anderson and Ricky Butler of Irvine, Terry Brent of  Tennessee Chattanooga, Greg Leggett of Bucknell and Eddie Reddick of Navy.  </P></p>

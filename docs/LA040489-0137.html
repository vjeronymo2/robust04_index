			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BARRY SANDERS ADMITTED TO NFL DRAFT  </P> <P> Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders was granted admission to the NFL draft  today, just three days after the Oklahoma State junior running back asked for a  special exemption to turn pro.  </P> <P> NFL spokesman Joe Browne said Sanders, a true junior with a year of eligibility  left, is being allowed into the April 23 draft because Oklahoma State is on  NCAA probation and because he is leaving school with the blessing both of Coach  Pat Jones and Athletic Director Myron Roderick.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-9, 183-pound Sanders rushed for 2,628 yards -- including four games  of at least 300 yards -- and 39 touchdowns last season. He is expected to be  chosen extremely high -- perhaps third by the Detroit Lions, who have expressed  a strong interest in him.  </P></p>

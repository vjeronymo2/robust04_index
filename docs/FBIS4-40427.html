			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 16 June TASS -- Secret voting is to be held in  the Ukrainian parliament on Thursday [16 June] on the  endorsement of Vitaliy Masol's appointment as Ukrainian prime  minister. The parliament adopted this decision on Wednesday  after a programme statement by the candidate to the post of  prime minister.    Masol, specifically, said he believes "Ukraine must continue  developing as an independent democratic rule-of-law state. The  strengthening of its sovereignity and preservation of  territorial integrity should be common concern". Masol believes  "Ukraine needs equal and friendly relations with countries of  the CIS and above all with Russia in order to preserve its own  independence".    Masol holds that to overcome the crisis it is necessary to  step up the pace of economic reform, transfer to market  relations and ensure equality of all forms of property. The  government should ease taxation on entrepreneurial structures  engaged in production and processing of farm produce, in the  construction industry and in communal services.    Masol believes that support by credits, banking services on  easy terms and ensurance against commercial risks should be  offered to these areas. He said that the main purpose now is  not to levy exorbitant taxes and drawing up an unrealistic basis  but to ease taxation and envigorate the economy, enabling work  collectives to work calmly and people to receive their earnings.  Masol believes taxes should not exceed 17 percent of profits.    He said there are two approaches to land privatisation. Land  can be rented for the construction of various social facilities  for 49 years, also to foreign investors, or else land can be  offered for long-term use with the right of inheritance.    Masol expressed the conviction that it takes the effort of  all branches of power to solve all problems.</p>

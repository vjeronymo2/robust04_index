			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Adjusting to reality Whatever the size of the cut in German interest rates we are promised from this morning's Bundesbank meeting, there are two possible conclusions to be drawn from the weekend's currency excitements. One is that the European Monetary system has again become the system of fixed but adjustable rates which its founders intended. In recent years, as realignments became increasingly rare, Europe had seemed to be on its way towards monetary union by inertia: now, the markets have forced a reversion to flexibility. Fixed exchange rates will have to come about by fiat - through the Maastricht treaty or some later reprise - rather than by default. A second conclusion might be that German interest rates are now, inexorably, heading down - and with them, rates in the rest of Europe. On this view, there might be a hiccup or two on the way, if the Bundesbank's backwoodsmen were able to rally their forces, but the growing weakness of the German economy would ensure that any re-tightening was momentary rather than sustained. For most markets, these two conclusions lead in directly contrary directions. For over a year, investors have been expecting to treat the turn in German interest rates as a buying signal. Yet the newly demonstrated adjustability of the ERM makes weak currencies such as sterling that much more vulnerable. But even for stronger currencies, last night's realignment holds a message. It places the responsibility for convergence on the shoulders of politicians rather than central banks. The Maastricht ratification process has shown how little prepared they are to carry that burden. There is one market, however, for which only half of this pair of matched conclusions applies. The dollar stands to gain from a sustained reduction in German interest rates, but is exempt from Europe's convergence neurosis. If the markets really believe that the turn has come in D-Mark interest rates, the dollar will show the impact most clearly. One other market will be particularly sensitive in the coming days - not least because it will be the one the Bundesbank watches most closely. The German bond market will doubtless rally in the wake of the cut in short-term rates. The critical question is how far that rally will go, and whether it succumbs to second thoughts. A weak rally, or one that is reversed in a matter of weeks, would be a vote of no confidence in the Bundesbank's ability to pursue anti-inflationary policies independent of political pressure. That would not reverse the medium-term direction of European interest rates; but it would put a floor under them well above the levels which are currently failing to reignite the US.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] Official spokespersons for the Army Information and  Press Department [DIDE] have blamed the URNG [Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity] for a terrorist attack early  Sunday morning on the route to the Atlantic area.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] What information do you have on  the explosion at the bridge over the San Juan River?    [Unidentified DIDE spokesperson] Once more the URNG has  attacked Guatemalan society. This time they have blown up the  San Juan Bridge located at the 20-kilometer marker on the  highway to the Atlantic area.    For the time being, the Guatemalan Army Corps of Engineers  is  working in the area to put a Bailey bridge in place. This  Bailey bridge costs 2,530,562 quetzales, and repairs to the  bridge that was blown up will cost approximately 5 million  quetzales. This ungrateful action by the URNG will cost  Guatemalans 7,530,652 quetzales.    In addition, the action involves costs in the economic,  business, and transportation sectors, as well as the threat and  danger posed to the Guatemalan people at the time of the  explosion. The Guatemalan people are still running a risk while  the bridge is being repaired.    [Reporter] What type of explosives were used this time?    [DIDE spokesperson] The information we have is that strong  dynamite charges were used.    [Reporter] How long will it take the Army engineers to  repair  the damage?    [DIDE spokesperson] In this case, the URNG destroys while  the  Army builds. The Guatemalan Army Corps of Engineers is setting  up the Bailey bridge at this time. Traffic will be restored at  approximately 1700 today, but it will take another 48 hours for  the bridge to be fully operational.    [Reporter] Why did the URNG blow up this bridge?    [DIDE spokesperson] Right now we don't know. I don't think  that is really important. What is important is that with this  action, the URNG is showing how much respect it has for  Guatemalans' human rights.    [Reporter] What do you think of the URNG's blowing up this  bridge in Guatemala while holding peace talks in Mexico?    [DIDE spokesperson] This is very contradictory. While it is  attending negotiations and holding talks for the benefit of all  Guatemalans, at the same time it is acting against our society.  The truth is that it is very regrettable. Guatemala is no  longer willing to tolerate such actions. Actually, the damage  to our country goes beyond all estimates.    [Reporter] On another subject, how about the fire early this  morning in the former military hospital?    [DIDE spokesman] A fire began at about 0200 at the former  military hospital in Zone 10. The fire was controlled at 0500.  We still do not know the origin of this fire, but it started at  the former administrative office, which was destroyed. It was a  very old and deteriorated building. That is why the military  hospital was transferred to the new building at Zone 17.    [Reporter] Was anyone in the building at the time?    [DIDE spokesperson] There was no one there.    [Reporter] What are the damage estimates?    [DIDE spokesperson] The fire was early this morning, and  personnel are currently evaluating the condition of the rest of  the building. Reporters wanted to enter this morning, but we  are first verifying the condition of the building before anyone  is allowed in.    [Reporter] On another subject, have there been any armed  confrontations between the Army and the guerrillas?    [DIDE spokesperson] I do not have any information to that  effect at the moment, but there were no confrontations on  Saturday or Sunday. [end recording]</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries strengthen on unexpected fall in store sales AFTER an initial period of consolidation, US Treasury prices firmed slightly across the board yesterday in the wake of an unexpected decline in store sales. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 102 9/32 , to yield 7.428 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was  1/8 firmer at 100 1/8 , to carry a yield of 4.541 per cent. Trading was subdued during the morning, although there was some sporadic profit-taking. Prices have risen substantially in the last few days amid hopes that economic growth would be sufficient to dissuade president-elect Bill Clinton from over-stimulating the economy with an aggressive package of fiscal stimuli. By yesterday, analysts felt that these hopes had been properly priced into the market, which has also already discounted this week's most important economic figures - the data on November producer and consumer prices, and retail sales. Prices picked up in the afternoon, however, following the release of the Johnson Redbook report, which showed a 2.2 per cent decline in US department and chain store sales during the first week of December. UK government bonds closed higher, with long-dated issues benefiting from the current interest in lengthening trades. In the cash market, the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose from 108 21/32 to 108 15/16 to yield 8.38 per cent as dealers noted some interest in switching into longer-dated issues. At the short end of the market, the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 gained  1/16 of a point to end at 104 13/32 , yielding 6.87 per cent. The recent spate of more optimistic economic data has dashed hopes of a cut in the base rate, encouraging interest in lengthening trades, dealers said. However, volume remained thin, with only about 16,000 futures contracts traded. MEDIUM and long-dated German government bonds closed higher yesterday, although dealers said that the short end of the market remained nervous about a possible rise in interest rates at the Bundesbank's repo operations. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 91.44 and traded up to a high of 91.67 before closing at 91.58. However, volume in the market was relatively low at around 28,500 contracts. The market will be watching today's allocation of 14-day securities repurchase agreements to see whether there is an increase in the minimum rate at which funds are allocated. Dealers said there was some nervousness that the minimum rate may rise, especially as overnight money has edged up to 8.95-9.05 per cent, from 8.85-8.95 per cent on Monday. The main focus for the market this week is tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank council, at which the central bank is expected to announce its money supply growth target for 1993. Some economists predict that the Bundesbank will set a slightly higher money supply growth target for 1993 at the meeting, raising it from its present target range of 3.5-5.5 per cent to 4.0-6.0 per cent. JAPANESE government bonds ended slightly weaker as money market interest rates edged up. The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.585 per cent, moving to a high of 4.575 per cent before ending at 4.595 per cent. The March bond future contract fell from 107.90 to close at 107.76. The overnight call rate traded at 3 29/32 per cent, compared with 3 27/32 per cent on Monday. Dealers said that the bond market was waiting for Friday's tankan report, the Bank of Japan's quarterly economic review, in the hope that the central bank would cut the official discount rate. However, the announcement yesterday by several of the city banks that they will cut their short-term prime rates by a quarter of a point to 4.5 per cent, may reduce the chance of such a discount rate cut, dealers said.</p>

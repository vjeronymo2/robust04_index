There were no casualties in the attack that  was carried out by persons unknown who somehow managed to drive  a car through the heavily guarded streets of central Tehran late  Tuesday night.    According to Tehran sources, Britain requested a "full  investigation" with "appropriate measures." A paper reflecting  the views of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani accused  Mojahedin-e-Khalq, the organization in exile, of carrying out  the attack, but the latter denied any connection with the attack  and accused the government of fabricating the incident. In a  telephone call to a Tehran paper a hitherto unheard of  organization called "the Imam's Soldiers" claimed  responsibility.    Britain has had no ambassador in Tehran since the mullahs  seized power in 1979. [passage omitted]</p>

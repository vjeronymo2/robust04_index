			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Nato closer to military co-operation with eastern Europe The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation yesterday moved closer to agreeing concrete plans for military co-operation with eastern European countries, amid a consensus that the alliance was not yet ready for the admission of new members, writes David White, Defence Correspondent, in Brussels. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said countries actively involved in the 'partnership for peace' agreements proposed by Washington should have permanent representatives at Nato and join a special planning cell at Mons in Belgium, the site of Nato's European military headquarters. At a Nato foreign ministers' meeting he said eastern European partners would train and exercise with Nato armies, and develop common military standards and procedures. Joint action could include peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. Nato officials said the US proposal, due to be formally endorsed at an allied summit next month, received strong backing from the 16 allies. But at the same time there was unanimity that enlargement of the alliance was 'not on the immediate agenda'. In a bid to soothe Russian suspicions about an expansion of Nato to former Warsaw Pact countries, Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, emphasised the need for 'a strong relationship' between Nato and Moscow. Although the new plan is aimed at all countries of the former eastern bloc, the UK is understood to oppose forming a partnership agreement with Ukraine until it joints the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Allies have yet to agree on which other European countries may be included in the plan and on how partner nations would consult Nato in a crisis. Mr Christopher said eastern European states would be expected to finance their involvement, but 'some new Nato resources' would be needed. He added that the agreements 'could be a key step towards Nato membership'. Allies also backed a US proposal for Nato joint task forces to be formed for peacekeeping and other missions outside alliance territory. These task forces would include units from France and Spain, which do not belong to Nato's integrated military structure. More detailed plans are due to be ready by next month.</p>

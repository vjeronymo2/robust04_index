			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Health purchasing changes proposed The government is likely to be urged this week to set up an experiment that would make 10 to 15 local authorities responsible for purchasing health services. Local councils and health authorities are being drawn into growing disagreement over the running of the National Health Service. A paper going to the Association of Metropolitan Authorities policy committee on Thursday argues that switching health-purchasing responsibilities from district health authorities to local councils could produce better management, service planning and public accountability. The paper calls for a pilot project under which local authorities of varying size, type and geographical location would take over health commissioning. Local authorities have never had a direct role in the NHS since its foundation in 1948. One of the traditional arguments against local authority involvement - lack of suitable expertise to run hospitals - has been diminished by the government's 1991 NHS reforms. Hospitals are now run by their own trust boards, with purchasing decisions made at arm's length by district health authorities. Critics in local authorities say unelected health authorities lack the legitimacy or public standing to make difficult decisions about spending priorities. They believe the government's decision to make local authorities responsible for purchasing community care services adds force to the argument that they should take over the entire health purchasing role. The proposal is being fiercely resisted by the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts, which believes it could undermine the national character of the NHS. Mr Philip Hunt, the association's director, said health authorities were accountable to the health secretary and were scrutinised by the Audit Commission, the National Audit Office and other public watchdogs. It was, however, important that appointees had credibility within their local communities. 'Every effort should be made to encourage people from a wide cross-section of the community to put their names forward for appointment as chairmen and non-executive directors of NHS boards,' he said.</p>

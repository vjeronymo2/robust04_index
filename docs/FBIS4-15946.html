			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Employment" rubric: </F> "Labor Minister Fear Mass Unemployment and Hopes for Sensible  Government Policy"]    [Text] Gennadiy Melikyan, minister of labor and employment,  and Fedor Prokopov, head of the Federal Employment Service,  yesterday briefed journalists on the general situation on the  Russian labor market, presented data on today's level of  unemployment, and tried to forecast the immediate future.    According to Mr. Melikyan and Mr. Prokopov, as of today  employment services have registered 1 million unemployed while  another 3 million people did not wish to solve the problems of  their employment with the aid of official structures and are  looking for jobs on their own. The number of partially employed  is approximately 4 million people, but Mr. Melikyan underlined  that it was virtually impossible to do a precise count of those  affected by "hidden" unemployment. Speaking about prospects of  unemployment's growth, Mr. Melikyan and Mr. Prokopov differed  somewhat in their assessments. According to the minister, the  number of unemployed will amount to around 3 million by the end  of 1994, while the employment service head thought that as many  as 3 million would apply to his agency alone with the total  number of unemployed being considerably higher. As for "hidden"  unemployment, according to the Ministry of Labor's rough  estimates, it will amount to between 4-8 million people by the  end of 1994. Explaining the reasons for such a wide spread in  the forecast figures, Mr. Prokopov pointed out that the Ministry  of Labor and the Employment Service are to a certain degree  "hostage to the government course," and that if a "tough"  financial policy is followed, the number of evident and hidden  unemployed may exceed the projected figures. Gennadiy Melikyan  also stated that unlike many Western European countries, Russia  would not be able to bear a 25-percent unemployment level "owing  to peculiarities of the national character."    According to Mr. Prokopov, the unemployment problem is  especially acute in Ivanovo Oblast, Ingushetia, and in the Far  North. As for hidden unemployment, this ailment affects most  regions where the defense industry is predominant. Speaking  about measures the Labor Ministry is taking regarding retraining  of the unemployed, Mr. Prokopov stated that the structures that  had done that in the past are in ruins and that "serious  financial injections" are necessary to restore them.    At the same time, in Mr. Prokopov's opinion, finding a job  is  not that difficult, but the existing vacancies mainly offer a  stable job at low pay (working in the state sector), or high pay  in the absence of the usual labor guarantees (new economy).    Touching on the question of possible competition for jobs  from refugees and economic immigrants to those who live in  Russia, Mr. Prokopov pointed to the fact that their pressure on  the labor market is insignificant.    Speaking about current migration processes, Mr. Melikyan  pointed out the existence of two main processes: an outflow of  the population from the Far North to the European part of  Russia, and a partial outflow of the urban population to rural  areas. Having noted the irreversibility of the depolicization  process, the minister recognized the economic objectivity of  mass migration from the areas of the Far North and stated that  his agency is preparing a federal program designed to facilitate  social adaptation of resettlers.</p>

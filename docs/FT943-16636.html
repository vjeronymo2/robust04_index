			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Arafat's return shatters a dream of home: Many in the refugee camps believe the Palestinian leader has sold them short As Mr Yassir Arafat made a hero's entry into the Jabalya refugee camp at the weekend  - the crucible of the Palestinian intifada, or uprising, against Israel  - one family stubbornly stayed indoors. 'For us the return of Arafat means the end of hope  - the hope we will ever get our land back. It is a day of shame,' said Hisham Elakra. Like many Palestinians the Elakra family sees Mr Arafat's peace accord with Israel as a betrayal of its dream of returning to the land its fathers lived on before the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and the subsequent creation of the state of Israel. The Elakra are not Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the peace agreement on religious grounds because it does not usher in an Islamic state in all of the traditional land of Palestine. They are part of the secular Palestinian opposition to Mr Arafat inside Gaza, the West Bank and the 4m-strong diaspora who believe that Mr Arafat has sold them short. Not only has the peace agreement firmly ruled out any prospect of regaining the 1948 Palestinian lands, but most Palestinians believe it has also permanently shelved the notion of a return. When the dust settles and the theatre of Mr Arafat's return passes, the fate of the fragile peace agreement could be determined by whether he is able to win over the secular opposition in Gaza-Jericho and in Lebanon, Jordan and other Arab states. Any failure by Mr Arafat to deliver on promises of jobs and prosperity and, more important, further gains of land from Israeli occupation, will fuel the opposition. The youths of the Elakra family  - Hisham, Bassam and Fayes  - were born and raised in the dusty and littered streets of Jabalya Camp, home to 72,000 Palestinian refugees. They have never left the densely populated Gaza Strip but they resolutely refuse to call it home. They are proud of their refugee identity and have no wish to accept Palestinian passports or leave the camp unless they are going home. Home is a place they have not seen, and probably never will. But they pronounce its Arabic name, Bruier (it is now called Brur Hail in Hebrew) with pride and passion. It is a place which has become shrouded in myth and legend, growing ever more sweet with the fading memories of their fathers and grandfathers who were forced to flee their 300 dunums (about 75 acres) of farmland as Israeli tanks and soldiers attacked their village in the early hours of May 12 1948. Today the Elakra's land, which once boasted grape vines and wheat fields, is a built-up Israeli kibbutz south of Ashkelon. The spirit of 1948 beats strong in the hearts of even the youngest in the family. 'The peace agreement is not peace. It is a surrender of our Arab land and we must fight against it by all means . . . We have nothing to lose  - no land, no jobs, no dignity. We will not leave this camp until we go back to our village,' said Bassam. Although there is still a slim majority in favour of the peace process in Gaza and the West Bank, Palestinian refugees like the Elakra family say the peace agreement would be resoundingly defeated in a referendum held in the entire Palestinian nation, including the diaspora. There are no portraits of Mr Arafat or Palestine Liberation Organisation flags at the Elakra house. Instead, pictures of Che Guevara, Lenin and Dr George Habash, the Damascus-based leader of the left-wing Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, adorn the small bedrooms. Any mention of Dr Habash  - or Hakeem (the wise one)  - is greeted with approval. 'We accepted Arafat as our leader  - as the president of Palestine. But he has accepted to be mayor of Gaza-Jericho. He has sold us out for nothing and the only way he will be able to rule is by using the secret police like the Israelis,' said Hisham. Mr Arafat is gambling that he will be able to win support through massive investment in housing, jobs and social services. But he is clearly nervous about the prospect of general elections. He may also have underestimated the strength of feeling about recovering Arab land that burns so passionately among the refugees who make up more than 75 per cent of Gaza's 850,000 population, especially those 325,000 still living in camps. Attachment to land has acquired an almost supernatural importance to the Palestinian refugees  - an affirmation of their existence with a past they portray as a paradise. 'Land is stability,' said Bassam. 'If there is no land we will not exist as a family as a people. We are physically related to our land because the graves of our family are on that land and our history of our family is on that land.' Although many Palestinian refugees know they may not see their land in their lifetime, they are philosophical about the future, sure that the tide of history will one day turn in their favour. 'Yassir Arafat is betraying our rights now because we are weak and Israel is strong,' said Hisham. 'Israel will not always be strong. Turkey and Britain ruled the world and Palestine for hundreds of years but where are they today? No one thought the Soviet Union would collapse but it did. One day Israel and the US, which supports Israel, will collapse and Palestine will be returned to us. 'It does not matter whether I will live to see Palestine, but for sure my son or my grandson will get the land back.'</p>

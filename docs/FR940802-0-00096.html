			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (l) Unwarranted Restriction of Opportunity To Continue Traditional Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters argued that same-day-airborne or even land and shoot methods of taking wolves in Alaska constitute traditional uses that Congress intended to protect under provisions of ANILCA. As such, our proposed regulation would eliminate legitimate traditional hunting and trapping activities and access needed in remote roadless areas and therefore violates the Congressional intent of ANILCA. On the other hand, some commenters stated the view that excessive and direct reliance on aircraft for taking wolves should not be used or allowed as replacement for the traditional hunting and trapping skills and activities that Congress intended to protect in Alaska.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ANILCA provides for the continuation of hunting and trapping opportunities as legitimate traditional uses of refuge lands in Alaska, and specifically allows use of aircraft for access to and within refuges for such traditional uses, subject to reasonable regulations and compatibility with refuge purposes. The proposed rule does not compromise either of these directives. It does not close refuges to hunting or trapping, nor does it preclude or restrict aircraft access for these and other traditional activities. ANILCA does not direct the Service to ensure use of aircraft for land and shoot or related methods of same-day-airborne shooting of wolves and other wildlife. There is no clear indication, nor is it reasonable to presume, that Congress intended to allow such activities on public lands, particularly when they invite or result in chronic violations of Federal laws and policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (m) Same-Day-Airborne Methods Provide the Most or Only Effective Alternative Means of Taking Wolves in Alaska  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters who indicated experience in trapping and hunting wolves expressed the concern that same-day-airborne shooting opportunities provide the only effective means or the most effective alternative to taking wolves with traps and snares in the vast and remote roadless areas of Alaska. A few commenters argued that same-day-airborne or even land and shoot methods offer more humane and more selective means of taking wolves. Traps and snares take non-target species while same-day-airborne methods are more selective to the target species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service considered and weighed such potential advantages of allowing same-day-airborne shooting wolves and wolverines against the problems and consequences and found the problems outweigh the benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation of public comments on the benefits and effectiveness of same-day-airborne take of wolves was complicated by the apparent contradiction or inconsistency in responses from people purportedly experienced in such methods. Some commenters argued that same-day-airborne shooting is needed to maintain an effective and selective method of taking wolves. Other experienced wolf hunters and/or trappers argued that it should be allowed by virtue of its very limited effectiveness. They contended that same-day-airborne shooting of wolves, particularly with the State's new requirement to be 300 feet from the airplane, involves very difficult methods that require considerable skill and offer very limited opportunities to be successful. It results in a very limited increase in harvest. Still other responses from some individuals knowledgeable or experienced in same-day-airborne shooting activities reinforce the Service's concerns that it allows or invites abuse and violations of the Airborne Hunting Act and should be prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (n) Advantages and Impacts of Using Aircraft Exaggerated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters disagreed with statements in the proposed rule concerning the advantage of using aircraft to detect and kill wildlife, contending that the Service exaggerated the advantages and impacts of using aircraft for taking wolves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, there is significant inconsistency in public comments on the effectiveness and impacts of same-day-airborne shooting of wolves, even among those individuals experienced in such activities. The Service recognizes that opportunities and advantages to hunters or trappers who shoot wolves on the same-day-airborne, as well as the impacts to wolf populations, are generally limited when such activities are accomplished in compliance with the Airborne Hunting Act. Unfortunately, same-day-airborne allowances create significant enforcement problems and provide greater opportunity and advantage to violators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rulemaking does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rulemaking is categorically excluded under 40 Code of Federal Regulations 1508.4 from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4347) as an activity directly related to the enforcement of fish and wildlife laws and as an administrative action that will have no potential for causing substantial environmental impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

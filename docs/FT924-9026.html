			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: At a glance - DIY taxation The Inland Revenue has published a consultative paper suggesting that individuals should be responsible for assessing their own tax. This change would not apply to the majority who pay tax through the PAYE system, but for those with other income, who regularly fill in a tax return. Income would be taxed on a current year basis. The proposals would not be introduced until the tax year 1995-96 at the earliest. The consultative paper is available from the Inland Revenue Reference Room, Room 8, New Wing, Somerset House, London WC2R 1LB, price Pounds 2.</p>

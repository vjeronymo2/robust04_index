			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Management: Game rules in black and white - Attempts to reveal the secrets of success and list them as tangible, attainable objectives If you want to make it as a senior manager at IBM UK in the future, you will need six things. Intellect, tenacity, vision, impact, skills in active management and skills in general management. Last week the company's top brass agreed that these should be the key to success at Big Blue. From now on some 70 senior managers just below board level will use these measuring sticks to determine their progress, to assess areas for improvement, and even to settle the size of their bonus. The six qualities are known in the jargon as 'management competencies'. To most people the phrase is a turn-off. Yet to IBM, Unilever, BP, NatWest, GKN and to a growing number of other big companies, management competencies point the way to an exciting future. They are being seized upon as a way of making all managers, even the most senior ones, do a better job. They are being used to help recruit the right people, to train them in the right skills, and even to determine the levels of pay. At a conference in London earlier this month, Norman Ashton, skills manager of IBM, enthusiastically described competencies as the vital link between a company's overall business plan and the management of its people. But what are competencies? They are the things you need in order to do a job properly. They may include skills, knowledge, understanding and will-power. As such, they sound neither very profound nor very new. What is new, however, is the way that companies are drawing up precise lists for each management position, and using them as a starting point for most of the other traditional personnel tasks. The driving force behind them has been the delayering of organisations. At IBM the interest in management competencies has been prompted by the mass replacement of functional managers with general managers. At other companies the motive has been similar. 'As a result of flattening structures, we need general managers who can be transferred from one job to another,' says Ray Atkinson, head of management development at GKN. Despite this enthusiasm, the attempt to define and measure general management skills is controversial. Critics insist that competencies are all very well for junior and technical jobs, but are no use at the top, where abilities are 'God given'. Any attempt to nail the qualities down may miss the real - intangible - secret of excellence. There is further debate about whether competencies are the same for all managers in all organisations, or whether they are company specific. An attempt by the Management Charter Initiative to provide standard competencies for all middle managers has been attacked by some for being too general to be useful - it has identified several hundred in all. 'People who have done very well in one company with a specific culture have very high failure rates when they move to other companies,' says Alan Warner of training consultancy MTP, which organised this month's seminar. A recent survey carried out by MTP of 100 companies showed that most believed that the skills needed in their company might be different from those required in another. Companies are compiling lists in different ways. Many see risks in basing the desired skills on the actual ones of present managers. 'You find the people who got promoted often have the wrong competencies. They just talk a good game,' says Warner. Many companies employ specialist consultancies to help their managers identify the right skills. Others cast their nets wider. IBM has taken the bold step of asking its customers who have direct dealings with IBM employees what they think are the most important qualities. Heather Bell from Hay Management Consultants warns that the list should not be considered as an end it itself. 'The hard bit is in rolling it out,' she says. 'At the moment the effort is going into making the model pretty. But the important part is in applying it to performance appraisal, pay and so on.' BP, one of the first British companies to use competencies at the top, applies them through a system of '360 degree' evaluation. Each of its senior managers is judged on a list of nine competencies - including leadership and team-building skills - by their supervisors, peers, and by their underlings. If there are gaps in their abilities, training is provided. For the more senior people this is likely to be individual coaching provided by an outsider. So far the company is hesitating to tie the system to pay. 'We won't hook it up until competencies are in the air conditioning,' says David Nicolson, development consultant at BP Oil. IBM is planning to follow BP in using the views of both bosses and subordinates to assess its managers against the yardstick. It has divided each of its six competencies into three levels of achievement, and specified that different levels are appropriate for different jobs. One of the advantages of competencies is that they provide people with certainty and clarity. 'Knowledge of what I need to be good at in BP oil is useful,' says Nicolson. 'Competencies involve a common language, revealing the rules of the game. That has been missing in our organisation which has been wrestling with uncertainty.' Getting managers to talk the common language takes time - Nicholson estimates it will take up to five years before everyone is quite at home with it. IBM is more optimistic. The remaining staff who have survived the purge and the radical changes at the company are now looking on the new system as a port in a storm. 'They've had the change. Now we are looking for the framework,' says Ashton. One of the primary uses of competencies is to match training to needs. Yet many senior management competencies do not lend themselves to training. 'You can teach a turkey to climb a tree, but it is easier to hire a squirrel,' says Bell. Yet Nicolson is optimistic about what can be done. 'We shouldn't despair about teaching managers personal skills. In many areas we can help them and give them exposure to lift their competence,' he says. Even the greatest fans of management competencies admit that there are dangers involved. Ashton warns against making the system too complicated. 'If you turn it into an industry you get bureaucracy, and then you get switch-off.'</p>

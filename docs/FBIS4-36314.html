			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanandaj (Kurdistan Prov.), June 7, IRNA -- The  north eastern Iraqi cities of Banjwin and Qal'at Dizah have been  taken over by forces loyal to Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party  (KDP) and the Islamic Movement Party (IMP) on Tuesday [7 June].    According to an IMP spokesman scores of forces of Iraq's  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) were killed or injured in the  clashes with the joint forces.    Latest dispatches from the area indicate that leaders of the  warring groups are to start first round of their official talks  in erbil on wednesday under supervision of the so-called iraqi  national congress -- a loose grouping of various factions  opposed to the regime in Baghdad -- to end the ongoing power  struggle in Iraqi Kurdistan.    Irbil, the second major Kurdish city after Karkuk, has been  declared capital of Iraqi Kurdistan by the self-proclaimed  government of Kurds. The city is 15 kms away from the buffer  zone which separates Kurdish controlled areas from the Iraqi  forces.</p>

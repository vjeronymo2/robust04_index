			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> AMBEGAOKAR &amp; CO. AT YORBA LINDA  </P> <P> Projecting vivid commitment and avid inner joy, Kathak dancer Anjani Ambegaokar  led members of her Sundar Lala Kendra school -- including her daughter Amrapali  Ambegaokar -- in a riveting yet informal program Friday at the Forum Theater in  Yorba Linda (repeated Saturday night in Beckman Auditorium at Caltech in  Pasadena).  </P> <P> In examples of pure dance technique, Anjani expresses her uniqueness in the way  she transmits the shuddering energy of rapid foot beats upward through a strong  but pliant torso; amplifies and modulates it into a centrifugal force unfolded  in superbly articulated arms and hands, then finally explodes that power  outwards from long, aristocratic fingers as she snaps into final position.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the coyness and flirtation of a woman trying to hold back her  lover in "Gazal" suited her less than the violent rage of the unworshiped Lord  Indra and the transcendent benevolence of Lord Krishna in "Goverdhan Leela"  (both examples of the dance-drama aspects of Kathak).  </P> <P> Otherwise, the high point of the program proved a series of playful,  intricately matched, improvised rhythmic challenges between her and master  tabla player, Ustad Sattar Tari, who also offered a virtuosic solo.  </P> <P> Whether in following Anjani's lead or re-creating village festival life on  their own, Ambegaokar's (six) young students looked accomplished and promising.  </P> <P> Mala Ganguly provided sweet-toned vocalism. Scott Marcus was the minimalist  sitarist.  </P> <P> Curiously, none of the dancers appeared to be fazed by the persistent flash  photos taken by their fans, seemingly oblivious to the blinding hazards they  were offering the objects of their devotion.

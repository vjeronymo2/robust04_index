			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Karpenko, IZVESTIYA correspondent: "A Law </F> for the Stock-Holder; the Economic Reforms and Millions of  Citizens Await it"]    [Text] Up to this point there is no law on  joint-stock companies in Russia. And every entrepreneur now  operates under the threat of the court and penalties based on  the legislation presently in force. First Deputy Chairman of the  State Committee on the Administration of State Property Petr  Mostovoy, one of the leading authors and elaborators of the law  on joint-stock companies, has recounted to IZVESTIYA how the  government intends to resolve these problems.    "The obvious criminalization of Russian business," says Petr  Mostovoy, "is in many respects related to the major deficiencies  in the legislation now currently in force. Precisely that is why  many entrepreneurs and simply adventurists calmly make deals  knowing beforehand that they will not be able to fulfill their  conditions and that it is difficult to make them answer for this  according to the law. On the other hand, the victims also well  know that it is simpler for them to conduct an `investigation'  with the use of a fire-arm than legal proceedings."    It is no secret that today we protect the rights of all  participants in the economic turnover poorly.    During the years of Soviet power our Civil Code underwent  such changes that today it is absolutely inadequate for economic  and legal reality and many situations have proven to be  practically altogether without regulation. The question of the  legislative regulation of the activity of joint-stock companies  is especially critical. The draft of a law on joint-stock  companies has been prepared for a long time already and its  elaboration has been delayed somewhat precisely because it has  been necessary to coordinate its basic norms, formulations, and  terminology with the draft of the Civil Code. Moreover, the  authors of the draft legislation, well understanding its  enormous importance for the activity of joint-stock companies,  have refrained from the temptation to introduce its basic  provisions by presidential edict. Without the approval of so  important a legal document by the parliament it would be more  complicated to insist on the need for and the obligatory nature  of its use for all joint-stock companies.    Both the law on joint-stock companies and, in addition,  draft  bills on trading partnerships, state enterprises, non-commercial  organizations, cooperatives and some others will be introduced  together with the Civil Code for the consideration of the  Federal Assembly.    These acts are vitally necessary. The fact is that even the  legal sphere of the activity of state enterprises, which  constitute so significant a share of economy, leaves much to be  desired. Thus, the institution of "complete economic authority"  as the legal basis for the activity of state enterprises has  long since outlived itself. In the draft bill it is planned to  transform state enterprises in two directions. Basically, they  will be transformed also into joint-stock companies with a  varying share of the property remaining with the state and even  with a 100-percent share of state capital.    This is not simply a change of sign in P. Mostovoy's  opinion.  State enterprises as juridical bodies are thereby transferred  into the category of active participants on the basis of the  right of ownership. The possibility is created, incidentally, of  recovering their debts with the use of a penalty on the property  of such an enterprise. There also are many other positive  features. The preconditions emerge for attracting non-state  funds and investments into such joint-stock enterprises.    Another alternative for state enterprises is their  conversion  into "public (kazennyy)" enterprises, i.e., operating not on the  basis of the right of ownership and economic authority, but on  the basis of operational control. The state is the proprietor of  such enterprises, similar in status to institutions. Today the  first precedents have already been created. Such enterprises as  a port administration, enterprises for air traffic control and  the use of air space, a basin administration on rivers and a  further entire series of structures have been converted to the  status of institutions, but with definite opportunities in the  sphere of economic activity.    What are the defects of our previous legislation? In the  first place, norms ensuring the protection of the rights of the  stock-holders are almost completely absent in this legislation.  Norms which protect the minority of stock-holders from decisions  taken by the majority to the detriment of their interests are  lacking. In particular, those provisions which are common for  world practice according to which stock-holders who possess if  only ten percent of the shares have a right to convene a  stock-holders meeting, to schedule an audit of the activity of a  joint-stock company, to require a valuation of the shares  belonging to them at a fair market price in the case of the  reorganization or liquidation of the company, etc., etc. Such  norms are present in the privatization legislation but they are  absent in the general legislation for the country and for  enterprises created outside the privatization process.    For example, the activity of closed type joint-stock  companies is very poorly regulated. This is a sphere of purely  entrepreneurial initiative. With us such companies cannot be  created with the participation of state capital, only with the  participation of foreign investors. So, regulation of their  activity falls outside the sphere of privatization legislation.    The entire practice of the activity of these joint-stock  companies shows that a stock-holder there is especially  unprotected. Right up to the fact that the possibility of the  compulsory confiscation of shares from certain stock-holders  based on a decision of the general meeting is provided for in  the founding documents of such joint-stock companies, which is  complete nonsense. If any one of the members of such a company  wishes to sell his shares, then he is obliged to sell them  either to the company or to his favorite stock-holder at a price  which is known to be unobjective. And there are no norms  whatever protecting the stock-holder.    The majority of the norms which protect creditors are also  absent in today's legislation. In particular the norms related  to the obligations which ought to result if a joint-stock  company undergoes reorganization, is liquidated, or the charter  capital of the joint-stock company is decreased. Such mutual  relations of a joint-stock company with a creditor are not  regulated in Russia. And the only alternative remaining to  creditors is to initiate bankruptcy proceedings.    As a matter of fact, Petr Mostovoy thinks, bankruptcy is not  at all obligatory in the majority of real situations. If the  appropriate norms were in effect in the general legislation, one  should be able to regulate these disputes by other less painful  methods. The courts before which applications concerning the  bringing of a bankruptcy action come up don't know what to do  with them, they haven't the practice, and there isn't an  adequate normative base. The appropriate provisions have already  been established in the draft bill on joint-stock companies.    Questions related to the issuance of shares and their  distribution are regulated in greater detail in it. It is well  known that joint-stock companies issued additional shares in  order to obtain funds to cover debts, that dividends were paid  to stock-holders through funds received from an issuance, and  that these funds were used for regulating mutual relations with  third parties, which is not to be tolerated.    What more new is there in the draft law on joint-stock  companies? For example, norms regulating reorganization  procedure: additions, mergers, divisions, separations. In  today's legislation there are norms which concern only the  merger of companies and they are present in one single  document--in the provisional statute on holding companies. These  norms have been treated in greater detail in the draft bill and  have been extended to all types of reorganization.    Questions related to the rights of the possessors of  privileged shares have also been entered in greater detail. In  particular the range of situations when they acquire the right  to vote at a general meeting of the stock-holders has been  defined: if the joint-stock company does not fulfill its  obligations with respect to them, does not pay dividends over a  period of two years, etc. They retain such a voting right as  long as the company does not settle with them completely.    If in the next few months the Federal Assembly will consider  and adopt the Civil Code together with the law on the  joint-stock company and the draft bills regulating the juridical  relations of all the remaining participants in economic  turnover, then, in Petr Mostovoy's opinion, Russia will secure a  serious legislative base for the market economy and the sphere  in which the state today is compelled to exercise its regulating  functions will be drastically limited.</p>

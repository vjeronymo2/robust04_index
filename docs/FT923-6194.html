			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / World Trade News: US begins Russian loans facility THE US Export-Import Bank will begin its first disbursement of loans to Russia in a signing ceremony tomorrow, according to Mr Eugene Lawson, the bank's vice-chairman, writes Nancy Dunne. All but one of the seven deals, worth a total Dollars 102m, were originally contracted with the former Soviet Union. Loans have been held up by the 'extremely cautious' policies of Vnesheconombank, the Russian trade bank. Because it has the responsibility for the old Soviet debt, it has moved 'prudently' before approving new deals, said Mr Lawson. The signing will cap a busy month for Eximbank. Recent Eximbank deals providing financing for US sales to Latin America, include: Two new guarantee facilities and one renewal of a guarantee totalling almost Dollars 70m for the sale of goods and equipment to Mexico. A loan guarantee supporting a Dollars 74.3m sale of equipment and engineering services to Corpoven, a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela. A Dollars 17.4m guarantee for the sale of a turbine generator set to Empresa Colombiana de Petroleos, the state-owned oil company of Colombia. A Dollars 21m guarantee of credit to finance the sale of US capital goods and services to Argentine customers of the Banco de Galicia of Buenos Aires. It has also approved its third 'bundling' facility to finance Dollars 57.3m of goods and services to India. Bundling involves a large number of US suppliers and numerous buyers. Eximbank provides a guarantee; the lending bank can hold the credits or bundle them to support one large security issue which can be floated in the capital markets.</p>

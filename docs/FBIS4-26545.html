			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The anticorruption leading group of the  provincial party committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon  [22 June] at which it was stressed that greater efforts should  be made to investigate and handle major and important cases in a  selective way, and to raise the province's anticorruption  struggle to a new level.    The current meeting studied the implementation of the spirit  of the meeting of the Central Commission for Political Science  and Law and the national conference of discipline inspection and  supervision organs, and made arrangements for the province's  anticorruption struggle in the next stage. The meeting also  adopted the report on the achievements made in the past 10  months of the anticorruption struggle throughout the province.  According to statistics, during that period, procuratorial  organs at all levels throughout the province accepted 687  economic criminal cases for prosecution, of which 208 were  embezzlement and bribe taking cases, constituting 40 percent of  the cases filed for investigation and prosecution. Of the 687  economic criminal cases accepted, 145 were major cases involving  more than 10,000 yuan in funds, and 34 were important cases  involving cadres at the county and departmental levels and  above. Compared with the previous year, the number of cases  filed for investigation and prosecution and the number of major  and important cases doubled and redoubled. This shows that  phased achievements have been made in the anticorruption  struggle.    The meeting held that although some achievements have been  made in the province's anticorruption struggle, there are still  many problems. Their main manifestations are that the  development of the anticorruption struggle is imbalanced; there  is a gap of understanding among leading cadres; and because laws  are not enforced strictly and no effective measures are taken to  fight corruption, the investigation and prosecution of cases  proceed slowly. [passage omitted]    Provincial party Secretary Yin Kesheng and Deputy Secretary  Cai Zhulin delivered speeches one after another. [passage  omitted]    In their speeches, they particularly urged cadres of the  discipline inspection and supervision organs, as well as cadres  and functionaries of political-legal organs, to enforce laws  impartially by removing barriers and obstructions, to promote  the province's work in all fields of endeavor with the victories  scored in the anticorruption struggle, keep the spirits of the  masses of people high through the anticorruption struggle, and  strive to elevate the province's work in all fields to a new  level.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corp. (NTT) said Tuesday [29 March] it will review its  procurement policy under a 1981 Japan-U.S. agreement as part of  efforts to increase foreign companies' opportunities for  NTT-related business.    Japan's telecommunications giant privatized in 1985 will  improve its procedures for buying components and other products  for use in equipment to facilitate foreign companies' access to  NTT business, a company spokesman said.    Specifically, NTT will provide prospective bidders with  information on its procurement plans before they are unveiled in  the government's official gazettes, the spokesman said. At  present, such information can be obtained only after specific  procurement plans are made public in the gazettes.    The latest step follows a U.S. request that the Japanese  Government treat NTT purchases as part of its procurements. The  government has rejected the request, saying that NTT "is  basically a private business," not a government agency.    The 1981 pact calls for nondiscriminatory treatment of  foreign bidders by NTT in its procurement policy. "NTT will  maximize its efforts to respond to foreign demand," the  spokesman said.</p>

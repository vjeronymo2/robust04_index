			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Lower gold price helps cut income at Gengold Gengold, the gold mining division of South Africa's Gencor group, has turned in a 7 per cent decline in after-tax income to R109.2m (Dollars 31.9m) in the December quarter, compared with R117.2m in the September period and R65.1m a year ago. A combination of a lower gold price, depressed by outstanding low-priced forward sales contracts, and a small increase in working costs, dulled a good operating performance from most of the group's 10 producing gold mines. Total gold output was unchanged at 16.7 tonnes, but the mines received an average gold price of R37,995 a kg, well below a spot price of R40,867 a kg for the quarter and lower than the previous quarter's R38,522 a kg. Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said all the group's forward positions would be unwound by May exposing the mines fully to the current gold price. He said the 'star performer' was St Helena which had recovered strongly after its mining operations were halved in 1992/3 in a last-ditch attempt to stay in business. Increasingly efficient underground mining led to higher tonnage, grades and gold output in addition to trimmed average working costs. After-tax profit jumped to R11.7m from R6.91m. The only poor news came from Buffelsfontein, the group's biggest gold producer, which Mr Maude said had only three-and-half years of underground reserves at current gold prices. The mine's gold output would be boosted by the end of the year by a new retreatment project, which would tackle more than 50m tonnes of dump material and keep the mine's mills turning over until the year 2010. Mr Maude said a decision on whether the R1.8bn developing Oryx mine would close or be able to raise R900m to see it to commissioning would be made in December.</p>

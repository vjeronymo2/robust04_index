			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD MARRIAGES CAN BE HIGH ANXIETY  </P> <P> In the course of a dozen years on movie sets, Annie Coe learned first-hand how  stressful filmmaking can be. She saw the toll that long hours and  unpredictability took both on herself and on her 15-year relationship with a  local filmmaker. But when Coe began training as a therapist at the California  Family Study Center in North Hollywood, she was amazed to learn that no one had  ever made a systematic study of the impact the many stresses of the  entertainment business have on filmmakers and their families.  </P> <P> "I was surprised at the dearth of information," Coe said. "I spent days in  front of the computers at school. There were studies of the effects of stress  on rock musicians and comedians but nothing on filmmakers."  </P> <P> Coe remedied that situation last year by studying how 10 filmmakers and their  families react to the stresses of the world's most glamorous profession. The  study helped earn her a master's degree in marriage and family therapy (the  North Hollywood counseling center and training facility has an accredited  master's program). According to faculty at the school, the study is also an  important first step toward developing reality-based counseling programs for  entertainment families with problems.  </P> <P> Michele Harway, the center's director of research, said Coe's study "blazes new  territory." Such studies are important, she said, "because we live in an area  where there are so many families that are affected directly or indirectly by  the entertainment industry." To counsel such families effectively, she said,  "it's important to have empirical information."  </P> <P> Now an intern at the school, Coe, who hopes to specialize in counseling  entertainment families, plans to study additional filmmakers.  </P> <P> A Silver Lake resident in her early 40s, Coe said "filmmaker" was her generic  term for anyone directly involved in making TV shows or movies. Her own  filmmaking experience included working as Orson Welles' assistant during the  shooting of his unfinished, unreleased film, "The Other Side of the Wind."  Welles would sometimes wake her up in the middle of the night to send a telex,  but the chance to hear the great man reminisce, in a purple robe, with a brandy  in his hand, more than made up for it, the English-born Coe said.  </P> <P> Recruited through Coe's industry contacts, the subjects of her study were 10  filmmakers -- seven men and three women -- who "were successful but not famous"  and their mates. They included a producer, a director, an actor, a stand-in, a  set decorator and a screenwriter. All had been married at least four years, one  for 29 years.  </P> <P> Coe interviewed each of the couples for as long as four hours, using a  questionnaire she developed based on earlier research on occupational stress.  She also took notes as the filmmakers and their spouses made comments and  observations.  </P> <P> As Coe anticipated, the study revealed that filmmaking is an unusually  stressful business, largely because of unpredictability. However, most of the  filmmakers and their families had found strategies that helped them minimize  the pressures.  </P> <P> "Virtually everything about the business is unpredictable," including salary,  work hours, locations and periods of employment, Coe said. As one of her  subjects put it, "at least the unpredictability is expected." Unpredictability  extended to whether filmmakers would show up for their interviews, Coe said.  Interviews with filmmakers had to be rescheduled for numerous reasons,  including a last-minute shoot in Seattle and a fire on a set.  </P> <P> Of all the unpredictable aspects of the business, periods of unemployment of  uncertain length seemed to take the biggest toll.  </P> <P> "Most subjects stated that being unemployed is the most stressful aspect of the  business," Coe said. Eighty percent of the filmmakers said they suffered from  anxiety and depression whenever they were out of work for more than three  weeks.  </P> <P> "The actor reported that periods of unemployment provoke emotional chaos for  him, reminiscent of the internal chaos he experienced as a child being brought  up by alcoholic parents," Coe said. She said the actor's wife was aware of how  troubled he was when the phone wasn't ringing and was especially supportive at  such times.  </P> <P> All the filmmakers reported that they reduced some of the anxiety associated  with unemployment by making sure they were financially prepared for it. One  woman said she and her husband always have enough in the bank to cover their  expenses for six months. Even the seven couples who were financially secure  said they tended to be anxious during periods of unemployment.  </P> <P> Working brought its own strains, the study found. While being employed  alleviated fears about money and subtler concerns about whether others  perceived the filmmaker as a good hire, working took its toll at home.  </P> <P> "Nine subjects and their spouses reported that less strain exists in the  relationship when the filmmakers were unemployed," Coe said. The couples said  they enjoyed their leisure time together and the chance to do things and visit  with people they had to put off when the filmmaker was working. Only one couple  reported they were happiest when the filmmaker had a job.  </P> <P> Eighty percent of the couples said working took its toll on their physical  relationship. Some of the filmmakers said they enjoyed talking with their  spouses when they finally got home after a day of shooting. But two said they  didn't want to speak to anyone, only to eat something, take a hot bath and fall  into bed. Most of the spouses reported that they had become much more  understanding about these patterns in recent years (only one said she still  gets furious, but she blamed the business, not her husband).  </P> <P> All the spouses reported that in the past they had made meals for their working  filmmaker, only to have the food grow cold as they grew hot. Now, they said,  they don't waste a lot of time in the kitchen when their mates are on the set.  (Coe refers to the reliance on meals that will keep as "the salad syndrome.")  </P> <P> Coe said the filmmakers typically made an extra effort to take good physical  care of themselves when they were working. Two take megadoses of vitamins and  another drinks ginseng tea. All the subjects said working was made less  stressful by supportive spouses. Most said the camaraderie of the set helped  reduce the stress of working. One exception was the director, probably, Coe  speculated, because the director's responsibilities proliferate during filming.  </P> <P> All 10 filmmakers said they help bring stress levels down by consciously  reminding themselves, "This, too, shall pass" or "It's only a movie."  </P> <P> Coe said she was surprised at how strong the filmmakers' marriages were. To a  person, she said, the 10 spouses were independent, self-confident and able to  find fulfillment in their own lives.  </P> <P> And in spite of Hollywood's image as a hotbed of infidelity, nine of the 10  said they felt secure in their marriages, without concerns about infidelity.  The sole exception was a wife who always goes on location with her filmmaker  husband, just in case.  </P></p>

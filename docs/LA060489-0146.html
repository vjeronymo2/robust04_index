			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> POPULAR CAL STATE LONG BEACH PRESIDENT FACES TOUGH BUDGET TEST  </P> <P> When Curtis L. McCray took over as president of Cal State Long Beach last  summer, some administrators and faculty members thought he was too good to be  true.  </P> <P> He promised an open-door policy, then kept his word. He converted the lavish  office of his predecessor into a conference area and moved into a modest room  equipped with a personal computer, a telephone and a desk adorned with  seashells.  </P> <P> Following a tradition dating from the early years of his administrative career,  he began teaching a class on Chaucer. And he still spends occasional half-days  working alternately as a campus secretary, custodian, groundskeeper and  admissions clerk.  </P> <P> "The president has to be seen," said McCray, 51. "The point is to speak to  people one-on-one."  </P> <P> Now 10 months later, the new president, with some notable exceptions, is still  getting generally high marks on his performance. Praised for the energy and  sense of inclusiveness he has brought to the campus, McCray is seen by the  faculty, at least, as a breath of fresh air compared to his predecessor,  Stephen Horn, with whom its relations were often strained.  </P> <P> "It was a one-man show under Horn," said Bob Winchell, president of the  1,900-member university faculty union. In contrast, Winchell said, McCray  listens to faculty members and includes them in the decision-making process.  "It's a multi-university show under McCray," he said. "He's brought a spirit of  true collegiality to the campus."  </P> <P> Yet the president remains largely untried, both his admirers and detractors  agree. Although he has moved to streamline his administration by announcing a  top-level reorganization effective July 1, they say McCray has not yet faced  the hard decisions that can make or break a presidency.  </P> <P> That is about to change.  </P> <P> Having completed his first academic year at Cal State Long Beach, McCray now  faces a budget crunch of potentially dramatic proportions.  </P> <P> "The honeymoon is over," said one program administrator who asked not to be  named. "Now he's going to have to make some real tough decisions. I'm afraid of  things falling apart."  </P> <P> The president already has taken the unusual step of requesting permission from  the state chancellor's office to turn away as many as 3,000 qualified students  for the fall.  </P> <P> The looming crisis is attributed to a number of factors.  </P> <P> Historically, Cal State Long Beach has been underfunded compared to other  campuses in the California State University and Colleges system, McCray said.  While the average campus received $5,376 per full-time student last year, the  Long Beach campus received only $4,583 -- about 85% of the average. The same  general pattern, McCray said, has existed for years.  </P> <P> He said state funding formulas are outdated, assuming that large campuses can  educate students more cheaply than smaller campuses. Thus, large Cal State  campuses, such as Long Beach, San Diego and Northridge, receive considerably  less per student than do smaller campuses such as Stanislaus, Bakersfield and  Humboldt.  </P> <P> In Long Beach, McCray said, the financial problem has been compounded by  rapidly growing enrollment that has consistently exceeded expectations. The  university is required by law to accept all students who qualify for admission,  McCray said. When the university accepts more than the number of students  budgeted, it effectively receives a lower allocation per student, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loss of $3 Million  </P> <P> The university's financial resources also would be affected by Gov. George  Deukmejian's proposed fiscal 1989-90 budget that, among other things, would  reduce the state university system's funding by about $45 million. The Long  Beach campus alone would lose $3 million next year under the governor's plan,  McCray said. The university's budget this year totals $136.4 million.  </P> <P> University officials have expressed hope, however, that an unexpected budget  surplus may help alleviate the problem.  </P> <P> McCray says he plans to tackle the problem on several fronts. First, he said,  he has asked Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, who heads the state university system,  to review what he considers archaic formulas by which the state determines how  money is distributed among the system's 19 campuses. Funding is based on a  complicated set of factors including the mix and variety of programs, type of  faculty and environmental setting of a campus, McCray said, and the formulas  have not been examined in a number of years.  </P> <P> He also has asked Reynolds to declare Cal State Long Beach "impacted" -- a  legal maneuver that would allow the campus to turn away as many as 3,000  otherwise qualified applicants for fall admission. Thus, McCray said, the  university could limit total enrollment to about 23,600, the level for which he  expects to receive funding.  </P> <P> "It's a ticklish situation," the president said. Rather than sacrifice quality  in favor of expedience, he said, the university ought to stop trying to do a  job it is not being adequately funded to do and hope the resulting furor will  send a message to the state capital. "The pain is created by public policy," he  said. "What we have to do is begin inflicting the pain on the public-policy  makers, and the way we do that is by not accommodating students."  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach's anticipated $3-million decrease in the state allocation,  he said, presents a challenge; one that is bound to draw blood. To meet the  governor's proposed bare-bones budget, McCray said, he is considering major  cuts in three areas: athletics, the University Art Museum and KLON, a  jazz-oriented public radio station associated with the university.  </P> <P> In May, McCray said, he asked the heads of those programs to examine how they  could operate on about three-fifths of their current budgets. Other options  under consideration, he said, include eliminating the programs entirely.  </P> <P> Already the mere specter of such solutions has led to a flurry of angry  petitions and phone calls, McCray said. And even if the proposed cuts are  carried out, he said, they would make only a dent in the problem. A remaining  shortfall of about $2.1 million would have to be eliminated by a hiring freeze  and reductions in such academic support items as new library books, travel,  paper or laboratory supplies.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are upset," McCray said. "The difficulty is that none of the  letters have suggested (alternative) ways of finding funding."  </P> <P> So far, the impending cuts -- which McCray says probably will be finalized this  month -- do not seem to have seriously tarnished the new president's image. Of  more concern on campus, it seems, are the implications of his planned  administrative reorganization.  </P> <P> In essence, according to McCray, the number of administrators reporting  directly to the president will be reduced from about 12 to 4. A new provost  position will be created. It will be filled by John Beljan, vice president for  academic affairs, who will be second-in-command to McCray.  </P> <P> A vice president for administration and finance will assume responsibility for  budgeting. William Griffith, a former accountant who was business manager 11  years at Northeastern Illinois University, has been selected.  </P> <P> The other two officers reporting directly to the president will be Robert  Bersi, vice president for development, and June Cooper, who will become vice  president for student services. She now is vice president for faculty and staff  relations.  </P> <P> The announced changes have created concern in some quarters.  </P> <P> One lower-level administrator expressed discomfort at the prospect of Griffith,  a new force on campus with whom few are familiar, exerting such major control  over the university's purse strings.  </P> <P> And student leaders say they are wary of Cooper's ability to oversee student  services -- which include counseling, student activities, housing and food  services -- after spending so many years representing the interests of faculty  and staff. That wariness has been increased, they say, by recent perceptions  that McCray has been less than hospitable to student input and concerns.  </P> <P> "When there are valid student issues that need to be brought up, they are put  off," said Roger Thompson, who has been Associated Student Body president since  last summer. After meeting regularly with student leaders during his first  semester on campus, Thompson said, McCray has recently become so difficult to  get an appointment with that Thompson has been unable to see him in two months.  "The perception," Thompson said, "is that we aren't getting his ear."  </P> <P> McCray blames Thompson's recent inability to see him on miscommunication, and  says he is "stunned" by the student leader's perception that students are  ignored. McCray says one of his major goals is to foster good communications  with all sectors of the campus.  </P> <P> He recently initiated a special program under which a major campus walkway is  named after an outstanding staff member each month.  </P> <P> During a recent luncheon with about 10 new teachers over a relaxed meal of  vegetables and spinach crepes, McCray casually discussed issues ranging from  the anticipated budget crunch to his ideas on recruiting minority students.  </P> <P> "I think this is very valuable," said Everett Murdock, a computer education  professor. "There's contact made. What he's doing is establishing  communications for the future and it's fostered a good climate."  </P> <P> McCray's schedule for the rest of the day, which he described as typical,  included teaching his Chaucer class, meeting with faculty union president  Winchell, attending a meeting of Boy Scout leaders to discuss the coming  Scout-O-Rama of which he is chairman, and meeting with soon-to-be student  services czar Cooper.  </P> <P> McCray generally begins his days with an early morning jog near his home and  ends them at one of the numerous social or cultural gatherings he is often  called upon to attend. Unlike Horn, who traveled a great deal, McCray says he  prefers to stay close to home and involve himself in local activities.  </P> <P> His energy and enthusiasm, in fact, has been noticed by Chancellor Reynolds,  who in the past has often been unwilling to comment publicly on the  professional performances of campus presidents.  </P> <P> "I am absolutely delighted with his administration," Reynolds said in a  telephone interview. "He's proved to be a very caring manager of the campus and  he's a pleasure to work with. We work very well shoulder-to-shoulder. He has  not made a misstep in my opinion, and that's very unusual on a campus of this  size and complexity."  </P></p>

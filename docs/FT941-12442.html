			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Books: The Breughel of the suburbs - A middlebrow moralist with a taste for the grotesque AFFLICTION by Fay Weldon HarperCollins Pounds 12.99, 172 pages Out of the gutter of wild desire on to the smooth lawns of married love' - that, says Fay Weldon in her famous novel The Life and Loves of a She Devil, is women's destiny. Weldon's entire oeuvre, some 20 works of fiction written since the mid 1970s, is a comic, angry scrutiny of how this fate turns sour. In simple fables, highly coloured, full of larger than life, stock characters, she depicts the conflicts of sex, power and man's inhumanity to women. She is unique in contemporary fiction: a feminist who is also a popular, station-bookstall novelist. Original visions or politically correct potboilers? Weldon's flare is for the grotesque, for creating gargoyle-characters like the She Devil, a clumsy giantess of a rejected wife who leaves her children, burns down her house, chops herself up to become as dainty as her husband's mistress, and returns to imprison and humiliate him. When this sort of black fantasy works, Weldon is our Breughel of the suburbs, exaggerating fallen everyday life into a blaze of chaos and sin and witty discontent. But when it fails, she is an unsubtle puppeteer, playing around with hollow figures, spouting cliches: a dull, too-topical moralist for our times. Affliction takes an hour to read and seems dated even before one has finished it. Annette and Spicer, TV researcher and wine merchant, are Mr and Mrs 1990s: media lunches, recessionary worries, pizzas and videos, Father's Night at the antenatal clinic. When Spicer suddenly becomes less caring than expected, they both panic, and each secretly seeks out a therapist. Their shrinks - you guessed it? - turn out to be a married couple as mixed up as they are, and intent on making their patients even more miserable. Confessions, insanities, infidelities, traumas, come tumbling out. Who is the voice of reason in the Hampstead madhouse? Weldon of course tips the scales: confused Annette is the vulnerable naive victim; confused Spicer the feckless vicious manipulator. But the sex war, the heart of a Weldon novel, here lacks the comic energy which inspired books like the She Devil or The Hearts and Lives of Men. The jokes in Affliction are feeble. The money-grubbing, body-grabbing middle European shrinks are predictable, unfunny stage villains. The absurdist denouement - haemorrhages, hospitals, quacks, a ride with a truck driver whose fee is sex every 50 miles - is recounted in flat depressing tones. 'Truck drivers are expected to be brutes. Terrible things happen to girls on the road . . . but Spicer is meant to be civilised, and you are his wife. Spicer is worse than the truck drivers,' says Annette's best friend. The leitmotif of Weldon's novels is that sex and greed win out over civilisation. Show this through a fantasy of grotesques and caricatures, and you have a comedy where ideas and images dovetail, and where even Weldon's notoriously sloppy style fits in with the vision of chaos. Show it through a middlebrow peep at partner-swapping among media folk, and you have just that  -a tale as flimsy and artless as a gossip column.</p>

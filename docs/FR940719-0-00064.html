That rule imposed fees on Korean-flag vessels in the amount of $100,000 per voyage, but suspended the sanctions until June 1, 1994. The Commission has since reviewed the progress achieved by the Government of Korea in implementing commitments to remove the restrictions. Inasmuch as reports from affected U.S. and Korean carriers confirm that the impediments at issue have been removed, and all the carriers recommend termination of the proceeding, there is no reason to continue the proceeding or to assess fees. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  May 19, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Robert D. Bourgoin, General Counsel, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20573, (202) 523&hyph;5740. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proceeding under section 19(1)(b) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, 46 U.S.C. app. 876(1)(b) (``Section 19''), was initiated by the Federal Maritime Commission (``Commission'') on June 7, 1991 (56 FR 26361), by Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``Proposed Rule''). The Proposed Rule raised issues concerning apparent Government of Korea (``ROK'') restrictions on U.S. carriers' ability to engage in trucking operations and to contract directly for rail service in Korea incidental to intermodal commerce in the United States/Korea trade (``Trade''). It proposed sanctions consisting of $100,000 per voyage fees on vessels in the Trade operated by Korean-flag carriers Hanjin Shipping Co., Ltd. and Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., Ltd. (collectively, ``Korean Carriers'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the basis of comments on the Proposed Rule and several supplemental submissions received thereafter from the Korean Carriers and the affected U.S. carriers, Sea-Land Service, Inc. and American President Lines, Ltd. (collectively, ``U.S. Carriers''), the Commission published a final rule on November 18, 1992 (57 FR 54318). The final rule found that unfavorable conditions existed in the Trade by virtue of ROK restrictions on U.S. carriers' trucking activities. It imposed the sanctions cited in the Proposed Rule, but suspended them until June 1, 1994, noting commitments made by the ROK in the course of bilateral inter-governmental discussions in the summer of 1992. The suspension, the Commission explained, would allow time for the ROK to implement the promised changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the meantime, the Commission directed that the U.S. and Korean Carriers, including Cho Yang Shipping Co., Ltd., which was added to the list of Korean Carriers, submit periodic reports to the Commission regarding the ROK's implementation of its commitments. Although the finding of unfavorable conditions was limited to the trucking issue, the Commission directed the carriers to report as well on ROK restrictions on rail access by the U.S. Carriers. The parties were ordered to address enumerated issues in submissions due December 15, 1992; May 1, 1993; November 1, 1993; and May 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the course of the reporting period, the Commission was advised that the ROK made considerable changes in its regulations and policies, with the effect of remedying the conditions in issue. Effective May 10, 1993, regulations were amended to enable U.S. carriers to issue Bonded Rail Transportation Permits without the need for a trucking license. Vehicle ownership requirements for obtaining Simplified Bonded Transportation Permits were substantially reduced. The carriers also indicated that the ROK adhered to its promised regionally-keyed timetable for issuing trucking licenses. All limitations on U.S. carrier trucking operations were reportedly removed as of April 1, 1994. All five carriers, U.S. and Korean, advise that the conditions on which the final rule is based no longer exist, and that the Commission's objectives in this proceeding have been met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is satisfied that there is no longer a basis for continuing this proceeding. The final rule is accordingly withdrawn and the proceeding discontinued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 586  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ecuador, Korea, Maritime carriers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, part 586 of title 46 CFR is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

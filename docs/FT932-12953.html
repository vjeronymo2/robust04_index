			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Letter: No remuneration hike at Premier Sir, Lucy Kellaway's article, 'Facts show fat cats are fatter' (April 20) and the letter from Mr Donald Butcher, of the UK Shareholders' Association (April 23), both suffer from a failure to check facts, and from the tendancy for an untruth, once written, to be accepted as fact. The supposed 50 per cent hike in management remuneration in Premier's 1992 accounts stems from an elementary failure to notice that the comparative period is one of only nine months. When the comparative figure is grossed up to the 12-month period, the increase is 12 per cent. However, this is not due to directors being awarded 12 per cent increases, but that an additional executive director joined Premier in June 1992 and in the previous year another new executive director did not join until September 1991. The real increase for executive directors for that year and for 1993 was basically in line with inflation - that is, no increase. In 1993, following retirement of two senior executive directors in June and December, total management remuneration is likely to be down by at least 30 per cent. I suggest that in future both your newspaper and the representative from UK Shareholders' Association have the courtesy to check the facts. The old adage about not being able to believe what you read in the newspapers seems true in this situation, but unfortunately in our case mud tends to stick.

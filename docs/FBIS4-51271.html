			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 26 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chinese  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said today that history is  the best possible judgement for an historical event.    Wu Jianmin made the above statement in reply to a question  about the "June 4" incident at today's news conference,  stressing that over the last five years, China has enjoyed  political stability, economic development, and further  improvement in people's livelihood. The status quo accords with  the wish of the Chinese people and meets the need of the region  and the world for peace, stability, and development.    Wu Jianmin quoted Jiang Zemin as saying in a meeting with  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir on 12 May: Looking back at  the political turmoil that occurred between late spring and  early summer in 1989, I feel that China would not have been  enjoying today's stability if it had not taken resolute measures  then.</p>

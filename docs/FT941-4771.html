			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / A tale of paper cod and accelerated cohesion fish: The Greek handling of the talks unravelled the EU's Byzantine solution to the fishing row A dispute over the conduct of the talks, rather than the content of the negotiations, appears to have stood in the way of the European Union clinching entry terms with Norway late on Tuesday night, when ministerial negotiations in Brussels on EU enlargement broke up in disarray Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, walked out of the negotiations for some two hours, irritated by the way the Greek presidency of the EU presented Spain with what he evidently saw as a 'take it or leave it' offer on access to Norwegian fish, without allowing time for the Spanish to examine the details. Spanish officials at the meeting nevertheless confirmed that they were prepared to give serious consideration to the content of the offer. The main obstacle to concluding terms with Norway is Spanish insistence that it get back the 7,000 tonnes of cod its fishing fleet used to catch in Norwegian waters before it was barred in 1981. Madrid equally wants the cod Norway ceded to the EU as part of this year's European Economic Area (EEA) free trade zone treaty 'consolidated' as part of a permanent quota. This amounts to 7,250 tonnes this year, rising to 11,000 tonnes in 1997, with the so-called 'cohesion' or poor countries, Spain and Portugal, getting 45 per cent each, and Greece and Ireland splitting the rest. But for over a year Oslo has unflinchingly refused to give up a single extra fish. 'I will stand tall and firm and say No,' Mr Jan Henry Olsen, Norway's fisheries minister, said on Tuesday, as Spain reiterated its threat to veto Norwegian entry unless he budged. The European Commission's alchemists, however, were busy working up a seemingly impossible formula to save the face of both Madrid and Oslo. Its main elements are: To bring forward the 11,000 tonnes quota for 1997 to this year (these are known as 'accelerated cohesion fish'). Under the EEA, the Union also gets 2.9 per cent of the total Norwegian waters cod quota, or about 40,000 tonnes this year. But the cod stock is rising because of careful Norwegian fisheries management, promising a higher tonnage for the EU in coming years. Brussels wants to satisfy Spain's demands by giving it these additional tonnes (known as 'paper fish', because at the moment they are only there on paper). Anticipating that Spain will not be satisfied, the Commission has also looked at 'other people's fish'. Brussels suggests the Union buys a portion of Russia's cod quota in Norwegian waters, allocate it to Spain, and pass the bill through Oslo's contribution to the EU budget. Norwegian officials, with whom this formula had to be worked out, were obviously familiar with the details of this package; Spanish officials, equally obviously, were not. When Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek European affairs minister chairing the EU Council of Ministers, presented Spain with what it regarded as a fait accompli, Mr Solana took it as an affront and left for his embassy. Spanish officials say they need time to study the implications, but concede that the Commission formula could turn dross, or at least cod, into gold.</p>

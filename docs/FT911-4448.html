			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Slough Estates makes Pounds 138m cash call to reduce gearing SLOUGH Estates, the UK's biggest industrial property company, yesterday announced a rights issue to raise Pounds 137.7m aimed at repairing the damage inflicted on its balance sheet by the sharp fall in property values. The announcement that 141m convertible preference shares would be issued at 100p each sent the shares 9p higher to 253p. The stock market has been speculating about a rights issue from Slough for some months. The rights issue would reduce Slough's year-end debt from Pounds 825m to Pounds 687m, cutting its gearing from 76 per cent to 56 per cent. Mr Joseph Harding, administrative director, said that although the company did not envisage any short-term problems with its gearing, it might have risked breaching bank guarantees if the steep fall in property values continued. Rather than be forced to raise money from its shareholders, the company preferred to choose its timing, he said. In addition, the company said that the rights issue would allow it to take advantage of the depressed market and acquire properties on attractive terms. However, nothing was planned at present. The rights issue follows the announcement last month of a 19 per cent fall in shareholders' diluted net assets, putting them at just below the value of end-1988. At the time, chairman Sir Nigel Mobbs said he could not recall a worse property market. The company said yesterday: 'The current downturn in the property market, involving both a virtual standstill in institutional investment and a significant slowdown in letting activity, has been more severe than generally expected.' The convertible preference shares are being issued on a one-for-two basis which, assuming conversion, is equivalent to about one new share for every 5.4 ordinary shares held. The new shares will have a fixed cumulative preferential dividend of 8.25p (net) a year. The rights issue has been underwritten by SG Warburg and the brokers are SG Warburg Securities. During the past few years, Slough has increased the development programme in its Pounds 1.8bn portfolio and included a greater office and retail content. It has also increased its overseas developments, particularly in North America and Australia, although 71 per cent of its portfolio is in the UK. Lex, Page 24</p>

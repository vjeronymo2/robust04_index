			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AZERBAIJANIS DECIDE TO RESUME RAILROAD SERVICE TO ARMENIA  </P> <P> Leaders of a political movement in the southern republic of Azerbaijan  suspended on Tuesday a rail strike that choked off supplies of fuel, food and  housing supplies to neighboring Armenia, a member said.  </P> <P> "We decided in a directive to open the railroad to Armenia as of 2200 (10  p.m.)," said Ingilap Aslanov, a member of the grass-roots People's Front, in a  telephone interview from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku.  </P> <P> He said the strike was suspended until Oct. 23 to give lawmakers in Moscow a  chance to respond to Azerbaijan's demands to remove special Kremlin  administration of the Nagorno-Karabakh area -- the source of a ethnic strife  between Azerbaijanis and Armenians.  </P> <P> Soviet troops moved into the Caucasus republics last week to break the strike  and blockade that has been strangling Armenia and the Armenian enclave of  Nagorno-Karabakh.  </P></p>

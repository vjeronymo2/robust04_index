			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts Some recent worries about government funding must have been dispelled by yesterday's Pounds 2.75bn gilts auction. Though the total was covered 1.62 times by bids - the lowest since auctions started in April last year - it was still well above worst fears. The lack of spread between the average bid yield and the highest accepted yield indicates a fairly heavy concentration of demand around the auction price. The cover ratio would only have been really worrying if a large number of bids had been below the market. The still better news for Mr Lamont is that the auction revealed continuing demand from domestic investors. Overseas buying of gilts has never been as large as expected since the election and appears to have been even more muted since Danish voters rejected the Maastricht Treaty. The 20-year maturity on yesterday's auction was never likely to appeal to foreign investors anyway, but domestic institutions clearly rose to the occasion even though this may have been at the expense of the equity market. The gilts market may thus not have all that much to fear from the funding consequences of low growth. Confirmation that GDP fell by 0.5 per cent in the first quarter may set off another round of forecast downgrading for the year as a whole. But a weak economy with low inflation is likely to drive switching out of equities and into gilts at a pace faster than the rise in the borrowing requirement. A one percentage point decline in growth expectations for the year as a whole implies extra government borrowing of only Pounds 4bn - less than yesterday's total bids.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Judge rules on BCCI papers A HIGH COURT judge yesterday refused to make an immediate order that the Serious Fraud Office disclose to the liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International documents seized from three former officers of the bank and a broker through which many of its treasury transactions took place. The documents were obtained from the homes of Mr Agha Abedi and Mr Swaleh Naqvi from a safe deposit box in the name of Mr Zafar Iqbal, and from the offices of Capcom Financial Services. Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor - the senior Chancery judge - said that none of the four had been notified of the liquidators' application for production of their documents. He said that those from whom documents had been seized were in general entitled to an opportunity to present to the court any objection they might have to the production of the documents. Capcom should be asked its attitude to disclosure and more information was needed about the circumstances of the three individuals and the practicability of notifying them before he could decide whether notification to them should be dispensed with. The liquidators, partners in Touche Ross, were granted an order for disclosure by the SFO of other documents obtained under compulsory powers from Price Waterhouse, former auditors of BCCI, and from Control Securities, a company formerly controlled by Mr Nazmudin Virani, other companies in the Control group, and from Mr Virani himself. The judge rejected the SFO's contention that it could voluntarily disclose to liquidators or administrators documents it had obtained under its compulsory powers.</p>

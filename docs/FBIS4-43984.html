			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Thomas Klestil by Alfred Worm: </F> place and date not given: "Departing From the Rule in Special  Cases"]    [Text] [Worm] Mr. President, we ask you for an authentic  interpretation. According to Article 65 of the Constitution,  the president represents the republic internationally.    [Klestil] The article also states: He signs state treaties.  However, I have never left any doubt that I will delegate this  authority.    [Worm] The Constitution says: According to the proposal of  the president.    [Klestil] That is right. This is the power to sign state  treaties. After all, the Constitution is the basis of our  democracy. I have sworn an oath on it.    [Worm] Your predecessors have never stressed this aspect of  the Constitution.    [Klestil] I know that the practices of my predecessors are a  strong element in the assessment of a political situation. I  have always made it clear that I will delegate this power. I  have already done that. All other details were discussed with  the chancellor.    [Worm] Why was there so much wrangling among the political  parties after the referendum?    [Klestil] During the campaign for the vote, I stressed that  I  would assume a nonpartisan role. This is what I would like to  signal to the European Union [EU] with my trip to Corfu. My  presence is designed to underline the historic significance of  the signing of this treaty.    [Worm] You will not sign the treaty in Corfu but you will  make a speech.    [Klestil] That has been agreed.    [Worm] What about the European Council?    [Klestil] Everything that is to be implemented politically  must be done by the government. Thus, it is quite natural for  the chancellor and the foreign minister to represent the  government in this body.    [Worm] The European Council will convene in Germany in  December. Will you participate in this meeting?    [Klestil] No, I will not.    [Worm] Can you think of an event that might induce you to  attend a meeting of the European Council in 1996 when the new  security structures are adopted and when you might act as the  supreme commander of the Austrian Army, for example?    [Klestil] Let me repeat once more: Basically, this will be  the task of the government because it must implement the  decisions. However, there might be very special occasions  permitting a departure from the rule.    [Worm] What will be the "rule?"    [Klestil] That the chancellor and the foreign minister  represent Austria.    [Worm] Are you annoyed about the refusal of the Austrian  People's Party to allow State Secretary Brigitte Ederer to sign  the treaty?    [Klestil] I have left no doubt that I will delegate the  authority to sign the treaty. Theoretically, I would have  considered it possible to suggest the signing of the treaty by  two persons -- the chancellor and the foreign minister. Bearing  in mind that Leopold Figl was the only person to sign the State  Treaty, one could have asked only Foreign Minister Mock to sign  the treaty with the EU. However, the government submitted a  different proposal.    [Worm] Did you express surprise?    [Klestil] I talked with the chancellor to avoid any  friction.  One should not inform the other side via the Austrian Press  Agency.    [Worm] Do you understand Ms. Ederer's situation?    [Klestil] During a discussion with her, I did not have the  impression that she was upset. She showed great commitment  during the negotiations. Thus, it would have been normal for  her to sign the treaty as well. However, the parties made a  different decision. In my view, a smaller group of persons who  held the talks would have corresponded to the weight of the  occasion.</p>

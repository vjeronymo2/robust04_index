			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSES  </P> <P> About once every 18 months The Times publishes a letter complaining that buses  add to pollution and traffic congestion (letter, Dec. 17). True, their engine  emissions need improvement.  </P> <P> But I wondered today, as I stood in the aisle with 40 other passengers, what it  would be like if we all occupied the same space on the street in 40  automobiles, based on the prevailing statistic of approximately one person per  car.  </P> <P> Other impediments to drivers are pedestrians and those pesky bicycles. I can  only imagine the annoyance of one motorist when I asked him to back up his  100-plus-horsepower getaway special, which had me and a woman with a baby  carriage trapped in the crosswalk.  </P> <P> JAMES S.

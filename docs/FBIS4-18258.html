			<p>BFN     [Text] Some movement around the Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia-- FYROM] issue continues due to  the successive visits by U.S. envoy Matthew Nimetz to Skopje and  Athens. Mr. Nimetz arrived in Athens from Skopje again this  afternoon and held a meeting with Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias, thus continuing the new round of contacts with the  Greek side. Our correspondent Mirela Kalostipi has the  following dispatch from the Foreign Ministry. Good evening  Mirela.    [Kalostipi] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. The new  round of talks between Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and  Bill Clinton's special envoy on the Skopje issue actually  concluded a few minutes ago. Mr. Nimetz arrived in Athens this  afternoon, and at 1900 he came to the Foreign Ministry and  talked with the Greek foreign minister for approximately 1 hour.  After this meeting, Mr. Nimetz will be returning to New York.    Some statements were made, but the most important point is  that Mr. Papoulias has accepted the invitation of Cyrus Vance,  the international UN mediator, to a meeting in New York from 9  to 11 April. Here we should say that, according to reliable  press reports, a similar invitation has also been accepted by  Skopje Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski.    [Announcer] For the same dates?    [Kalostipi] For the same date, for 11 April. There is a  statement by Mr. Crvenkovski that he will also visit New York to  meet with Mr. Vance. In any case, Mr. Papoulias said that Mr.  Kiro Gligorov and the Skopjeans persist in their well-known  intransigence. We will see how this story develops. In any  event, in a statement after his meeting with Mr. Papoulias, Mr.  Nimetz said that continuous in-depth and intensive discussions  are going on both in Athens and in Skopje. They are discussing  all aspects of the problem and, according to Mr. Nimetz, it is  obvious that both sides have both the desire and the will to  reach a solution. We are concerned that a solution to the  problem be found. However, he added, there are still  difficulties, and the negotiations and talks should continue in  order to find some way out.    [Anouncer] Mirela, do you assess the fact that both sides  have accepted the invitation to meet with Cyrus Vance in New  York on the same dates as a positive development showing that  the negotiations are on the right track?    [Kalostipi] Clearly, this shows that something positive is  happening. At least there is a persistent movement to find a  solution soon; and when we say soon, we mean prior to the prime  minister's visit to the United States. But there is nothing  clear concerning the question of ending Skopjean intransigence.  However, I suppose--and this is a guess--that for both Mr.  Crvenkovski and Mr. Papoulias to decide to visit New York in  order to meet, most probably separately, with the international  mediator means that they have something to say of which we do  not yet know. Probably--and I am still guessing--the Skopjeans  are ready to make some practical concession, but all this is  conjecture. What we know as a fact is that Mr. Vance will meet  with both Mr. Crvenkovski and Greek Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias in the next few days.</p>

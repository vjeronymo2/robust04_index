			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`Roundup' by XINHUA reporter Tang Tianri (0781 1131 2480): </F> "The Light of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence Will  Shine Forever"]    [Text] Beijing, 26 Jun (XINHUA) -- The 40th anniversary of  the promulgation of the five principles of peaceful coexistence,  which was jointly initiated by China, India and Myanmar [Burma],  falls in June this year. The five principles are: mutual  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual  nonaggression, non-interference in each other's internal  affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.  After 40 years of tests in practice, the five principles of  peaceful coexistence have shown strong vitality and become a  universally-acknowledged basic norm governing relations among  nations.    After World War II, national independence and liberation  movements flourished vigorously in Asia, Africa, and Latin  America. Newly independent countries were in urgent need of a  new international relationship based on equality to defend  national sovereignty and develop their national economies. The  five principles of peaceful coexistence had emerged precisely to  meet such a strong common aspiration of the newly independent  countries.    China and India, two giants in Asia, established diplomatic  relations on 1 April 1950 after their rebirths. On 29 April  1954, China and India signed an "agreement between the People's  Republic of China and the Republic of India on trade and  communications between China's Tibet region and India," and the  five principles of peaceful coexistence were introduced for the  first time into the preface of the agreement. In June 1954,  Premier Zhou Enlai visited India and Burma at the invitation of  the two countries and successively held talks with Indian Prime  Minister Nehru and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu. The five  principles of peaceful coexistence were officially announced as  the basic norms for guiding bilateral relations in both the  "joint statement of Chinese and Indian prime ministers" issued  on 28 June 1954 and the "joint statement of Chinese and Burmese  prime ministers" issued on 29 June 1954. The Sino-Indian joint  statement proposed that "these principles not only be applicable  to relations between nations, but also to international  relations in general." The Sino-Burmese joint statement hoped  that "these principles will be observed by all countries."    In April 1955, the year after China, India, and Burma  initiated the five principles of peaceful coexistence, 29 newly  independent countries from Asia and Africa held the historic  Asian-African Conference in Bangdung, Indonesia. With concerted  efforts made by the representatives of various countries, the  conference adopted the "declaration on promotion of world peace  and cooperation" and formulated the ten principles of the  Bangdung Conference. These 10 principles, which contained all  five of the principles of peaceful coexistence, represented an  extension and development of the latter. Since then, the five  principles of peaceful coexistence have been recognized and  accepted by more and more nations, international organizations,  and international meetings; and have been incorporated into a  series of major international documents, including declarations  adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. The five  principles were also reaffirmed in the documents on China's  establishment of diplomatic relations with more than 100  nations, including Western countries like the United States, and  in treaties as well as communiques China has signed with other  countries.    The world today is characterized by diversity. There are  about 1,000 ethnic nationalities and more than 200 countries,  including more than 180 independent, sovereign nations. They  differ not only in social systems and development levels, but  also in ideology, cultural heritage, national character, and  religious belief. The practice of many years has proved that  whenever a few countries in disregard of the said differences  tried stubbornly to impose their values on "democracy" and  "human rights" as well as their social systems on other  countries, there would invariably be unrest and chaos, making  such practice utterly futile. Similarly, contradictions would  be intensified and international tensions heightened if the  modes of "big family," "bloc politics," "sphere of influence"  and "world leadership" were applied in handling international  relations. With the end of the Cold War, there is no more bloc  confrontation characterized by the contention for hegemony  between the two superpowers. However, manifestations of power  politics still exist in international relations, marked by the  big suppressing the small, the strong bullying the weak,  interference in others' internal affairs under various excuses,  and frequent threats to apply sanctions and even to use force.  Therefore, it is still of paramount and realistic significance  to actively advocate and apply the five principles of peaceful  coexistence in handling international relations.    The five principles of peaceful coexistence, transcending  the limits of social system and ideology, have generalized the  most basic norms that govern international relations. Only when  international relations are completely based on the five  principles of peaceful coexistence; the differences between  nations are duly recognized and respected; all nations, big or  small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are recognized as equals in  the international community with the right to choose their own  ideology, social system, and the mode of development suitable  for them; and mutual exchange, seeking of common grounds and  keeping of differences, as well as complementary exchange are  encouraged, can the nations co-exist peacefully and enjoy  genuine peace, stability and development.    In order to promote peace and development, a peaceful,  stable, just, and equitable new international political and  economic order should be established on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence and on the premise of  recognizing the diversity of the world and differences between  nations. Under such a new order, mutual respect, equality, and  cooperation between nations will take the place of hegemonism  and power politics; negotiations and dialogue will replace the  use and the threat of the use of force; and equality, mutual  benefit, and complementary exchange will substitute for trade  protectionism and unequal exchange. To achieve these ends, the  international community needs to cooperate extensively and make  long-term and unremitting efforts.</p>

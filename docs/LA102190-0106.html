			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> GUZZO FITS INTO THE SCHEME OF THINGS IN EL CAMINO REAL DEFENSE  </P> <P> Remember Jack (Hacksaw) Reynolds, the inside linebacker who left the Los  Angeles Rams and helped the San Francisco 49ers win Super Bowl XVI in 1982?  </P> <P> Meet Adam (Jigsaw) Guzzo, an inside linebacker who left the Simi Valley High  Pioneers to become the final piece of the puzzle for an El Camino Real defense  that has quickly become one of the best in the City Section.  </P> <P> The Conquistadores are whole again, the last hole filled by a surprise transfer  three weeks into the season. Guzzo is a perfect fit.  </P> <P> The senior showed up at El Camino Real two weeks ago, having moved from his  mother's home in Simi Valley to his father's home in West Hills. Guzzo already  had ties to El Camino Real: His girlfriend is a student there and he had played  in the West Valley Eagles youth football program with many of the Conquistadore  players.  </P> <P> "I walked in the locker room and there he was," said Chris Griggs, the team's  other inside linebacker. "It was just in time. We needed inside linebacker  help."  </P> <P> A knee injury to linebacker Damien Lopez had forced lineman Hilton Romanski to  fill in at linebacker. In its first three games, El Camino Real was able to  defeat punchless Monroe and Cleveland but had been defeated by Sylmar. Powerful  San Fernando and Kennedy loomed ahead.  </P> <P> The addition of Guzzo enabled Romanski to return to defensive tackle and gave  the Conquistadores a talented quartet of linebackers -- Troy Snider and Jim  Robertson on the outside, Griggs and Guzzo on the inside.  </P> <P> "When Adam came, everything came back together," said Ryan Marine, a two-way  starter at running back and safety.  </P> <P> El Camino Real stunned San Fernando, 14-13, last week, with Guzzo dashing 76  yards with a fumble recovery to set up the winning touchdown. The  Conquistadores were even more impressive Friday night, blanking Kennedy, 20-0,  and holding talented Golden Cougar running back Ontiwaun Carter to 45 yards in  18 carries.  </P> <P> Flashbacks: Those merry pranksters who made up the Quartz Hill Class of 1970  were at it again Friday night during the Rebels' homecoming game that also  served to celebrate its 20-year reunion.  </P> <P> "Made up" is the key phrase here.  </P> <P> Reporters from several newspapers were told by helpful members of the Class of  '70 that Quartz Hill's 35-7 win over Saugus was the school's first homecoming  victory since, you guessed it, 1970. Can you dig that? Like, unreal, man.  </P> <P> Unreal, indeed. Turns out the Rebels won homecoming games in "1988, '87, and  many other years," according to John Albee, who has been the Quartz Hill coach  since 1968.  </P> <P> Home sweet home: After two decades of feeling like an unwanted guest, Royal  finally has a castle to call its own.  </P> <P> Until this season, the Highlanders played home games at rival Simi Valley High.  In 1988, a bond issue to build a stadium at Royal High was defeated by less  than 1%, a margin of 65 votes. Morale on campus was low.  </P> <P> But thanks to the efforts of Principal Dave Jackson and Athletic Director Terry  Dobbins, the Highlanders this year play at Moorpark College, perhaps the finest  facility in Ventura County.  </P> <P> "The lack of a stadium was a major problem. The kids felt like they were second  class," said Dobbins, in his third year at Royal after serving as Simi Valley  athletic director for six years. "Royal needed an identity of its own."  </P> <P> The Highlanders have responded with first-class performances, shutting out  Newbury Park and Agoura in their two Marmonte League home games. Royal is 6-1,  having lost only at Camarillo.  </P> <P> "Getting Moorpark was a big boost," said Tim Ross, a third-year starter. "It's  our place. We're proud to have people come and watch us there."  </P> <P> Able Gable: Leon Gable's 330 rushing yards Friday night against Monroe bettered  by three yards his total of two weeks ago against Van Nuys. The North Hollywood  tailback's 657 yards in those two games is more than the season rushing total  of seven area City Section teams.  </P> <P> Gable and Montclair Prep's Eliel Swinton became the second and third area  rushers to break the 1,000-yard barrier. Swinton, a Montclair Prep sophomore,  had his fourth 200-yard game of the season Friday night to give him 1,016  yards. Gable has 1,029.  </P> <P> Glendale's Pathon Rucker leads area players with 1,183 yards.  </P> <P> Block party: Someday, somewhere, somebody will mention to Eugene Dreher that  blocking a kick is supposed to be a rare occurrence.  </P> <P> Meantime, the Antelope Valley linebacker has blocked three field-goal attempts  and four point-after attempts this season. His latest came Friday against  Canyon on a fourth-quarter conversion kick.  </P> <P> Dreher blocks kicks with the frequency most people take vitamins: One a day.  The Antelopes have played seven games; Dreher has blocked seven kicks.  </P> <P> His secret? He blocks out negative thoughts. "It's just something I do," Dreher  said. "It needs to be done, so I do it."  </P> <P> The 6-foot-3 junior linebacker rushes from the right side. Freddy Edwards lines  up beside Dreher and charges inside, giving Dreher a clear shot at the kick.  </P> <P> "Most of the time, nobody touches me," Dreher said.  </P></p>

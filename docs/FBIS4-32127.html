			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Antonin Jilecek of the Czech Statistical Office: </F> "Economic Development From January to April 1994"]    [Text] Industrial output was 1.2 percent lower in April  than in April 1993. The volume of industrial output during the  first four months of the year was 0.7 percent lower compared  with the same period last year; this figure was 3 percent in  organizations with 25 and more employees. According to  estimates, output in smaller organizations was higher in April  and has been since the beginning of the year, by almost  one-quarter. The production of goods was higher, in particular,  in the paper and printing industry and in publishing activity,  by 15.4 percent; in oil refining, by 9.3 percent; and in the  chemical and pharmaceutical industry, by 3.3 percent.    Construction output was 0.3 percent higher in April; it was  6.5 percent higher for the first four months of the year  compared with the same period of 1993. During the first four  months, output rose by 11.4 percent in organizations with fewer  than 25 employees and among individual businessmen.    The number of employees in enterprises with 25 and more  employees in industry was 5.5 percent lower during the first  four months compared with the same period last year; this figure  was 1.4 percent higher in construction. The average monthly wage  during the aforementioned period rose to 6,185 korunas [Kc] (by  13.7 percent) in industry and to Kc6,787 (by 13.5 percent) in  construction.    The volume of cargo traffic declined in April in all types  of  traffic compared with last April. Compared with the  January-to-April period last year, during the first four months  of this year, 3.2 percent more goods were conveyed by public  road haulage; 15.1 percent fewer goods were conveyed by  railroad; and 25.2 percent fewer goods were conveyed by river.    During the first four months of 1994, sales of slaughter  cattle fell by 9 percent, of slaughter hogs by 4.4 percent, of  slaughter poultry by 27.6 percent, of milk by 6.6 percent, and  of eggs by 4.8 percent compared with the same period last year.    Consumer prices went up by 0.4 percent in April compared  with  March; at the same time, the prices of foodstuffs,  nonfoodstuffs, and services increased by the same percentage,  while prices in public catering rose by 0.6 percent.    The number of unplaced job seekers declined further in April  to 171,900 and was 13,400 lower than at the end of last year.    Retail sales in the January-to-April period amounted to  Kc131  billion and were 15.2 percent higher than during the same period  last year. Expressed in physical volume, they increased by 6.5  percent.    The overall volume of exports during the first four months  amounted to Kc117 billion in franco prices and was 6.5 percent  lower than in the January-to-April period last year. The decline  in exports to Slovakia by Kc7.5 billion--that is, by 27.9  percent--had a decisive influence on the reduction in exports.  Imports amounted to Kc118.5 billion and were 10.9 percent more  than last year; at the same time, imports from Slovakia fell by  7.1 percent. So, the balance of trade ended with a deficit of  Kc1.5 billion. With the exception of the countries of the former  Soviet Union (a deficit of Kc10.1 billion), there was a surplus  with all territories.</p>

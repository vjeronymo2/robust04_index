			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lyubov Dobrota: "Is the Power Industry on the </F> Brink of Regional `Sovereignization?' Vital Activities in the  Entire Southern Section of the Republic Have Been Endangered by  a Single Stroke of a Pen"]    [Text] For the last 30 years, all three southern  oblasts of our republic were supplied with electricity through  the Yuzhkazenergo system. Following the disintegration of the  USSR, the bulk of the power capacity in this region ended up  abroad, in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. The Zhambyl  GRES [State Regional Electric Power Station] is the only station  that is in a position to meet 80-90 percent of local needs.  However, in view of a fuel shortage, the Yuzhkazenergo  distributes the miserly amount of power which the station  currently generates evenly among South Kazakhstan, Zhambyl, and  Kzyl-Orda Oblasts.    This robs of its sleep the leadership of Zhambyl Oblast,  which considers itself the owner of electricity generated at the  Zhambyl GRES. The two adjacent oblasts are not taken into  account. The desire to dissociate at any price borders on the  absurd. For example, it is proposed to tear down the power lines  built by the Yuzhkazenergo Production Association and to create  Zhambylenergo, which will report solely to the local  authorities. The government has given the go-ahead for the  partition of the power industry in South Kazakhstan, apparently  being reluctant to pick a quarrel with the administrator of  Zhambyl.    Gennadiy Knyshev, deputy chief engineer of Yuzhkazenergo,  believes that "10 years ago, when the economy operated in a far  steadier manner, such a reorganization could have been feasible.  At present, this is a step toward the abyss."    The consequences of the undertaken transformations are easy  to figure out. For example, where are skilled cadres to be had?  Hardly anyone will go to Zhambyl from the abolished  Yuzhkazenergo or Russia. On the contrary, specialists that are  left without a job will head for the historical motherland.  Inexperienced people will be recruited by the Zhambyl  administration, and, therefore, the likelihood of an emergency  situation will increase. This is as clear as can be to the power  industry personnel of all three oblasts. Being concerned about  this turn of events, they appealed to Kazakhstanenergo, the  former Ministry of Power and Fuel Resources, and the republic  government with a letter which, in particular, says:  "Electricity consumption in the region remains the lowest in the  republic. At a stressful time of preparations for the coming  winter, with a minimal reserve of fuel, spare parts, and  materials available to us, we learned with alarm about the  expected division of our energy system and the creation of a  separate staff for the Zhambylenergo administration. We  insistently ask you that the issue of reorganizing the structure  of the power industry in south Kazakhstan be canceled until the  economic and financial situation stabilizes and the power supply  to the region is made steadier. The construction of a  high-voltage power line to carry cheap electricity from the  north to the south of Kazakhstan is a priority issue in  accomplishing the stabilization of the financial and economic  situation of the power industry and a steady supply to the three  oblasts of south Kazakhstan in which more than one-third of the  economic potential of the republic is concentrated."    Would it not be better to invest all the funds to be spent  for the reform into building this line? For the sake of  fairness, stresses G. Knyshev, we must note that among the  reasons for the "divorce" there is an objective one. The current  tax policy is such that the tax is collected for the budget from  the entire Yuzhkazenergo. Zhambyl Oblast looses a certain  proportion of these taxes. All of them go to Almaty and are then  distributed in a centralized fashion. Would it not be better to  try and solve this problem at the level of taxation rather than  slicing through the flesh of a single organism?    Following the creation of Zhambylenergo, the establishment  of  similar autonomous structures in Kzyl-Orda may become the next  step. After all, the power industry of Shymkent will not be able  to maintain them itself because the Kzyl-Orda power group,  especially TETS-6 [Heat and Electric Power Station-6] meets its  outlays out of the funds generated by Yuzhkazenergo. In a word,  the power industry in the south of the republic is on the verge  of regional or, more precisely, localistic "sovereignization."  Meanwhile, poor examples are easy to follow....    EDITORIAL NOTE. As a message from the republic  president to the Kazakh Supreme Council said, the current  government and heads of oblast administrations do not amount to  a unified team that is necessary to stabilize the economy and  enhance reform. A quite convincing confirmation of this is found  in the situation described by our correspondent, which concerns  a key, basic sector in the absence of which no other sector can  exist in a regular manner. It cannot fail to surprise us that  the partitioning of the power industry, whose strength is  precisely in the unity of the technological process and the  opportunity for various enterprises to instantly come to a  neighbor's rescue, is being devised in one of Kazakhstan's large  regions with a blessing from Almaty at a time when the  integrationist initiatives of the republic's president,  including the creation of the Eurasian Union gain ever more  supporters beyond the Kazakh borders. However, the exact  opposite thing will begin to happen here any moment.    This shows once again how topical the proposals of the  president are to bring to an end "confusion and hesitation"  involving the government, the local authorities, and various  sectors--in the interest of the economy, the society, and the  people.</p>

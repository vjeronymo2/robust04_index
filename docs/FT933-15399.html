			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Ukraine premier wants to see emergency rule UKRAINE'S prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, said yesterday the only solution to the country's mounting economic crisis was to declare a national state of emergency. This was almost immediaitely rejected by President Leonid Kravchuk, who declared he would rely on his authority, the people and the country's top industrialists to bring the country out of crisis. Mr Kuchma described Ukraine's economic situation as worse than at any time since independence nearly two years ago. He blamed it on the central bank and higher prices for Russian oil and gas. 'We must at last understand that just by printing more money we will not make ourselves richer.' Western economists estimate the monthly inflation rate in June exceeded 50 per cent and, with a national referendum scheduled for September, Ukrainian politicians are unlikely to cut spending over the summer. The reform-minded prime minister, just back from a visit to the Baltic republics, said Ukraine lacked the determination to implement reforms. 'Of course, there are paths to cope with this (higher energy prices) as the Baltic republics show,' Mr Kuchma said. 'But we have many internal problems. The key thing is for the people to have a desire to pursue reforms.' Mr Kuchma complained, too, that the continued political struggle between himself, the president and the parliament was paralysing the country. He said a national state of emergency, which he lacks the political authority to invoke, is needed to break the political deadlock and concentrate economic decision-making in the hands of a single leader. The prime minister also urged Ukraine to declare itself a temporary nuclear power. He said Ukraine had no plans to control the nuclear missiles on its territory but had to assert ownership to receive the valuable enriched uranium contained in the warheads.</p>

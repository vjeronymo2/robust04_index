			<p>BFN     [Text] Addis Ababa, 23 Apr (ENA/PANA) -- The newly formed  Ethiopian National Democratic Party (ENDP) announced in Addis  Ababa on Saturday [23 April] that it would not participate in  the upcoming Constituent Assembly elections. The party said it  decided to withdraw from the polls in protest against the  rejection by the National Electoral Board of its demands for the  extension of the deadline for the registration of voters and  candidates. It said that another demand for the extension of  the election date was also rejected by the board.    However, the ENDP vowed to continue participating in the  ongoing council discussions and debates on the draft  constitution.</p>

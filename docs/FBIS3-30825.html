He  regarded air strikes against Serbian cities "just as if Russian  cities were being bombed", Zhirinovskiy told the Prague-based  newspaper LIDOVE NOVINY. "This would completely change Russian  foreign policy," he said. If the bombings take place, all of  those countries involved should be aware "that whatever they do  to Serbian cities, the same will happen to their countries.  Bombs will fall on the cities of those countries that bomb  Serbian cities."    Zhirinovskiy confirmed that he had received an invitation  from the extreme-right Czech Republicans. He would very much  like to come, even though this would not be welcomed by all  sides. Zhirinovskiy predicted that the Czech Republic would come  to a speedy end. "Your country will be destroyed. I assure you  that, in 10 years' time, neither Moravia nor the Sudetenland  will exist. The Czechs will be forced to speak German, forget  their native language, attend German churches, and polish the  boots of German officers."</p>

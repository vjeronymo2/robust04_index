			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISSING OFFICER FOUND IN VICTORVILLE;  </P> <P> MYSTERY: MASSIVE HUNT CONDUCTED FOR BELL GARDENS POLICEMAN AFTER HE MISSES ROLL  CALL. HE IS SPOTTED WALKING DOWN STREET 12 HOURS LATER.  </P> <P> A massive search for a missing Bell Gardens police officer ended Friday evening  when he was found walking along a street in Victorville, the city where his  abandoned police cruiser had been found earlier in the day, authorities said.  </P> <P> Officer David Larimore, 35, was spotted about 6 p.m. -- about 12 hours after he  disappeared with the patrol car -- walking along a residential street in the  southern section of the city, Sgt. Michael Lenihan of the San Bernardino County  Sheriff's Department said.  </P> <P> A citizen had heard his description on a newscast, remembered that he had seen  the officer walking near 7th and Nisqually streets and called local police,  Lenihan said. Larimore was found about four or five miles from where the  abandoned squad car had been found.  </P> <P> "He was coherent. He was not hurt," said Lenihan. "He gave no problems to the  officers. He was very cooperative."  </P> <P> Mounted police and other officers had searched most of the day Friday for the  veteran officer who was seen early in the day walking toward the Mojave Desert.  </P> <P> After he was found, Larimore was taken to a sheriff's station and was being  questioned by investigators about his disappearance, Lenihan said. Authorities  did not release any information from that interview and it was unclear exactly  how the officer spent his day.  </P> <P> Initial reports after Larimore was found indicated that he was disoriented. The  reports, which quoted Bell Gardens police officials, said Larimore told  authorities he did not remember driving to Victorville and said he thought he  had called in sick.  </P> <P> Lenihan said "there's a lot of speculation" about what happened with Larimore.  </P> <P> And though Lenihan described Larimore as coherent when found, he said the  officer "did not remember what occurred this morning."  </P> <P> Representatives of the Bell Gardens department picked Larimore up at about 9  p.m. to return him to Bell Gardens, Lenihan said.  </P> <P> Larimore, who lives in Long Beach, was expected to undergo psychiatric  evaluation once he is returned home, Lenihan said.  </P> <P> Officials released no other details about the incident.  </P> <P> The search for Larimore began after he missed a 7 a.m. roll call, an action  that surprised his colleagues. When they were unable to reach the 11-year  veteran on his radio by 8 a.m., they reported him missing to other local law  enforcement agencies. Long Beach police were asked to check his residence.  </P> <P> His white car, bearing a Bell Gardens police insignia, was found abandoned  shortly before noon in a vacant lot in the desert town of Victorville, more  than 100 miles away. The doors were locked. Inside were his keys, uniform  shirt, police identification, driver's license and gun, Victorville police  reported.  </P> <P> One caller, who had heard radio broadcasts about the missing officer, told  Victorville police he had seen a man wearing uniform-style pants and a white  T-shirt walking away from the car and toward the dry bed of the Mojave River.  </P> <P> Larimore's disappearance stunned his fellow officers and his wife, said Bell  Gardens Police Chief William Donohoe.  </P> <P> "He didn't say anything to anybody when he came in this morning," Donohoe said.  </P> <P> Donohoe said none of his 50 colleagues or other friends who were interviewed  Friday recalled any erratic behavior, problems or depression that might explain  the disappearance.  </P> <P> "It's as much of a mystery to them as it is to us. . . . We are hopeful it is  something that can be explained," Donohoe said.  </P> <P> In Victorville, local police officers went door to door Friday afternoon  questioning business owners and residents, Community Service Officer Denise  Garland said.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Andrea Ford and Nieson Himmel contributed to this story.  </P></p>

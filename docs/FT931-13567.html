			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Tyson warns on family poverty THERE were signs of an erosion of US competitiveness that had 'potentially devastating' consequences for ordinary American families, Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Bill Clinton's choice for the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, told a Senate confirmation hearing yesterday. Per capita GDP had grown more slowly in the US in recent years than in any other advanced economy. The US had also suffered 'a decade of worsening inequality. 'Since 1980, the proportion of full-time workers with annual incomes below the poverty rate for a family of four had increased from 12 per cent to nearly 20 per cent.' Ms Tyson's emphasis on weaknesses in US economic performance contrasted sharply with up-beat remarks last week by her predecessor, Mr Michael Boskin, chief economist in the Bush administration. In his final report, he sought to demolish claims that the US was declining economically, relative to other industrial nations. Ms Tyson said she expected the CEA to be 'an integral part of President Clinton's economic team'. She responded vigorously to criticism of her nomination from some prominent US economists.</p>

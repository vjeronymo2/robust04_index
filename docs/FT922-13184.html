			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Moscow aims for foreign investment FOREIGN investment will be encouraged under a programme spelling out the conditions for privatising most of Russia's vast state property holdings. The programme also gives extensive privileges to workers in the enterprises being privatised, but tries to end the process of 'spontaneous' privatisation, under which enterprises are transferred to their workforces without government permission. The plan, thrashed out over the first months of this year, is now ready for adoption by the government and signing by President Boris Yeltsin. But the efforts of the Russian Congress to derail economic reform are delaying progress. The aim of the programme is to cut through the various laws governing privatisation and enterprises by setting out practical steps to be taken by authorities at all levels. There will be no restraints on foreigners buying privatised property in most industrial sectors - including electronics, engineering, construction, textiles and others. In the most lucrative fields - oil and gas enterprises, gold and diamond production and the high-technology defence sector which accounts for much of the civilian electronics output as well - a licence will be required from the Committee for Foreign Investments. Foreigners can also take part in auctions to buy shops and small businesses employing fewer than 200 people and with assets of under Rbs1m, but only with the permission of the local authorities. Open auctions of small businesses are now going on in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia's third biggest city, though no foreigners are participating so far. The programme says transactions must be made in roubles; it does not say at what rate, but that the roubles used shall be 'taken from special accounts'. The Russian government and central bank are discussing setting a special rate much higher than the official Rbs100 to the dollar to stop foreigners buying assets at rock bottom prices. Ministers and officials working on the privatisation proposals are aware of public hostility both to privatisation as a whole and to selling assets to foreigners. However, they want as few restrictions as possible in order to draw in foreign capital desperately needed to renew infrastructure and upgrade production machinery. Goldman Sachs, the US merchant bank, has been hired to help the government identify projects and sectors most promising for foreign investment. Officials have stressed that they want to simplify and speed up investment procedures as far as possible. This will partly involve re-establishing the authority of the central government in order to cut through the layers of local and regional bureaucracy. The programme lays out two options for sweetening the pain of job losses involved in privatisation: workers could either receive 25 per cent of non-voting shares in the enterprise while buying 10 per cent of the voting shares at a hefty discount, or they could be given the right to buy up to 51 per cent of the share capital of the enterprise. The workers could then sell on these shares without restrictions.</p>

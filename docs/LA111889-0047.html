			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LA MIRADA SHUNS 'TUNE-UP' ROLE, STUNS ESTANCIA  </P> <P> La Mirada High School knocked previously unbeaten Estancia High School out of  the Southern Section Division VI playoffs Friday night with a stunning 15-12  upset at Davidson Field.  </P> <P> With 9:22 left to play, La Mirada, trailing, 10-7, marched 78 yards in 14 plays  to win when quarterback Chad Drown scrambled away from blitzing defenders and  found Dan Arreguin open for a 23-yard touchdown pass.  </P> <P> "During the drive, we just kept saying to ourselves how all week long they were  calling us 'tune-ups'," Drown said. "We didn't want to lose it like last year."  </P> <P> La Mirada (8-4) botched the snap on the conversion but Drown, who doubles as  the team's kicker, picked up the loose ball and passed to Jim Pace in the  corner of the end zone for the successful two-point conversion.  </P> <P> Drown completed 14 of 25 for 167 yards and no interceptions, and hooked up with  Eric DeLaCruz five times for 78 yards.  </P> <P> "We needed to pass to be successful tonight," La Mirada Coach John Mele said,  "and Chad Drown had a hell of a game."  </P> <P> The Matador defense also did a job on the Eagles (10-1), forcing five Estancia  turnovers -- three interceptions and two fumble recoveries -- and held Josh  Wojtkiewicz to just 60 yards rushing.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INITIAL HYSTERIA PROVOKED POSITIVE CHANGES IN DAY CARE  </P> <P> The year was 1984 and news reports from New York to California and from  Minnesota to Florida carried accounts of children being molested in day-care  centers, schools and youth programs.  </P> <P> Suddenly, it seemed, virtually everyone in day-care centers -- which serve as  surrogate parents to 16 million of the nation's children -- became a suspected  child molester. And in such a hysterical climate, the routine act of providing  affection through touch became taboo.  </P> <P> Rocking chairs were removed from some centers, so children would not sit on the  laps of adults. Other centers installed video cameras in classrooms to monitor  all activities. Children's diapers were changed in the standing-up position,  and nursery school directors stopped taking photographs of even clothed  children at play for fear they would be accused of pornography.  </P> <P> Some fearful teachers quit hugging kids, instead saying, "Give yourself a pat  on the back." Male day-care employees especially felt untrusted and in many  cases were automatically viewed with suspicion. Many were rejected for jobs.  </P> <P> Liability insurance premiums soared -- forcing many small operators out of  business and causing others to go underground, remaining open but unlicensed  and uninsured. Large day-care operations moved toward self-insurance;  church-run centers found protection under the umbrella of their church's  insurance policies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Ways to Protect Safety  </P> <P> And anxious parents started inspecting their children's genitals at bath time,  warning them not to let anyone touch their "private parts."  </P> <P> But from this tempest came some positive changes in a long-unscrutinized  industry, in which as much as 90% of family-care operators were unlicensed and  unregulated. Under fire from every direction, day-care centers scrambled for  new ways to protect children's safety and to ensure that their facilities were  not vulnerable to similar allegations.  </P> <P> The McMartin case in particular led to new laws and policies that altered the  course of child care in America.  </P> <P> News accounts of nursery schools as hotbeds of molestation turned out to be  misleading. A national study of sexual abuse in day care by the University of  New Hampshire's family research laboratory later showed that children are  nearly twice as likely to be molested in their own household as in a day-care  center. And many of the highly publicized molestation cases fell apart.  </P> <P> Slowly the pendulum began to swing back -- but not to the careless, unguarded  innocence of the past.  </P> <P> The mid-1980s had been a desperate time. "It got to the point where staff were  literally afraid to pick up a crying child," said Barbara Willer, spokeswoman  for the National Assn. for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) in  Washington, "because it might be misconstrued as a sexual overture."  </P> <P> Said one male day-care worker in Los Angeles: "On one hand, I never let myself  be in a room alone with a child; yet on the other, I know they need affection,  particularly those who have no male role models at home. They like to be  touched, stroked, picked up and spun around, and to feel the strength of an  adult. But I am careful."  </P> <P> "Children and grown-ups all need hugs and physical affection in order to feel  cared about," said Santa Monica therapist Ruth Bettelheim, citing several  classic animal studies showing that monkeys denied physical contact as infants  were unable to socialize or have sexual relations as adults.  </P> <P> A drop in affection only makes children hunger for it and thus even more  susceptible to molestation, Los Angeles child psychiatrist Michael Durfee said.  </P> <P> Still, screening procedures became more stringent. Marsheen Pleak, director of  the Palisades-Malibu YMCA after-school program in Los Angeles, acknowledged,  "After McMartin, we started looking a lot deeper into people's backgrounds for  things like large gaps in employment, doing fingerprint and criminal checks,  and checking references."  </P> <P> She said she looks for those who have taken courses in child development, asks  how applicants would handle certain hypothetical situations and requires the  staff to take part in extra training sessions. Parents are also encouraged to  become involved.  </P> <P> The YMCA-USA -- probably the largest provider of child care in the nation --  combines background checks and interviews, training and observation, and  sometimes even looks for behavior patterns that police say are frequently found  in pedophiles -- such as socializing only with children and not those in their  own age group.  </P> <P> "We are not psychology experts," said Melinda Sprague, senior vice president of  the YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles, which serves 6,000 children, "so we try  to set up safeguards such as a policy that no staff person is to be alone with  a child at any time."  </P> <P> Many nursery schools have adopted policies that protect both teacher and child,  such as requiring the presence of a third person when a child's injuries  require inspection of the genital area and assigning parent helpers to escort  toddlers to the bathroom two at a time.  </P> <P> Most importantly, good schools permit parents to observe their children at any  time, unannounced, through one-way mirrors or windows. Parents are also  encouraged -- and given tuition credits -- to donate one morning a month to  assisting, ensuring that parent helpers are available each day.  </P> <P> "It's important for a teacher to be able to give a hug and hold a child in her  lap," said Marjorie Buell, who directs the Methodist Pre-School in Pacific  Palisades. "I'd hate for us to become paranoid and I emphasize that parents can  come and watch any time."  </P> <P> NAEYC's Willer says heightened awareness has led to probationary periods for  new employees during which they are not left alone with children without  supervision, training has improved, and several bills before Congress and  pending in several states would require that parents have access to child-care  facilities whenever their children are present.  </P> <P> "The actual numbers (of molestation cases) are small," Willer said. "And it's  important that the hysteria did die down. But we need to be aware where the  potential for sexual abuse exists and look for ways to reduce it." In Portland,  Me., the Koala Child Kare center installed video monitors in classrooms, so the  employees feel free to give children hugs and put their arms around them while  reading stories, without such gestures being misinterpreted.  </P> <P> In Louisville, Ky., where the county provides day care for nearly 2,000  children, two adults are required to be in the classroom even when only two or  three children are present, according to Ellen Skaikun, coordinator of  child-care training and services. "We want to provide safeguards and we don't  want to leave ourselves open to being accused," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Experience Requirement  </P> <P> She said Jefferson County is trying to professionalize their services by  offering salaries above the minimum wage and fringe benefits, in addition to  requiring training and experience. Many male aides work in the kindergarten  program, she said.  </P> <P> "We had thought about these things before the mid-'80s, when the child  molestation cases broke. But we don't want our people to have to hold back on  expressing nice feelings for kids. Most of us know what's right and wrong. If  somebody's going to tell me I can't touch a child I'll look for another job."  </P> <P> Kinder-Care Learning Centers, headquartered in Montgomery, Ala., and licensed  to care for 160,000 youngsters, has had an open-door policy and conducted  reference checks on prospective employees since its inception, said vice  president Ann Muscari, but still found room for improvement.  </P> <P> "We were outraged and made even more aware and alert by what was happening" in  some day-care centers, she said, adding that the corporation developed a video  called "Listen to Dolly" to make parents and children and staff aware of the  possibilities both of abuse and molestation. "But," she added, "we never  stopped hugging children."  </P> <P> "A lot of the hysteria, especially involving males, has died down," said child  psychiatrist Michael Durfee, who coordinates the Los Angeles County Health  Department's program for abused children. But a lot of suspicion still exists.  </P> <P> "Still, one out of two people will say 'no' if you ask whether they think it's  OK for a man to change a child's diapers," he said. Until recently, males were  not assigned to work in the nursery of the county's sole public facility for  abused and neglected children, Durfee said, because the director was concerned  that they would be "tempted."  </P> <P> The day-care industry's forced self-examination and policing has benefited  society in the long run, Durfee said.  </P></p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Gooda Names may face delay Names on the lossmaking Gooda Walker syndicates at Lloyd's could face long delays in their legal action due to start in April following an application for an adjournment by defendants in the case. More than 3,000 Gooda Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally backed the Lloyd's insurance market - are taking action against more than 70 agents in an attempt to recover losses of more than Pounds 550m. The adjournment application, lodged with the courts on Friday by Elborne Mitchell, the agents' solicitors, comes at a crucial time for the Gooda Walker Names Action Group, which last month voted by a 5-1 majority to pursue legal action rather than accept its share of a Pounds 900m out-of-court settlement offer. It is understood that the application was made after a potentially vital witness was advised by his solicitors not to give evidence in the civil action, while there is a pending investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into the agency's affairs. News of the SFO probe, which focuses on the use by Gooda Walker of so-called 'time and distance' reinsurance policies, emerged last year. Mr Philip Rocher of Wilde Sapte, the solicitors working with the action group, said Names would 'strenuously resist' the adjournment application, which is to be heard on Friday or early next week. An adjournment would be a blow to Gooda Names because their legal action - one of the biggest being fought by Names - was one of the first Names' actions scheduled to come to court. Gooda Names are therefore hoping to have greater access to the limited pool of errors-and-omissions insurance cover - which protects agents against negligence awards - than some other lossmakers. Insurance market leaders have said that 70 per cent of Names - by value of the offer - must accept if it is to go ahead. But it appears that Lloyd's will be unable to persuade enough Names to accept the deal before a deadline of February 14. The implementation later this year in the UK of the European Union's third non-life directive will tighten the solvency regulations faced by UK insurers and could add to pressures faced by some smaller reinsurers in the London market, according to Price Waterhouse, the accountants. Under the new regulations insurers and reinsurers will no longer be able to count premiums and reinsurance recoveries which are more than three months overdue as assets for solvency purposes.</p>

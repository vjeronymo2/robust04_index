Frunze in 1953 and the Military Academy of the  General Staff in 1959. He was Commander-in-Chief of the Group of  Soviet Forces in Germany in 1969-1971, Chief of the General  Staff in 1971-1977, and was Commander-in-Chief of the Warsaw  Treaty Member-States Allied Military Forces from 1977 through  1989. At the present time, he is an advisor under the USSR  Ministry of Defense. Viktor Georgiyevich is a Hero of the Soviet  Union and has been decorated with many orders of the USSR and of  foreign states.    Makhmut Akhmetovich Gareyev is a participant of the  Great Patriotic War, he completed the Military Academy imeni  M.V. Frunze in 1950 and the Military Academy of the General  Staff in 1959. He was Urals Military District Chief of Staff  from 1971-1973. He was Chief of the Military-Scientific  Directorate -- Deputy Chief of the General Staff Main  Directorate in 1974-1984, Deputy Chief of the General Staff in  1984-1988, and Chief Military Advisor to the Republic of  Afghanistan in 1989-1990.    He is a doctor of military sciences, professor, member  of the Academy of Natural Sciences, author of 60 scientific  works, including the books "M.V. Frunze -- voyennyy teoretik"  [M.V. Frunze -- Military Theoretician], and "obshchevoyskovyye  ucheniya" [Combined-Arms Exercises]. M.A. Gareyev has been  decorated with orders of the USSR.    There were definite achievements and serious shortcomings in  the military-technical policy of the Soviet state. In our  country, concern about arms development and the technical  equipment of the army and navy was considered to the most  important state task and all national economic activity was  subordinated to the interests of carrying out that task.  However, for some time expenditures for military needs exceeded  all reasonable limits, as a result of which not only the economy  but also the technological base of defense itself turned out to  be undermined. The absence of a systems approach to the  resolution of defense problems was one of the primary causes of  this: political, economic and military-technical issues were  resolved in isolation from each other in a number of cases. The  absence of an integrated military-technical policy concept that  takes into account all of these factors resulted in the fact  that many arms development issues were resolved without the  proper foresight and were extremely extravagant in an economic  sense. And the fact that a military-technical policy concept is  being developed for the first time in the Russian Federation is  a definite guarantee that the task of the technical equipment of  the army and the navy in subsequent years will be carried out in  a more intelligent, purposeful, and rational manner. However,  the problems that must lie at the foundation of  military-technical policy so far remain unclear. Let's cite two  examples.    The 7th Russian Federation Congress of People's Deputies  Decree tasked the Armed Forces with the following main missions:    deterrence from unleashing any wars that are directed  against  Russia through the presence of strategic nuclear forces; and,    efficient neutralization of military conflicts using highly  mobile general purpose forces.    The decree does not provide for the readiness of the Armed  Forces to repel large-scale aggression. But under that approach,  the armed forces must be capable of inflicting a retaliatory  strike with unacceptable losses for the enemy for deterrence  "from unleashing any wars". This will be impossible with the  planned strategic nuclear forces reductions and the weakening of  our antimissile warning system and especially in the event of  the development of an antiballistic missile (ABM) defense system  on the territory of the United States. Therefore, we will have  to, as some people suggest, shift to the concept adopted in the  United States and in NATO as a whole which envisions that a  nuclear first strike will be inflicted in response to any  aggression (including with the employment of conventional  weapons). Then we need to review our military doctrine and  military-technical policy which is inadvisable for political and  other considerations. It is advisable to also take into account  the readiness to repel large-scale aggression in order to  prevent having to resort to such extreme measures and at the  same time to guarantee the country's military security. Even  though the direct threat of large-scale aggression does not  exist right now, it is impossible to completely exclude it.    Another example. The draft military reform program is  unambiguously oriented toward the preservation of the  five-service system of the Armed Forces and the shift to three  Armed Forces services is envisioned only at the second-third  stages of military reform. But each Armed Forces service will  develop command and control systems and equipment for all of  these years, while proceeding from the existing organization.  Already right now the Air Force, PVO [Air Defense], and the  Ground Forces automated command and control systems do not  connect to each other. What will occur in the future? The more  time that passes, the more difficult it will be to emerge from  these dead end situations. Therefore, already right now we need  to lay the foundation for and develop a command and control  system for the future Armed Forces organizational structure and  we don't need to accomplish that task by Armed Forces service,  but centralize it in the hands of the General Staff and the  first deputy minister of defense staff.    These and other examples attest to the fact that not  everything is being coordinated with military-political and  strategic considerations in the military-technical policy that  is being developed. Therefore, we need to precisely define some  military-political tenets on some issues (for example, from the  point of view of Armed Forces readiness to repel large-scale  aggression) and on others -- bring military-technical policy  into compliance with these precepts. Special scientific-research  work is needed to comprehensively research what kind of real  threats to Russia can emerge, what missions its Armed Forces  must be prepared to accomplish, and what the nature of armed  combat could be. Only while taking this into account will we be  able to judge what kind of Armed Forces are needed and what  their technical equipment should be.    It is impossible to judge the criteria of the sufficiency of  defense and the substantiation of the military-technical policy  in the abstract. We can specifically resolve these issues only  once we have determined what strategic missions the Armed Forces  will have to accomplish.    While proceeding from the future missions and actual  economic  capabilities of the state, it is advisable to concentrate the  primary efforts in military-technical policy on the resolution  of two interrelated tasks. First of all, in the near future we  must make our main emphasis on the creation of a cadre nucleus  of well-equipped, flexibly-commanded and controlled, and  professionally trained Armed Forces that have been reduced in  effective combat strength and, in military-technical policy --  on increasing the effectiveness of scientific-research and  design work that is targeted at the development of highly  effective types of weapons and military equipment.    Second, in the future we need to be prepared to mobilize and  deploy larger Armed Forces, to create the required reserves of  weapons and to transition the defense industry to a wartime  footing for the technical equipment of the army and navy with  the calculation of ensuring readiness to repel large-scale  aggression.    While considering the incomparability of our national income  with the world's leading states, in military-technical policy it  is important not to embark on a course of weapons and equipment  development that is dictated by other states and not to attempt  to develop everything that they have as it frequently occurred  in the past. It is desirable to determine our own, more  advantageous for us, path based upon a scientific prediction of  arms development. The primary task in this sphere is to  determine the direction of development and the primary  specifications of new generation weapons which will occupy a  dominant position in the future. While taking this into account,  as a minimum we need to terminate the development and design of  those types of weapons, command and control and support systems  that do not meet contemporary effectiveness requirements. We  also need to gradually retune the production of the defense  sectors of industry in that direction and, naturally, there must  be a thorough accounting of military-economic considerations to  achieve a decisive concentration of our technical and production  efforts to priority future weapons.    In our country, there previously was an obvious  overestimation of the effectiveness of our defense industry,  especially from the point of view of the economic indicators of  new types of weapons and equipment and unjustifiably large  expenditures for the maintenance of numerous KB's [Design  Bureaus], NII's [Scientific Research Institutes] and test  ranges. And the lag behind the NATO countries that exists right  now in intelligence, communications, navigation and weapons  guidance systems and in computer and electronic equipment in  general is still not being properly assessed. There has long  been a need for a comprehensive study of the state of affairs in  the defense sectors of industry by a special qualified  commission with the subsequent adoption of the appropriate  measures not only with the goal of conversion but also for  increasing the effectiveness of the operations of enterprises  for the country's defense. Defense enterprises could earn more  resources for the resolution of future defense tasks, without  resorting to additional state appropriations, with the rational  implementation of conversion, the reduction of the gross output  of weapons being produced, and an increase of the production of  scarce civilian goods.    We first of all need to eliminate the lag in circuitry and  other modern technologies in order to overcome our lagging  behind in the sphere of electronics, computer equipment,  detection and command and control systems, and precision-guided  weapons. To do that, major government decisions are needed on  the concentration of financial resources and scientific forces.    At the present time, the scientific-research institutions  that operate in the defense sphere are dispersed and not  powerful. Major research centers are needed with the  concentration in them of the most talented scientists and the  provision of the maximum material incentives for their  activities. We also need new organs in the system of government  and the military industrial complex (MIC) which would head this  work. In a word, half measures or the ordinary improvement of  existing structures are inadequate in this sphere. Such  fundamental steps and such a concentration of financial,  material, administrative and scientific efforts are needed that  would ensure a quantum leap in the sphere of mastery of the most  important technologies for the development of future types of  weapons and military equipment in the next 5-10 years.    We would like to once again direct attention to certain  aspects of military-technical policy. First of all this is the  improvement of military-technical information, coordination of  the process of its extraction, and dissemination of innovations  in the sphere of promising technologies and weapons both within  the country and abroad to scientific and industrial  organizations. In the developed capitalist countries, many  private firms and corporations, along with the intelligence  services, conduct industrial espionage. In our country, we will  not be ready to do that very soon. Therefore, we need to step up  work to extract needed information in the sphere of leading  technology. It is impossible to collect information in an  abstract manner. Military-technical information is needed to  resolve certain tasks for the development of industrial  technology and arms. The most qualified special organs are  incapable of completely knowing and taking into account all of  the information requirements on various spheres of activity and  of ascertaining to which question they need to provide an  answer. All the more so that general information (which is  occurring right now) is not needed in scientific and practical  work but information is needed first of all on such problems,  the resolution of which comes up against the absence of new  knowledge and the search for ways to resolve them. The need for  such information, its deep essence and various nuances are  revealed only with the specific examination of some or other  issues in the course of their scientific research and practical  resolution. And they are best of all seen by those who are  directly involved with them.    While considering all of this, it is exceptionally important  that the interested organs of rule and NII's, while proceeding  from actual requirements and in accordance with their  competence, assign the tasks, define the requirements or  requests, and submit requests for the kinds of information they  specifically need.    Further, in contrast to the United States, the  underestimation of the modernization of existing types of  weapons, the production and supply of spare parts to the troops,  and the coordination of technical support and operation of  weapons and equipment was a weak spot in our military-technical  policy of past years. The number of failures, accidents and  catastrophes significantly increased, weapons and equipment  operating periods were shortened, and their combat effectiveness  was reduced as a result of the inadequate training of compulsory  service military personnel.    With the examination of the issue on the coordination of  Armed Forces technical support, it is desirable to ensure that  we overcome the main deficiency in this sphere -- the artificial  interruption of the development of weapons, weapons orders and  responsibility for weapons operation and maintenance in the  troops and in the fleets. This permitted the military industrial  complex to force everything that they produced on the army and  navy. We need the organs of rule that are involved with the  development of weapons to be responsible for the operation and  maintenance of weapons and equipment. Then they will more  responsibly and strictly approach their orders and purchases.    Right now a quite well substantiated policy is being  conducted toward the formation of a Russian Federation  independent military-technical policy. At the same time, we need  to take into the account the cooperation that has developed in  the production of the most important types of weapons within the  CIS. Therefore, it is advisable for the military-technical  policy concept to provide for, on the one hand, measures for the  maintenance of cooperation and the founding of joint ventures  with the CIS countries and, on the other hand, to conduct, in  the future and when possible, a policy toward the restoration on  Russian territory of the most needed enterprises without which  we cannot get by. The creation of new shops under plants which  need component items that were previously supplied from other  republics appears to be most advantageous.    While considering the enormous significance of  military-technical policy, the Russian Federation President --  the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and the  Government -- needs to define it in accordance with the state's  military policy and economic capabilities based on the Law on  Defense and the Law on National Security that were adopted by  the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet.    The primary military security issues must be resolved while  taking into account national security interests as a whole and  be examined in the Security Council within these limits. The  problems of defense are scattered and cannot always be  adequately resolved in a purposeful manner in the overall mass  of many issues (economic, information, ecological security, and  others). Therefore, besides the Security Council, it is  advisable to have a Defense Council under the Russian Federation  President that is made up of the highest officials who are  responsible for defense matters. We could have, under the  Defense Council, a team of consultants (experts) to render  skilled assistance from among the experienced military leaders  who lead designers and scientists.    We should also preserve state rule of the defense industry.  Obviously, it will be impossible to totally transfer to a market  economy in the defense industry in a short period of time. The  primary defense enterprises will remain state property for a  long time yet as it is being done in certain Western countries.  Therefore, a government organ is needed (of the military  industrial complex type with more limited functions than  previously) which would be involved with the coordination of the  activities of defense enterprises. The Russian Defense Industry  Committee that exists at the present time is incapable of  accomplishing this task in a full-fledged manner. The Ministry  of Defense, jointly with other state organs and representatives  of the defense industry, should actively participate in the  development of the military-technical policy and play a leading  role in the determination of the prospects for arms development,  their production programs, and the priorities for the technical  equipment of the army and navy.    Right now, in principle, the correct course has been taken  that the Ministry of Defense is becoming the customer of all  types of weapons and equipment. This will permit it to overcome  the former weak spot in the implementation of military-technical  policy when the military industrial complex in a number of cases  forced on the Armed Forces not those weapons and command and  control systems that were needed but those that were more  advantageous to produce. The monopolistic position of the  industrial enterprises and the absence of competition resulted  in price increases for military products and a technological lag  behind the leading Western countries.    Under conditions of the market economy, the transition to  the  new system, when all arms orders will be carried out through the  Ministry of Defense, requires a more powerful and ramified staff  which would develop the arms program, coordinate  military-technical research and development of new types of  weapons, track the work of various design bureaus and the  production capabilities of enterprises, distribute orders,  conclude contracts, participate in the testing and selection of  new models of weapons, implement financing of NIOKR [scientific  research and experimental design work] and military orders, and  resolve many other issues. For example, in the United States,  the staff that accomplishes these tasks numbers over 25,000  people and, along with lawyers and temporarily hired experts --  up to 50,000 people.    For decades we have proceeded from F. Engels' provision that  the development of weapons and equipment determines the  development of military art. In principle, this provision is  correct. However, now when weapons are increasing in cost, a  more active role of military science itself is required which  must more objectively determine the main directions of arms  development and substantiate specific operational-strategic and  tactical requirements and the description of the weapons of the  future. The impact of the operational-strategic aspect must  increase.    Therefore, at the present time, one of the most important  problems consists of organizing coordinated work on the  elaboration of the operational-strategic and military-technical  ideology of arms development while taking into account the  military-economic considerations. Only on this basis can we  implement real program planning of arms development which has  never occurred in our country and which, unfortunately, still  hasn't occurred.    As we know, in the United States the assignment of  program-target tasks is carried out at the strategic planning  level. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, jointly with the leaders of  the Armed Forces services and other Department of Defense  agencies and while relying on DARPA (a strategic planning  agency) research, accomplishes that task.    Under our conditions, it is desirable to consolidate the  leading role of the General Staff in operational-strategic  aspects and the role of the First Deputy Minister of Defense and  the chief of weapons on military-technical issues, which must be  continuously resolved while taking strategic considerations into  account.    With this goal, it appears to be advisable to:    have an Armed Forces High Scientific Council in the Ministry  of Defense under the leadership of the Minister of Defense which  would examine the most important operational-strategic and  military-technical problems;    unified planning of scientific work in the Armed Forces is  needed while taking into account strategic, military-technical  and economic aspects. The General Staff's military-scientific  directorate, jointly with the chief of weapons directorate and  other organs of rule, should accomplish this task.    In the sense of the implementation of scientific research,  the High Scientific Council must rely on the Armed Forces  Structural Development and Reform Directorate, on the General  Staff Strategic Research Center and the lead military-technical  scientific-research institute. Reorganization of the entire  network of scientific-research institutions is also needed. As a  result of the elimination of the former ministries of the  defense sectors of industry, we should study the feasibility of  uniting the more important NII's of industry with the Russian  Federation Ministry of Defense NIU [Scientific Research  Directorate].    According to the data of League of Defense Sectors of  Industry President A.N. Shulunov, at the present time there are  approximately 3,000 defense enterprises, scientific research and  design organizations in the Russian Federation. Right now all of  them to some degree or other are experiencing difficulties with  finances and are conducting a struggle for survival. This is  leading not only to the dispersal of resources. Gradually the  entire defense industry could collapse. Therefore, no matter how  painful it might be, we need to painstakingly weigh everything,  assess actual capabilities and make fundamental decisions: what  NII's, KB's and enterprises to retain and, consequently, to help  them more and to completely terminate the financing of which  enterprises, NII's and KB's. Then we can at least save the most  important.    Several words regarding the formation of the military  budget.  In the Soviet Union, it was customary that Gosplan, the Ministry  of Finances, the Ministry of Defense and other sectors  associated with defense production would compile the requests  (proposals) on the formation of the defense budget. Then, after  a complex system of processes and a struggle among themselves  for the priorities of the various Armed Forces services, the  proposals that were coordinated with the appropriate departments  of the CPSU Central Committee and military industrial complex  were submitted to the Politburo (Defense Council) where the  decision was ultimately made on the amount and allocation of the  defense budget. But many expenditures for defense needs (for  example, on nuclear power engineering and others) went to  different ministries and were not included in the defense  budget. Therefore, it would be difficult to judge just how much  is actually being spent on defense. Only four men practically  knew the true picture of the military budget: the General  Secretary, the Council of Ministers Chairman, the Minister of  Defense, and the Chief of the General Staff.    This has impeded a correct assessment of the cost of defense  and has resulted in each department attempting to grab as much  as possible for itself. The military industrial complex managed  to gradually place its own people on the staff of the Central  Committee, the Council of Ministers, Gosplan and other organs  and they defended the interests of their "native" sectors of  industry in isolation from the interests of the matter as a  whole, sometimes without taking into account the General Staff's  proposals.    The procedures for the formation of the military budget that  were recently established mainly ensure that the former narrow  spots are being negotiated and, in principle, appear to be  acceptable. But three weak spots still remain.    First of all, an integrated and substantiated assessment of  defense expenditures that encompasses all needs and requests has  not been totally attained; quite a few incidental, unanticipated  expenditures are emerging; the criteria for accounting for the  rate of inflation and indexing planned expenditures have not  been elaborated which disorganizes the entire budget system and  impedes the conclusion of contracts with defense enterprises.    Second, the policy that is being conducted, that is oriented  first of all on sending resources for the maintenance of the  army and navy and only that which remains is utilized to  purchase arms, is implementable in practice only until certain  limits are reached, and exceeding those limits will result in  the destruction of the defense industry's viability. We need to  take into account not only the current but also the future needs  of the army and industry.    Third, and the most dangerous -- is the reduction of  expenditures for NIOKR. Despite the recognition of NIOKR  priorities in words, as before we are not attaining the  concentration of scientific forces and finances for priority  tasks associated with the development of future weapons.    In the United States in the 1970's, the advanced research  agency's (DARPA) budget was doubled every four years and, in the  1980's, every two years. The widespread involvement of the most  talented civilian scientists on contract only for the time of  the accomplishment of specific research tasks permitted them to  increase the volume of research work without expanding  appropriations.    In the United States, a new weapon is developed only when an  existing weapon is not subject to modernization. This provides a  great savings. For example, the installation of cruise missiles  on an obsolete B-52 aircraft transformed it into a new strategic  weapon with minimal expenditures. It is also desirable to  separate a weapons and equipment modernization program in our  country, having tied it to the tasks of repairing and supplying  spare parts and in general with the problem of extending the  operating periods of weapons and equipment.    In our view, these are some considerations and steps that  should facilitate the improvement of work on the formation of  the military-technical policy.</p>

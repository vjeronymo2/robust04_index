Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part 1953 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribes procedures under section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (hereinafter called the Act) by which the Regional Administrator for Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter called Regional Administrator) under a delegation of authority from the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health (29 CFR 1953.4) will review and approve standards promulgated pursuant to a State plan which has been approved in accordance with section 18(c) of the Act and 29 CFR part 1902. On December 28, 1972, notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (37 FR 28628) of the approval of the Oregon plan and the adoption of subpart D to part 1952 containing the decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Oregon plan provides for adoption of State standards which are at least as effective as comparable Federal standards promulgated under section 6 of the Act. Section 1953.20 provides that where any alteration in the Federal program could have an adverse impact on the at least as effective as status of the State program, a program change supplement to a State plan shall be required. The Oregon plan also provides for the adoption of Federal standards as State standards by reference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to Federal standards amendments, the State has submitted by letters dated April 16, and October 16, 1992, from John A. Pompei, Administrator, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, and incorporated as part of the plan, State standard amendments comparable to 29 CFR 1910.1048, Formaldehyde, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 2681) on January 23, 1992, (57 19262) on May 5, 1992, (57 FR 22290) on May 27, 1992, (57 FR 24701) on June 10, 1992, and (57 FR 27160) on June 18, 1992. The State's rules pertaining to Formaldehyde, contained in OAR 437&hyph;02&hyph;360(28), were adopted by reference on April 16, 1992, and October 13, 1992, pursuant to ORS 654.025(2), ORS 656.726(3), and ORS 183.335, as ordered and transmitted under OR&hyph;OSHA Administrative Orders 4&hyph;1992 and 12&hyph;1992. On March 24, 1991, and July 16, 1991, the State mailed the Notice of Proposed Amendment of Rules to those on the Department of Insurance and Finance Mailing list, established pursuant to OAR 431&hyph;01&hyph;000 and to those on the Department's distribution list as their interest appeared. No written requests for a public hearing were received. The State's rules pertaining to Formaldehyde, contained in OAR 437&hyph;02&hyph;360(28), were originally adopted by reference and approved in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 13, 1989 (54 FR 1461), with other amendments approved on April 26, 1991 (56 FR 19382). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated January 6, 1993, from John A. Pompei, Administrator, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, and incorporated as part of the plan, the State on its own initiative submitted a repeal of OAR 437&hyph;02&hyph;370, and adopted by reference &sect;1910.1025(e)(1), table 1, Lead Implementation Schedule. The State standard was adopted and became effective on December 7, 1992, pursuant to ORS 654.025(2), ORS 656.726(3), and ORS 183.335, as ordered and transmitted under OR&hyph;OSHA Administrative Order 14&hyph;1992. The State's Lead standard was originally approved in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (54 FR 38300) on September 15, 1989. The change became necessary when on July 19, 1991, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia lifted the judicial stays of the Lead standard for all industries, except brass and bronze ingot production. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On its own initiative, the State has submitted by letter dated October 19, 1993, from John A. Pompei, Administrator, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, and incorporated as part of the plan, a revision to State rules comparable to 29 CFR 1910.134, Respiratory Protection, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (39 FR 23671) on June 27, 1974. The State's original adoption of Respiratory Protection was promulgated as OAR 437, Chapter 22&hyph;69, and received  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  approval at 40 FR 50583 on October 30, 1975. The State's standard was subsequently recodified as OAR 437, Division 129, with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  approval at 52 FR 27026 on July 17, 1987. The State has repealed OAR 437, Division 129, in its entirety, and has incorporated 29 CFR 1910.134, Respiratory Protection, by reference as OAR 437&hyph;02&hyph;1910.134. The State's readoption by reference also deleted General and Special Industry Safety and Health Standards, Revocation, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (43 FR 49748) on October 24, 1978, and Revocation of Advisory and Repetitive Standards as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (49 FR 5322) on February 10, 1984. The State has also adopted one State-initiated rule at OAR 437&hyph;02&hyph;133 on air quality in respirators in lieu of 29 CFR 1910.134(d)(1), which updates the Compressed Gas Association Commodity Specification from G&hyph;7.1&hyph;1966 (as in the Federal rule) to G&hyph;7.1&hyph;1989. During the early period of Oregon's program, the State elected not to adopt by reference standards comparable to 29 CFR 1910.137, Electrical Protective Devices, 1910.138, Effective Dates, &sect;1910.139, Sources of Standards, and 1910.140, Standards Organizations. (These standards are at the end of 29 CFR 1910 subpart I, Personal Protective Equipment.) With this notice the State has chosen to do so, at OAR 437&hyph;02, Subdivision I. On March 22, 1993, the Notice of Proposed Revision of Rules was mailed to those on the Department of Insurance and Finance mailing list established pursuant to OAR 436&hyph;90&hyph;505 and to those on the Department's distribution mailing list as their interest appeared. Both actions failed to elicit a request for hearing; however, two written comments were received which recommended that the State retain its more specific language in some areas of the standard. The State's revision was adopted on July 29, 1993, with an effective date of September 15, 1993, through OR&hyph;OSHA Administrative Order 9&hyph;1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

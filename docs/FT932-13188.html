			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Letter: Outrageous, but at the same time entertaining (2) Sir, How sad that a Financial Times reader (J G Freeland, Letters, April 17-18) should so lack either a sense of humour or a sense of proportion that a couple of witty items by Michael Thompson-Noel should make him 'see red'. I, on the other hand, found the two pieces that offended him so entertaining that I extracted them from the paper for the benefit of any friends or relatives who may have been away or missed them for some reason on publication. Michael Thompson-Noel is consistently one of the most rewarding of columnists. Mr Freeland may well be right about '. . . a mediocre England' and the barbarians being at the gates. But the reason for this can be found in the greed and hypocrisy of the appalling 1980s and can hardly be laid at the door of unfortunate reporters of our decline, much though he may castigate members of a profession he finds distasteful.

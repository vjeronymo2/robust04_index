			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / US forces commander nominated PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has picked General John Shalikashvili, Nato's supreme commander in Europe, to succeed General Colin Powell as chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, George Graham reports. Gen Shalikashvili's appointment is subject to confirmation by the Senate, but is expected to take effect when Gen Powell completes his second two-year term next month. The chairman is the top US military officer, and Gen Shalikashvili's role will be particularly important because of Mr Clinton's less than smooth relationship with the armed forces. Gen Powell opposed sharper cuts in the defence budget and resisted Mr Clinton's efforts to let homosexuals serve openly. Gen Shalikashvili, a 57-year-old artillery officer, was born in Poland and came to the US at the age of 16. He served as commander of the allied operation to protect the Kurds in northern Iraq, and as assistant to Gen Powell. Mr Clinton said yesterday Gen Shalikashvili had been a leader in persuading Nato to undertake new missions outside its traditional boundaries, including the recent decision to prepare for possible air strikes in Bosnia.</p>

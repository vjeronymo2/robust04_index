The world's industrial nations are finding it hard  to get people back to work.    Employment, described by the International Labor  Organization  (ILO) in a recent report as in a "global crisis" far more  serious than the economic problem in the 1980s, has become a  persistent headache in the West.    "Unemployment, not inflation is the main threat." This is  the message of the 23 union representatives which gathered at  the AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial  Organizations] headquarters last week, urging for a "global new  deal" to help the jobless.    Any diagnosis to share? That's what the Clinton  administration is talking about in preparing the much-taunted  jobs summit of the group of seven nations, to be held a week  from today in Detroit, Michigan.    "These countries are different. We are aiming not so much  for a communique or an agreed-upon set of actions," said Labor  Secretary Robert Reich last week. "We wish to share different  kind of solutions."    "What's important to the United States is to get the rest of  the industrialized world growing," said Alan Blinder, a member  of the White House Council of Economic Advisers today,  predicting the summit "a huge success."    The G-7 jobs summit, proposed by President Clinton in July  and originally scheduled for last autumn, gathers the labor,  finance, social service ministers from the U.S., Japan, Germany,  France, Britain, Italy and Canada, the latter five all posting  double digit jobless rates.    With America's jobless rate dipping from 7.7 percent a year  ago to 6.5 percent in February, the White House is busy claiming  credit for the two million jobs added to the nation's payroll in  the last 13 months.    U.S. officials, however, may find the American experience in  job creation, coming along in the wake of stable economic  recovery, good but irrelevant for the depressed labor market in  Western Europe.    "I would doubt that the Europeans are very enthusiastic  about  the jobs summit," said Peter Richards, a Geneva-based ILO  economist, in an interview. "They see the problem very much on  their own."    Practically half of the 35 million unemployed in Western  Europe have been off payrolls for a year or more, due to  technological changes, widening economic competition and normal  movement of economic cycle.    Observers noted that in Western Europe, only the United  Kingdom now appears a bit optimistic in the overall employment  picture, while unemployment is regarded as the most difficult to  solve in Germany and France.    In the U.S., 8.5 million people are registered as out of  work. 4.5 million work part-time and say they would like to have  full-time jobs. Another half million Americans are too  discouraged to look for work.    "When it comes to jobs, we want to create two million more  in  1994," President Clinton said over the weekend, pledging to  boost the country's exports, one billion U.S. dollars of which  will create 20,000 jobs.    This week, the administration is scheduled to introduce the  reemployment act of 1994, in order to bring the U.S. job  training programs into the 21st Century and replace the entire  existing unemployment system.    The proposed one-stop shopping centers, officials said, will  link job search with training. People can get job search help,  data on the next possible jobs as well as the trainings to get  the job in a single place.    The U.S. and Europe, observers said, face two completely  different problems in employment. Europe, with high jobless  rate, witnesses steady rise in the income of its workers, while  the U.S., despite its dropping jobless rate, suffers from  declining wages.    In Europe, it is the unions not the corporate mangers that  have the final say in keeping a worker or not, and there is  almost no or very little flexibility in the labor market there,  especially in Germany.    Americans are another case. Workers are increasingly worried  since their bosses do not make layoff announcement until the  last minute, making them ill prepared for the change or  disappearance of jobs.    "The responsibility of the G-7 must be to initiate a  profound  change in direction of international economic policy, to get rid  of the free market approach and become pragmatic," said John  Evans, general secretary of OECD's Trade Union Advisory  Committee.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Laos has offered to sell Thailand water from rivers  linked to the Mekong River, according to Deputy Transport and  Communications Minister Charat Phuachuai.    Mr Charat said the offer had been confirmed during his visit  to Vientiane about three weeks ago by Laotian PM's [Prime  Minister's] Office Minister Phao Bounnaphon and the deputy  labour and foreign ministers.    Concrete pipes could be built to carry the water from rivers  across the Mekong River to northern and northeastern river  networks in Thailand, he said.    Each pipe will cost about 1,000 million baht and could be  completed within two years at a length of over 1,000 metres.    The 1,000-million-baht cost excludes funding for technology  to raise the water so it flows into Thailand to solve the  drought problem, he said.    Mr Charat said the project would be easier than taking water  direct from the Mekong River as this would require permission  from Cambodia and Vietnam.    The deputy minister cited possible routes for the waterways:    -- From the Tha River to the Ing River in Chiang Khong  District, Chiang Rai Province which links with the Nan River in  Uttaradit Province;    -- From the Ngum and Paksan rivers to the branches of the  Chi River in either Loei or Nong Khai provinces;    -- From the Ngum River to the source of the Phasak River  in Phetchabun Province (according to Mr Charat, the Phasak River  could feed the water network for the Central Plains)    -- From the Thoen River to a branch of the Mun River in  Nakhon Phanom Province, and    -- From the Se River to the Mun River in Ubon Ratchathani  Province.    If the proposal is supported by the Thai Government, Laos  has  agreed to sell the water to Thailand at a per cubic metre rate,  he said.    Mr Charat said the drought is a problem needing urgent  action  and Laos wants money to implement projects to develop the  country.</p>

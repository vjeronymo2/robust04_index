			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Premier Group earnings up 23% PREMIER GROUP, South Africa's second-largest foods group, has increased six-month earnings and stepped up its dividend. Net attributable earnings for the half-year rose 23 per cent to R89.5m (Dollars 30m) compared to the first half of 1991, and the dividend is going up by 13 per cent to 36 cents a share. Turnover increased by 21 per cent to R5.4bn from the restated figure of R4.5bn in 1991, but Mr Peter Wrighton, chairman, said the performances were not strictly comparable as the results of the Metro Cash and Carry acquisition in the previous period covered only four months'trading. Mr Wrighton described the results as 'most pleasing'. This is shown by tighter margins, with trading profit only 9 per cent higher at R213m, against R195m. The group benefited considerably, however, from lower debt and lower interest rates - total borrowings fell to R280m from R650m - reflected in net interest paid declining to R17.7m from R39.4m. Mr Wrighton said that while most divisions had performed satisfactorily, certain sectors had suffered from poor trading conditions and reduced consumer spending. In terms of trading profit, roughly 45 per cent of Premier's earnings come from food, 28 per cent from pharmaceutical operations, 12 per cent from wholesaling and 15 per cent from retailing. The market was anticipating good results, with the share having risen by more than 20 per cent during the past month. Premier is regarded as a good defensive stock, which benefits during a recession from its focus on basic foods and pharmaceuticals.</p>

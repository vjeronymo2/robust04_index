			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Letter: Little difference in approach Sir, I read with interest the letter from Mr Tetsuro Kikuchi (September 23) concerning the different approaches by Japanese companies to combating recession. I feel that he has missed one vital and perhaps most important difference between the current recessions, both in the UK and Japan. Here in the south-east region of the UK we have been in recession since late 1989 and the majority of companies have gone through the process of improving productivity, cutting costs, asking for increased government spending (which in the main has fallen on deaf ears) and we are now at the final stage of asking for the only option which is left open, that of the reduction in interest rates. To conclude therefore, there is probably very little difference between the approach of Japanese and UK companies; it is just that the Japanese are some three years behind in the process.

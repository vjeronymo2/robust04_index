			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Laird Following better than expected results from the likes of GKN and T&amp;N, the market was half expecting a strong showing from Laird. Even so, a 43 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits was clearly ahead of expectations. A 3 per cent rise in the shares against the background of a falling market underlines the point. With new plant still running below capacity, sales and margins should show further improvement in the second half. Capital expenditure is still running at around 1.5 times depreciation, maintaining a record of investment in recession which underpins yesterday's figures. The nagging concern is that success on the automotive side, which accounted for most of a Pounds 40m increase in turnover in the first half, leaves Laird looking unbalanced. Other interests, such as US plastics and packaging, are suffering. The rate of progress in future hinges on the outlook for the European car market. As a supplier to some of the newer high-volume models on the market, such as the redesigned Volkswagen Golf, Laird should be protected from the worst of any downturn. Yet new car sales in the important west German market are expected to fall this year and Laird will have to work hard to maintain momentum. A multiple of around 12 times this year's forecast earnings is hardly demanding, though, when viewed against prospective multiples of 17 or more elsewhere in the sector.</p>

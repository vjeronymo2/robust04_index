			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Kenya reassures UN over fate of refugees THE KENYAN government told UN officials yesterday it had no intention of evicting refugees, UN officials said, Reuter reports from Nairobi. They said they were given the assurance by Mr Kalonzo Musyoka, foreign minister, when they discussed a government statement calling on the UN to repatriate 500,000 refugees, mostly Somalis, because of attacks and scant resources. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said before the meeting that it was concerned about Tuesday's statement and would oppose any forcible repatriation. Relief agencies were alarmed by the statement because Somalia is still lawless and hungry despite the arrival of a 35,000-strong US-led force.</p>

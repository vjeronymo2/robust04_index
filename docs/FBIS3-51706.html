			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday in Carepa the acting Defense Minister,  General Ramon Emilio Gil Bermudez, officially instituted the  17th Brigade, whose jurisdiction will be Uraba, and turned over  command of the brigade to Brigadier General Hermofilio Rodriguez.    Three thousand soldiers supported by a counterinsurgency  brigade will try to put a stop to the bloody wave of violence in  the region.    What is to guarantee its future operational success in the  wake of the fissures in the peace accords among the political  forces and following the assassination of several dozen  activists of Hope, Peace and Liberty, and other leftist leaders?  What does the Armed Forces know aside from what the parties  involved in the dispute have said?    EL TIEMPO has exclusive information about a classified  intelligence report on the incipient alliance between insurgents  of the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Popular  Liberation Army (EPL) dissidents against those who have  demobilized.    Military officials believe they have reliable evidence that  FARC guerrillas have forged their first alliance with the  criminals of the "Bernardo Franco" Front, part of Francisco  Caraballo's group which is a violent dissident faction of the  EPL.    According to the Armed Forces' information, the insurgents  of  the 5th and 34th Fronts have begun to support members of the  "Bernardo Franco" Front with training, supplies, loans, and arms  sales.    Although they have not carried out any joint actions, it is  feared that the alliance could increase the number of victims of  the political control of the zone.    The classified report reveals, for example, that in one of  the largest guerrilla camps in Uraba, located in the El Porroso  area in Mutata municipality (Antioquia Department), there are  units of the "Bernardo Franco" Front and close to 250 guerrillas  of the two FARC fronts.    According to military officials, the first step toward an  "alliance" was the agreement reached in July 1992 between the  FARC's 5th Front and David Meza Pena, "Gonzalo."    Meza obtained the help of the FARC in a kind of guerrilla  "boarding school" for the EPL's nascent dissident group.    According to the report, there are 710 armed guerrillas in  Uraba.    The militias, for their part, have grown substantially in  the  last year. According to the report, close to 800 men belong to  the FARC's Bolivarian Milita, which operates in Apartado,  Chigorodo, Mutata, and Carepa Municipalities.    The two FARC Fronts and the incipient "Bernando Franco"  Front  are trying to divide into at least five or six fronts.    Those fronts have the mission of opening political space  and,  according to military officials, obtaining control of the  region's largest union: Sintrainagro [Banana Worker's Union].    This is what has led to the systematic assassination of  members of Hope, Peace and Liberty.    The following groups currently operate in the region.  <H5>  The 5th Front </H5>   The history of the struggle for political control is not  new.  In fact, beginning in April 1971, the FARC secretariat decided  to bring to Uraba a group of insurgents who later became the 5th  Front.    Now 22 years later, that front is a kind of "parent" front  in  the region and has 350 combatants. Its area of influence  comprises Murindo, Apartado, Chigorodo, Carepa, Turbo, Necocli,  and San Pedro de Uraba Municipalities.    Up until April 1993 the front was under the command of  Efrain  Guzman, "El Chucho," who was transferred, following the 8th  conference of the FARC, to the FARC secretariat, where he is now  in charge of coordinating the bloc of the FARC's northeastern  front.    The 5th Front is under the command of Noel Mata Mata.  According to the classified report, it consists of a general  staff, a company charged with security for the general staff,  and four combat companies. The main camp is in Porroso (Mutata).  According to intelligence information, the guerrillas of that  front have been setting up camps and schools in Los Tocales,  Rosali Arriba, Puerto Galleta, El Porroso, and Tamarindo.  <H5>  The 34th Front </H5>   This front operates with 200 men organized into three  "companies": Cacique Nutibara, Cacique Tone, and the Chanburay  Indian Group. Each one has several companies operating in the  region.    Since 1987, in view of the excessive growth of the 5th  Front,  the FARC secretariat decided to organize the 34th Front. But it  was not until mid-1991 that the presence of this criminal group  was felt in the region.    Security organizations know with certainty that this front  is  less belligerent than the 5th. However, it was the insurgents of  the 34th who attacked a military patrol several months ago in  Mutata and killed three soldiers of the Army.    Intelligent reports say that the 34th Front was exclusively  in charge of the trafficking of arms and contraband along the  border, as well as extorting tourist businesses in the Capurgana  region.    At the same time, they add, one of the 34th Front's  principal  sources of financing is drug trafficking. According to Armed  Forces' reports the front maintains 1,200 hectares of coca  plantations. The crops in the Acandi and Zapzurro zones belong  to the guerrillas.    According to military officials, the desire for the money  generated by these crops has been a decisive factor in the  growth of the front.    The commander of this front, also known as Comision Alberto  Martinez, is Luis Uzuga Restrepo, "Isaias Trujillo," or Jose  Salvador Galan Rodriguez. Trujillo maintains control over the  Acandi, Unguia, Riosucio, Rioneca,  and Balboa Municipalities, as well as the entire border with  Panama.    The guerrillas' presence in Dabeiba, Frontino, and Uramita  Municipalities leads intelligence organizations to believe that  the FARC is trying to split the 34th Front and that a new one,  called "Mariscal Sucre," has already begun to form.    This front, according to the report, would have the same  basic mission of distracting the authorities' attention in order  to continue with its drug-trafficking activities in Acandi and  Zapzurro municipalities.  <H5>  EPL Dissidents </H5>   They were a group of 25 men. They had two missions: to  revitalize the EPL and to eliminate their former comrades who  decided to lay down their arms at the beginning of 1991. Now  there are 160 guerrillas. They do not call themselves the EPL,  but the "Bernardo Franco" Front. And according to President  Cesar Gaviria himself, they are responsible for the majority of  assassinations of members of Hope, Peace, and Liberty.    This front has five combat commissions, a "support  commission," and local guerrillas (similar to the the FARC  Bolivarian Militias) in the municipalities under its influence.    The commanders of the commissions are David Mesa Pena,  "Gonzalo"; Efren Vargas Gutierrez, "Gavilan"; Juan Alvarez  Pastrana, "Rodrigo," and Orlando  Vergara.    But the group's recruitment efforts continue. According to  the report, its members are trying to form various "guerrilla  fronts" each comprising five commissions.    Since the beginning, it has carried out its criminal  activities in El Tres, El Dos, Turbo, San Vincente del Congo,  Pueblo Bello, San Jose de Bulatos, and Pueblo Nuevo.    The front's influence extends to Arboletes, Necocli,  Apartado, Chigorodo, and Carepa municipalities.    The military officials attribute the strengthening of the  "Bernardo Franco" Front to its capacity for recruiting into its  guerrilla ranks inhabitants of the region who have families  there and who have a very good knowledge of the terrain in which  they operate.    According to the officials, the families' houses serve as  hiding places for arms and guerrillas. In addition, they obtain  information about the movements of the security forces and its  enemies, the members of Hope, Peace, and Liberty.</p>

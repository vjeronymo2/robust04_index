			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mariya Starozhitskaya of UNIAN under general </F> heading: "Russia Pleased With NATO's Decision, Ukraine Pleased  With Clinton's Arrival, East Europe Disappointed"]    [Text] Kiev -- The accord on a meeting in Kiev with U.S.  President Bill Clinton 12 January and on a  Ukrainian-Russian-U.S. meeting in Moscow 14 January was a 60th  birthday gift for President Leonid Kravchuk.    Citing THE SUNDAY TIMES, Ukrainian television reported a  U.S.  Christmas present -- $12 billion in compensation for the  complete elimination of nuclear weapons from the republic's  territory.    With this turn of events -- the sums offered previously did  not exceed $500 million -- Ukrainian politicians of both the  right wing and the left wing have, on the whole, approved of the  prospect of signing the agreement. "A document on such a level  could play an important role in stabilizing public opinion, but  the interests of the three sides will hardly coincide in the  details," A. Moroz, head of the Socialist Party of Ukraine,  believes.    Given such compensation, according to V. Filenko, leader of  the democratic opposition, the Ukrainian Supreme Council should  not have any complaints against the treaty. "Finances sober up  politics," he said. "Economically, we cannot now afford nuclear  weapons, and the hryvnya needs a stabilization fund, which can  no longer be gotten anywhere." According to some data, there  was talk in Washington of a considerably smaller sum, and the  agreement of Congress is still needed to issue it. In the  opinion of V. Chornovil, leader of the Ukraine People's  Movement, President Kravchuk does not have powers to sign  international documents on nuclear disarmament. "After the act  of full and unconditional disarmament Ukraine would be thrust  into the backwoods of the world community, and interest in it  would be lost forever," he said. "There is hope, however, that  parliament -- the future agreement is subject to compulsory  ratification by it -- will not give its consent to this."    Kiev regards the change in the original plan of Bill  Clinton's European tour as almost the most significant victory  for Ukrainian diplomacy over the past year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nagoya, Jan. 27 KYODO -- Toyota Motor Corp. said  Thursday [27 January] it has agreed with German automaker  Volkswagen AG to extend their contract to make commercial  vehicles in Germany.    Under the contract due to expire at the end of 1994, Toyota  and Volkswagen have turned out Toyota's Hilux model and  Volkswagen's Taro based on the Hilux at a Volkswagen factory in  Hannover since 1989.    Toyota said the extended contract will be valid until the  currently produced models give way to new ones, but that it is  not yet decided whether to extend it again after that time.    The Hannover factory produced some 9,000 units last year and  expects to keep production volume unchanged from last year's  level in light of a weak European auto market.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / The Business Traveller: Only connect, for a more reliable ride - Better ways of flying to eastern Europe Travellers' tales from eastern Europe and the old Soviet Union, of overcrowded aircraft, of being flown to the wrong destination or of passengers having to club together to buy the fuel, make good table talk. But yesterday's fatal air crash in Russia is a reminder that safety, as well as comfort, should be taken seriously when you venture east of the Elbe. One way of increasing the safety of your trip - recommended by the UK foreign office - is to seek out western airlines that fly to smaller cities in the east. Several European carriers are making a virtue of their central European bases and are offering quick connections to destinations such as Bucharest and Timisoara in Romania, Kiev and Odessa in Ukraine, Minsk in Belarus, Alma Ata in Kazakhstan and half a dozen other hard-to-get-to cities. Your first choice should be Austrian Airlines. It flies to 10 cities that do not have direct links from London, Paris, New York or Tokyo, and it also offers short, same-day connections. Travellers receive boarding passes at their home airport for the onward flight and can check baggage through to their final destination. Austrian guarantees baggage transfer at Vienna even if there is only half an hour between connecting flights. Although a direct flight might be faster, the extra time needed for the stopover in Vienna is usually short, and the difference in comfort and convenience great. Going to Kiev via Vienna, for example, you leave London at 07:35 and arrive at 14:50. The connecting flight from Paris leaves at 08:10, from Milan at 09:20 and from New York at about 19:00 the previous day. The direct alternative from London, on Ukraine International Airlines, flies three times a week in the late afternoon, arriving at the inconvenient hour of 21:45. Running a close second to Austrian Airlines is Lufthansa, the German carrier. It flies to many of the same cities, but some departures are too early for a same-day connection when starting from London, Paris or New York. However, Lufthansa does fly to some cities that no other western carrier reaches. They include Alma Ata and Tashkent, the capitals of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, both important for the oil and gas industries. Some oil executives are not so lucky. Cities such as Baku in Azerbaijan have no direct flights from western Europe. But it is possible to avoid flying via Moscow on THY, the Turkish airline. THY also flies to Ashkhabad, capital of Turkmenistan, and if there is no same-day connection in Ankara, THY will pay for a night's accommodation. Travellers to the Baltic states have a wider choice. To Riga or Tallinn, you can go via Frankfurt or Munich on Lufthansa, via Copenhagen on SAS, or Helsinki on Finnair. For Vilnius, pick from SAS, Lufthansa, Austrian or Hamburg Airlines. Some of these connections do not appear in airline guides such as ABC. And new destinations are continually being added: Austrian will fly to Odessa from this spring, for example. However, all connections and additions should be on electronic booking systems. But it may be wise to stimulate the imagination of your travel department or agency to check all the options.</p>

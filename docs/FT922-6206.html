			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Bonn fails to satisfy US on new corps GERMANY has failed to overcome US objections to setting up a Franco-German army corps despite providing assurances that obligations to Nato will not be affected. Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, discussed the European Corps' role with Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, before a Nato planning meeting here yesterday. US officials said questions remained unanswered about the 'ultimate allegiance' of the corps, launched officially at last week's Franco-German summit. However, Mr Ruhe said later that the meeting of Nato defence ministers produced 'no revolt' against the plan. Germany was one of several allies expressing broad support for proposals to enable the nine-nation Western European Union (WEU) to make use of military formations which also had a Nato role. The Netherlands and Italy backed UK proposals to make a range of both multi-national and national forces available to the WEU. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said in a recent policy statement that the Franco-German corps could play a part as one of the formations available, alongside forces already existing in the Nato structure. WEU foreign and defence ministers are expected to agree an outline forces plan at a meeting in Bonn on June 19. Belgium and Spain, which are both considering joining the Franco-German corps, are discussing with other allies how else they might contribute to the WEU initiative. Britain has said that the use of forces by the WEU should be subject to prior Nato consultation. However, it is understood to view this as a precautionary measure to ensure that forces can be spared for operations outside the Nato area, and not as a US right of veto over WEU operations. The US is anxious to ensure that forces continue to be trained for their Nato role. However, WEU members, who are in the process of setting up a planning cell for military contingencies, foresee holding some exercises of their own. The Nato ministers also held preliminary talks on providing peacekeeping forces for the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). Nato is agreed on the principle of making its resources and organisation available for such operations if the CSCE takes on a regional UN peacekeeping mission.</p>

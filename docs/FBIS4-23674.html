			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] continues with its warmongering pretensions all  over Angola. This morning it once more tried to storm and take  over the city of Malanje, but was promptly repelled by  government troops. Our correspondent Francisco Curingana reports  from the area:    At dawn today, at 0200, a group of UNITA armed bandits who  tried to murder civilians and loot their property fled in  disarray when the civilians and the civilian defense members  responded to the attack. In its flight the enemy left explosive  devices, destroying three abandoned houses. This kind of action  has been occurring frequently, shows the desperation of the  enemy, since they are failing to justify to their commanders the  failure in the operations against Malanje. Thirteen UNITA  rebels were put out of action on 11 June in Lombe, west of  Malanje, and the government forces recovered eight AKM weapons,  two RPK machine guns, 1,368 rounds of ammunition, and three  South African made antitank mines. The government forces regret  the death of two of its valorous combatants.    In the south in Quitapa, 18 km from the city of Malanje, the  situation is calm and under the control of the government forces  and life in the city is going on normally. All institutions are  running smoothly, despite shortages of commodities in local  markets and soaring prices.</p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Pledge of Pounds 8.9m to cut fishing fleet A total of Pounds 8.9m is to be made available this year for fishermen who want to leave the industry as part of a plan to reduce Britain's fishing capacity by 19 per cent by 1996, the government announced yesterday. The funding is the latest tranche of a Pounds 25m decommissioning programme which came into force last year. The scheme had been put on ice after a High Court challenge by fishermen to controversial government plans which would limit the number of days they would be able spend at sea. In December the High Court referred the case to the European Court. Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, said he was putting the outcome of the European court case to one side. He said: 'We've thought very carefully about what the industry said in the court case and we're trying to work together with them on conserving fish stocks.' The government is discussing technical measures to preserve fish stocks such as changing the design of nets to allow young fish to escape. Mr Jack also plans to monitor whether remaining vessels in the fleet are fishing harder to compensate for those leaving the industry. He said: 'We have to make certain there have been genuine reductions in fishing to make decommissioning worthwhile. 'We also have to evaluate carefully technical conservation measures to make sure they work before they are implemented.' Last year 135 vessels were taken out of business from a fleet of 11,000. This cut capacity by less than 5 per cent. Fishermen were sceptical yesterday that decommissioning could achieve the capacity cuts required by the European Union without more funding. Mr George Traves, a trawler-owner in Bridlington, said: 'It's just not doing the job. We need at least Pounds 100m to take out the sort of capacity they're talking about.'</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: BBV in accord with Tractebel SPAIN'S Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) said yesterday it had signed a general industrial co-operation agreement with the Belgian utility Tractebel, AP-DJ reports. In a short statement, the Spanish bank described the agreement as 'a general accord on global co-operation in the industrial sector'. Details on the accord will not be available until the two companies finish defining the agreement, a BBV spokesman said. The spokesman was unable to say how the accord would affect Proindesa, the industrial holding BBV formed in January with Spain's largest private utility, Iberdrola. However, in its statement, the bank said it had increased its stake in Iberdrola to almost 10 per cent from 5.9 per cent 'by virtue of' the accord. Tractebel has acquired around 3 per cent of Iberdrola since the start of the year under an agreement to strengthen the ties between the two utilities as a basis for creating joint ventures.</p>

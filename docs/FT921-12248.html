			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report PLATINUM'S PRICE discount against gold narrowed sharply yesterday as the white metal led an advance at the London bullion market. The platinum price closed at Dollars 351.25 a troy ounce, up Dollars 8 from Friday, while gold was up Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 356.15 an ounce. Silver edged up after Friday's sharp fall, ending 1 cent to the good at 418 cents an ounce. 'Physical demand and a little speculative activity have helped the metals,' one Zurich dealer said, adding 'the firm opening on Wall Street helped sentiment in white metals a little'. Meanwhile a London trader suggested that 'people are trying to trade the gold/platinum spread to flat again.' At the London Metal Exchange aluminium prices maintained the recent bullish sentiment. The cash price closed at a 5 1/2 -month high of Dollars 1,267.50 a tonne, adding Dollars 18 to last week's Dollars 61.50 rise and taking the rise on the year so far to Dollars 141. Dealers said the tone was aided by an early burst of Far East buying, short-covering, options-related activity and constructive chart patterns. But nickel continued to retreat from the upside resistance area tested on Friday. Under profit-taking pressure the cash price closed Dollars 105 down at Dollars 7,760 a tonne. Copper prices bounced with cash metal gaining Pounds 33 to Pounds 1,227 a tonne.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tax looms large in sea views - The Issues: Personal Finance TAX is one of the central planks of the Conservatives' campaign. Judging by the savers and investors of Worthing, a south-coast resort where a high proportion of residents live off retirement income, the issue strikes home with the Tories' core supporters. The private investors of the quiet streets and seaside views of the West Sussex town, where the Conservative Mr Terence Higgins is defending a 18,500 majority, stand fairly solidly behind Mr John Major. Labour's policy shifts have not impressed them. On the basis of Mr John Smith's alternative Budget, few would be worse off and some would gain from the pensions increase. One has to be very wealthy to enjoy investment income of more than Pounds 40,000 a year - the rate at which Labour's 50 per cent tax would apply - and retired people would not be hit by abolition of the Pounds 405 per week National Insurance ceiling. Labour has also dropped a planned 9 per cent surcharge on investment income. Nevertheless, the general belief is that whatever Labour says now, it would significantly raise taxes for everyone when in office. Mr Cecil Thriscutt, a residential landlord, says: 'John Smith puts his case over better than Lamont but there is the shadow of previous Labour treatment of high income tax and interest rates.' Mr Frank O'Mahony, a retired headmaster, says: 'I go by past records and I remember Labour's 83 per cent tax rate. They will wear their old spots once they are in power.' Memories of the 1974-79 Labour government are strong. 'The record proves that they cannot keep inflation down,' says Mr Kenneth Finney, a former telecommunications executive. Mr Neil Kinnock is particularly unpopular. 'I don't trust him,' says Mr John Cameron, a retired civil servant. 'He's made more twists and turns than Torvill and Dean.' Part of Labour's problem may be that its case does not get through. In spite of repeated denials that it will reduce the capital gains tax threshold to Pounds 1,000, Tory-supporting newspapers and one of the country's largest financial-adviser groups, Noble Lowndes, were last weekend describing this as Labour policy. Capital gains tax, which was only paid by 165,000 people last year, is probably not an important issue. But Mr Major seems to have struck a chord with his plans to reduce the inheritance tax burden. Mr Thriscutt says: 'When you've worked hard and want to leave your property to your family, it's a bit galling when the government takes a huge chunk away.' On inheritance tax, Labour has indicated that it would like to move to a recipient-based levy, but the party has not spelled out its plans. The various tax shelters the Conservatives have introduced, such as Peps (personal equity plans) and Tessas (tax-exempt special savings accounts) did not seem to arouse much enthusiasm in Worthing. Investors were aware of the opportunities to save tax, but many cautiously kept their funds in property or building societies. Labour's plans on these issues have at times lacked clarity. Ms Mo Mowlam, one of the party's Treasury team, said last year: 'We would not continue the tax relief to Peps.' But another of the team, Mr Chris Smith, said earlier this year: 'We don't have any intention of sweeping them (Peps) away.' Instead, Labour might create an expanded version of the Pep, with bonds and cash products included. It would be wrong to say support for the Tories among savers in Worthing is unanimous. Mr John Hamill, a retired tax expert with advisers Wilfred T. Fry, was planning to vote Labour because he would not mind paying one or two pence in the pound for improved public services. Mrs Jean Cameron, a former secretary, was inclined to vote Liberal Democrat because of the party's education plans. Mr Chris Dale, a management consultant, described himself as a floating voter, saying that neither party had policies to encourage the growth of manufacturing industry along the lines followed by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. But for many Worthing savers support for the Tories is a tribal loyalty, best summed up by Mr Finney: 'The Conservatives look after the middle classes.'</p>

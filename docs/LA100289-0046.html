			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURF BATTLE OVER SPORTS PHYSICALS;  </P> <P> DOCTORS OPPOSE CHIROPRACTORS ON CHECKUPS FOR SCHOOL ATHLETES  </P> <P> In his nine years as a chiropractor, Tim Ursich has performed physical  examinations on aspiring athletes, deciding whether the youths are fit to  participate in sports at such high schools as Rolling Hills on the Palos Verdes  Peninsula, Bishop Montgomery in Torrance and Redondo Union in Redondo Beach.  </P> <P> But if any of his young patients want to go out for sports at such schools as  Banning, Carson or Gardena High -- all part of the Los Angeles Unified School  District -- district regulations dictate they must be examined by a licensed  physician and surgeon: a medical doctor or an osteopath.  </P> <P> Ursich and some of his colleagues, under the aegis of the increasingly active  California Chiropractic Assn., are trying to get the regulation changed to  allow chiropractors and other licensed health care practitioners to perform the  physicals.  </P> <P> Their controversial campaign to change the regulation, scheduled for a vote  today by a divided school board, has drawn vociferous opposition from the Los  Angeles County Medical Assn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Would Be Step Backward'  </P> <P> "We have been trying for years to progressively improve the medical care of the  school athlete," said Dr. Jerome (Jerry) Bornstein, an Encino orthopedist who  has been a team physician since 1961 and a member of the medical association's  sports medicine committee.  </P> <P> "This would be a step backward, not forward," Bernstein said. "I have respect  for what chiropractors are trained to do in the healing arts, but I think they  are overstepping (their qualifications) here."  </P> <P> The debate in Los Angeles, where about 20,000 students a year are required to  take sports screening physical exams, is being watched throughout California's  health care community. It comes at a time when chiropractors have been seeking  -- and getting -- wider acceptance, in part through favorable court decisions  and aggressive lobbying and public relations. Marking the debate, which has  escalated rapidly since the issue was heard in the Board of Education's  Personnel and Schools Committee in August, is a tangle of medical and legal  arguments fraught, both sides say, with political overtones.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Losing Some of the Pie'  </P> <P> "The MDs are starting to worry about the competition, that they're losing some  of the pie," said Paul Lehman, director of public affairs for the chiropractic  association.  </P> <P> But Dr. Charles McElwee, president of the county medical association and an  orthopedic surgeon in Covina, said turf is not the issue.  </P> <P> "It's scope of training," McElwee said. "They are not physicians and they  shouldn't be practicing medicine. If (a patient) wants a true history and  physical exam, they cannot get it from a chiropractor."  </P> <P> Helen Hale, a pediatrician who is director of student health services for the  district, said the school board requires a complete physical examination,  including hearing, vision, heart, lungs and other internal organs and an  evaluation of the musculoskeletal system, plus a medical history, before a  youngster is allowed to participate in athletics. In most instances, the family  pays the cost of the exam. If a child's family can't afford it, either one of  the district's 40 staff physicians or private doctors provide the service for  free.  </P> <P> Board Member Rita Walters has been outspoken in her opposition to changing the  regulations to include chiropractors, nurse practitioners and others. To fully  protect the district from liability and to provide the best screening and care  for its students, the exams ought to be done by physicians, she said.  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate, but for some of these families, this (sports physical) may  be the only time their teen-age children encounter a physician. I think they  ought to see a fully licensed medical doctor," Walters said.  </P> <P> But Jerilynn Kaibel, a chiropractor with practices in San Bernardino and  Riverside counties and a member of the Beaumont Unified School District Board  of Education, said chiropractors can do just as good an exam as medical  doctors. She is convinced that chiropractors are well qualified to do physicals  for Los Angeles, even though the exam is more thorough than that required in  many other districts.  </P> <P> "L.A.'s exam is very comprehensive, and that's good," Kaibel said, "but it's  nothing outside the scope of chiropractic."  </P> <P> There is wide disagreement about what chiropractors, whose training and  practice centers on the musculoskeletal system, are trained and licensed to do.  </P> <P> Chiropractors want the district to follow the lead of the California  Interscholastic Federation, the private association which oversees school  athletic competitions throughout the state. The CIF allows the job of physical  exams to be done by any "medical practitioner." Several school districts in  California, including several in Los Angeles and Orange counties, have  patterned their own regulations after the CIF.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Districts' Policies Cited  </P> <P> "School districts all over the state have decided there is no problem (with  allowing chiropractors to do sports physicals). So why," said Ursich, "is that  different in Los Angeles?"  </P> <P> But Tom Byrnes, the CIF's state commissioner of athletics, cautioned that the  organization's regulations are not meant to preempt local districts' judgment  in the matter of who should do the exams.  </P> <P> "We leave it to the local school districts to determine who is qualified . . .  or what constitutes a proper exam," Byrnes said, noting the federation a couple  of years ago considered, then rejected, a proposal to change its regulations to  accept exams only from licensed physicians and surgeons.  </P> <P> Both sides cite state law and court cases to bolster their arguments and both  have threatened to sue if they don't like the school board's decision.  </P> <P> In a letter to school board President Jackie Goldberg, who has sought to have  chiropractors allowed, attorney Michael J. Schroeder argued that "chiropractors  always have been legally authorized to diagnose all conditions or diseases of  the human body" and said there "is little question that the position that the  district has taken is contrary to law."  </P> <P> The district's legal advisers said some of the legal issues, including scope of  practice questions in a recent Sacramento court case on appeal, have yet to be  fully resolved. Still, district staff attorney Ron Apperson said he believes  "there is sufficient basis to allow the board to make a decision on the choice  before them" -- whether to keep its current policy or change it to more closely  conform with the CIF regulations.  </P></p>

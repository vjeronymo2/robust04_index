			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (8): Little magic, just mystery THE NEW MARKET WIZARDS: CONVERSATIONS WITH AMERICA'S TOP TRADERS By Jack D. Schwager HarperBusiness, Dollars 22.50, 493 pages PERHAPS THE most revealing statement in this book comes in the middle of a conversation between the author and trader Gil Blake. Schwager asks whether people can buy systems developed by others and use them successfully. Blake thinks not. He argues that systems are more useful to the originator than to anyone else and that trading methods always have to be personalised. Besides, he adds, successful traders do not sell their systems. Which rather lets the cat out of the bag. Schwager's book, and its predecessor Market Wizards, are in the American tradition started by Dale Carnegie which depend on the idea that you too can make a million simply by following successful practitioners. Needless to say you cannot - the most that can be gleaned is the odd tip. Those who failed to make a fortune from Schwager's first book are unlikely to do so from his current collection of fireside chats. The format is also a little irritating. A series of verbatim discussions offers no opportunity for analysis, save that which flows from the interviewer's questions. To give the layman any chance of understanding the jargon-filled exchanges, a large number of explanations also have to be added in parentheses, breaking the flow. Nor does The New Market Wizards offer the kind of psychological insight which made John Train's The Money Masters such compelling reading. There are some titbits of interesting information buried inside the 500 pages. It is surprising how often the traders' most profitable bets come when they are convinced that they have to speculate against the consensus. It is not that they are all permanent contrary thinkers, more that they seem to have a feel for the right time to oppose the trend. There is also an intriguing but inconclusive account of how the famous traders William Eckhardt and Richard Dennis successfully taught classes of trainees their techniques. In the end, though, The New Market Wizards offers too much background and too few insights. Sadly, this series of tape recordings stuck between hard covers does not even hint at how such highly successful speculators differ from the thousands of battery-hen traders who sweat it out in dealing rooms around the world.</p>

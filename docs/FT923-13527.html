			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Financial services expect upturn THE financial services sector may be about to pick up, according to a report published today. However, it warns that business volumes remain well below normal and says that improved profitability has been won partly through job losses and reduced costs. For the only the second time since December 1989, the report - prepared jointly by the Confederation of British Industry and accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand - records an upturn in business confidence. According to the 333 companies surveyed, business confidence in many UK financial services strengthened in the second quarter of the year, even though business levels remained well below normal. There was also a slight rise in business volumes during the quarter, the first since June 1990. Total operating costs were down for the third quarter in succession. The most optimistic financial services are general insurance, fund management, venture capital and finance houses, but banking and building societies still report a weakening in their confidence. Less than a third of financial services companies expect business volumes to rise in the quarter now under way, and only 4 per cent think there will be a drop in business. The survey says that uncertainty about business prospects is still holding back investment plans and that spending by financial services companies on information technology over the next year looks like falling for the first time since the survey began. Companies are planning to curb spending on land, buildings, vehicles, plant and machinery in the drive to control costs. They are also cutting spending on staff training. With operating costs down and wider margins on their business, the profitability of companies surveyed is expected to rise still further over the next three months. In the life insurance sector, business volumes are still depressed and expectations of a recovery have been unfulfilled. The CBI says companies that sell products through brokers fared markedly better than those which do not. Building societies were among the sectors that did worse, with demand shrinking and no signs of improved margins or fee income. CBI/Coopers &amp; Lybrand Financial Services Survey No 11.

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Pretoria rebuked over policy on violence A JUDICIAL commission yesterday sharply rebuked the South African government for ignoring its recommendations and jeopardising efforts to curb political violence. In a blunt warning to President F W de Klerk, Judge Richard Goldstone, who heads the official commission of inquiry into township violence, made clear that the government's authority could be undermined if it failed to tackle the issue. He listed proposals which had either not been followed up by the government, or had been inadequately implemented: 'To ignore its (the commission) recommendations can only be calculated to diminish if not destroy the credibility and effectiveness not only of the commission but also of the government.' Judge Goldstone read his statement at the preliminary hearing into last month's Boipatong massacre in which 42 people died. He stressed that the Commission had received 'no evidence . . . which in any way justifies allegations of any direct complicity in or planning of current violence' by President de Klerk, his ministers, or 'any highly placed officer' in the security forces. In the absence of such evidence, such allegations 'are unwise, unfair and dangerous,' the judge continued, in what seemed an implicit refence to accusations made by Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader and other political leaders. But he went to deliver a forthright attack on the government's response to the commission's work. He noted that a government 'must be able to demonstrate that it has full control of its security forces' if it is to command support. Whether or not members of the former counter-insurgency unit called Koevoet, now part of the police force, were involved in the violence, 'the very existence of such a group in South Africa in 1992 is calculated to cause yet further distrust.' Examples of commission recommendations that had been ignored included fencing and monitoring hostels, source of much township tensions, and ending deployment of 32 battalion, which has a reputation for brutality, in black townships. Recommendations banning carrying of arms in public had been 'partially but inadequately implemented', he said. Six thousand striking workers at Toyota's Durban plant were dismissed yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow 10 June TASS -- As a result of  round-the-clock joint patrolling of streets in Dushanbe, the  capital of Tajikistan, by the Republic's security, the Interior  and Defence Ministry, as well as deployed there Russian military  contingent units, over 30 firearms were confisticated, military  sources in Dushanbe told ITAR-TASS today.    As reported earlier, with the aim of stabilizing the  situation in the Tajik capital, a decision was adopted at a  session of the Coordination Council of the republic's law  enforcement bodies on 6 June to take additional measures for  fighting against crimes. The Russian 201 Army Division has set  up posts, which are being jointly manned with police bodies. A  mobile radio station is broadcasting the Russian division  command's appeal to residents of the city to voluntarily  surrender illegal arms in their possession. Pamphlets carrying  text of the appeal are being distributed in the capital. The  patrols have sweeping powers, including carrying out search of  all types of vehicles, checking documents in possession of the  citizens and confiscating illegally kept arms. Areas, where  Russian servicemen and members of their families live, are being  kept under special guard.    It became known today that an attempt was made to attack the  car of the 201st Divison commander during the evening checking  of the posts on 7 June. The attacker was disarmed as a result  of daring decisive action taken by driver Private Salavat  Galimov. The would-be assassin, identified as Nazar Khoitov,  born in 1967, was handed over to police.</p>

Each Board Member is entitled to appoint staff within the constraints of the adopted budget for the Office of the Board. Consistent with the Act, the Board shall approve the appointment of the ``heads of major administrative divisions,'' which the Board interprets to mean the Chief Operating Officer and career Office Directors. The Chairman has authority to appoint the Secretary and noncareer (political) Office Directors but does so with the understanding that all Agency representations by such staff are on behalf of the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Organization chart. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Consistent with its mandate to approve regulations and the appointments outlined above, the Board shall approve the FCA organizational chart down to the Office level along with relevant functional statements for each Office.

The CEO shall be responsible for overseeing the audit resolution process. However, the CEO must obtain Board approval of resolutions where the issue would normally require Board action. The CEO (through his/her designee) shall be responsible for implementation and audit followup. The Chairman will provide a briefing in the appropriate setting for the Board on the Inspector General's Semi-Annual Report to Congress within ten (10) working days of the Chairman's transmittal of the Report to Congress. The Chairman will ask the IG and Audit Followup Official to discuss the status of any unresolved audit recommendations, unimplemented management decisions, and other issues identified in the Semi-Annual Report. Consistent with its budgetary responsibility, the Board must approve all audit resolutions that result in a cumulative cost to the Agency in excess of $25,000 per audit. This requirement applies to audits commenced after May 1, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Director, Office of Secondary Market Oversight.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director shall report to the FCA Board regarding general policy and rulemaking issues and to the FCA Chairman as CEO relating to administrative activities of the Office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

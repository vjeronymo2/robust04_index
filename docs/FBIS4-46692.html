			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with A. Malinovskiy by Galina Pokomareva; place </F> and date not given: "And Again Non-flying Weather"]    [Text] "The wages of pilots at the Moscow Bykovo  Airport range from 300,000 to 500,000 rubles. Pilots in  Domodedovo and Vnukovo receive more than 1 million. In the  opinion of the common man, not the most destitute people in the  country intend to strike," I began the conversation with A.  Malinovskiy, who a year ago left the post of IL-62 commander in  Domodedovo in order to head Russia's Trade Union of Flight  Personnel.    "You are an instigator, I guessed right away," Alfred  Avgustovich reacted. "One should not make extremists out of us.  We demand not money, but the government's attention to the  problems of the entire sector.    "Only enterprises that have the opportunity to fly abroad  are  profitable now. The rest are unprofitable. Aviators in the North  and the Far East are in the most difficult situation, despite  the fact that airplanes and helicopters are the only types of  transport there. Fuel is expensive, costs per flying hour are  excessively high, and only millionaires can afford the transport  rates. Traditional customers--petroleum industry workers,  geologists, fishermen, and gold miners--had to give up aviation.  Things got to the point where many air detachments performed  free flights to remote settlements in order to take out sick  people, women in childbirth, and mail and to deliver bread and  medical supplies. At the same time, crews do not receive wages  for months."    [Pokomareva] Sad as it may be, the market, about which we  talk a great deal, dictates its laws. Profitable enterprises  flourish and unprofitable ones declare themselves bankrupt...    [Malinovskiy] Under the present market economy an enterprise  has an owner. Most of our aviation enterprises, as before, are  state enterprises, that is, they require budget injections.  After all, in any, the most developed, country the transport  system enjoys the concern and support of the state. The entire  population needs it. Two years ago the Trade Union of Flight  Personnel proposed that free air transport rates be introduced,  but, in order that the population should not suffer, that money  from the budget be allocated for compensation for the needy.  Which was done. As a result, ticket prices increased, but 75  billion rubles, which were allocated for compensation in 1993,  did not reach those to whom they were addressed. Now every  airport sets its own, often unsubstantiated, prices of fuel,  spare parts, and maintenance. Departing on a flight, pilots are  forced to get from their enterprise literally a bag of money and  from this bag to pay in cash for everything, including the  cleaning of the airplane.    We demand that steps be taken to stop the chaos and  arbitrariness; for example, to develop a mechanism of payment of  compensations for the population for air tickets; to establish a  system of mutual noncash transactions among aviation  enterprises; to issue a reference catalog with rates of air  services and to establish economic and administrative sanctions  for their violation.    [Pokomareva] However, in your demands there are also more  "global" questions, which cannot be solved right away...    [Malinovskiy] We fully realize that problems of "small  aviation," which traditionally serviced other national economic  sectors, cannot be solved right away. However, those that make  decisions should at least "face" them. Agriculture suffers, not  receiving the help of aviation in field fertilization and weed  control. Forestry incurs losses owing to fires. Reindeer  breeding brigades and fishing artels are isolated. Power  industry workers are cutting down on the patrolling of electric  transmission lines. Oil industry workers cannot use helicopters  for the delivery of products and materials to places that are  not easily accessible. It would be realistic to establish an  intersectorial commission and to determine the necessary volume  of aviation work and its financing from the budget of every  sector. There is a need for tax privileges for aviation  enterprises performing work for the need of the national  economy, especially in regions of the North and the Far East.    [Pokomareva] Are you confident that all 40,000 pilots will  support the trade union's decision?    [Malinovskiy] Two years ago I called a strike "by bluffing."  Everyone supported it. Right away everyone began to take action,  became frightened, and came to negotiations. This worked. They  did not let the strike happen--they accepted our demands. I am  confident that they will also support us now.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   One of the specialists in the field of air law explained to  me that the pilots' strike is none other than "destabilization  of the state transport system" and entails criminal  responsibility. As a joke he advised that the telephone numbers  of the "ringleaders" of this undertaking be published in the  newspaper. For passengers. Then it will become clear who is  right and who is to blame...</p>

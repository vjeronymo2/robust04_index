			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Ever-closer connection Indonesian businessman Mr Liem Sioe Liong, one of the wealthiest overseas Chinese in south-east Asia, is at the centre of the latest big investment to be announced in China. The deal illustrates Mr Liem's return to ancestral roots, a common motivation among overseas Chinese investing in their homeland, writes Kieran Cooke. He has teamed up with two state-controlled Singaporean companies to develop an industrial park in China's Fujian province. The first phase will cost Dollars 185m. Mr Liem heads the Salim group, which has an estimated annual turnover of Dollars 8bn and is Indonesia's biggest business group. The group is involved in cement, steelmaking, shipping, property, flour milling, noodle making and other activities. Mr Liem is a native of Fujian and has maintained close links with the province. Singapore itself has close connections with Fujian province, home of people who speak the Hokkien Chinese dialect, which is widely spoken in Singapore. A Singapore-based investment analyst says Mr Liem's project is an example of 'the Singapore Inc approach - cash-rich government companies linking up with well-connected private interests to exploit an opportunity'. Mr Liem will hold a 40 per cent share in a company which will plan and manage the Fujian enterprise. Other companies connected with Mr Liem will have an additional 30 per cent stake, while the two Singaporean companies, Singapore Technologies and Jurong Environmental Engineering, will each have a 10 per cent share. The project involves turning a 5,000-hectare area into a commercial, industrial and residential complex. Port and other infrastructure facilities will also be built. The aim is to attract light and medium-sized industries from Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. The complex is designed to be a low-cost export manufacturing base which will act as a springboard for further trade and investments in China. It is close to Taiwan, which is also investing heavily in Fujian. But the project could cause regional ripples. 'There are many people in Indonesia who feel that Liem, having made his money there, should not be investing big amounts in China. Allowing our (Singapore) state companies to get involved in such high-profile projects could cause problems in our future relations with Indonesia,' says a Singapore-based analyst.</p>

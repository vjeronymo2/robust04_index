			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Speaking at a National Education </F> Conference, Huang Ju Stresses the Need To Seize the Opportunity  To Deepen Reform and Build a First-Class City and Develop  First-Class Education"]    [Text] Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, who is attending the  national education conference, addressed the conference on 15  June. He said: The aim of the national education conference,  convened by the party Central Committee and the State Council in  the new situation of establishing a socialist market economic  structure, is to mobilize the whole party and all sectors of  society to implement the "Outline for the Reform and Development  of Education in China" so as to accelerate the realization of  China's grand objective of economic and social development in  the nineties. The current conference will have a profound and  far-reaching impact on the development of China's education and  economy. The reports of foresight, made by the leading central  comrades at the conference, have widened our horizons and  instilled new ideas in us. We express our total support.    Expounding on Shanghai's understanding of the strategic  position of education, Mayor Huang Ju said: The sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the economy in Shanghai in the  nineties has been, to a large extent, due to the importance it  attached to education in the eighties. In recent years,  Shanghai has become the favorite investment hot spot of domestic  and foreign businesses. In particular, it has attracted many  world-renowned transnational corporations. This is also mainly  due to the unique advantage that in Shanghai the quality of  workers is good, trained personnel are fairly concentrated, and  education is developed. Practice has shown that an advantage in  trained personnel constitutes the most important advantage in  the investment environment. We can truly say that "today's  education will become the science and technology of tomorrow,  and the economy of the day after tomorrow." It is precisely  from these historical experiences that we have learned that it  is necessary to establish Shanghai's strategic position in  education, which means the overall leading position in basic  industries. More importantly, Shanghai, which is marching  toward the 21st century, must have first-class education to  match a first-class city. Shanghai belongs to the whole  country. In establishing Shanghai's reform and education goals,  we must also embody the strategic idea that Shanghai "serves the  whole country and is geared to the whole world." It is  Shanghai's bounden duty and obligation to train tens of  thousands of high-caliber and high-quality personnel for the  Chang Jiang basin and for various areas of the country. As an  international metropolis, Shanghai should open up more channels  of international cooperation in education, and become one of  China's showcases with education geared to the world.    Huang Ju said: In the past few years, Shanghai, like the  rest of the country, has made marked progress in education but  many problems still remain. The major ones are the following  four contradictions: the contradiction between educational  supply and the demand for trained personnel by large-scale  economic and social development; the contradiction between the  traditional educational system and Shanghai's lead in  establishing a socialist market economic operating mechanism;  the contradiction between the existing structure and  distribution of education on the one hand, and readjustment of  urban functions on the other; and the contradiction between  educational barriers between regions and departments on the one  hand, and the pattern of all-encompassing opening to the outside  world on the other. To solve these contradictions, we must  emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, actively explore  new ways, and deepen reform.    He discussed five aspects of Shanghai's practices and  exploration in educational reform and development.    1. Promote high-standard basic education with a view to  enhancing the quality of the whole nation. First, while mainly  depending on government appropriations, Shanghai has ensured a  steady source and increased the revenues for nine-year  compulsory education. In the "Measures for Implementing the  `Law of the People's Republic of China on Compulsory Education'  in Shanghai," promulgated in 1993, it is stipulated that  financial appropriations for compulsory education must be  increased in two ways and that public expenses should be  adjusted yearly according to changes in the prices of  commodities. In addition, the measures also urge society to  increase investment in education. Meanwhile, to strengthen the  training of more teachers for elementary and middle schools and  comprehensively upgrade the quality of teachers, we drew up the  "Provisions for Elementary and Middle School Studies in  Shanghai" to institutionalize the system for in-service teachers  to continue their education, and to upgrade the educational  level of teachers of elementary and middle schools. On the  basis of reforming the distribution system and raising work  quality and efficiency, we gradually improved teachers' wages.  In 1993, the average pay of elementary and middle school  teachers in Shanghai rose by 10 percent over 1992 after allowing  for price rises. We have also constantly pushed forward the  reform of courses and teaching materials. At present, the  attendance rate of school-age children and the percentage of  graduates of elementary schools going into middle schools have  reached 100 percent. Enforcement of nine-year compulsory  education in the 20 districts and counties of the municipality  has been completed.    2. Enhance the vitality of education by reforming the method  of running schools and the school investment system. The  establishment of a socialist market economic structure is bound  to demand different ways of running schools and result in calls  for a new system in which schools will be run predominantly by  the state with the participation of all sectors of society. In  the past two years, Shanghai has established over 10 middle and  elementary schools run by private individuals or by individuals  with the help of the state. It has also approved applications  for the construction of privately run schools of higher  learning. In running schools through international cooperation,  we have established a number of international cooperative  schools of specialized studies including accountancy, commerce  and trade, and management. We have also promulgated two  regulations for the management of civilian-run schools and  schools of international cooperation. We have explored the  reform of the education investment system and introduced various  channels of investment in education. First, we increased  government investment by stipulating that the annual increase in  local education expenses must be higher than the increase in the  gross national product by 2 to 3 percentage points, and that  budgeted educational expenses must account for over 20 percent  of the total local revenue; second, we raised the proportion of  the surtax for urban educational expenses from two to three  percent. We have also readjusted the surtax for rural education  expenses, increasing it by 30 percent; third, we adopted  preferential policies to support industries run by schools.  Last year, the total profits made by industries run by schools  were 760 million yuan; fourth, we have established a fund for  educational development to encourage enterprises, social  organizations, and individuals to support education. The fund  will reach 100 million yuan by the end of this year. Through  the efforts of all concerned, Shanghai's basic education  expenses increased by 34 percent, and higher education expenses,  30 percent, last year.    3. Optimize the allocation of educational resources through  "joint construction, cooperative construction, merging, and  readjustment." Limited by the past system of planned economy,  there were barriers in Shanghai's schools, and university  courses leaned heavily toward science and engineering. To deal  with this contradiction, we carried out major readjustments to  the structure of schools of higher learning: 1) we actively  explored ways for joint construction of schools of higher  learning between Shanghai and the central ministries and  commissions, and both sides have signed an agreement on joint  construction of Fudan University, Jiaotong University, and  Shanghai Foreign Language University; 2) taking advantage of the  "211" project, we introduced cooperation in running schools.  The four universities were merged recently to form the new  Shanghai University; 3) we did a good job in running schools  through cooperation between central ministries and commissions,  and Shanghai. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation will delegate the management of the Shanghai Foreign  Trade College to Shanghai. Through this method, Shanghai's  universities and colleges will be readjusted from around 50 to  40, of which local universities and colleges will be readjusted  from 21 to 14 or 15. Applying the market mechanism, and in  conjunction with large-scale urban construction and reform, we  also readjusted the distribution of elementary and middle  schools, and by applying the existing educational resources, we  have organized the implementation of the "project for training  badly needed personnel for Shanghai in the nineties." We have  set up 10 training centers for that purpose. We plan to train,  in two to three years, tens of thousands of specialized  personnel in the fields of banking, insurance, overseas  commerce, high-grade accountancy, and foreign law, all of which  are urgently needed by Shanghai.    4. Reform the student enrollment and graduate employment  systems. Higher education should be provided mainly but not  entirely by the government. We have over the past two years  taken the reform of student enrollment and graduate employment  systems as a breakthrough in advancing the reform of institutes  of higher learning, and gradually established a system requiring  students to pay school fees while in university and  independently select their own jobs upon graduation. With  regard to measures, our first was aimed at changing the  mechanism to establish a fee system and a corresponding  scholarship and educational loan system. Last year's statistics  showed fee-paying students accounted for 40 percent of the total  student enrollment at Shanghai's institutes of higher learning,  in addition to the 10 percent who were entrusted to the  institutes by their employers for training. This total figure  will increase to 60 percent this year, preparing the institutes  of higher learning for next year's abolition of the division  between paying and nonpaying students. The second measure was  the reform-oriented experimentation with independent student  enrollment at eight institutes of higher learning in Shanghai,  to give students a greater opportunity to choose their own  school and profession, and to promote basic education's shift  from one emphasizing examination to one emphasizing quality.  The third measure was the breakup of the planned distribution  system of "unified job assignment" to establish a system of  independent job selection for most graduates; to expand rather  considerably the recommendation authority of schools, the  personnel selection right of employing units, and the job  selection right of graduates; and to appropriately lift  restrictions on personnel selection and hiring based on a  graduate's place of origin. The municipal government will also  set up a qualified personnel market and the "Shanghai City  College Graduates' Employment Service Center" to provide  information and consultation services to graduates and employing  units.    5. Strengthen moral education to comprehensively improve the  quality of education. Over recent years, the municipal party  committee and government earnestly implemented Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's instruction that equally strong emphasis be placed on  both spiritual and material civilizations. First, we  incorporated school patriotic education and moral education into  the master plan for promoting Shanghai's spiritual civilization,  and gave them a prominent place in our work. Second, we  strengthened organization and coordination, and mobilized the  strength of the entire society, naming 20 municipal-level  "youngsters' education bases" and setting up some 1,000 district  and neighborhood youngsters' education bases to form a good  atmosphere and environment throughout the city for patriotic  education. Third, we attentively studied the situation and  characteristics of opening up to the outside world and adhered  to the principle of "emphasizing actual results and rejecting  formalism" to carry out lively, impressive, and well-targeted  ideological and moral education in various fields, and at  different levels; to forge a lofty sentiment of cherishing a  deep love for the motherland and enthusiastically seeking  advancement; and to promote healthy and strong growth of the new  socialist generation. In comprehensively improving the teaching  quality, we, in addition to strengthening curriculum reform,  emphatically carried out the experimentation and popularization  of the credit system in institutes of higher learning.    Speaking of Shanghai's primary goals in implementing the  "outline," Mayor Huang Ju said: we must, first of all, study and  implement the guidelines of the national education conference in  real earnest. We will ask party committees and governments at  all levels in Shanghai, top party and government leaders in  particular, to study the important speeches made by central  leading comrades, especially the guidelines of making education  a strategic priority. As they study and relay them, they should  make comparisons and examination, unify their thinking, act in  unison, and truly bring forth a new generation of well-educated  and self-disciplined people with lofty ideals and moral  integrity. Plans and goals of educational development should be  incorporated into the overall plan for Shanghai's social and  economic development, and educational indexes must also be  incorporated into the system under which the leading cadres at  various levels are held responsible for the attainment of  specified objectives. The report on government work submitted  annually to the people's congress is obligated to set forth  requirements and review educational work. In evaluating the  performance of leading cadres we should look at their  achievements in educational work. Second, we should improve the  ranks of teachers and see to it that teachers' wages, housing,  and other material benefits are raised and improved. We should  work hard to fulfill the goal of raising the average wage of  teachers to a level that is 10 percent higher than that of  government employees. We must, in particular, improve the  material benefits of young and middle-aged backbone teachers.  We should learn from Beijing's and Dalian's experiences by  incorporating construction of teachers' quarters into the city's  urban development plans or quarters development plans. We  should also adopt a policy that favorably tilts towards the  teachers in terms of pensions and medical insurance. Third, we  should concentrate the required financial resources to ensure  construction of key educational projects. Fourth, we should step  up educational legislation so that education will be brought  within the jurisdiction of law. We plan to establish a basic  framework of educational laws by formulating 40 or so sets of  regulations within three to five years. We must also enhance  our awareness of law enforcement and strengthen the supervision  mechanism. Regulations, once promulgated for implementation,  must be strictly enforced according to law.    Mayor Huang Ju's speech was highly acclaimed by the  conference participants.</p>

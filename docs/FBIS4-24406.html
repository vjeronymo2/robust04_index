			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 28 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton's decision to extend China's most favored nation [MFN]  trading status for another year and to delink human rights from  trade issues has been warmly received by HK [Hong Kong]  residents, especially businessmen here.    Local business leaders today hailed the decision as not only  conducive to the trade development among China, the United  States and Hong Kong, but also conducive to China's reentry into  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Raymond Ch'ien Kuo-fung, chairman of the Federation of Hong  Kong Industries, said that the decision will have positive  impact on the economic development in the three areas,  especially in Hong Kong.    Before the decision was made, some investors had taken a  wait- and-see attitude towards investment in China, now that  most of the uncertainties have been cleared away, investors'  confidence in China will surely be enhanced, which, in turn,  will benefit Hong Kong, Ch'ien said.    Ian A. Christie, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber  of  Commerce, believed that the renewal of China's MFN trading  status has increased the chance for China to reenter the GATT.    He hoped China could get its permanent MFN trading status  from the United States next year, which he said would benefit  all of the three sides.    Henry Tang Ying-yen, vice-president of the Federation of  Hong  Kong Industries, expressed his welcome to President Clinton's  announcement to delink human rights from trade issues while  deciding to renew China's MFN trading status.    He said that the bilateral trade between two countries  should  be conducted on an equal basis, and it is never correct for one  country to threaten the other with unfair trade conditions.    Meanwhile, many local public figures have also expressed  their concerns over the U.S. decision to ban the import of  Chinese weapons.</p>

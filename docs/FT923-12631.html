			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / US-made Toyotas for Japan TOYOTA, Japan's biggest car maker, is to start importing US-made Toyota cars into Japan next month. The move is important symbolically as an effort to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the US, particularly given Toyota's huge market power in Japan, where it claims 42 per cent of car sales. It will also help Toyota meet a growing domestic demand for estates (station wagons). Toyota will import the right-hand-drive version of its Camry Wagon, manufactured at its plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, to be sold domestically as the Scepter. The company has set an ambitious sales target of 700 units a month. It will compete against Honda's US-made and designed Accord Wagon, whose sales have averaged 836 a month this year. Nissan said yesterday it would next year start importing to Japan a small wagon to be manufactured at its Mexican assembly plant. Honda remains the leader in so-called reverse imports, with average monthly imports of 1,146 units of three different models of the Accord. The cars tend to be sold as premium products without the extensive discounting now available on domestically-made models. Nissan has been selling an average of 192 UK-made Primera models, while Mitsubishi has sold 46 US and Australian-made models each month. Mazda has sold about 160 US-made cars bearing the Ford marque each month. Ford owns a 24 per cent stake in Mazda. Total sales of imported vehicles in Japan in the first six months of the year came to 85,129 units, down 12.7 per cent from a year ago. European marques were hit hardest.</p>

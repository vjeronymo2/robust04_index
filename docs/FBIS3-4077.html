			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 9 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The  advantages of introducing and utilizing foreign capital for  modernization in China has been acknowledged by people  throughout the world. However, with the increase in large  numbers of foreign-invested enterprises, the number of law  violations related to such enterprises is also increasing.  Because of this, personalities of economic circles and even of  academic circles have put forward this question: Are we using  foreign capital or are we being used by foreign capital?    An article entitled "Cool Thinking in Foreign Capital Fever"  published in the "Economic Square" column of the latest issue of  ZHONGHUA WENZHAI [China Digest] has incisively raised this  question, which must not be neglected, urging people to think  and observe calmly.    The article points out that one of the inharmonious shadows  is "false joint ventures and deceptive practices," that is, some  enterprises are only joint ventures in name, but are enjoying  preferential treatment for joint ventures. In recent years,  many cases of this "false Sino-foreign joint venture disease"  have been found and the "disease" seems to be spreading. In  these false joint venture enterprises, the foreign side is  usually not committed to investing, but collects one-time  "service charges" or takes in regular "cooperation fees" of a  certain percentage. What is particularly worthy of our  attention is that some foreign businessmen with ulterior motives  have sought "wedding ties" of this kind on their own initiative,  have gained capital by cheating, and have then fled with the  money.    The second is "exaggerating the amount of investment to  build  oneself up." Over a very long period, there has been a  phenomena of exaggerated investment in the foreigners' visible  assets -- passing old equipment off as new equipment, inferior  equipment as superior equipment, and low-price equipment as  high-price equipment. A foreign businessman negotiated five  identical joint venture projects with several provinces and  municipalities in China and imported five sets of equipment at  $2.4 million each. During the later inspection by commodity  inspection departments, all these five sets of equipment were  pieced together abroad, and their total price was only slightly  over $900,000.    The third is "declaring losses instead of profits to evade  taxes." In recent years, some foreign-invested enterprises have  resorted to various tricks to evade taxes, the most common being  is to "declare losses instead of profits." In 1991, a total of  4,838 foreign-invested enterprises declared losses totalling  3.66 billion yuan in Guangdong Province, accounting for 53  percent of enterprises involved in remittance settlement. As a  result, quite a few joint venture enterprises have emerged which  "always suffer losses" but will "never close down," and which  have been constantly expanding their scale of production. These  enterprises are in reality reaping more and more profits with  each passing year.    Besides, there are numerous other tricks which have appeared  one after another, such as using foreign capital as a pretext  for smuggling, making profits by exaggerating the amount of  capital introduced and covering up the amount of capital taken  out, fleeing to avoid paying debts, and so on.    In conclusion, the article pointed out that the  participation  of some foreign businessmen in illegal activities is not  something new. Such activities have existed for the past 13  years. They have become especially conspicuous, because the  number of foreign- invested enterprises has increased greatly.  Because foreign- invested enterprises are special by nature,  effective techniques for managing domestic enterprises may not  work in the management of foreign-invested enterprises.  Therefore, many urgent problems require a prompt solution by  the departments concerned, and better regulations and rules  should be formulated so that the foreign capital fever can truly  give impetus to rapid economic development in China.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF leads Dollars 400m bid for LTV divisions THOMSON-CSF, the French state-controlled defence company, has joined forces with two US partners to bid Dollars 400m for the aerospace and missile businesses of LTV, the US steel and defence company under bankruptcy protection for the past five years. The Thomson-CSF bid, which features Hughes Aircraft and the Carlyle Group as partners, tops a Dollars 355m bid LTV agreed in February with Vought, a venture formed by US defence groups Lockheed and Martin Marietta. The French company and Hughes are offering Dollars 280m in cash for LTV's missile business, while the Carlyle Group, an investment firm run by Mr Frank Carlucci, the former secretary of defence, is offering Dollars 90m in cash and Dollars 30m in preferred stock for LTV's aircraft division. As LTV is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, any bid for its assets would need the approval of the judge following its case. Thomson and its partners claimed last night that their bid would not create any anti-trust complications. Following the acquisition, each division would be separately capitalised and operated independently, Thomson-CSF said. LTV's missiles division would remain an American company, it was claimed, and would observe US Defence Department restrictions to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of classified information or transfer of sensitive technology. Thomson-CSF said compliance with US laws and regulations would be ensured by a Special Security Agreement (SSA) written to US Defence Department specifications. Security compliance would be overseen by an eight-member board of directors, all but one of whom would be US citizens.</p>

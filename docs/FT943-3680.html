			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / People: ASDA Supermarket group ASDA has appointed Michael Fleming, 33, as marketing director. Fleming is currently marketing director of Somerfield, the supermarket chain formerly known as Gateway. Fleming fills the gap left by former marketing director Allan Leighton's move last January to become Asda's retail director, overseeing store operations and the programme of store refurbishments or 'renewals'. He will be building on the work Leighton has done to reposition the UK's fourth largest grocer as a retailer providing the weekly shopping needs of 'ordinary working people and their families'. This has involved lowering prices, strengthening the Asda brand and reintroducing the 'Asda Price' slogan and advertising campaign. A graduate of Oxford and Insead, Fleming has previously worked for Storehouse, the UK clothing retailer, and US investment bank Morgan Stanley.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unidentified station observer commentary; from the "Good </F> Evening, China" program]    [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev has ended his  official visit to China. Our station observer has the following  comment on the outcome of his visit:    The talks and meetings held in Beijing, as well as documents  signed there, have shown that both sides have made important  strides in strengthening and deepening the Russian-Chinese  bilateral relations. They have formulated active measures  including common understanding on developing their partnership  in economic cooperation and trade, and have resolved important  border issues. Eventually, they have agreed to hold the second  Russian-Chinese summit in Moscow in 1994. In short, Russia's  foreign policy has been attaching -- previously and currently --  top priority to Russian-Chinese relations.    However, the impact of the Russian Foreign Minister's visit  to China was not limited to Russian-Chinese bilateral relations.  The Russian Foreign Ministry publicly reiterated that the  Russian Foreign Minister's visit to China has striven to further  strengthen peace and security throughout the whole Asia-Pacific  region. First, from Russia's viewpoint, the Asia-Pacific region  has become more and more important to Russia's future. Russia  has in the past, as now, regarded relations with members of the  Asia-Pacific region as multilateral. Therefore, Russia has  maintained sound relations with all countries of the  Asia-Pacific region. The same principle has been reflected in  Russia's treaties with China, India, and the Republic of Korea,  and in Russia's ties with the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea. Russia's relations with Japan, with members of the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and with other countries  of the Asia-Pacific region have all been established under the  same principle.    Kozyrev said: At present, the Asia-Pacific region faces the  least likelihood of large-scale conflicts since the end of the  World War II. However, the threat exists in the region whereby  new tense situations may occur, and existing tense situations  may worsen. An example in this regard is the resumption of  civil war in Cambodia. I believe that both Russia and China can  facilitate an end to the bloody conflicts in Cambodia.    Nowadays, other issues bothering the Asia-Pacific region  include the possibility of extracting and developing abundant  resources in the Pacific Ocean, including the extraction of  undersea oil and natural gas that have already been discovered,  and that have been termed as very massive. I should remind our  listeners: Some countries of the Asia-Pacific region have, for  a long time, failed to peacefully resolve territorial disputes  over some coral islands in the South China Sea. Many border  conflicts among countries of the Asia-Pacific region have yet to  be settled. Religious and national radicalism still have an  impact on the relations among countries in the region. In  summary, just as Kozyrev stressed during his visit in China: If  we do not promptly handle all these problems, we will face the  danger of a very powerful explosion.    The Asia-Pacific region has not been spared the threat of  proliferation of nuclear weapons and rocket technology. First,  the proliferation of nuclear weapons and rocket technology does  not suit the interests of Russia, China, and India. Therefore,  the unsettled nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is  particularly bothersome.    Russia proposed to establish, at different stages, a common  security system in Asia. Russia proposed establishing a  conflict- prevention center and a regional research organization  that studies related work.    Kozyrev's visit to China has demonstrated once again: While  pursuing its foreign policy, Russia does not intend to  facilitate a West-East confrontation, or to show favoritism to  either side. Only by adhering to a balanced foreign policy can  Russia safeguard its accomplishments in the international arena.</p>

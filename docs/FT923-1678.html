			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: MAI Despite moneybroking's reputation for producing poor quality earnings, MAI seems to do consistently well, as yesterday's preliminary results reaffirmed. With a particularly strong niche in the New York-based US Treasury bond market and operations in deposit and securities broking in London, MAI is as well placed as it is possible to be in such a footloose industry. Automation may cut margins in some more straightforward areas of broking, but governments' habit of issuing ever-increasing volumes of debt and the volatility of markets are all grist to MAI's turnover-driven mill. Even if the market still worries about profits from the main broking business, the company has good cash flow and a strong balance sheet. Diversification into television also adds another profits stream. Meridian, the new ITV franchisee for the south of England in which it holds a majority stake, should break even this year and enhance profits thereafter. Yet MAI is a people-based service business of the type which has been deeply unfashionable with investors in recent years. That alone may be enough to keep it on a rating below the market average.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, 12 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The second round of  talks between representatives of the Croatian authorities and  the Republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] in Croatia, which were to  have been held at Russia's diplomatic mission here today, have  been postponed. This has been disclosed by the Russian Embassy  in Zagreb, which added that the specific reasons for the  postponement would be given at a news conference to be held  today by representatives of Russia, the United States, and the  European Union -- the mediators in the conflict.    Local diplomatic circles link this postponement directly to  the recent NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions on  the outskirts of the city of Gorazde, which has led to a serious  deterioration in the situation throughout former Yugoslavia.    As we know, the first round of talks between the Croats and  representatives of Serb Krajina, in which Vitaliy Churkin, the  Russian president's special representative, played a direct  part, successfully culminated in the signing of a truce. The  truce came into force on 4 April and has been strictly observed  up to now. It had been expected that a number of important  questions consolidating peaceful coexistence between Krajina and  Croatia -- above all the restoration of trade and economic ties,  which have been more or less severed -- would be discussed  during the second round of talks.</p>

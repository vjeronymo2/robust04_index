			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Cash surge cuts deficit to Pounds 8.13bn A SURGE in money flowing into Britain arising from companies' overseas operations and from bank transactions has led to a large cut in the current-account deficit for the first nine months of this year. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that the current account deficit for the nine months was Pounds 8.13bn, against a previous estimate of Pounds 8.68bn. The revision results largely from new third-quarter figures for invisible trade, which covers services, interest payments and financial transfers. However, the CSO cautioned that the better-than-expected figures largely reflected special factors related to the depth of the UK recession and September's sterling devaluation. The figures could not be taken as a guide to underlying trends. On the basis of the new numbers, the UK had a surplus on invisible trade in the third quarter of Pounds 1.07bn, as against a previous projection of Pounds 300m. The UK traditionally has a surplus in this part of the current account. This normally partly compensates for a large deficit in visible items, comprising merchandise goods and oil. The new estimates are mainly due to a large surplus on net payments into Britain in the third quarter of interest, profits and dividends. At Pounds 1.73bn, this is the biggest surplus for such items since the CSO started records in 1963. The surplus partly reflects a large net flow into Britain in the third quarter of Pounds 2.16bn from earnings on company investments. In the second quarter, the corresponding flow of cash into the UK was only Pounds 1.6bn. The explanation for this figure was that the recession pushed down the amount of cash flowing out of Britain arising from non-UK companies' operations. Another factor was currency translations linked to sterling devaluation. The invisibles surplus also benefited from a reduction in the flow of cash out of Britain arising from profits on banking transactions. In the third quarter, this was Pounds 903m, as against Pounds 1.46bn in the second quarter. Less useful in helping the invisibles surplus was a reduction in cash earned on services. In the third quarter, the surplus on service activities was Pounds 842m, the lowest quarterly figure since late 1989. The overall impact of the upward revision in the invisibles figure for the third quarter was diluted by a new estimate for the invisibles surplus for the second quarter. The CSO now puts this at Pounds 100m, as against a previously estimated Pounds 336m.</p>

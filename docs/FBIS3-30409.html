At the airport of the war-ravaged  Sarajevo, the two prime ministers were greeted by the commander  of the United Nations Protection Forces, Lieutenant General  Michael (Rose). PTV correspondent Qamar Muhiuddin reports from  Sarajevo that the Bosnian leaders could not reach the airport to  receive the two leaders as the area around the airport is under  Serbian control. From the airport, the two prime ministers of  the Muslim world drove straight to the presidential palace where  Ms. Benazir Bhutto and Madam Tansu Ciller were welcomed by the  Bosnian prime minister Haris Silajdzic.    Later, the two prime ministers called on President Alija  Izetbegovic who briefed them on the situation in his country  subjected to wanton and dastardly Serbian aggression. The two  prime ministers expressed solidarity with President Alija  Izetbegovic and the people of the republic who have been victims  of genocidal aggression and ethnic cleansing. The Bosnian  president expressed gratitude on his behalf and on the people of  Bosnia for having demonstrated the unprecedented gesture of  solidarity with them in their hour of trial and tribulation.    Our correspondent understands that during the talks it was  agreed that the world community must take effective measures to  stop Serbian aggression and the United Nations resolution on  Bosnia must be implemented. The need for immediate lifting of  arms embargo was also emphasized. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto  also informed the Bosnian president that a contingent of the  Pakistan Army is ready to join the United Nations Protection  Force in the war-ravaged Bosnia-Herzegovina.    During their short stay, the two prime ministers also  visited  Kosevo Hospital in Sarajevo to sympathize with the victims of  Serbian aggression. During their hour-long visit, Ms. Benazir  Bhutto and Madam Tansu Ciller went round various wards of the  hospital. The two prime ministers were visibly moved to see the  innocent people which included old, young and children injured  and maimed in the holocaust unleashed by marauding Serbians.  Our correspondent says Kosevo Hospital has also been a target  of hand grenade attacks 193 times during the last 22 months. As  in other hospitals, supplies of medicines in this hospital have  become scarce and even water supply remains cut off because of  continuing siege of Sarajevo by Serbian forces.    Pakistan and Turkey have called upon the United Nations  Security Council to ensure implementation of all its resolutions  and lift the unjust embargo against Bosnia with a view to  ensuring a halt to the destruction of the republic. The call  was made in a joint declaration issued at the conclusion of the  most courageous and historic visit to Sarajevo by the prime  minister, Benazir Bhutto, and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller of  Turkey.    The two leaders said in the joint declaration that Bosnia  must not be forced to negotiate at gun point. We will resist any  imposed settlement which rewards the aggressor and legitimizes  the fruits of aggression. Ethnic cleansing cannot and should  not be the basis of statehood.    The joint declaration said it is shocking that this apalling  human tragedy is being enacted in the heart of a continent which  prides itself on its commitment to human rights and respect for  human dignity. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Madam Tansu  Ciller said it is unacceptable that in this era in which the  principles of the United Nations Charter are recognized as  having universal validity, a sovereign independent state is  being violently dismembered along racial lines and genocide  perpetrated against the peaceful and enlightened people. They  saluted the heroism of the people of Bosnia and supported their  just struggle for their national survival and said we fully  endorse their resolve to preserve the sovereignty, territorial  integrity and political independence of their motherland.    About the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the two leaders  said rarely in the annals of human history have a nation been  subjected to such merciless savagery in the full view of the  world. They called for an immediate and strict implementation of  a total cease-fire and cessation of hostility so that  negotiations can be resumed and huge relief operation ensured.    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Tansu Ciller said the  situation on Bosnia-Herzegovina is a universal tragedy. The  degradation of the human person as practiced in Bosnia is of  concern to the entire human race. We leave this beleaguered but  great city deeply outraged at the injustices being done to its  citizens, but in fullest admiration and solidarity for the  resolve to reject an unjust dispensation.    Earlier, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto arrived in Croatian  capital Zagreb today. She was received by Croatian Prime  Minister Nikica Valentic, the deputy prime minister and the  foreign minister and the UN special representative. The prime  minister was accompanied by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad  Ali, Interior Minister Major, retired, Nasiruddin Khan Babar and  the foreign secretary. Later, Ms. Benazir Bhutto had a meeting  with the prime minister of Turkey, Madam Tansu Ciller, who also  arrived in Zagreb to accompany her to Sarajevo. The Pakistani  and the Turkish prime ministers later renewed call to stop the  destruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Begin recording] [Bhutto] the prime minister of Turkey and  I  are both going to Sarajevo, less as prime ministers and more as  mothers, to focus the attention of the world on the plight of  the people of Bosnia and to give a renewed call for the end of  fighting. It is tragic to see that in the heart of Europe so  many of the principles upon which peace and stability in the  world are based are being violated. The UN Charter enshrines  the territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations. But here  the territorial integrity is being violated. It is very  important that the Croatians and the Bosnians also coordinate  closely together to permit redrawing of borders.    [Ciller] We should try to make sure that the approach of  Europe and the definition of Europe is defended, that the values  of Europe should be defended, and we should do that together and  there is no discrimination as to who does this. The value is  that we should be defending the multinational, the multiculture,  multireligion entity of living together. This is what Europe  has been all about. [end recording]</p>

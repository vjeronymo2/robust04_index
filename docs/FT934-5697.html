			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Airport train finally reaches Rome's centre More than three years after discovering that the city end of the rail link between Rome's Fiumicino airport and the 'city centre' was far from central, travellers will be pleased to learn that the service has finally penetrated Rome's heart. The link, built for the 1990 soccer world cup, was always a disappointment to budget-conscious tourists, as trains stopped about a mile short of the city centre at the suburban station of Ostiense. The obligatory taxi ride into town added L10,000-L15,000 to the rail ticket, now L7,000 (Pounds 2.80). That meant the journey was still only about one third the price of taking a taxi all 16 miles from Fiumicino, but added a great deal of inconvenience. Having to change from rail to taxi (or hike the 10 minutes to the nearest underground stop) meant Ostiense was a drag, particularly after the popular direct bus service from the airport to Rome's main Stazione Termini railway terminus was suspended soon after the new rail link opened. Ostiense also acquired an unfortunate early stigma after many taxi drivers either boycotted the new terminal or made fictitious claims about 'rail strikes' or 'problems on the line' to persuade passengers to continue all the way to the airport. Last Saturday everything changed. Now, 15 trains a day run non-stop between Fiumicino and Rome's Stazione Termini, in the heart of town. The new service, between 7am and 8.50pm, is costlier than its forerunner, at L12,000 one way. But the air conditioned and 1st class only coaches come as a godsend to those wanting to avoid venal taxi drivers or rush-hour traffic. Better still, Alitalia, Italy's state airline, has inaugurated four check-in and ticket desks alongside Stazione Termini's platform 22, from which the new service departs. Passengers with hand baggage only can check in on the spot before hopping on the train for the 30-minute ride. The only drawback with the new train is the frequency, only once an hour each way. Italy's state railways, which has already broken new ground with Alitalia by inaugurating new Florence-Fiumicino and Naples-Fiumicino services, claims a more frequent schedule is impossible owing to congestion. Meanwhile, the old rail link continues as before, though the modernistic steel and marble air terminal at Ostiense has been closed. Travellers can still use the Ostiense suburban station on the other side of the tracks for the airport train. However, as it now continues to other suburban stops before terminating at Tiburtina to the east, it may be more convenient to alight elsewhere.</p>

The Type III exits and adjacent seat rows are offset longitudinally such that persons approaching an exit from one end of the cabin may use the exit without interfering with those approaching the other exit from the other end of the cabin; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. The location and part number of each passenger seat must be defined by a drawing approved by the FAA or foreign civil airworthiness authority. The seat arrangement may not be reconfigured without FAA approval; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. An evacuation demonstration must be conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the aisle arrangement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The content of the special conditions was based, in part, on the maximum passenger capacity proposed by BAe. The specific limitation of 29 passenger seats was the maximum capacity requested by BAe, but the FAA considered that the fact that this capacity was well below the maximum that could be allowed for the installed exit combination was a significant factor in acceptance of the aisle arrangement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequent to issuing the Special Conditions 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 and prior to issuance of the Type Certificate for that project British Aerospace Public Limited Company changed its name to Jetstream Aircraft Limited and changed the model designation for the airplane from BAe Model 4100 to the Jetstream Model 4101. Type Certificate A41NM was issued to Jetstream Aircraft Limited on April 9, 1993 for the Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. It is now anticipated that additional models of the 4100 series may be added to this Type Certificate in the future. In addition to the Model 4101, Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 would be applicable to any other Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes that incorporate the same novel or unusual aisle configuration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Type Certification Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the provisions of &sect;21.101, Jetstream must show that 30 passenger Model 4100 series airplanes comply with the regulations in the type certification basis established for the 29 passenger Jetstream Model 4101 airplane.

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: BZ earns SFr132m from trust BZ TRUST, the fund management arm of Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank group in Zurich, has earned SFr132.7m (Dollars 94.4m) in fees for managing BK Vision, an investment company it formed two years ago, in the first eight months of 1993. BK Vision specialises in investing in Swiss financial shares and in the past few months Swiss banking shares have performed very well. The BZ Trust fee schedule provides for sharply increasing fees as the performance of the funds it manages improves. BK Vision bearer shares rose in the first eight months of 1993 by 43.1 per cent to SFr1,431. Its net asset value at the end of August was SFr1.4bn or SFr1,425 per bearer share. Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, president of BZ Trust, said there had been no criticism of the fees from shareholders. 'They are looking at the performance of the share,' he said. The BZ commission formula provides that fees are paid quarterly based on the rise in the BK Vision share price. If the price rises by less than 6 per cent (on an annualised basis), no commission is paid. If the rise is between 6 and 10 per cent, the fee is 20 per cent of the increase. Between 10 and 15 per cent, it is 25 per cent and thereafter it is 30 per cent. Critics say that it is no great achievement for a specialised fund to achieve large gains when its sector as a whole is doing well. It would be more appropriate, they argue, to relate the fees to the extent to which BK Vision shares outperformed the banking sector. Mr Schiltknecht rejected this criticism. 'Other people follow the same approach as we do,' he said. 'We informed investors in advance, and everyone who buys the shares knows what the structure is,' he said.</p>

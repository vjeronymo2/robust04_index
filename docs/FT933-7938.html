			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo back in demand DRUG shares moved smartly forward on a combination of technical factors and news from the US. Glaxo was the best performer, gaining 36 1/2 at 558p in hefty volume of 11m, the biggest daily turnover for six months. Initial strength came from the announcement that the US authorities had approved Zofran, the drug produced and marketed by Glaxo for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting. Drugs analysts said this wider use of the product - Zofran has been available for narrower usage since February 1991 - was welcome, but warned that cheaper post-operative drugs were available in the US. Technical issues were also at work. Dealers in New York said a strong rise in drugs stocks in the past two days on Wall Street was only just being reflected in London. Yesterday's rises on Wall Street were inspired by a speech by President Clinton on healthcare in which he made no reference to cutting drug prices - an issue which has dogged the sector for several months. In addition, Glaxo shares are considered to have lagged behind their rivals and there was some thought that they were looking cheap. Buying interest from the US prompted The Bank of New York to annnounce yesterday that BNY (Nominees), which holds stock on behalf of US investors, now holds 21.94 per cent in Glaxo. Among other drug stocks, SmithKline Beecham rose 16 to 448p and Wellcome 34 to 678p.</p>

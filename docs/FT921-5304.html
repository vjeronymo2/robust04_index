			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major reinforces April 9 election speculation THE prime minister last night reinforced expectations that the Conservatives would launch their campaign for an April 9 election with a tax cutting Budget next Tuesday, Philip Stephens writes. Despite renewed warnings from some on the right of his party of the need for a 'prudent' Budget package which would win the confidence of financial markets, Mr Major defended a sharp increase in public borrowing. In an interview in today's Glasgow Herald, the prime minister suggested that the Budget could act as the springboard for recovery by boosting the 'confidence' factor in the economy. He defended present levels of public borrowing as a 'cyclical' response to the recession recalling that the Labour party had cut taxes in 1978 despite a high borrowing requirement.</p>

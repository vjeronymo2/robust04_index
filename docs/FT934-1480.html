			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Europa poised to close merger After a five-month delay, terms for the proposed three-way merger of Europa Minerals, a small UK mining finance house, with Burmine and Austmin Gold, two Australian companies with which it is already closely involved, will soon be announced. Europa said the Australian Securities Commission has now given approval in principle for its merger with Burmine. When the ASC formally documents its approval, probably next week, 'implementation of the merger can go ahead,' the UK company said. First news of the proposed merger was given in July, and in October Europa said terms would be announced that month. In the meantime, another Australian gold producer, Mt Edon, has also bid for Burmine in which it has built a 22.6 per cent stake. Mt Edon also owns 19.9 per cent of Europa and made an informal approach to the UK group, but was rebuffed. The contest is made even more complex by the fact that Europa already owns 38.5 per cent of Burmine and Austmin holds 19.8 per cent of Europa. Henry Ansbacher, the UK merchant bank, owns 12.8 per cent of Europa following a poorly-received rights issue of shares that it underwrote last year.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Stock Baskets OKd: The Securities and Exchange Commission approved plans by the  New York Stock Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange to begin trading  "stock baskets." The NYSE product, called the Exchange Stock Portfolio, will  allow institutional investors, but not individuals, to trade $5-million blocks  of stocks reflecting Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index. The Chicago  product, also limited to institutional investors, will permit trading in  $1.6-million baskets based on the S&amp;P 100 index and $1.73-million baskets  based on the S&amp;P 500 index. The products were recommended in the wake of  the October, 1987, stock market crash as a means of reducing volatility in the  markets.  </P></p>

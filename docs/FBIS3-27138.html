"China welcomes the relaxation, to some extent, of the  situation in Sarajevo," a foreign ministry spokesman said.    A NATO ultimatum set for 0000 GMT Monday requiring Bosnian  Muslim and Serb forces to withdraw heavy weapons from around  Sarajevo or face air strikes expired, with UN officials saying  no immediate military action would be taken.    China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has  repeatedly opposed the use of force in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  calling for a resolution of the situation through peaceful  negotiation.    "We welcome all efforts by the international community that  are conducive to relaxing the present tense situation in Bosnia  and creating a favourable atmosphere for peaceful negotiations  there," the spokesman said. "We hope that the parties concerned  will make continued efforts to promote this process," he added.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Mother won't open account My elderly mother has never had a bank account and insists she does not want one, so I have cashed cheques for her through my own bank account. But with the increase in 'account payee only' cheques, this is becoming increasingly difficult. I have heard there are agencies which cash cheques for individuals for a small percentage fee. Would this be an option? The recent legislation reforming cheque law is aimed at narrowing the possibility of cheque fraud. Thus, 'account payee only' cheques are omni-present and your mother will have no alternative but to open an account. But this is not intimidating and any one of the clearers should be able to help.

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL  </P> <P> Marketing Program: On a more down-to-earth note, Catalina Marketing Group in  Anaheim has announced Tuesday that it has signed the nation's fifth-largest  supermarket chain to participate in the company's unique direct-marketing  program.  </P> <P> Winn-Dixie, which has 1,223 stores, is a pretty big deal in the South, even if  few people know of it around here. It joins other major chains, including  Ralphs and Lucky supermarkets, in participating in the program.  </P> <P> Catalina's "Checkout Coupon" system uses information about consumer purchases  gleaned from computerized scanners at checkout counters to provide customers  with coupons that they will probably want or use. Catalina will keep track of  the purchases of 30 million households.  </P></p>

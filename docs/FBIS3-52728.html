			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A confrontation has developed in the last few  minutes between settlers, who had blocked the Qalqilyah-Nabulus  road near the Tzofim settlement, and IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  soldiers. Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that members of  the security forces have started forcibly removing Tzofim  settlers who are sitting in the road, blocking it to protest  what they term the deteriorating state of security in the area.    Our correspondent adds that several settlers have been  detained, and the IDF is now proceeding with an evacuation. A  traffic jam has been created by the fracas. The IDF has  declared the site a closed military zone.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: REMEMBERING BY WENDELL BERRY (NORTH POINT PRESS: $7.95)  </P> <P> A poetic novel of despair, hope and the redemptive power of the soil. The loss  of his right hand in an accident embitters Andy Catlett, a journalist who  covers agricultural issues.  </P> <P> As he mourns his missing hand, Catlett discovers healing strength in memories  of his farmer ancestors and their ties to the earth, and in the example of a  modest Amish farmer who is content with his small farm and honest labor.  Wendell Berry contrasts modern American agribusiness -- which he depicts as an  artificial conglomeration of sterile flow charts, debts and mechanization --  with the older ideal of farming as a nurturing way of life. Like the wise Turk  in "Candide," Berry maintains that working the land "keeps away the three great  evils: boredom, vice and need," and he frames his arguements in a seductively  evocative, almost misty prose.  </P></p>

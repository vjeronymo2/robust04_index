			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS DEAL SETBACK TO BID FOR  CITYHOOD  </P> <P> The county Board of Supervisors on Thursday handed Malibu cityhood supporters a  temporary setback, putting off until Nov. 21 the setting of an election to  determine whether the seaside community will become an incorporated city.  </P> <P> At the urging of lawyers for the county, the supervisors postponed setting a  date for the election until next month, after the California Coastal Commission  considers whether to approve a revised sewer plan for Malibu.  </P> <P> The commission in September rejected the county's $43-million sewer plan for  Malibu -- which many cityhood supporters opposed -- as "oversized." It is to  consider approval of a revised plan during several days of hearings that begin  Nov. 14.  </P></p>

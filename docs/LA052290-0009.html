			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON;  </P> <P> SMOKE AND ASTHMA  </P> <P> Question: My brother-in-law smokes even though his children (my niece and  nephew) have asthma.  </P> <P> He says that once a child has asthma, it doesn't make any difference if anyone  in the house smokes. I told him he's a jerk, and I'd like your opinion.  </P> <P> Answer: I don't know whether your brother-in-law is a jerk, but I can tell you  that passive cigarette smoke has an adverse effect on asthmatic symptoms. There  are many reasons for people not to smoke. Having a child or children with  asthma should be at the top of the list.  </P></p>

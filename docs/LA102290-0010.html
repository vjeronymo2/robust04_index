			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAIN AS THE NOSE ON YOUR FACE  </P> <P> "Are you from the Middle East?" the woman inquired, her voice thick with  accent. She seemed hellbent on conversation during my quiet bus ride home. I  scrutinized her alert eyes and deeply lined face, trying to discern whether she  was merely curious or spoiling for a fight.  </P> <P> When I said I was born in Wisconsin, she became impatient. "But your  grandparents; where were they from?" When she discovered that her guess was  reasonably accurate, she sat back, relieved. "I knew it!" she announced  proudly. "I'm an anthropologist."  </P> <P> Then she added the six little words that struck fear in my heart. "I could tell  by your nose," she said.  </P> <P> Under other circumstances I might have pondered why strangers feel compelled to  comment on such things. Or I might have wondered how reliable an ethnic  indicator one's nose is. But there wasn't time. She hurtled into an impassioned  (and remarkably loud) speech about the beauty of "unusual" noses -- how mine  had so much character, how it wasn't like everyone else's, how nose jobs were  despicable. By now every passenger in the front half of the bus was studying my  nose and assessing its character.  </P> <P> This woman's sister had urged her to get her nose fixed, and she was still  fuming. "This is America!" she shouted. "What is this infatuation with noses  that all look alike? You have such a gorgeous nose -- you'd never think of  getting a nose job, would you?"  </P> <P> I felt a sharp pain. My neighbor faded away and there I was, standing by my  high school locker, listening uncomprehendingly as a "good friend" was telling  me how another "friend" secretly hated me because of my excessively curly hair  and my big, ugly nose.  </P> <P> Yes, I did think about having a nose job. In fact, I almost got one. I remember  so clearly planning to have that operation -- what had intervened? Perhaps my  features had evened out. Maybe the issue had receded at college, where  intellectual rather than facial aesthetics were stressed and where distinctive  ethnic schnozzes far outnumbered WASPish, regular features.  </P> <P> Regular features -- what, after all, did that mean? Western literature is  replete with heroes and heroines sporting fine, elegant noses. Elegant, I  understood, meant small, noble, straight. Everyone calls it a "nice" nose.  </P> <P> Those of us who passed through the birth canal without first packing the  requisite designer genes found ourselves less fashionably attired. Our noses  wore frumpy labels like pug or prominent, hawk or hook, flat or broad, bumpy or  ski jump. "Elegant" meant first-class travel; the others were pay-as-you-go.  </P> <P> I'd never begrudge anyone the option of resculpting a nose to alleviate  anguish. But by buying into the American penchant for "nice" and "normal"  (read, familiar and upper-class European) as opposed to "distinctive" and  "ethnic" (less familiar, hence frightening or declasse), we help perpetuate the  absurd notion that "regular features" exist in the first place.  </P> <P> "Regular" in our multicultural nation comprises whatever our ancestral lineage  has bestowed upon each of us. It's a fact as plain as that lovely appendage  they call the nose on your face.  </P></p>

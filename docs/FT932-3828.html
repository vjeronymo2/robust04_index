			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (16): Gap between negotiators remains wide - Andrew Gowers and Michael Holman travel from Sebokeng to Tuynhuys to discover where the real power will lie 'SETTLER] Settler]' The group of youngsters chants derisively as our car passes them before drawing up outside Sebokeng's delapidated post office. Thabo Mothopeng, local chairman of the ANC Youth League, welcomes us with a grin: 'Have you come to look for disillusioned youth?' The sprawling black township 25 miles from Johannesburg is in the front line of the struggle for change in South Africa. If Nelson Mandela cannot carry his young urban constituents along with him in his pursuit of power, any settlement he signs will be a fragile affair. So far at least, the ANC leader's pragmatism is supported by Mothopeng and his colleagues. Their slogan for 1993 - 'the year of no nonsense' - reflects sound civic sense: they support the negotiations, and look forward to a new government that will tar Sebokeng's dusty, potholed roads, introduce electricity, build clinics and schools, and crack down on crime. 'This is a nice location, really,' says one 'comrade' wistfully, surveying the rows of box-like houses, the regimented effect softened by the occasional tidy lawn. The ANC has divided Sebokeng into blocks and given them revolutionary names. We start in Namibia and drive through Libya and Palestine. Stopping in Angola, we gather with Youth League members in the local bar-cum-nightclub. All agree that a government of national unity is a good thing - provided the ANC is in charge. 'The party which wins chooses the other parties,' asserts one. Would the cabinet include non-ANC ministers? Certainly room should be found for Pik Botha, South Africa's long-serving foreign minister: 'His experience is needed.' Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi? Heads shake in disapproval. FW de Klerk? Mothopeng grimaces. Twenty-four hours later and 1,000 miles away in his Tuynhuys residence in Cape Town, President de Klerk provides a very different interpretation of a coalition government. He envisages an inner cabinet of the main party leaders who take decisions on 'fundamental issues' by consensus. 'We believe that all major parties must play a fundamental role,' he says. 'I have no doubt that my party will be one of those.' The gulf between Sebokeng and Tuynhuys is the essence of South Africa's political crisis. Time and again, during two weeks of interviews around the country, the conversation returned to this critical difference on the meaning of power-sharing between black and white. Roelf Meyer is one of the men charged with bridging it. A quietly-spoken, courteous young Afrikaner, he is the chief government negotiator in the multi-party talks at Johannesburg's World Trade Centre. But in spite of his close personal rapport with his ANC opposite number, Cyril Ramaphosa, he is constrained by his constituency. Meyer stresses that a coalition or government of national unity is not a matter of 'co-opting parties, but real power sharing.' What does this mean in practice? 'This has still to be thrashed out between Mandela and de Klerk. So far they have not addressed the details.' Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary-general, puts it quite differently: 'In a government of national unity naturally an inner cabinet will evolve, where deadlocks will be resolved.' But this does not mean he accepts de Klerk's call for a formalised consensus: 'They haven't given up a white veto. But they can never have it.' Lest there is any doubt about the pressures Ramaphosa himself is under within the ANC, Tokyo Sexwale, a regional chairman and one of its more populist voices, provides a timely reminder. 'We've reached a situation where the ANC doesn't have to call for action any more. These days the ANC is beginning to run behind the people. It is a very explosive situation.' Such warnings have their uses. No one in the ANC alliance has proved more adept in turning them to negotiating advantage than Joe Slovo. Once the leading bete noire of white South Africa, Communist leader Slovo now commands a sneaking respect among his conference table adversaries, and judges them shrewdly. 'There is a feeling of urgency about talks that wasn't there a year ago,' he insists. The economy is in trouble, the government's alliance with Inkatha has broken up, the National Party is divided: 'They need a settlement. It's a question of survival - they have nowhere else to run to.' In the pressure to produce quick results, however, lies danger, as independent observers of the talks anxiously underline. John Kane-Berman, director of the Institute of Race Relations, cautions against rushing headlong into a flawed settlement: 'There's a lot of talking up of this process. I've always been worried about unrealistic deadlines' a reference to the proposed April 1994 election date. 'What worries me is that you will have bilateral deals between certain parties but the levels of violence in some areas of the country will make elections there meaningless. But having set a deadline you will steam ahead with elections and put the clamps on dissenters.' Frederick van Zyl Slabbert, former liberal MP and academic, concurs that the talks can give a false impression of progress: 'Every time they agree to put something aside and not talk about it becomes a breakthrough. It's a political farce. The ANC and the government are playing 'coup poker' - they scare the hell out of each other and then find common ground. I find it very difficult to see an elected national unity government in the next year - more likely is a hybrid civilian-military agreement to stabilise the situation with a self-appointed government of national unity endorsed by a phoney referendum.' But the most sombre assessment of all comes from a senior backroom member of the ruling National Party, a man who has been at the heart of white South Africa's move towards the negotiating table in the last decade: 'I have very serious doubts about an election in a year's time because of the problem of violence.' This man, who prefers to remain anonymous, sees a dangerous decline in white morale. 'The National Party has moved from holding a monopoly of power to sharing power. The problem is that power sharing is not happening. The ANC has to understand that we must retain whites in this country, not as a subjected people but as a people with a stake in the new dispensation. The only thing that stands between South Africa and the chaos that is the rest of Africa is for enough people with skill and experience to keep it going to stay around. They happen to be mostly white.' Second only to power sharing as a bone of contention is the issue of how, or whether, to accommodate Chief Buthelezi, the Zulu leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party. Chief Buthelezi wants his provincial stronghold of Natal to have its own assembly with a substantial degree of self-government, something the ANC resists. Joe Matthews, one of his key negotiators, believes the ANC is becoming more flexible on the issue: 'For the ANC power is now that close - the overwhelming imperative is to get into government. The details matter less.' What worries the IFP, however - and what could still prompt it to walk out of the talks - is the suspicion that the ANC and the government are pursuing a hidden agenda which will in the end leave Chief Buthelezi high and dry. It is a conspiracy theory shared by those on the extreme right and left of South Africa's political spectrum. 'Decisions are being made for our people without their participation. We are opposed to power-sharing because we don't know what it contains,' says Johnson Mlambo, deputy-chairman of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). Pieter Mulder, a leading Conservative Party MP, voices a similar sense of frustration. And as the process unfolds, he says, the anger on the right can only grow: 'The realities of the proposed solution are coming to the fore. Up until now it was just rhetoric. The myth is that the election will solve everything: you only have to look at Angola to see that violence is not necessarily ended by an election.' That, at least for some, is the grim reality that lies behind the optimism so frequently expressed at the conference centre in Johannesburg. For all their procedural progress, negotiators seem no closer to resolving the big question: where in the new South Africa will the real power lie? As long as Sebokeng and Tuynhuys offer such fundamentally different answers, a lasting settlement seems out of reach.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anthraquinone dyes and pigments is generated at 11 facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sludge generated from 9 of the 11 facilities, which represents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over 98% of the anthraquinone dye and pigment production volume,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is commingled with wastewater treatment sludge from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of azo pigments and/or dyes. Over 98% of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commingled sludge currently is managed in municipal landfills or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is disposed in on-site monofills. Small fractions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commingled sludge are managed under Subtitle C. Waste management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and waste volume information relevant to this discussion is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included at the present time due to business confidentiality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 11 facilities that generate this waste, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected samples from the three largest contributors to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream and from one small contributor. Several compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in anthraquinone dye or pigment operations were expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be present in the waste, based on facility production schedules,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and were not detected. In addition, analysis of these samples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not produce any other contaminants attributable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anthraquinone dye or pigment operations (refer to the Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document for this rulemaking located in the RCRA Docket for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section) for the methodology used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifying contaminants attributable to a process).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several compounds used in the manufacture of anthraquinone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dyes and pigments were dropped from the Agency's target analyte  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list for dye and pigment wastes, due to the absence of any health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects information and because of low usage rates ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compound was used at only 1 or 2 facilities). Examples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anthraquinone-related compounds dropped from the target analyte  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list for these reasons include: 1-chloroanthraquinone, 1,4-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, 1-amino-2-chloro-4-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydroxyanthraquinone, and 1-amino-4-bromo-2-anthraquinonesulfonic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, the Agency's analysis of wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment sludge samples collected from anthraquinone dye and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pigment operations did not produce any contaminants attributable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to anthraquinone dye or pigment operations. However, industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data submitted on 11 sludge samples confirmed the presence of two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> target analytes, 1-aminoanthraquinone, and leucoquinizarine, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average concentrations of 1.5, and 1.4 ppm, respectively. Each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the two analytes was detected in three of the 11 samples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency did not find HBLs for either of the two compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detected in this wastestream, 1-aminoanthraquinone and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leucoquinizarine. In addition, the Agency was not able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify any appropriate surrogate compounds to represent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity of these compounds. If one or both of these compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are potential carcinogens and behave in a similar manner to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential carcinogen, 1-amino-2-methyl-anthraquinone, then the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk posed by the presence of the compounds in the waste would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to be examined further. The Agency is concerned about using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this limited surrogate information as a basis for listing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste as hazardous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, the Agency is proposing to defer a listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination for wastewater treatment sludge from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture of anthraquinone dyes and pigments at this time, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is requesting data on the toxicity of 1-aminoanthraquinone and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leucoquinizarine or information on suitable surrogates for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds. EPA also would be interested in submission of further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterization data. EPA will evaluate carefully all public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments and information received in response to this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on comments or data received, the Agency, rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deferring, may choose to promulgate a final determination to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either list or not to list this waste as hazardous under RCRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Wastewaters from the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing not to list wastewaters from the production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of anthraquinone dyes and pigments as hazardous. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream is not considered to pose significant risks to human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and the environment, based on the analysis of samples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the waste. Several compounds used in the manufacture of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anthraquinone dyes and pigments were expected to be present in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the waste but were not detected. Only one compound attributable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to anthraquinone processes, 3-aminoacetanilide, was detected in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the waste, at low concentrations. Health effects information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this constituent does not currently exist, and risk estimates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted using methylenephenylenediamine as a surrogate indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no significant risks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

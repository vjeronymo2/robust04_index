			<p>BFN     [Text] On Saturday Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy  Radetskyy told newsmen in Kiev that security for Ukraine spelled  overall security. Radetskyy summed up results of an official  visit by a delegation of Ukrainian military to NATO's  headquarters in Brussels.    According to Radetskyy, the participants in the Brussels  meeting appreciated the Ukrainian stand on efforts to build a  new system of security in Europe and approved principles on  which Ukraine was to build its armed forces.    Everyone he met, Radetskyy said, supported, in no uncertain  terms, the Ukrainian leaders who sought to preserve the  territorial integrity of their country and insure the  inviolability of the Ukrainian frontiers.    Radetskyy assigned priority to moves "to bridge the  artificially-created gap between Ukraine and Europe and return  Ukraine into the family of advanced European nations".    As a constituent part of Europe, Ukraine based its moves in  the field of military politics on the principles of multilateral  cooperation, Radetskyy said.</p>

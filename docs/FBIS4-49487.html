			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, may 4 (XINHUA) -- More than 100 young  people from all walks of life gathered at a seminar here this  afternoon to mark the 75th anniversary of the May 4th Movement.    The May 4th Movement in 1919 was an anti-imperialist,  anti-feudal political and cultural movement. After the founding  of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the day was  established as the youth day in China.    A guest speaker at the seminar sponsored by the Hong Kong  United Youth Association Limited (HKUYA), Zhang Junsheng, deputy  director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch, urged the Hong  Kong youth carry on the May 4th spirit and make more  contributions to the realization of Hong Kong's smooth transfer  of power in 1997 and prosperity of the motherland.    Zhang described the young people as "the masters of the next  century" and hoped that they help maintain prosperity and  stability in Hong Kong and facilitate China's reform and opening  to the outside world.    Speaking at the senior [as received], Peter M.K. Wong,  chairman of the HKUYA, said the Hong Kong young people are the  masters of future Hong Kong. "It is of great significance for  Hong Kong youth to review the May 4th Movement and carry on the  May 4th tradition in the runup to 1997," he said. Giving  lectures on the May 4th Movement and its significance at the  seminar were Chow Kai-wing, senior lecturer of Department of  History of the Hong Kong Baptist College, Ng Hong Mun, deputy to  the Chinese National People's Congress, and legislator Li  Ka-cheung.</p>

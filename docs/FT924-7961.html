			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Manufacturers to bear brunt  -Defence DEFENCE spending will fall by 10 1/2 per cent in real terms over the next three years, more than twice as much as set out in the summer's defence White Paper. The cuts are as deep as many in the defence industry had feared, and are likely to lead to the postponement or cancellation of contracts. The alternative of lower current spending has been all but ruled out, because staff cuts are still being implemented as a result of the 1990 Options for Change defence review. The changes outlined by the Ministry of Defence will cut about Pounds 1bn a year from the level of spending proposed in the defence white paper in July. The MoD said technical changes in the treatment of pensions reduced the cuts to about Pounds 500m. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence minister, gave few clues as to where the cuts would fall. 'The best means of making these savings will be identified during the normal recosting of the defence programme which is already under way,' he said, adding that some savings would be achieved through pay restraint. Nevertheless, the figures show that the brunt of the cuts will fall on manufacturers of military equipment which take the biggest slice of the defence budget at 37 per cent. The forward procurement programme is now worth 'over Pounds 8bn a year', said the MoD. This compares with the previous figure of Pounds 9bn. Several companies are vulnerable. British Aerospace is involved in the Pounds 700m mid-life upgrade for Tornado GR1 aircraft, while its Royal Ordnance offshoot had been hoping to build a new gun for an upgrade to Challenger 1 tanks, which the MoD said performed only 'adequately' in the Gulf war. BAe may also have to live without a contract for a medium-range surface-to-air missile to replace the retired Bloodhound. A decision on the Pounds 500m contract has been postponed several times and is now not expected until June 1993. GEC-Marconi could be affected. It is also bidding for the Bloodhound replacement contract and would be a leading contractor on the Tornado GR1 update. Another defence company, Vickers, is the lead contractor on the Challenger upgrade. The Trigat anti-tank missiles project worth Pounds 425m could also be abandoned. The production phase has already been cut from spending plans. The cuts take Britain a notch lower in the world rankings of defence spenders. Britain's defence outlay as a proportion of GDP will fall from 4 per cent to 3 1/4 per cent over three years, moving it below the level spent by France.</p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Personal View: Blueprint for better policing in the UK I never thought that I would come to miss the Takeover Panel, critical though I have sometimes been of it when we have crossed swords in the past. However, I rather wish the Police Federation was subject to the demand for accuracy the panel imposes. The federation's response to our report has been so long on emotion and so short on factual content that the shareholders (the public at large) must be confused. The report is the culmination of an inquiry into police responsibilities and rewards set up 12 months ago by the home secretary. The committee's other members included John Bullock, Professor Eric Caines, Professor Colin Campbell and Sir Paul Fox, each being appointed on the basis of their experience in managing large organisations both inside and outside the public sector. We fully recognised that our lack of professional experience of working with the police service made it vital that we should learn about the police at first hand, so we made 55 visits to 24 forces. We found that police constables felt badly managed and chief officers lacked the tools to manage them. What changes are we actually recommending to taxpayers' investment in the police? Our objectives were: to retain the best policing based on consent; to increase the number of officers doing real policing; to give chief officers the flexibility to manage; to enhance the empowerment of all ranks but require greater local accountability; and to recommend a radically different pay and rewards system to bring these objectives about. The two elements of the recommended pay and rewards system that have aroused the most criticism are the introduction of performance-related pay and the move to fixed-term appointments. It has been claimed that fixed-term appointments are inconsistent with the concept of the police service as a vocation and that they would make it impossible for an officer to have a 'job for life'. This is a curious argument. Anyone who really has a vocation can still make the police service a 'job for life' and, moreover, the service will reward their expertise and dedication, better than it does at present. Fixed-term appointments provide an opportunity for officers to review their careers, to consider their options both inside and outside the service and to leave with dignity and a fair compensation package, if that is the best course. In other professions, individuals of the highest calibre are not put off by the absence of a guaranteed 'job for life'. On the contrary, their motivation to provide the best service possible is directly related to the importance placed on the quality of its delivery. The only grounds for refusing to renew a fixed-term appointment are specified in our report: they are medical unfitness, gross misconduct, manifest incompetence or severance on structural grounds. Not even the most partisan police officer could disagree with the first three. And dismissal on 'structural grounds', though it may sound like a sinister catch-all provision for the aged and the unwanted, in fact has a highly specific meaning: it will occur only when there is either nothing for an officer to do, or when there is nothing which he or she is capable of doing. In reality, it is likely that very few police officers will have their career prospects abruptly terminated by the non-renewal of a fixed-term appointment. Performance-related pay is an equally contentious area and has been labelled as just about everything from divisive to impractical. The chorus of disapproval has tended to obscure the inquiry's recommendation that performance itself should only be one element in the matrix. Between them there are 12 points to be allocated in order to determine an officer's position on the basic pay scale. Only three points relate to performance, amounting to no more than 10-15 per cent of the basic pay an officer could receive. The service has already acknowledged that it could work with the other elements of the matrix - role scope; circumstances and experience and skills. Is it the case that the service is saying that it cannot cope with a system that incorporates this modest, but important, element to recognise individual performance? Officers in management positions already make complicated judgments about the relative skills of people under their command, and all officers are posted, and progress through the service, on the basis of just such judgments. The inquiry seeks to formalise this process, reward an officer's performance through pay and, via the appraisal system, ensure that officers are treated fairly and can comment on judgments that are made. To say this process, and the payments to be made, will destroy team spirit and cohesiveness of the service must be an exaggeration. At present, officers stand side by side in public order incidents but their pay differs because of their length of service, regardless of unsatisfactory, satisfactory or outstanding performance. The inquiry has never claimed that acceptance of its recommendations would lead to a reduction in crime but it has certainly suggested that a better led, better managed and more accountable police service could win greater public confidence. This, in turn, should lead to better co-operation from the public, which is the essential element in the fight against crime and which, sadly, is an ingredient which has been diminishing year by year. The author - who is head of BAT Industries - is chairman of the government-appointed Committee on Police Roles and Responsibilities.</p>

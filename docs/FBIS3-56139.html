Fate of  Council of Ministers' Bigwigs Will Be Decided Any Day Now"]    [Text] Having moved into a new building, the Russian  Government also received a new inner structure on 10 January:  Boris Yeltsin signed an edict "On the Structure of Federal  Organs of Executive Power." Under it, the number of ministers  has been cut to 23, and there will remain 44 state committees  and committees that are now given an equal status. The  reorganization boils down to scrapping a range of organs of  federal power, transforming (complete with name change)  individual ministries and agencies, and having the "outgoing"  turn over their functions to those remaining.    One may note an enhanced status, to that of a ministry, of  the State Committee on Economic Cooperation With Commonwealth  Member States and of the State Committee on Civil Defense,  Emergency Situations, and Recovery from Natural Disasters.  Notably, the Agriculture Ministry now incorporates the  Committee on the Food and Food Processing Industry, while the  Committee on Price Policy run by Lilya Rozenova, which  represented a "fifth column" inside the Economy Ministry, now  becomes completely subsumed in the ministry. Federal organs will  now delegate some functions to the provinces. An important  development is that the president takes over the control of  three ministries (Defense, Internal Affairs, and Foreign  Affairs) and of seven federal services.    The edict directs Victor Chernomyrdin to propose within one  week his candidates for two first and two "plain" deputies.  Whereas there has been no doubt in the press as to the future  status of Oleg Soskovets and Yegor Gaydar, there are varied  guesses as to who will be vice premiers. Invariably present in  all the combinations was Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who is personally  close to the premier and hails from the same part of the country.    Who will be the second? Under the president's edict the  functions of the agency for international cooperation and  development created by Aleksandr Shokhin have been transferred  to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, and this seems to  signal Shokhin's imminent discharge. Yuriy Yarov, who is  supposedly leaving to take an elevated position in the State  Duma, stands virtually no chance. Very significantly, the State  Committee for the Management of State Property in the new  structure does not amount to a ministry with Anatoliy Chubays  still remaining a "vice," having not received even the  consolation status of minister. As for Boris Fedorov, he is  very unlikely to agree to become finance minister in a  government whose vice premier will be Mr. Zaveryukha: too  divergent views on the economic policy could not make their  relations warm. But while Boris Fedorov is going to react  adequately to the lowering of his status, Anatoliy Chubays will  surely not slam the door. First, he has taken a strong liking  to what he is doing (and there is plenty to do); second, while  Gaydar remains in the government, Chubays will see possibilities  for a gamble against his opponents.    Who will be vice premiers? This is of no idle interest in  the present Russian situation. This is a fundamental question  of the direction of reforms. If he errs, Viktor Chernomyrdin  would not only emasculate the reforms, but would also weaken the  government's intellectual potential in the face of the  parliamentary opposition.</p>

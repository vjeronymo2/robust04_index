			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Straw urges grants review AN independent review of the local government grant system was urged yesterday by Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, as he condemned the present method of distributing council grants as 'bent and flawed'. The government has already conceded that standard spending assessments, the government estimates of what councils need to spend, need to be thoroughly reviewed, and the process has already started. Ministers admit privately that as the system of limiting local spending becomes increasingly dependent on SSAs, the present system might not be 'robust' enough to be a fair basis. Next month, Department of the Environment officials will begin talking to the local authority associations about the review, and the exercise will be completed by the autumn, in order to come into effect in the spring next year. But Mr Straw argued that there should be a wide review of SSAs, which should be independent of ministers and carried out by a team chosen after consultation with local authority associations and the Audit Commission, the local council spending watchdog. His comments came as the local government information unit, a research unit supported by councils and trade unions, published a report highlighting differences in the increases in grants among councils since the mid 1980s. The average council tax bill in England will be Pounds 447 per household, according to a survey for Public Finance and Accountancy magazine and Channel Four News based on council tax figures recommended or approved by 313 of 529 local authorities. The average bill for households in Scotland will be Pounds 407 and for Wales Pounds 258. The figures do not include transitional relief which will further reduce bills in areas facing steep increases.</p>

The revised licensing procedures proposed here envision processing only those applications filed by entities with acceptable DOT safety fitness ratings or, in the case of unrated or exempt applicants, those certifying their safety compliance. In a break with past practice, we will require each applicant to obtain the insurance certificate from the insurance company and file it along with the application form. While we believe this approach is beneficial, we will give individuals the opportunity to comment on whether it is feasible and whether it maintains the integrity of the insurance compliance system. Also, at the time of filing, all applications must be accompanied by process agent filings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Up front filing of insurance information and a list of process agents will allow the Commission to compress the time required to handle applications and confine the process to qualified applicants who are prepared to enter the trucking industry. Safety compliance can be verified easily by Commission staff before applications are processed. As an extra safeguard that applicants are making bona fide insurance filings, we will include the name of the insurance carrier in the ICC Register notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the basic licensing standards confirmed prior to processing and publication of an application, the remainder of the licensing process can be sharply reduced. By law, protests are limited to evidence that an applicant fails or will fail to meet the fitness entry standards. The proposed revised application form and regulations, therefore, also eliminate those features of the licensing process_such as extended protest periods and pre-licensing review of carrier control relationships_that would unreasonably prolong or not contribute to basic fitness assessments. The brief protest period will allow us to hear from insurance companies that question applicants' filings or others who may have information to supplement DOT's safety information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Almost 15 years of eased entry requirements under the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 have produced a licensing docket where each year less than a dozen of the approximately 17,000 applications filed are opposed. A brief protest period should suffice to identify the limited number of applications that deserve strict screening.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, common control information is not necessary in applying the TIRRA licensing standards. Commonly controlled carriers with ``Unsatisfactory'' safety fitness ratings are prioritized by DOT for continuing safety fitness oversight, and those transporting hazardous materials or passengers, in particular, either must achieve an improved safety fitness rating in a limited time period or be placed out of service by DOT. Those with insurance problems will be identified through our existing insurance monitoring program. Nevertheless, we are including an ``Affiliations'' question to be sure that carriers with poor safety compliance records do not attempt to reenter under a different name.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

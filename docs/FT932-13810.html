			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / The Balkan Conflict: Tighter sanctions unlikely to hasten war's end - As the UN prepares to tighten the noose around Serbia, Laura Silber assesses the growing impact on the republic's economy and the defiance of its political leaders MORE STRINGENT United Nations sanctions to tighten the noose around Serbia will accelerate the economic decline of the republic, but they are unlikely to bring a swift end to the war in Bosnia, according to analysts. Additional sanctions, due to come into effect on Monday, include the freezing of Serbian financial assets abroad, the stationing of monitors on board Danube river traffic, the banning of transshipments across the former Yugoslavia - reduced to Serbia and Montenegro - and the imposition of a maritime exclusion zone along the Adriatic coast. 'The sanctions contain some very serious provisions. If implemented they will really hurt the economy,' claims one Belgrade-based diplomat. Serbians economists agree that any new sanctions will accelerate the deterioration in the economy which, despite widespread sanctions-busting, has declined steadily from the combined impact of 10 months under the existing regime of UN sanctions, two years of war and the loss of trade with the former Yugoslav republics. But the international community has been disappointed that sanctions have done nothing to stop the war in Bosnia or to foster public opposition to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Official economic statistics are incomplete, but diplomats believe those that are available highlight the extent of the economic damage. The annual rate of inflation last year was almost 20,000 per cent, the highest in the world. Inflation last month rose by 225 per cent, and shops rarely display prices because they are changed at least once a day. Industrial production in March fell by 40 per cent compared with the same month last year. In 1989 Serbia accounted for about 30 per cent of the old Yugoslavia's gross national product of Dollars 77bn (Pounds 50bn). But the latest estimates suggest last year's GNP fell to about Dollars 12bn. The burden of supporting ethnic Serbs in neighbouring Bosnia and Croatia consumes about 20 per cent of GNP, according to economic analysts. The value of the dinar was devalued last week by 98 per cent, from the previous rate of one dollar to 750 dinars to 37,500. Two days later the dollar had jumped 20 per cent above the official rate on the lively black market. In spite of the grim picture, diplomats do not expect the economy to grind to a halt. 'It is very difficult to hermetically seal a country,' said one. But just how vulnerable has the Serbian economy proved to be to the current sanctions? The oil embargo, for example, has slashed road traffic. On the nearly deserted motorway running through Serbia peasants driving oxen are now a common sight. Petrol is officially rationed at five litres per car per month. But it is unavailable except at the black market price of DM3 (Pounds 1.26) per litre. Serbia was the breadbasket of the former Yugoslavia, and farmers suffer from a lack of diesel fuel and fertilisers derived from oil. But economists believe there will be no chronic shortages of food, as the spring planting has been completed. Loopholes have allowed Serbia to import oil via Serb-held areas in Bosnia and Croatia and through former Yugoslav republics. The Serbs have stockpiled an unknown quantity of fuel to supplement domestic oil production, which in 1991 amounted to 79,500 barrels a day, about 25 per cent of demand. Individual Serbs have been hit hard by the deteriorating economy. The average wage has plummeted to the black market equivalent of DM27 per month, while consumers face periodic shortages of staples such as sugar and flour. Many Serbs, however, have been cushioned by the very high interest rates available for hard currency savings deposits. Many pensioners in particular had made ends meet on their monthly interest payments. But the recent crash of one of the private banks offering such high rates stirred public protest, and the Serbian government is desperately shoring up Dafiment, the biggest private bank with several million such accounts. Other Serbians have actually profited from sanctions. Belgrade criminologists say as much as 10 per cent of the 9.8m Serbians have made money out of sanctions-busting. Ironically, sanctions have weakened opposition to Mr Milosevic, who has used them to whip up anti-western sentiments which have found fertile ground in the isolated political landscape of Serbia. 'Serbia will never bend to the will of the west,' promised Mr Milosevic, who has boasted of new oil discoveries. And there are no signs that war-weary Serbs are about to buckle. They grumble about the 'unjust' sanctions, but most of their ire is still targeted at the west. 'Serbs are not guilty. Sanctions should be imposed on the people who deserve them, the Slovenes, Croats and Moslems,' said a clerk waiting in vain to withdraw money from the Dafiment bank. The state-run media constantly bills Serbs as the victims of the war and says sanctions are a western plot to destroy Serbia. And the Serbian government has showed no sign of backing down to western pressure and threats of military intervention. Mr Zoran Lilic, parliamentary speaker, recently dismissed attempts to seal off Serbia. 'While we have food, the world cannot do anything to us,' he said.</p>

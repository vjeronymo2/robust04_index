			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sale sign erected over Cornerstone - Estate agency loss totals Pounds 226m since acquisition in 1987 ABBEY NATIONAL yesterday disclosed that it had lost a total of Pounds 226m on estate agency since it acquired its business in 1987. The company now intends to sell the Cornerstone residential estate agency, which has 355 branches. The loss comprises Pounds 88m in total operating losses over five years, and Pounds 126m in goodwill written off to reserves as well as a further Pounds 12m in restructuring costs in 1992. Sir Christopher Tugendhat, Abbey chairman, said that the company had bought the estate agency chain to protect its share of the mortgage lending market. But its agents referred no more business proportionately than intermediaries. 'The essential reason for buying it was to defend our flank. Since then, we have discovered that it does not have that strategic advantage,' said Sir Christopher. The goodwill write-off, which was taken as an exceptional item because Abbey is now complying with the FRS 3 reporting standard, leaves only Pounds 15m of goodwill in reserves. Some Pounds 141m of goodwill was taken into reserves on acquisition. Abbey's decision to dispose of its estate agency business, which made a trading loss of Pounds 20m (Pounds 19m) in 1992, contrasts with building societies which are holding on to lossmaking chains in the hope that they will return to profit. The Cornerstone residential estate agency business, which achieved a small increase in the number of houses sold, closed a further 59 branches as part of rationalisation, compared with 16 branch closures in 1991. Sir Christopher said it was 'always difficult to see the best of times or the worst of times to sell something'. But Abbey believed it was sensible to sell now amid signs of the housing market 'coming out of the doldrums'. Abbey currently gains Pounds 500m a year of mortgage business through the Cornerstone chain. However, Sir Christopher said that Abbey had found it was getting a similar flow of business through other estate agents that it did not own. A large number of building societies - as Abbey was in 1987 - started to acquire estate agency chains as a defensive measure because they believed that their share of mortgage lending was threatened by new lenders. Mr Peter Birch, Abbey chief executive, said that this fear proved to be illusory. 'If we went back to that time, we would probably do the same thing again. I hope that we would not do, but I think we probably would,' he said. Woolwich Building Society disclosed last week that its Woolwich Property Services estate agency business, which has 257 offices and is the seventh largest corporate estate agent in Britain, incurred a trading loss of Pounds 11m during 1992. If Abbey is unable to dispose of the chain as a whole, it will sell branches in regional blocks. It believes it will be able to achieve a higher price than the Pounds 15m of goodwill remaining its its reserves after the write-off. Abbey's move is one of the largest attempted disposals of a corporate chain since Prudential disposed of or closed more than 500 of its branches during 1990. Abbey is advised on the sale by Kleinwort Benson. See Lex</p>

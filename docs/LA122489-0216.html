			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFENSE THROWS CONKLIN INTO LIMELIGHT;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: WASHINGTON'S QUARTERBACK COLLECTS SCHOOL RECORDS AND CONFIDENCE WITH  NEW ONE-BACK, QUICK-PASS ATTACK.  </P> <P> University of Washington quarterback Cary Conklin walked out to practice one  day last spring and tried to make sense of Coach Don James' new offense.  </P> <P> The one back, the quick pass, whatever the name, quickly became an enormous  pain for Conklin.  </P> <P> On the first day of spring practice, someone handed Conklin a new playbook,  pointed to a set of receivers he'd never seen before and said, "Now get to  work, son."  </P> <P> Actually, the offense is a quarterback's dream. Washington State had used it  successfully under Dennis Erickson before he took it to the University of Miami  this year.  </P> <P> The offense gives the quarterback as many as five receivers, including the  fullback, to choose from in short to medium range and, as Conklin soon learned,  is difficult to defend.  </P> <P> And James, unhappy after a 6-5 season in which the Huskies missed a bowl game  for the first time in nearly a decade, junked the I-formation offense in favor  of the wide open (read: exciting) one-back passing game.  </P> <P> James also fired offensive line coach Dan Dorazio and replaced him with Keith  Gilbertson, who added some flair to an offense that ranked seventh in the  Pacific-10 in 1988. Gilbertson, who was the head coach at Idaho for three  seasons, was among the first to develop the one-back offense.  </P> <P> Conklin couldn't have been happier, at least until it came time to work out.  </P> <P> A knee injury sidelined Andre Riley, the only veteran receiver.  </P> <P> "At the time, we didn't know if we were doing the smart thing (changing the  offense)," James said. "He was throwing to a lot of new faces."  </P> <P> After a lengthy period of adjustment, Conklin became comfortable with the  offense.  </P> <P> "Finally, we had to learn it because we had a game in a few days," Conklin  said.  </P> <P> A school-record 2,569 yards passing later, Conklin has finally mastered the  one-back offense, leading Washington to a 7-4 record and a spot in the Freedom  Bowl against Florida Saturday morning at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> His passing yardage broke Sonny Sixkiller's single-season school record of  2,303 set in 1970.  </P> <P> Sixkiller's record stood through almost 20 years of outstanding Washington  quarterbacks. Warren Moon couldn't break it, neither could Chris Chandler, Tom  Flick, Hugh Millen or Steve Pelluer.  </P> <P> "When we recruited (Conklin), he looked a lot like the rest of the kids we've  had success with," James said. "Moon, Flick . . . he's as good as any of them."  </P> <P> Conklin, 6-foot-4, 215 pounds from Yakima, Wash., is quick to credit the  Huskies' new offense for his record-breaking season.  </P> <P> "I think it's the offense of the '90s," Conklin said after practice Friday at  Golden West College. "They (defenses) don't know when you're going to throw the  quick game at them or go with the longer stuff. Usually we have four receivers  and one running back, but sometimes we have five receivers and no running back.  The whole idea is to mix it up with the run. It's a fun offense to watch."  </P> <P> And, to hear Conklin tell it, an exciting one to play.  </P> <P> "It's hard to stop," he said. "No one really stopped it all year. They only  time we were stopped is when we stopped ourselves."  </P> <P> Said James: "Any quarterback who's a thrower would like it. If he just had  another year with the offense . . . "  </P> <P> Indeed, Conklin is a fourth-year senior, which is rare in these days of  redshirt-mania.  </P> <P> James and Conklin agreed the quarterback would redshirt his sophomore season in  1987. But when Chandler was injured the week of the Arizona game, James had no  one else to turn to.  </P> <P> The game ended in a 21-21 tie with Conklin throwing two touchdowns. It was just  the confidence boost he needed.  </P> <P> "Ever since that game I knew I had the ability," Conklin said. "The last two  years I've been real successful and it goes back to that game. That game gave  me a lot of confidence."  </P> <P> Conklin remembers having mixed feelings before the game.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to ruin my redshirt year," he said. "But then again I was tired  of practicing. I wanted to get out there and show what I could do."  </P> <P> Chandler returned to the lineup quickly and Conklin was back on the bench. But  there was little question who the starter would be after Chandler graduated.  </P> <P> As a junior, Conklin passed for 1,883 yards.  </P> <P> But his senior season began under happier circumstances. In the opening game,  the Huskies upset 15th-ranked Texas A&amp;M as Conklin completed 23 of 37 for  224 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> The year has not been without pitfalls, however. Washington lost three  consecutive games before meeting Oregon in mid-October.  </P> <P> With the score tied at 14 in the third quarter, Washington had possession on  the Ducks' one-yard line. Conklin, trying to wriggle his way into the end zone  on an option, caught his foot in the artificial turf as he spun and pulled a  lower abdominal muscle.  </P> <P> Washington won, 20-14, but Conklin was hurting for the next month.  </P> <P> "I could barely walk," he said.  </P> <P> Conklin played anyway, leading Washington to four victories in the final five  games to gain a berth in the Freedom Bowl.  </P> <P> The highlights of Conklin's season was a 28-27 victory over UCLA. Still  bothered by the pulled muscle, he played poorly in the first quarter as the  Huskies trailed, 21-0, before rallying in the second half.  </P> <P> Trailing 27-21 with 3:12 remaining, Conklin led the Huskies to the winning  touchdown on a 78-yard, 10-play drive. He completed five of seven passes on the  drive, which ended on Greg Lewis' 10-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> "I just got in the huddle and said, 'Somebody's got to come up with some big  plays,' " Conklin said. "There was never any doubt in my mind we'd score."  </P> <P> That's just an example of Conklin's confidence, Riley says.  </P> <P> "It's the poise he has, the self-confidence in the pocket that makes him so  good," said Riley, Washington's leading receiver this season with 53 catches  for 1,039 yards.  </P> <P> Since that Arizona game his sophomore season, Conklin's confidence has never  wavered through offenses, old or new. It just took time to adjust to the new  one.  </P></p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Hang Seng Bank earnings rise 22% HANG Seng Bank, the listed subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, yesterday reported a 22 per cent rise in net profits to HKDollars 2.3bn (USDollars 298m) in the six months to June 30, from HKDollars 1.9bn a year earlier, and forecast a 67 per cent increase in dividends for the year. The bank said it had reviewed its dividend policy in light of its decision to report earnings on a fully-disclosed basis. Hongkong Bank, which owns 61.5 per cent of Hang Sang, moved to full disclosure when it bid for Midland Bank earlier this year. Mr Alexander Au, managing director and deputy chief executive, said in future the bank intended to pay around half of its net profits in dividends  -a third of which would be paid out at the interim stage. Previously it had paid out a half of its reported earnings. He said, however, the percentage increases in the pay-out this year were exceptional and one-off. The increases reflected the move to full disclosure and their scale would not be repeated in the coming years, he said. Hang Sang said it would pay an interim dividend of 65 cents a share, compared with 38 cents. It expected to pay not less than HKDollars 1.67 for the year - an increase in total 1992 dividends of 67 per cent over the 1991 payout. The bank said the Hong Kong economy had maintained its momentum in the first half, with the trade sector performing well and domestic demand buoyant. 'Against this background, the group's deposit and loan growth both recorded satisfactory progress during the first half.' Mr Au said the bank registered some slight growth in mortgage lending but there was evidence of a slowdown towards the end of the half year. He said the 'star' performer for the bank was trade finance. There had also been very brisk growth in exports, especially re-exports.</p>

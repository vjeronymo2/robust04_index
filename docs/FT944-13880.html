			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Vietnam enters tougher phase Vietnam's economic adjustment programme is entering a more demanding phase now that relatively easy price reforms have been accomplished, the World Bank said yesterday. Announcing the approval of a Dollars 150m (Pounds 94.9m), 40-year structural adjustment loan, its fourth to Vietnam since lending resumed last year, the bank said restructuring of state banks, privatisation of public companies and trade reform had still to be tackled. Vietnam should also provide a basic civil and commercial law code and simplify investment rules to facilitate business activity. The reform programme had produced 'impressive results', but 'some weaknesses are evident.' Weak infrastructure and an inefficient financial system hindered investment. International donors could provide finance for development, but the government would need effective institutions to take most advantage of development aid. The trade system should be reformed to abolish import permits and introduce a simplified tariff structure.</p>

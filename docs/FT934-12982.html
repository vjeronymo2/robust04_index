			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Markets: Pause for breath before surging on - Wall Street WALL Street paus-ed for breath this week, after a feverish up-ward run, but by yesterday it seemed to have recovered sufficient confidence to keep the bull market intact. The week has been dominated by the third quarter results season, which produced its usual share of nasty surprises and market jitters. Yet the main message of the results season so far appears to have been positive: the gradual recovery of the US economy is intact, with GDP expanding at around 3 per cent a year, and this has been reflected in the financial reports from some of the most cyclically sensitive sectors. Wall Street was particularly pleased on Thursday when Caterpillar, the heavy equipment company, and Cummins Engine, maker of diesel engines, reported better than expected results and brisk demand for their machines. Better results have also been reported by several of the leading US airlines, with both American Airlines, the largest US carrier, and Northwest Airlines announcing rare profits for the third quarter. The market has also took heart from the battle for Paramount Communications, the film and book company, where QVC Network, the television home shopping company, has made an an unsolicited Dollars 9.5bn takeover proposal, while cable company Viacom has made an agreed Dollars 7.6bn offer. Paramount, while proceeding with the Viacom deal, has been refusing to talk to QVC. On Thursday, QVC tried to force Paramount to the negotiating table by turning its bid from a mere proposal, for discussion with the Paramount board, into a firm offer to its shareholders - a tender offer for 51 per cent of the company's stock. This offer has the same value as its opening proposal - Dollars 80 for each Paramount share - but will be all in cash, rather than a mixture of cash and stock. Few investors seem likely to accept, since Wall Street is anticipating a long bidding war for Paramount. But the action could rapidly tease out a higher offer from Viacom and push Paramount's board to the negotiating table. The bid action and encouraging results helped the Dow Jones industrial average recover yesterday from its week-long weakness and at lunchtime it stood some 10 points above its all-time closing record of 3,652.1, reached on August 25. However, nervousness about long-term US interest rates could prevent it making much more ground in the near term. In spite of fears at the start of the week bank lending rates were not about to tumble, it seemed. However, with demand for loans remaining low and banks increasingly awash with capital, an erosion of lending margins still looks likely. JP Morgan sparked a minor rout by announcing that it was cutting its prime lending rate - the rate used by banks to determine loans mainly to smaller businesses and on consumer credit - from 6 per cent to 5.5 per cent. The news came out of the blue. And its surprise nature added to its shock value and prompted a 4 per cent drop in bank shares. Other big commercial banks spent the rest of the week playing down the significance of the Morgan move, while nervously looking to see who might be tempted next into a pre-emptive interest rate cut. In one sense they were right: Morgan, after all, has little business tied to the prime rate, and the move may be more in undermining competitors than in increasing its own lending business. Also, a lower prime may do little immediate damage to bank earnings. Citibank said a half point cut in its prime rate would cost it Dollars 100m a year in net interest revenue, although it would probably be offset by other factors (such as an increase in demand for loans.) Chemical, which reported third quarter earnings per share of Dollars 1.84 (up from 98 cents a share) said a prime cut would cost it only around 8 cents a share but it was not planning to cut, it added. Market willingness to mark down bank share prices so quickly, though, reflected the fact that lending margins will have to fall eventually. The big commercial banks last week reported further advances in their key tier one capital ratios (even Citibank passed the 6 per cent milestone, a level almost unthinkable just two years ago) prompting several to question at what level they would begin to look over-capitalised. Faced with the choice of dropping their credit standards to attract business or charging less for loans, most banks would prefer the latter. Bank share prices may have recouped some of their of their losses by the end of the week, but the day when all big banks are forced to drop their prime rates seemed a step closer.  --------------------------- Monday     3642.31  +  12.58 Tuesday    3635.32 -  06.99 Wednesday  3645.10  +  09.78 Thursday   3636.16 -  08.94 Friday     3649.30  +  13.14  ---------------------------</p>

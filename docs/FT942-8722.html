			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / 'Ties' between life insurers and banks to change Arrangements for 'ties' between life insurers and banks or building societies would have to change in order to remain worthwhile, Mr Bill Jack, general manager of General Accident Life, said yesterday. They had not sufficiently benefited customers in the past, he added. He argued that increasing competition meant that greater transparency should be introduced into tied arrangements, and existing cross-subsidies could end. Mr Jack said that the new regulatory regime - which would allow differential pricing - would increase the pressure for cost efficiency and highlight the attractions of very low-cost distribution methods such as telephone sales.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Big order saves IBM factory THE FUTURE of IBM Havant in Hampshire, one of four large European manufacturing plants threatened with closure earlier this year by the computer giant, looks secure for the foreseeable future, Alan Cane writes. Western Digital Corporation, a large US-based computer memory manufacturer, yesterday said it had placed a contract with Havant for the assembly, testing and packaging of its most popular personal computer disk drives. Mr Ken Wilkie, IBM Havant chief executive, said the deal secured Havant's future and the jobs of its 2,000 workforce. He believed, however, that Havant would have been safe even without the order. The plant was also building drives for IBM and special electronic circuitry for other manufacturers. Mr Charles Haggerty, Western Digital's chairman, president and chief executive, said the deal would provide the company with a European source of drives. The Havant contract is initially for 18 months and Western Digital envisages Havant producing 400,000 disc drives a year. The drives will go to customers throughout Europe. Last year the company's European subsidiary shipped about a million disk drives.</p>

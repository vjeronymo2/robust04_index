			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> D.C. MAYOR CHARGED ON 1 DRUG COUNT;  </P> <P> LAWYER SAYS BARRY WILL PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO MISDEMEANOR  </P> <P> Mayor Marion Barry, who has repeatedly denied using narcotics, was charged  today on one count of possessing highly addictive "crack" cocaine in a episode  filmed by undercover police.  </P> <P> The flamboyant Barry, one of the best-known and most controversial black  politicians in America, was charged in a federal court after his arrest  Thursday night in a police "sting" that used a female acquaintance as bait and  a hidden camera to record evidence.  </P> <P> Barry, 53, led into court past a crowd of reporters and chanting supporters,  entered no plea during the brief proceeding in which he was charged only with a  misdemeanor and not a felony, which carries much heavier penalties.  </P> <P> The judge said the misdemeanor crack cocaine charge, based apparently on the  amount of the drug involved, would carry a maximum possible penalty of one year  in prison and a $1,000 fine.  </P> <P> Barry was released without having to post bail pending a hearing scheduled for  Feb. 5 to set a possible trial date. As a condition for his bail, officials  said he will have to take weekly drug tests beginning Monday.  </P> <P> During the brief appearance before U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson, Barry  waived his right to a preliminary hearing, but his attorney said he will insist  on a jury trial and will eventually plead not guilty.  </P> <P> Among the evidence presented at the hearing was an FBI statement that Barry had  tested positive for cocaine use in both blood and urine tests taken after the  arrest.  </P> <P> Barry has governed Washington for more than a decade as the powerful leader of  its majority black community -- a man seemingly impervious to controversy that  might have felled other men -- and had planned to announce this Sunday that he  would run for a fourth term. His staff said that announcement has been placed  on indefinite hold.  </P> <P> He was arrested Thursday night in a hotel about six blocks from the White House  in a room rented by FBI agents and, according to an FBI affidavit filed in  court, bought crack cocaine there from a female acquaintance while a hidden  camera clicked away.  </P> <P> The mayor appeared calm although grim as he made his way out of the U.S.  District Courthouse through a pressing crowd of reporters. He did pause long  enough to deliver one of his patented cool dismissals of the latest controversy  clouding his future.  </P> <P> He said he could not comment in substance on the case because it is still  before the court, but added:  </P> <P> "I am going to leave here and go about the business of government."  </P></p>

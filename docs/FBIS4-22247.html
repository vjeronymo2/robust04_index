			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yakov Nikolayev: "`Chechen Party': A Game at Two </F> Tables"]    [Text] Two groups of high-ranking Moscow politicians,  separately and independently of each other, are conducting  confidential negotiations with two feuding Chechen groups. The  aim of the negotiations is the return of Chechnya to the bosom  of the Federation.    The Ministry of the Russian Federation on Nationality  Affairs, headed by Sergey Shakhray and joined by the leadership  of the Federation Council (first fiddle in this group is played  by Deputy Speaker Ramazan Abdulatipov, first deputy in the  recent past and a person who is generally close to Shakhray), is  building bridges with the Chechen irreconcilable opposition,  which promises Moscow numerous concessions but which cannot make  them at present, because it does not now have the power. At the  same time, the administration of the president of Russia, headed  by Sergey Filatov, is trying to fix relations with Dzhokhar  Dudayev, the head of the Chechen Republic, who in words does not  intend to give up sovereignty, but who is really prepared to  accept certain sacrifices.    The "dual diplomacy" in the relationship with the prodigal  component of the Federation is explained, evidently, by the fact  that Moscow does not understand very well "who is who" in  Groznyy. Filatov and his subordinates emphasize that their  partners can only be representatives of the official authorities  of Chechnya, and they transparently hint at an alleged planned  meeting of the two presidents (a success about which Dudayev can  only dream at present). Shakhray, in turn, is cautiously  insisting that it is impossible to come to an agreement with  Dudayev, and that it is necessary to rely on "other  sociopolitical forces in the republic," which, incidentally, are  thinking of and preparing for a violent overthrow of the Chechen  president.    In addition, third persons are also wedging their way into  the negotiating process. Thus, Viktor Chernomyrdin recently,  without consulting anyone and without going into an analysis of  the Russian-Chechen mess, received the Deputy Prime Minister  Mugodayev of the Dudayev government (with whom our prime  minister, according to information of the Chechen opposition,  was personally acquainted when Mugodayev was chief of  Groztrubprovodstroy) and settled certain problems of the Groznyy  oil refinery plant and of a number of other local enterprises.  It is possible that the fate of budgetary money earmarked at one  time for Chechnya was decided in the course of this rendezvous.  As was disclosed by an OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist from reliable  sources in the government, a year ago Shakhray, being the deputy  prime minister at that time, did everything so that this money  did not fall into Dudayev's hands. Today, Sergey Mikhaylovich,  reduced to the rank of minister, cannot control budgetary  expenditures. A competent source expressed the supposition that  Mugodayev, with the blessing of Chernomyrdin, took at least a  part of the billions held up in Moscow with him to Groznyy.    In the meantime, the Chechen oppositionists, who have  penetrated the Russian corridors of power, were also counting on  this sum. An OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist found out about this  directly from the leaders of the Provisional Soviet opposed to  Dudayev. (Officials in the White House refuse to give any kind  of specific information about the negotiations with Chechnya.)    Leaders of the opposition arrived in the Russian capital  with  a draft agreement with the Government of the Russian Federation.  They are asking to be helped materially (for which a "Chechen"  line in the budget could be suitable) and to recognize them as  the legal authority in Chechnya. On their part, they pledge  themselves to overthrow the present regime, to organize  parliamentary elections, and to transform the republic into a  valuable component of the Federation. According to the words of  the Groznyy insurgents, Shakhray and Abdulatipov "met their  proposals with understanding." Chairman of the Federation  Council Vladimir Shumeyko, responding to a question of an  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist, declared that "it is necessary to  wait and see who is more ready for negotiations--Dudayev or the  Provisional Soviet."    But in seeking the laurels of peaceful victors in rebellious  Chechnya, the Shakhray-Abdulatipov group is being hindered by  the "competing firm" of Filatov. As has been reported, at the  beginning of March, Filatov, while in Nalchik, met with a  representative of the Chechen authorities. This was an official  from the department of Dudayev's state secretary, Aslanbek  Akbulatov, whose name the Kremlin sources did not want to  mention, and the Chechen oppositionists could not recall, but it  is clear that the rank of this "emissary" did not in any way  equate to the level of his interlocutor. However, Dudayev is  prepared in the future to detail Akbulatov himself--formally the  third person in the republic, and not too influential in  internal affairs--to the negotiations with a Russian emissary.    The concepts of the sides on the subject of future dialogues  still differ significantly. The Kremlin intends to sign a treaty  with Groznyy on the division of powers and subjects of  jurisdiction similar to the Russian-Tatar treaty. Dudayev issued  instructions to conduct negotiations only "about improving  relations with Russia." However, informed persons in Groznyy  think that the general is ready for concessions on the condition  of keeping his post and the share of profits that the export of  petroleum products will bring to the republic. These profits, in  the words of those same informants, constitute the basis of the  prosperity of the Groznyy establishment, and it is precisely  about the size of the export quotas that Mugodayev was haggling  with Chernomyrdin.    Considering that Dudayev has lost control over a significant  part of the territory, and that the opposition is arming itself  intensely, the Groznyy leader really can become a very tractable  partner. Of course, in this case, he certainly will run into the  accusation of betraying the cause of national independence, but  here it is already necessary to make a choice: either power or  reputation.    On the whole, the Chechen situation is reminiscent of the  finale of the "Gamsakhurdia epoch" in Georgia. Of course, the  local opposition lacks its own Shevardnadze. Doku Zavgayev, the  former first secretary of the oblast party committee and  chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Checheno-Ingushetia, has  retired and does not wish to involve himself in anything. Ruslan  Khasbulatov, who was released from prison under the amnesty,  could satisfy the insurgents as a person who enjoys popularity  in the republic, but the former speaker categorically is not  suitable for negotiations not only with Yeltsin, but also  Chernomyrdin, and even with Shakhray. The head of the so-called  alternative "government of national trust," billionaire Yaragi  Mamodayev, who did not share last year's income from exports  with Dudayev and who emigrated to Moscow, does not have  authority among the opposition, and his whole government  consists of himself alone. Salambek Khadzhiyev, the former  minister of the USSR oil industry, is more fit than others for  the role of future national leader, but he also is not in a  hurry to join in the implementation of the "revolutionary" plans  of his countrymen, and he is taking a wait-and-see position.    Moscow could more successfully play on the confrontation of  Dudayev and the opposition, pushing the leader to concessions  and simultaneously encouraging the activeness of his opponents.  But this is being hindered by the misalignment in the actions of  Russian authorities and the rivalry between the high-ranking  "negotiators" who do not trust one another. Such a situation  pleases Dudayev most of all: He keeps political and economic  power in his hands, he feeds Filatov and his team indefinite  promises of some kind of a future treaty with Moscow, but at the  same time he haggles with the Government of the Russian  Federation about the distribution of profits from trade in  "sovereign" Chechen oil products.</p>

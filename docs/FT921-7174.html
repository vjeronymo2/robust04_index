			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / The Mood of Britain: Scots landscape that will shape the political map - Skye From Elgol on the Isle of Skye to Treorchy deep in the Rhondda, the British electorate is preparing to make its choice. As decision day approaches, the nation remains tantalisingly undecided, fed up with the fall-out from recession and yet suspicious of a reconstructed Labour party offering a fresh start. In the first of five articles, Michael Cassell takes to the road to see how Britain and the British have changed during 13 years of Conservative rule and to identify their hopes and expectations for the 1990s TOM McEache yelled into the wind from the dripping deck of the ferry Loch Fyne as it crossed the sea to Skye: 'They won't be naming anything after Thatcher up here. But there's a farmer near Drumnadrochit with an old nag called Maggie.' McEache, a van driver on the road from Inverness to Portree, the pocket-capital of Scotland's 'misty isle', filled the five-minute crossing between Kyle of Lochalsh and Kyleakin with language calculated to curl the former prime minister's coiffure. He recalls hearing the radio announcement that she was being made redundant: 'I swear I nearly put the truck in Loch Ness.' Alex Finlayson, a hotel worker en route to see Dunvegan Castle - seat of the Clan Macleod and where a lock of Bonnie Prince Charlie's hair lies - added a touch of local knowledge: 'Not many people know she crawled out of Loch Ness in the first place.' McEache and Finlayson would not have helped Margaret Thatcher win her fourth term. But she could have counted on Roderick Fraser, a salesman from Oban nursing a badly dented Sierra. The Plock of Kyle disappeared into the mist behind him: 'She bit Britain in the bum. Now we're going back to sleep.' Passengers on the Loch Fyne, along with the rest of the electorate, were denied by faint-hearted Tory MPs the opportunity to give their ballot-box verdict on the woman who tried to change Britain. But in spite of Thatcher's ruthless removal and the subsequent Tory enthusiasm for resetting the political clock at zero, the general election contest ahead will be fought on a political landscape of which she remains the principal architect. Many of the issues over which the combatants will clash are those that she identified as worthy of her reforming zeal. Much of the battleground they cover in the weeks ahead will centre on her successes and failures. The election will test whether Thatcher inspired an enduring revolution in attitudes and aspirations on which John Major - successfully distanced from her more strident postures - can build a fourth successive Conservative election victory, even at a time of deep recession. Residents on Skye, first port of call on a journey through Britain to test the nation's mood as decision-day ap-proaches, accept that the 1980s brought big changes to a remote corner of the kingdom. The majority of the residents have grown more prosperous but are reluctant to give credit to southern, Tory values or to anything else emanating from Westminster. Caledonian MacBrayne's ferry service is itself witness to change. The summertime flow of traffic between the mainland and the island now means long, impatient queues and occasional roadside punch-ups. The solution is to build Scotland's first privately-financed toll bridge, a Pounds 23m project which will render Skye a less magical, more readily accessible, place. Most islanders want the bridge. But they are angry at plans for very high toll fees which, they claim, have the fingerprints of Thatcherism all over them. Just as privately-financed public bridges may have been unthinkable 10 years ago, so was European finance for the local roads. But now they have been improved with the help of welcome cash from the European Community. In the 1975 referendum the islanders told Brussels to get lost. Now the EC emblem lines the road to Broadford, which broods quietly under the great domes of the Red Hills. George Forsyth, a sprightly pensioner, gives directions to Elgol, the hamlet on Loch Scavaig where the Bonnie Prince left for the mainland. He accepts a short lift. 'We can have the bridge but only if we pay for it ourselves over 25 years. What's the point in cutting taxes if we have to cough up extra for things the government should provide?' he asks. 'Who wants lower income tax if it means Portree has to wait eight years for a new high school? It's about time we got back to talking about the common good and heard less about personal gain.' Personal enrichment for most British people during the 1980s was drawn from the deepening pool of home ownership, the ripples of which reached as far as Skye. There are plenty of pensioners like Forsyth on the island, many of them immigrants from England who exploited escalating property values to resettle where Pounds 65,000 can buy a stone-built home with dramatic views of the bald, black Cuillin Hills. Harry and Olive Jackson from Chester share a sandwich on the chilly shore of Loch Sligachan and wait for the Raasay ferry. Olive regards the spread of home ownership - up from 55 per cent in 1979 to 67 per cent now - as a permanent achievement of Thatcher. 'People used to be trapped. But we bought our council house, moved to something nicer and can now afford to retire up here. She made that possible and she'll always be welcome in my house.' There is, however, another side to the influx of comfortably-off newcomers who have settled in spots such as Glendale, dubbed 'Little England' and boasting views across Loch Pooltiel to the outer isles. It is best illustrated by the drab caravan parks which are home for those without permanent foundations under their feet. Along with the Jacksons, many tenants on Skye bought their homes during the last decade - some of the 1m British families who did so. But the supply of replacement public sector homes is very limited and waiting lists have grown. Ian McCormack, campaigning editor of the West Highland Free Press, with its adverts for winkle pickers and Gaelic-speaking childminders, says the local housing situation reflects a wider, political complaint: 'Some undoubtedly have done very well for themselves but at what cost to the others? 'There is a flurry of homeless cases in the spring when landlords repossess properties to rent out to holidaymakers. Those thrown out try and find a caravan or may have to leave the island altogether.' He reckons the island's revived prowess at shinty - a demonic form of hockey for which the wise don helmets and face-guards - is because youngsters remain on Skye as there is no work available on the mainland. Jim Hunter, a historian who lives in a modernised crofters' cottage above the road to Flora MacDonald's grave, challenges the image of continuing decline and lack of employment: 'Since the 1840s, the island's population has fallen. But the trend has been reversed and there are more jobs. Pride and self-confidence has grown, reviving interest in local culture and language.' Hunter is not alone in identifying an upsurge in local enterprise on an island where every croft arguably represents the perfect working model of self-help. 'There is less dependency and more self-motivation,' he says. In another snug crofter's cottage, flanked by a couple of inquisitive dogs, George Campbell, director of the Scottish Crofters' Union, says the mechanisms and agencies for stimulating enterprise have improved. He believes living standards have risen but, in spite of national consumer debt standing three and a half times higher than a decade ago, says islanders have ignored the siren voices calling on them to borrow more. It is, perhaps, the same Presbyterian streak which has led most crofters, in spite of their anger, to pay their poll tax. But he is concerned by what he sees as a steady erosion of community spirit in a place with only 9,000 permanent residents: 'The collectivist approach is waning. People have become more individualistic.' Even so, the institutions of community life on Skye are jealously guarded. Plans for just one private bed at the McKinnon Memorial Hospital in Broadford were ditched following a right old 'stushie' which reverberated from Score Bay to the Aird of Sleat. Jim Ross, a coach driver leaving Skye on the Loch Fyne, volunteers: 'Most of us are born in hospital and most of us die there. The NHS is ours and not for politicians of any party to play around with. Labour won't slice it away, though I don't see them being able to spend much more on it.' In Glasgow, beyond a slush-covered Glencoe, the Herald's front page reports the gathering storm on proposed trust status for some of Scotland's finest hospitals. But in The Curlers pub on the busy Byres Road, talk is of the Rangers v St Mirren match at Ibrox and of players with doubtful Gaelic names such as Kuznetsov and Mikhailichenko. Thatcher, of course, even made her mark on football. Joe Gillespie, a fireman in need of a pint after Saturday morning shopping, says her attitude to the sport was symbolic. 'I think she despised all sorts of people she knew nothing about and wasn't interested in,' he says. 'She branded all football fans as louts, in the same way she saw the poor as lazy spongers who needed a kick up the ass. Got one herself in the end, didn't she?'

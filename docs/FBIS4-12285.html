			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["An Issue and Opinion" column by Salamah 'Ukur: "The Fight </F> With Chairs Is a Serious Sign"]    [Text] The regrettable fight with chairs that erupted  Wednesday [30 March] between Fatah and Hamas supporters during a  Land Day rally at the professional unions' complex was another  sign that these political forces will not hesitate, if  necessary, to turn Jordan into an arena for conflict and the  settling of accounts.    We were not surprised by the dialogue, which involved the  use  of chairs, at this complex. The winds of democracy have not yet  reached the ranks and the organization of these political  forces. Democratic dialogue is lacking among them. Likewise, we  will not be surprised by fresh dialogues using other tools,  including, perhaps, bullets, exactly like what has frequently  happened in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank, and also  similar to what happened earlier in Lebanon.    We frequently cautioned against the infiltration by external  forces and organizations into our official, popular, and trade  union institutions. These forces would pursue activities that  have nothing to do with the Jordanian people's issues, problems,  and concerns. Moreover, the rallies and interests of these  forces have no room for Jordanian national occasions.    We also frequently cautioned against turning Jordan into a  hotbed of tension or a heated arena for conflicts and battles  among non-Jordanian organizations and forces which are not  interested in safeguarding this country's security and  stability. We are very afraid that the phenomenon of quarreling  by chair will escalate and become a fiercer fight using more  dangerous tools.    We are also very afraid that Fatah, which is now preparing  to  assume the self-rule authority in Gaza and Jericho, will  deliberately settle its accounts with the Palestinian opposition  wherever it is present, including Jordan, so the opposition in  Gaza and Jericho would not be able to undermine Fatah's  authority, paralyze its capabilities, or upset it.    We wish that a constructive democratic dialogue would have  been initiated between the Palestinian leadership and its  supporters on the one hand and all opposition factions and  forces on the other in order to close the Palestinian ranks and  unify the Palestinian position. Conflicts and settling of  accounts by force and violence will weaken the Palestinian  position and undermine the security and stability of the hosting  states. When the spark of violence is triggered, it will not be  easy to put it out or circumvent its repercussions.</p>

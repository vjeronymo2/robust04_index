			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 13, BNS -- Eesti Gaas, the company  running the natural gas distribution networks in Estonia, and  Russia's Gazprom concern have finished drafting a supply  agreement for the next 10 years, Eesti Gaas Director General  Aarne Saar said.    The two companies by now have agreed on the amount of supply  and conditions of delivery, while talks are going on to find a  formula for price calculation, Saar said.    Price calculation formulas based on heavy oil and heating  oil  prices at the Rotterdam stock exchange, as generally used in the  West, are not suitable with respect to Russia because of a  higher percentage of sulphur in gas from Russia, Saar explained.    Eesti Gaas and Gazprom expect to sign the agreement already  in August or in September.    The Russian concern owns a 30-percent stake in Eesti Gaas.  The Estonian Government holds 39 percent of the company's  shares. Fifteen percent of the shares are to be sold in Estonia,  and another 15 percent, to some western company. Negotiations  with potential investors are under way, Saar added.    Eesti Gaas turned over 0.5 billion kroons last year. The  company's share capital is 38.8 million kroons.</p>

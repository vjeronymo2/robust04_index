			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CEAUSESCU SON TRIED TO FLEE IN BACK OF CAR DRIVEN BY WOMAN  </P> <P> The son of deposed Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu tried to flee Bucharest  hiding in the back seat of a car driven by a heavily perfumed woman who  identified him as her lover, a Hungarian newspaper said today.  </P> <P> Ivan Maru, a printer, told the Nepszabadsag he overpowered Nicu Ceausescu and  then took him to the TV center in Bucharest, where the notorious playboy  appeared on camera looking dazed and bruised.  </P> <P> Maru said he had been checking cars near Bucharest's Baneasa domestic airport  Friday with a group of young men when a Romanian-made car approached.  </P> <P> "A very elegant woman was driving the car. . . . We saw that a man was sitting  behind, his cap completely pulled down.  </P> <P> "I reached in and pulled off his cap. I saw it was Nicu. He got out of the car  and pretended to search for his papers. Then suddenly he ran away. I ran after  him and jumped on him. I twisted his arm behind his back. My buddies got there  too and helped."  </P></p>

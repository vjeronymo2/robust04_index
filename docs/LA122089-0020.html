			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S CYNICAL CHINA SYNDROME  </P> <P> The adjectives cynical and dishonorable already have been used to describe the  Bush Administration's conduct of Sino-American relations. The word deceitful  can now be added to the list.  </P> <P> In the immediate aftermath of the bloody suppression of pro-democracy  demonstrators in Beijing's Tien An Men Square last June, the President publicly  ordered a suspension of all high-level contacts between U.S. and Chinese  diplomats. He also halted sales of military supplies to Beijing, and announced  that Washington would seek a halt to consideration of additional international  financial loans to China. These steps, Bush then argued, would be sufficient to  persuade Beijing that as long as it persisted in murderous repression, it could  not expect to do "business as usual" with the West.  </P> <P> The ban on U.S. military sales was the first of the sanctions to be discarded  by the Administration. Tuesday, the President abandoned the purely economic  reprisals when he approved the sale of three civilian communication satellites  to China and lifted prohibitions on U.S. export-import financing of business  activities with China.  </P> <P> As it turns out, the President never had any intention of abiding by his own  ban on high-level diplomatic contacts. Barely a month after the killings in  Tien An Men Square Bush dispatched National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft  and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger on a secret mission to  Beijing. Now that they have been found out, the Administration's spokesmen  claim the envoys were sent "to underscore the U.S. shock and concern about the  violence."  </P> <P> Perhaps, but if the Chinese government, which at that very moment was rounding  up dissidents and conducting secret executions, read something else into the  contradiction between Washington's public statements and private conduct, who  would be surprised? The leaders of China's power elite may be physically  feeble, but they have a keen appreciation of hypocrisy born of a lifetime's  practice. The Bush Administration, after all, was talking their language.  </P></p>

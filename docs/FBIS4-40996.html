			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia and China ended talks in Moscow on Tuesday by  signing an agreement for cooperation in the area of  communications.    The two sides are committed to help improve their  communications networks and postal services, ensure the transit  of all types of communications and postal dispatches through  each other's territory and provide better legal regulation.    Russia and China are planning to increase the number of  telecommunication links from 30 to 90 by the end of this year  and largely reduce the need for third countries in this sphere,  Russian Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak told reporters  in Moscow. The number of links, telephone and other, will  eventually be increased to 250 to meet the two countries' needs,  he said.    The two countries reaffirmed the intention to let Beijing  hook up to Russia's transiberian fiber optic communications due  to go into operation in 1996. For its part, China is to install  communications from Harbin to Khabarovsk and Nakhodka and from  Heihe to Blagoveshensk.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian leaders are continuing widespread  political activities in East Jerusalem, which are coordinated  with the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.  The Palestinians are now saying that they are prepared to renew  the negotiations with Israel on the transfer of authorities in  the other West Bank towns. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports:    [Begin recording] [Amir] The furor surrounding the letter  written by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has led to a  confidence crisis among Palestinian leaders. The affair has  been exploited by Palestinian supporters of the peace process  who oppose the Gaza-Jericho First agreement and believe that it  is detrimental to the Palestinian cause. Faysal al-Husayni, as  if to highlight the political activities at Orient House,  received a delegation of foreign consuls in his office and  Palestinian leaders continued yesterday to hold discussions on  Jerusalem's current situation as well as its future. A  Palestinian source pointed out that although the famous letter  sent to the Norwegian foreign minister was not addressed to the  PLO, the letter's contents had undoubtedly been coordinated with  the PLO. To prove his point, the source noted that he had a  copy of the letter before it was signed by Foreign Minister  Peres, which was dated 9 September.    Jamil al-Tarifi, a member of the higher liaison committee  and  one of 'Arafat's closest aides, yesterday emphasized that at the  time, the letter of commitment guaranteed that the Palestinian  delegation could carry out the political activities in East  Jerusalem that were necessary in order to conduct negotiations  with Israel. Al-Tarifi asserted that it was impossible to  separate the political activities of PLO institutions in East  Jerusalem and the activities of the autonomy institutions, which  will indeed be located in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, as  stipulated by the agreement.    [Al-Tarifi, in English] Everybody knows that we have many  institutions in Jerusalem. It will be as it is, and of course  it's a Palestinian institute and we will not change anything on  it. So, nobody can cut the relations between the Palestinians  and their leadership, which is PLO and one of its organizations  PPA [sentence as heard].    [Amir translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues]  Al-Tarifi expressed the assessment that now, following the  establishment of the Palestinian Authority, the negotiations  with Israel on the transfer of authorities could be resumed.  Al-Tarifi said that the Palestinians would demand authority  over more than the five spheres of health, education and  culture, tourism, social welfare, and direct taxation stipulated  by the Gaza-Jericho First agreement.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 8 June adds  that  "the PLO has rejected an Israeli proposal to release hundreds of  Palestinian prisoners tomorrow after Israel demanded that the  prisoners remain in the Gaza Strip before returning to their  homes until their original prison terms were over. This was  stated by Jamil al-Tarifi, a member of the Palestinian  Authority. Al-Tarifi said that Yasir 'Arafat had instructed him  over the telephone yesterday to reject the release proposal and  said that the Israeli offer contravened the Cairo agreement. He  expressed the hope that this was merely a misunderstanding and  that an agreement would be reached on the release of the  Palestinian prisoners."]</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Observer: Well spotted Hong Kong's Eastern Express, launched last Tuesday with great fanfare, is having a bit of trouble living up to its motto as the paper 'you can trust'. One of its first 'exclusives' was a revelation that a company controlled by Peter Woo, part of the Sir Y K Pao dynasty, was spying on Li Ka-shing, one of Hong Kong's richest tycoons. An eagle-eyed reporter had spotted that a camera situated on the 22nd floor of Wheelock House was pointing at the China Building across the road, where Li and son Victor have their offices, and put two and two together. Sadly, the 10-year-old camera is actually nothing more sinister than an optical receiver for picking up a real-time data feed from the Hong Kong stock exchange.</p>

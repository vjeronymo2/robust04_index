			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Toshiba Corp. said Monday  [16 May] it has developed an innovative high capacity 3.5-inch  optical disk system that has a partial rewrite capability.    Data can be entered on the new optical disk using a modified  phase-change process, allowing it to be either partially or  totally deleted by overwriting, Toshiba said.    In phase-change optical disk drives, the reading and writing  of data is achieved by converting the recording layer of the  disk from an amorphous to a crystalline state and vice versa,  using the heat emitted by a laser diode.    Toshiba said the system represents a dramatic improvement  over conventional rewritable magneto-optical disk systems, in  which stored data cannot be changed without first erasing the  whole section on which amended data is to be entered.    The new optical disk will be suitable for application in a  wide range of next-generation multimedia products that run on  personal computers, Toshiba said.</p>

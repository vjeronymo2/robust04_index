			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Three main parties spurn Peru election REGISTRATION for Peru's congressional elections will close at midnight tonight, three prominent parties having decided not to field candidates. Peruvians will vote on November 22 for a new, 80-member 'democratic constituent congress'. President Alberto Fujimori is hoping for a majority so as to continue economic liberalisation and structural reform. Also, the resumption of much-needed international financial assistance to Peru, frozen since the president dissolved the previous Congress and suspended the constitution on April 5, depends on a return to democracy. The parties not fielding candidates argue that the new Congress, charged with writing a new constitution, already has its hands tied by Mr Fujimori. Opposition to the his regime by former presidents Fernando Belaunde and Alan Garca has ensured that their parties, Popular Action and Apra respectively, will not run. The right-wing Freedom movement of Mr Mario Vargas Llosa, defeated by Mr Fujimori in the last presidentiual election, has also refused to participate. Up to a dozen groups, many of them newcomers to Peruvian politics, could meet the deadline tonight. Parties which failed to gain at least five per cent of the popular vote in the 1990 elections, and so do not qualify for registration, have had to collect signatures from at least 100,000 backers. Early opinion polls indicate that Mr Fujimori's Change 90 party, with New Majority, headed by former mining minister Mr Jaime Yoshiyama, will sweep the board, but the volatility of the electorate means nothing can be taken for granted. International observers appointed by the Organisation of American States are to start arriving in Lima today to monitor the electoral process. MR Abimael Guzman, founder-leader of the Shining Path guerrilla movement has been found guilty of treason after a 10-day summary trial by a closed court martial. He now faces a life sentence. He can appeal to a 'war council' and, if his conviction is upheld there, to Peru's Supreme Military Court. President Alberto Fujimori has announced that the appeals procedure has been accelerated, with both stages to be completed within five days. Radio reports said that suspected Shining Path guerrillas had killed six members of Peru's security forces in an apparent reaction to the expected life sentence.</p>

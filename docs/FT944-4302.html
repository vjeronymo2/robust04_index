			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Hungary's energy prices soar Hungary's Socialist-led government yesterday agreed huge energy price rises but backed off from the even higher price increases recommended by its energy office and advisers working on the privatisation of the country's electricity and gas companies. Mr Laszlo Pal, industry minister, said electricity prices for households would rise by 65 per cent and for gas by 53 per cent from January. Details of price rises for industry were not given, but Mr Pal said they would be significantly lower than those for domestic users. To soften the blow, the government, which faces nationwide local elections on Sunday, will allocate Ft9bn (Pounds 52m) from the state budget to compensate those most hit by the increases. The price rises increase the value of the state electricity and gas companies which the government plans to privatise next year, but analysts estimate household energy prices, which are controlled by the state, need to rise by 100 per cent to bring them to world levels and cover production and modernisation costs.</p>

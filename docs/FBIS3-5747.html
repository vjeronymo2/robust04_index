The showroom, the first  such facility to be opened in Beijing by a Japanese automaker,  will exhibit Legend and Accord models, Honda said.    At the same time, Honda's Hong Kong-based sales subsidiary,  Honda Motor (China) Co., will launch active automobile-marketing  efforts in China, company officials said. The wholly owned  subsidiary was established in February 1993 to market and  service Honda motorcycles, for which Chinese demand is  increasing, the officials said.    Honda so far has sold automobiles in China through trading  companies. The officials said Honda decided to have the  subsidiary promote direct automobile marketing in China after  Honda's auto exports to the country hit a record 12,200 vehicles  last year.</p>

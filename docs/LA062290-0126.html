			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: CONSIDER STOCKS THAT ARE DOWN NOW  </P> <P> While many folks on Wall Street are still waiting for a steep market selloff --  a correction, as it is called -- a few stocks are already deep into their own  private declines. Investors who have been considering getting into some solid  stocks for the long run might want to look at some of the recently wounded.  </P> <P> Take Pasadena-based Jacobs Engineering. The stock has come down 17%, from its  May peak of $25.50, to $21.125. That kind of quick move isn't unusual for a  thinly traded stock such as Jacobs, but it frustrates the company nonetheless.  </P> <P> Jacobs is a major player in plant design and construction and in hazardous  waste cleanup. The company's orders have been booming, as corporate capital  spending has soared worldwide. Hours billed in May were a record, says Nazim  Thawerbhoy, Jacobs' controller. "Our fundamentals are as strong as before or  even stronger," he says.  </P> <P> Some Jacobs sellers may have been reacting to competitor Fluor Corp.'s  disappointing earnings for the quarter ended April 30, which Fluor reported  June 5. But Jacobs isn't in the same boat, Thawerbhoy says. "We don't expect  our earnings to be down" this quarter, he said.  </P> <P> At $21.125, Jacobs sells for 18 times the $1.20 a share it should earn this  year. Fluor, meanwhile, sells for about 27 times estimated 1990 earnings.  Thawerbhoy figures Jacobs deserves better.  </P> <P> Another thinly traded stock that's off sharply since May is MagneTek Inc. The  L.A.-based company is a big name in electrical equipment, such as motors,  ballasts, controls and transformers. Its customers include the aerospace,  utility and construction industries.  </P> <P> MagneTek's stock has dropped to $10.50, down 16% from its May peak of $12.50.  Yet business still appears to be on track: Revenue in the third quarter, ended  March 31, rose 16% from a year earlier to $286 million. Earnings jumped 27% to  47 cents a share. The firm also has said that it anticipates a "strong" June 30  quarter.  </P> <P> So why the drop in the stock? MagneTek went public a year ago and on June 13 a  restriction was lifted on the ability of some big stockholders to sell shares.  The market figured a lot might be dumped. That hasn't happened.  </P> <P> There still is concern about a 6% block of the stock owned by First Executive  Corp., the troubled insurance firm. First Executive was rumored to have been  selling some of the shares last week. But Otto Stoll, a MagneTek spokesman,  said: "My understanding is that they did not sell." First Executive, as a rule,  never comments on its trades.  </P> <P> In any case, MagneTek now sells for less than 10 times annualized earnings per  share -- a price that appears to have recession worries firmly built into it,  and one that reflects the firm's relatively high debt load. Unless orders  suddenly collapse, MagneTek may be in shape to surprise Wall Street with  healthy earnings growth this year.  </P> <P> Two other sold-off stocks that may be bargains now: personal computer maker AST  Research of Irvine and Goleta-based Applied Magnetics Corp., which makes  magnetic recording heads for the computer industry.  </P> <P> On June 13, AST called for redemption of some debentures, which will create 3  million new AST shares. About 12 million are outstanding now.  </P> <P> While the market will have to digest that new stock, investors eventually will  begin refocusing on the company's strong computer sales, which remain "very  much" on track, says spokesman Don Mathias.  </P> <P> Applied Magnetics, meanwhile, is experiencing "tremendous demand" for its  recording heads, says Todd Bakar, an analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc. in  San Francisco.  </P> <P> The problem is that most of the company's manufacturing is done in South Korea,  and the firm has faced labor strife there recently over such issues as  overtime.  </P> <P> But Bakar believes Applied will work out the problems quickly, and says demand  is so strong that earnings should reach 76 cents a share this year and $1.65  next. If he's right, this is a cheap stock.  </P> <P> A Gold List for Shearson?American Express has always jealously guarded the  names of its cardholders, especially those who hold the upper-crust gold and  platinum cards. Not even Shearson Lehman Hutton, American Express' brokerage  operation, has had access to that customer list.  </P> <P> That could change soon. AmEx confirms that it is considering sharing gold and  platinum cardholders' names with Shearson. The list could be a mother lode for  Shearson brokers who are trying to bring in new business, because gold and  platinum cardholders are, in theory at least, a well-heeled group.  </P> <P> Discussions about cross-marketing within AmEx are part of a major  reorganization, designed to boost profits. As part of the reorganization,  Jonathan Linen was named head of Shearson on May 29. He had been in charge of  AmEx's direct-marketing group, and his background suggests he knows how to  boost sales.  </P> <P> AmEx won't say how many gold and platinum cards are outstanding, but  credit-card guru Spencer Nilson of the Santa Monica-based Nilson Report  estimates there are 6.4 million gold cards in the United States and 250,000  platinum cards. Green AmEx cards number about 15.2 million in the United  States, Nilson says.  </P> <P> Briefly: Shares of L.A.-based food wholesaler Rykoff-Sexton Inc. have surged to  $19, up from $16.625 at the end of May. This week, Rykoff reported earnings for  the quarter ended April 28, and the stock got a further lift from the report.  </P> <P> Rykoff ran into trouble last winter, so Wall Street knew the latest quarter  would be a disaster. But the 62% drop in earnings, to 18 cents a share,  apparently wasn't as bad as expected. The Wisconsin Investment Board, that  state's public pension fund, owns 1 million Rykoff shares (9%) and continues to  take a positive view of the company, a board spokesman says.  </P> <P> They always said stocks were just a big crap shoot, right? Even so, Washington  state's latest lottery game isn't winning a lot of fans in the investment  world: The game, called "Wall Street," is advertised as "the excitement of  investing without the inherent risks."  </P> <P> The average public commodity fund plunged 5.8% in value in May, reversing a  six-month string of big gains for investors in those risky ventures, reports  Norwood Securities of Chicago.  </P> <P> The funds' winning streak had averaged gains of 2.75% a month since November,  but many fund managers got murdered by being short on Treasury bond futures in  May, Norwood reports.  </P> <P> BATTERED STOCKS  </P> <P> While many analysts expect a significant "correction" in the stock market soon,  these stocks already have suffered sharp drops from their spring highs.

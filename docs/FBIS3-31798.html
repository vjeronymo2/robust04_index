			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikola Sainovic, deputy prime minister of </F> the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by Mirjana Jevtic in  Belgrade on 23 February -- recorded]    [Text] [Jevtic] Mr. Sainovic, you spent over a year as  Serbia's prime minister. During that time the new stabilization  program has been implemented. How would you comment on the fact  that Mr. Mirko Marjanovic will take up your job?    [Sainovic] Briefly, I can express great satisfaction that a  man with such experience and such results in the economy --  which Mr. Marjanovic has behind him -- will be in a position to  form a government of national unity in the Republic of Serbia.  I am convinced that the program will be in safe hands -- to put  it that way -- in the Republic of Serbia and that it will  certainly produce results.    [Jevtic] You are going from the Serbian Government to the  Federal Government as deputy prime minister with a very concrete  and special task. You will be the coordinator of the entire  program for the reconstruction of the monetary system and the  recovery of our economy. What are your exact tasks?    [Sainovic] I am deeply aware of the significant  responsibility for the realization of the program and the  coordination of all the subjects that participate in its  realization. The program is not only of the Federal Government,  because the National Bank and the Payment Operations Services  also participate in it. Both republics, the economy, and the  association of all these subjects for a synchronized operation  is a very important task, and that will be the essence of my  everyday work. I am convinced that all the subjects involved in  this will simply justify the huge confidence that the people  already have in the new dinar and this program, and that this  confidence is in effect the measure of my responsibility.</p>

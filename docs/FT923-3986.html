			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Weak currencies hit Record's strategy Despite an increase of 4 per cent in sales, pre-tax profits at Record Holdings were cut by 48 per cent in the half year to June 30. The group makes hand and bench tools, and non-portable power tools. The competitive advantage it created by reducing prices had been largely eliminated by weakened currencies in its principal overseas markets, particularly North America, the Far East, Australasia and South Africa, explained Mr Michael Mallett, chairman. Turnover was Pounds 14m (Pounds 13.4m) and within that volume increases included North America 24 per cent, UK exports 41 per cent, and power tools 66 per cent. Operating profit came to Pounds 801,000 (Pounds 1.79m) and the pre-tax balance to Pounds 809,000 (Pounds 1.57m). Earnings per share fell to 1.22p (3.32p) and the interim dividend is again 1.15p on higher capital.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BEACH POLLUTION  </P> <P> I am an 18-year resident of Laguna Beach, and do not like to see our beach  reputation so diminished by several years of unacceptable polluting of our  shores because of defective equipment, lack of monitoring devices and power  outages.  </P> <P> The rationalizations offered by the city mothers and fathers offend: the  situation cannot be controlled, the equipment cannot be fixed, a monitoring  system is too expensive.  </P> <P> The situation can be remedied. Our beaches can be pristine. Visitors will come  and spend all their cash to fill Laguna coffers. All the situation requires is  money and renewed respect for the environment by the City Council. Not to  systematically remedy the problem now as a first priority will ruin Laguna's  reputation and continue to do so long after the town has been made to solve the  problem.  </P> <P> Just tell us how much it will cost and how the steps to be taken will be  financed. And let's get on with it tomorrow.  </P> <P> STUART WILSON  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

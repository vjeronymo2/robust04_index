			<p>BFN     [Text] The Jonassaint government guarantees all foreigners  living in Haiti the freedom to attend to their affairs. The  Ministry of Information, Culture, and Coordination strongly  denies the allegations contained in the 8 June communique issued  by an organization claiming to be an OAS/UN international  civilian mission in Haiti, which recounts incidents that  occurred on the evening of 7 June between agents of that  organization and segments of the Haitian police force.    In its concern for the truth, and to shield the country from  the systematic denigration campaign of which it is an object,  the Ministry of Information, Culture, and Coordination is  pleased to present the following corrections:    The first and most important correction concerns the arms  and radios seized by the police patrol on duty that night. The  arms and radios were not registered with the police or with the  National Council of Telecommunications [CONATEL], and the two  operations were led by known police agents working under the the  strictest military discipline.    The Ministry of Information, Culture, and Coordination is  reacting to the U.S. State Department memo, which responded to  the report by this alleged OAS/UN international civilian mission  in Haiti. The Ministry is amazed at the hasty conclusions drawn  by this U.S. state entity, which asserts that the lives of  Americans are threatened and their safety remains tentative.    Is it necessary to remind them of the series of incidents  that occurred during the seven-month Aristide government,  including, among others, the Leogane affair, which cost about 10  U.S. citizens their freedom and almost brought them to a tragic  death by lynching; and that these types of events were inspired  by the anti-American violence of President Aristide's speeches.  How and why did they forget that anti-imperialism was nourishing  state-sponsored terrorism at that time -- fortunately in the  past -- and threatening the lives of Americans and the safety of  people and buildings of foreign embassies? The Ministry of  Information, Culture, and Coordination wonders about this.    On that score, this Ministry believes this communique by the  international civilian mission in Haiti is very thoughtless as  is its corollary, the State Department memo, which can cause  irreparable damage to Haiti which -- despite low blows and  ingratitude -- remains on the track of friendship among peoples  based on mutual respect and human values and freedom.    The Ministry of Information takes this opportunity to remind  all foreigners living on national territory that they have the  government's full guarantee of their safety and rights and are  free to attend to their affairs.    This note was signed by Jacques Saint-Louis, minister of  information, culture, and coordination.</p>

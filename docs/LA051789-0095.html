			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Twenty alleged French urban guerrillas refused to recognize the court's  authority as their mass trial on charges of murder, armed robbery and bombing  opened in the southeastern city of Lyon. Police allege that the defendants are  members of the Lyon cell of the ultra-leftist guerrilla group Direct Action.  Andre Olivier, a high-school teacher alleged to be the group's ideologist, and  Max Frerot, said to be its explosives expert, refused to answer when the judge  asked their names. The case against the 20 includes charges arising from 30  armed robberies, three bombings and three murders.  </P></p>

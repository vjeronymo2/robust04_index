			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mascarene black petrel ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pterodroma aterrima <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1980 petition, ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a small sea bird of the family Procellariidae; originally found on the islands of Reunion and Rodrigues, which are parts of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It seems to have disappeared from Rodrigues by the 18th century and to have become extremely rare on Reunion. Reasons for the decline are not precisely known, but may involve human hunting (B), predation by introduced rats and cats (C), and absorption of pesticides harmful to reproduction (E). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pink pigeon ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nesoenas mayeri <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1980 petition, ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a member of the family Columbidae, about the size of the domestic pigeon ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Columba domestica <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), but with shorter and more rounded wings and generally pink in color (Goodwin 1977); known only from southwestern Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. This species has declined because of the clearing of its native forest habitat by people (A), human hunting for use as food (B), and predation by introduced rats and macaques (C). Remnant populations also became more vulnerable to the effects of cyclones and natural food shortages (E). The pink pigeon already was rare by the 1830s and currently the single known wild group contains only about 20 birds. Larger numbers exist in captivity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> White-tailed laurel pigeon ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Columba junoniae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1980 petition, ICBP rare, proposed U.S. threatened; a large member of the family Columbidae, closely related to the common Old World wood pigeon ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Columba palumbus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ); known only from the Canary Islands, a Spanish possession off northwestern Africa. Early reports suggest that this species may once have occurred throughout the Canaries, though it is known with certainty only from the western islands of Tenerife, La Palma, and Gomera. It now is relatively common only on parts of La Palma. Elsewhere it has disappeared or declined in conjunction with human destruction of the endemic Canarian laurel forests (A). Some of the remnant populations appear to be stable, following legal measures to protect them and their forest habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Madagascar pochard ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aythya innotata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1991 petition, ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a diving duck of the family Anatidae; apparently confined to freshwater lakes and pools in the northern central plateau of Madagascar. Although still common around 1930, this species subsequently declined drastically because of large-scale hunting by people (B). It may also have been adversely affected by the introduction of exotic fish and accidental capture by people netting the fish (E). It probably is on the brink of extinction; there had been no definite records between 1970 and August 1991, when a specimen was captured alive and placed in the Botanical Garden at Antananarivo ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oryx, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  April 1992, 26:73). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dappled mountain robin ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Modulatrix orostruthus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1980 petition, ICBP rare, proposed U.S. threatened; a thrush of the family Muscicapidae; occurs in three isolated patches of montane forest, one in northern Mozambique and two in eastern Tanzania. Much of the rainforest habitat on which the species depends has been cleared for agricultural purposes (A). The population in Mozambique has not been recorded since 1932. The other two populations may number in the hundreds or low thousands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marungu sunbird ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nectarinia prigoginei <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1991 petition, ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a nectar-feeding bird of the family Nectarinidae, characterized by small size and a long bill, somewhat comparable to the hummingbirds superficially; known only from the Marungu Highlands of southeastern Zaire. The remnant riparian forest on which this species probably depends covers only a small part of the Marungu Highlands and is under severe pressure from logging and from the erosion of stream banks caused by the overgrazing of cattle (A). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Taita thrush ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Turdus helleri <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1991 petition, ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a dark-colored, ground-dwelling member of the family Muscicapidae; apparently confined to highlands in southeastern Kenya. This species occurs at low density and depends on limited forest habitat. Such areas now have been mostly cleared for agricultural purposes or to obtain firewood (A). The only relatively well-known population occupies an area of about 3 square miles (5 square kilometers) and may contain several hundred individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

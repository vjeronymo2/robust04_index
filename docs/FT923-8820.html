			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Fernandez Ordonez dies MR Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, the former foreign minister who helped guide Spain's integration into the European Community, died yesterday after a long illness, AP reports from Madrid. He was 62 and had asked to be relieved from his post in June.

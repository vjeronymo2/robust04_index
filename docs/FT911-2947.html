			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Observer: Poles apart 'How did you get on with the Queen, Mr President, and what did you think of Windsor Palace?' It was the question all had been waiting for and Poland's Lech Walesa didn't disappoint. 'Windsor is very nice. But I'd move a few things round a bit if I lived there. The light was too far away from the bed - and the bed was so big I could hardly find my wife.' And the Queen? 'Ah yes, she's like a mother. Nations like England need a mother. We need a mother too.' Walesa is also a great admirer of another lady with near icon status in eastern Europe: the iron lady herself, Margaret Thatcher. The two met again yesterday, but 'far too briefly'. So he invited the ex-premier to come back to Poland 'for a longer talk' about her vision of politics. He was less charmed by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, who was quoted as having raised questions about the merits of debt- forgiveness. Walesa, whose visit has been long on ceremony but shorter on substance, recalled that while Polish workers were struggling to get rid of communism western banks were bankrolling the ancien regimes. 'Imagine Poland is building a car. The 50 per cent debt relief agreed by the Paris club gives us the body. The 20 per cent added by the Americans and the 10 per cent by the French is like adding wheels to the car. Anything extra Britain can add is welcome.'</p>

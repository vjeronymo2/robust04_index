Job Mokgoro and Dr Tjaart van der Walt made the  announcement at a press conference in Mmabatho.    In terms of the decree, yet to be promulgated, the  co-administrators will take over responsibility for  Bophuthatswana under the supervision of the South African  Government and the executive council.    The decree, which applies to the whole of the territory,  suspends part of the constitution. Existing law will apply  until it is amended, substituted or repealed and all former  state departments will continue until they are abolished or  re-organised.    The co-administrators will take responsibility for any legal  matters applicable to the former state president, executive  council or ministers of state or parliamentary members.    Dr van der Walt and Mr Mokgoro's functions will include re-  establishment of good government in Bophuthatswana, the  restoration of essential services, suspension of the  constitution and promotion of free political activity to  facilitate the holding of free and fair elections.    They will have the power to make laws for peace, order and  good government and may amend, substitute or repeal any such law.    The Independent Electoral Commission Act, the Transitional  Executive Council Act, the Independent Broadcasting Authority  Act and the Electoral Act of the Republic of South Africa will  apply in Bophuthatswana.    The joint administrators will take responsibility for all  liabilities and obligations incurred by the Bophuthatswana  government before March 12.    They will also be liable for any legal action against the  former homeland before the decree.    Public property in possession of anyone who held office  under  the former government will be recovered.</p>

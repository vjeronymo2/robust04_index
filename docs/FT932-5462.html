			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Aggressive terms set for Chilean deal A SLEW of sovereign and corporate names hit the Eurobond market yesterday, with borrowers tapping mainly the dollar, Ecu and D-Mark sectors. Among emerging market names, Celulosa Arauco Y Constitucion, the Chilean pulp and forestry products group, attracted considerable attention with a very aggressively priced deal. The Dollars 150m five-year deal marks the first time that a Chilean borrower has launched a straight bond issue, according to Chase, the lead manager. Compania de Telefonos de Chile, the Chilean telecommunications group, launched a convertible bond issue earlier this year. Mr Jorge Jasson, managing director of the international capital markets group in Chase, said the bond was priced to yield 210 basis points over the relevant Treasury bond, making this the tightest launch spread from a Latin American name. The proceeds will be used partly to pay off existing debt and extend its maturity, while Dollars 50m will be used for working capital. The company does not have an international credit rating, but Chase said it carries the top local rating. 'The deal will go well - they can afford to price it aggressively as a lot of people have been looking for Chilean paper,' said one dealer. The Kingdom of Sweden turned to the Ecu sector yesterday with an Ecu500m, seven-year deal. Sweden has borrowed in a broad range of currencies recently, and bankers estimate it is now about halfway through its borrowing programme for the year. Swiss Bank Corporation, the lead manager, said it looked at recent seven-year Ecu issues from the EIB and France for reference when pricing the deal. These two deals were yielding 7.19 per cent and 7.47 per cent respectively, while Sweden was priced to yield 7.516 per cent at launch. Dealers said the issue went fairly well and was expected to appeal to both retail and institutional investors in search of current-coupon Ecu paper. The Republic of Portugal, which recently had its credit rating upgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's, took advantage of the good news by tapping the D-Mark sector. The DM 1.5bn, 10-year issue, will be priced today at between 27 and 30 basis points over the 6 3/4 per cent bund due 2003. Dresdner Bank, the joint lead manager, estimated that the recent upgrading probably translated into a 5 basis point saving for Portugal. In the dollar sector, France's Compagnie Bancaire launched a Dollars 300m two-year offering of bonds via Paribas Capital Markets. Dealers said the issue was fairly priced at 70 basis points over the comparable US Treasury. Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank of Hungary yesterday launched a DM100m bond issue and so became the first east European commercial bank to tap the international capital markets since the collapse of communism. The state-controlled foreign trade bank priced the five-year 9 1/2 per cent Eurobonds to yield 324 basis points above the comparable benchmark German government bond. The lead manager of the deal was Bayerische Landesbank, the German bank which last year expressed interest in taking a stake when Kulkereskedelmi Bank is privatised. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development broke new ground by acting as senior co-manager. The D-Mark market was a 'natural choice,' Kulkereskedelmi Bank said. Germany is Hungary's largest trading partner and the bank is Hungary's main financer of foreign trade. The National Bank of Hungary, the central bank, has also paved the way for Hungarian borrowers with a series of DM bonds culminating this April in a DM1bn issue carrying a coupon of 9.25 per cent. However,the German roadshow for Kulkereskedelmi coincided with the Hungarian finance ministry's announcement that gross domestic product could fall by up to 3 per cent rather than show the 0 - 3 per cent growth first forecast. At the same time a report by the World Bank and Credit Suisse First Boston showed capital problems at the Magyar Hitel Bank and Kereskedelmi Bank, the two largest Hungarian commercial banks. The news prompted fears that the financial community might lump Kulkereskedelmi together with Hungary's more troubled institutions but the bank, which the report estimated has a capital adequacy ratio of 16.1 per cent, was judged on its own merits.</p>

To the applause of participants in the ceremony, the  President said that he would like to join the U.S. secretary of  state, who was present at the signing of the documents in  Brussels and congratulate the Russian people and its leaders on  this far-sighted choice. President Clinton described it as one  more step on the long path of mankind's eternal urge towards  peace, and thanked them.</p>

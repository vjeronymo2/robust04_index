			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / GM's revolution turns into a race against time: The US carmaker's move to turn around operations News that Mr Robert Stempel, the 59-year-old chairman of General Motors, has been admitted to hospital after suddenly falling ill, introduces a further element of uncertainty to the group's plans for changes in its loss-making North American car operations. Ten months after he announced plans to cut 74,000 jobs and close 21 parts and assembly plants by the middle of the decade, Mr Stempel's revolution has won some early skirmishes. But the hardest battles are just beginning, and rumours suggest that powerful non-executive members of GM's board may be restive that change is not coming more quickly. Two huge question marks remain over the company's future: Can GM cut costs as fast as it needs in the face of opposition from the United Auto Workers union and the group's own entrenched bureaucracy? Can it produce the kind of vehicles Americans want to buy, to halt the slide in its US car market share from 46 per cent in 1980 to 33 per cent last month ? Mr Stempel was reportedly due to be released from hospital this morning after a blood pressure problem was corrected. Prolonged ill-health could complicate GM's efforts to turn around its core North American vehicle business, which made an operating loss last year of Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.1bn) and is on course for a Dollars 2.4bn loss this year, says Mr David Healy, an analyst with SG Warburg. A persistent loss in North America will eventually undermine profits made by GM's European car operations and its financial services, aerospace and data processing subsidiaries. It may already be cramping its budget for the development of new cars. 'It has the potential for absolutely catastrophic long-term harm to the company, from a financial standpoint,' says Mr David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. Protected initially by its sheer size, GM was slower than Ford and Chrysler to react to the assault mounted by Japanese manufacturers in the 1980s. Figures published last week by Harbour &amp; Associates, a car industry consultancy, estimate GM employs 4.55 workers to assemble one vehicle, compared with 3.01 at Ford and 3.76 at Chrysler. It was the US recession, plunging GM into the red, that finally forced management into a revolution which has now passed through four distinct stages. Stage one, between December and April, laid the groundwork for change with announcements of proposed plant closures and an organisational shake-up which scrapped GM's three division structure in North America and replaced it with a single umbrella organisation. In stage two, the revolution did what revolutions often do: it devoured its own. The GM board, unhappy over the speed and style of change, ousted Mr Lloyd Reuss, the company president hand-picked by Mr Stempel to oversee North America, and replaced him with Mr Jack Smith, head of international operations. Mr Smith made his mark in the 1980s as head of its European operations, which he turned from severe losses into one of the world's most profitable car businesses. He has brought extra drive to the restructuring, especially through his appointment of Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a Spaniard who shook up GM's parts suppliers in Europe, to perform the same job in North America. The previously decentralised purchasing system has been placed entirely under his command. Mr Lopez has had an immediate impact on Detroit, telling GM's suppliers that if they want to retain its business they must compete with the best in the world - on quality and cost - and in some cases lower their prices by 20 per cent or more. In return, GM is prepared to offer them long-term contracts and assistance. Many supply companies are furious; others are more sanguine, looking forward to a closer involvement in developing new vehicles, and to the overseas sales opportunities offered by GM's new global sourcing policy. Mr Lopez's most dramatic impact may have been inside GM itself. The company gets 70 per cent of its parts from its own subsidiaries (extremely high compared with rivals), which employ UAW members. These too are being told to shape up or lose business. GM has also begun selling off some parts operations - it recently put its ball bearing business up for auction - and some analysts believe far more dramatic disposals could be in the pipeline. Mr Lopez's actions have also helped usher in the fourth and most fraught stage of the revolution - a potential confrontation with the UAW, which has recently staged two strikes at local parts plants over job losses. The union, already angry over the 21 plant closures, fears many more jobs will go if the company buys more parts from outside suppliers. It is also furious over the company's alleged 'whipsawing' - playing off plants threatened with closure against one another to win concessions on labour practices. The strikes are seen as a counter shot to deter GM from drastic job cuts and soften the company up before 1993's negotiations on a new three-year labour pact. Yet this week Mr Stephen Yokich, a senior UAW official, said the union recognised GM had real problems and was 'quite prepared to be part of . . . solutions'. The potential confrontation with the UAW contrasts with an improvement in recent years in day-to-day management-labour relations at many GM plants, where greater worker involvement in decision-making has been an element of a drive to improve vehicle quality. In spite of big strides in narrowing the quality gap with Japanese rivals, GM has not yet been able to translate this into market share gains. The company lacks contenders in buoyant sectors such as sports utility vehicles, mini-vans and mid-sized saloons. There is also a 1980s legacy of dull, look-alike cars and GM's most faithful buyers tend to be relatively old and are gradually dying off. 'The challenge for GM is to make products which appeal to the baby-boom generation,' says Mr Christopher Cedergren of the Autopacific consultancy. GM can sometimes do this: its luxury Cadillac Seville is a big hit and its compact Saturn car, manufactured with state-of-the-art techniques, is so popular it is in short supply. GM has some formidable strengths: financial clout, strong European operations, a vast US dealer network and great depth in technology. The revolution, then, has a lot of factors working in its favour. But time is not one of them, success is far from certain, and the next 12 months look particularly perilous.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                          CAR MANUFACTURING  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Effect of productivity on cost (Hourly wage of Dollars 37.50)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Manufacturing process                 FORD     CHRYSLER       GM                                     Dollars    Dollars     Dollars  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Vehicle assembly                      909       1,128       1,365 Body stamping                         213         327         396  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Engine manufacturing                  198         234         303 Transmission manufacturing            243         183         294  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Total labour cost per vehicle       1,563       1,872       2,358 Penalty over Ford per vehicle           -         309         795  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Annual production volume (normal)       -   2,000,000   5,000,000 Annual penalty (millions)               -         618       3,975  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Harbour and Associates  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

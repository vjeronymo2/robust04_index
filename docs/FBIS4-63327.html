			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Nugmanov: "From the City Soviet Session: </F> Budget Deficit and Emergency Budget"]    [Text] Budget deficit and emergency budget--these were  undoubtedly the words most frequently heard on the first day of  the 18th session of the Kazan City Soviet which opened  yesterday. Indeed, the city's economy had a deficit overall of  6.3 billion rubles [R] at the end of 1993, and predictions for  the current year show this could grow to R181 billion! City  authorities have therefore been forced to adopt emergency  financial measures. True, inroads have somehow managed to be  made in mending the deficiencies of last year's budget,  primarily through diligence on the part of the tax inspectorate  and efforts by the city administration and a number of  enterprises. But now, how do we "leap over the financial abyss"  of the current year?    V. Titov, director of the city's Finance Administration,  cited a number of emergency measures in his presentation during  the session aimed at extricating the city from its crisis:  replenishment of the working capital of city enterprises, the  introduction of promissory notes in clearing-account  transactions, and even state regulation of prices and wages, etc.    In her supplementary report, T. Antropova, chairman of the  Planning and Budget Commission of the city soviet, also  attempted to locate nontraditional sources of revenue, not  overlooking the prospect of conducting lotteries and auctions,  or even of collecting revenue from the Kazan Racetrack.    Deputies taking part in the debates also proposed their  solutions for fortifying the "financial health" of the city.  Thus, G. Naumov called for the establishment of a municipal  bank with all its appropriate infrastructure, following the  example of a number of Russian cities. D. Galyautdinov focused  attention on "hot" facilities that "fell out" of the 1994  budget. In particular, in his view there is no way Kazan can do  without a new trolleybus depot and a number of new automated  telephone exchanges.    Adoption of an emergency budget will assist in resolving a  number of burning issues. Following the allocation of R6.4  billion to meet the city's electric transport needs, the  acquisition and replacement of 48 streetcars and 55 trolleybuses  and the modernization of water and sewage networks become  entirely real prospects.    G. Kobelev, chairman of the Budget and Planning Commission  of  the Tatarstan Republic Supreme Soviet, then took the floor.  Along with the stunning information that the total nonpayments  amount throughout the republic had reached the astronomical  figure of R1 trillion, he provided favorable information  concerning the expected gradual lowering of the interest rate on  bank credits by the end of the year to 190-100 percent, the  planned adoption of a number of new Tatarstan Republic laws, and  an anticrisis program.</p>

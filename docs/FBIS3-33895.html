Another meeting is expected between Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat next week.  The situation can be summed up as follows: There is no  progress on the bilateral tracks and the talks on the  Palestinian-Israeli track are delayed. Our correspondent in  Washington Salim Salim reported to the Voice of Lebanon bureau  in Washington that the Israeli delegation insists on a peace  agreement with Lebanon before discussing Security Council  Resolution 425. Also, the Israeli delegation insists on secret  talks with Syria before lifting the veto on the Golan. The  report did not rule out direct U.S. intercession in the talks  this week.    [Begin Salim recording] There is nothing new regarding the  Arab-Israeli talks being held at the heads-of-delegation level,  which began their second week without results worth mentioning.  Why did the talks fail to make progress? We put the question  to the delegations participating in the talks and to the U.S.  State Department. It seems clear that failure to make progress  on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks is due to the following  reasons: On the Lebanese track, Israel will not pledge to  implement Resolution 425 before Lebanon declares its readiness  to accept a bilateral peace treaty. As for the failure on the  Syrian track, Israel will not declare its readiness to withdraw  from the Golan until after Damascus agrees to negotiate with  Israel secretly, as the Israelis and Palestinians did in Oslo  recently. Damascus rejects this.    The Voice of Lebanon has learned that Itamar Rabinovich,  Israeli ambassador and head of the negotiating delegation with  Syria, asked U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to  convince Syria to agree to secret talks. The U.S. stance was  cautious and the U.S. side did not show any enthusiasm for this  formula. This caused the talks at the heads-of-delegation level  to bog down. Direct U.S. intercession beginning in the middle  of this week cannot be ruled out if chronic and traditional  obstacles are not resolved among the Lebanese, Syrian, and  Israeli delegations.

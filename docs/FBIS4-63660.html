			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian Interior Ministry has called on the  Crimean leadership to reconsider its decision to transfer local  law-enforcement bodies to Crimean jurisdiction. According to a  statement of the ministry collegium distributed Monday [23 May],  Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov "exceeded his powers and  actively interfered in the activities of the law-enforcement  bodies."    "Yuriy Meshkov's decree to remove A. Plyuta as Crimean  interior minister and appoint Valeriy Kuznetsov as acting  minister was made unilaterally, without coordination with the  Ukrainian Interior Ministry, breaching the Ukrainian  Constitution and the law on power-sharing between state power  bodies of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic," the document stated.    According to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, "a  destabilization of the general situation can be seen in Crimea,  the number of serious crimes, often with the use of firearms  continues to grow." In the meantime, Crimean police units are  used to guard radio and television broadcasting installations  allegedly planned to be seized by Kiev instead of preventing and  investigating crimes, the document said.    The authors of the statement assess Kuznetsov's actions to  ensure the safety of people as "unprofessional and inadequate  considering the criminal situation in Crimea." The Ukrainian  Interior Ministry collegium put all responsibility for what is  going on in Crimea and its unpredictable consequences on  Kuznetsov and those forces, which created the conditions for  this situation.</p>

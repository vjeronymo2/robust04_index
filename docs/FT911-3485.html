			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Cannon Street Market reaction to the Pounds 49m cash call from Cannon Street Investments suggests the fashion for rights issues is getting out of hand. Cannon Street is a deeply unsuccessful little conglomerate whose net assets have fallen by 60 per cent in the past two years and whose earnings per share fell 29 per cent last year. Since 1986 it has raised Pounds 100m through share issues - yesterday's not included - and has spent Pounds 130m on acquisitions. In the past year, its borrowings have shot up from Pounds 29m to Pounds 107m. The net result by yesterday morning was a market value of just Pounds 80m. Then came the call, and the shares rose 17 per cent. Part of the reason may be that some of the new paper has been conditionally placed with the group's banker, Bank of Scotland. Should the issue flop, the result will therefore be a partial swap of debt for equity. Cannon Street and its chairman have been here before, when its collapse in the 1974 secondary banking crisis led to it being owned for a while by its then banker, NatWest. But the banks' problems are their own affair. There seems no reason for the equity market to throw good money after bad.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / CIA knew of BNL loans to Iraq, says ex-banker MR Christopher Drogoul, the former Atlanta banker at the centre of America's arms-to-Iraq scandal, yesterday alleged in congressional testimony that US government officials, including those working with the Central Intelligence Agency, were aware of billions of dollars of Iraqi loans he extended on behalf of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. The former BNL Atlanta branch manager, who was brought to Washington yesterday morning from prison in Atlanta, also named for the first time BNL executives in Rome who he said knew of and approved his Iraqi dealings. BNL Rome has denied repeatedly it knew of, or authorised any of, Mr Drogoul's secret loans to Iraq. The House banking committee has spent the past three years probing whether or not the BNL Atlanta loans, which helped finance Baghdad's nuclear and chemical weapons projects, were part of covert aid to Iraq by the Reagan and Bush administrations. Yesterday Mr Drogoul claimed the BNL Atlanta branch 'was no more and no less than a tool of the US government.' Mr Drogoul cited a dinner he attended in Washington with Iraqi and US government officials weeks before the November 1988 presidential election. He said he heard the Americans tell the Iraqis to sign up quickly for more US loan guarantees because 'if Dukakis defeats Bush, the Democrats will cut you off.' Mr Drogoul also said that in a 1989 meeting with Iraqi central bank officials he was told not to worry about his lending 'because we have been working with the CIA and US intelligence for a number of years'. Mr Drogoul has agreed to plead guilty to three minor charges instead of facing a trial that could have earned him life in prison. He said the Rome office knew his Iraqi lending was maintained off official books and named Mr Giacomo Pedde, the former BNL director-general, and Mr Angelo Florio, former head of BNL's foreign division, as having known and approved of his Iraqi lending. He said he would make documents available shortly, including letters from US companies to BNL Rome.</p>

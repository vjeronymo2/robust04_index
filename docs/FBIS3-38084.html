			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Sidorov: "President Warns Against </F> Provocations In Sarajevo"]    [Text] As is known, Russian head of state Boris Yeltsin  expressed the hope that all sides in the Bosnian conflict will  observe the cease-fire and will not perpetrate any provocations  against UN forces, including Russian soldiers in Sarajevo.    Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian Federation president's special  representative, before returning to Moscow after his latest tour  of former Yugoslavia, said that the possibility of adventurist  sorties and provocations against the "blue helmets" in Sarajevo  is not ruled out. According to him, there are those among  Muslim figures in Bosnia who are continuing to make neurotic and  sometimes irresponsible statements. The Russian diplomat did  not specify who said what, although it is known that people very  close to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic have repeatedly  called the Russian contingent in Sarajevo "occupiers." Muhamed  Sacirbey, the Bosnian Muslim government's representative at the  United Nations, used the same word recently.    According to a spokesman for the Russian Armed Forces  General  Staff, this "rebuke" should seriously worry both the Russian  leadership itself and Russia's partners among the NATO  countries. Neither the British, nor the French, nor any other  national contingent in the UN force in Bosnia has been attacked  in this way. And if the deliberate defamation of the Russian  "blue helmets," who played a key part in relieving the tension  around Sarajevo, does not stop, Russia, according to him, will  be fully entitled to consider a range of independent measures to  protect its soldiers. That is what France did, for example, by  sending an aircraft carrier group to the Adriatic Sea when Paris  believed the lives of the French servicemen in Bosnia to be in  particular danger.    Nonetheless, Russia's stance on the Bosnian conflict remains  the same. No ultimatums or threats of intervention by force  will help resolve the crisis, which has a considerable  international as well as internal dimension. Russian  diplomacy's aim at the present stage is to make the cease-fire  in Sarajevo the breakthrough to peace in Bosnia as a whole. And  this will be achieved through close cooperation with the United  Nations and NATO. This is the aim of the new Russian initiative  on a summit meeting to discuss ways of stopping the war in  former Yugoslavia, to be attended by the United States, Russia,  France, Britain, and Germany. The foundation for the success of  the conference exists. At the Bonn meeting on Tuesday there was  unanimity, according to observers, among the Europeans,  Americans, and Russians on a number of aspects. Chiefly on the  fact that all countries interested in a settlement of the  conflict must use all their political authority to pressure the  warring sides into accepting the terms of the EC peace plan with  regard to the territorial division of Bosnia and Herzegovina.    Western capitals' initial reaction to Russia's initiative  varied. The British Foreign Office has so far refrained from  commenting, traditionally deferring to Washington. The United  States, in turn, is in no hurry to assess the initiative,  believing that a "summit meeting would require a great deal of  preparation." There was a neutral, "if not negative" reaction  from Rome. "The fact that Italy was not named among the  participants in the proposed meeting made a negative impression"  on Italian Foreign Minister B. Andreatta.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jacques de Barrin: "A Very Political Soldier"] </F>   [Text] On Sunday 16 January, when he appeared on the TV  screen in the middle of prime time to call the entire political  class to order, many Algerians told themselves--once their  surprise was over--that General Lamine Zeroual, who had been  recalled from retirement six months earlier to become minister  of defense, was someone who might have to be reckoned with. Had  he not warned the country's "living forces" that it was their  "national duty" to "help overcome the crisis"? Had he not  promised everyone that "the Armed Forces will not stand idly by  in the face of dangerous deviations and excesses"? Had he not  given his compatriots reason to hope that "the desired rupture  depends on the establishment of a new national system"?    Lamine Zeroual was born in Batna, "capital" of the Aures  Mountains and site of the first struggles for independence, on 3  July 1941. His fellow soldiers Gen. Khaled Nezzar, former member  of the Higher State Council, and Gen.l Bennabes Gheziel, the  current commandant of the Gendarmerie, are from the same town.  At 16 years of age, Zeroual joined the ranks of the National  Liberation Army (ALN). When peace came, he was sent abroad for  military training: first to Moscow and then to Paris. Pursuing a  conventional and uneventful career, Zeroual was given command of  the Applied Weapons School in Batna in 1975 and then of the  Combined Arms Military Academy in Cherchell in 1981. After that  he was named head of several military regions in succession:  Tamanrasset in the Sahara in 1982, Bechar on the Moroccan border  in 1984, and Constantine in the eastern part of the country in  1987.    After being promoted to general in 1988, Zeroual was  appointed commanding general of the ground forces. His military  career was interrupted at that point: as the result of  disagreement with Chief of Staff Gen. Nezzar and President  Chadli, both of whom supported a professional military no longer  under the control of officers from the ALN, he hung up his  uniform in December 1989. He was appointed ambassador to  Romania, but remained in that post for less than a year,  preferring to retire completely from public life. Contrary to  all expectations, Zeroual, who is married and has three  children, again stepped to the front of the political stage last  10 July, when he was called upon to succeed Gen. Nezzar as  minister of defense. On 24 October, during his first public  speech, he called on "the political and progressive forces" to  "work together to find a consensus solution to the crisis before  the end of the year." In his eyes, that solution "must conform  to the ideals of November (1954)."  <H5>  `Loss of Confidence' </H5>   On 16 January, the untalkative but very "political" soldier  became insistent, deploring "the weakness of a system that  allowed the emergence of a parasitic ideological  movement"--meaning the Islamic movement. Acknowledging "the loss  of confidence in a government whose words are in complete  contradiction with its actual practice," he advocated a "real  break with the behavior and management methods of the past."    Will Gen. Zeroual keep his word? He is not well-known to the  public, and no one knows exactly how he will behave with the  reins of power in his hands. Meeting with him during a visit to  Algiers in mid-November, Jean-Pierre Chevenement's first  impression was that the general did not have the makings of a  Pinochet.</p>

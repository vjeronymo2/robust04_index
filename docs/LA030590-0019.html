			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES COURTS;  </P> <P> DECISION ON NARCOTICS CASE IS DISTURBING;  </P> <P> THE MESSAGE THE APPELLATE COURT SENDS TO THE TRIAL JUDGES IS CLEAR -- YOU MUST  ALWAYS BELIEVE THE TESTIMONY OF GOVERNMENT WITNESSES.  </P> <P> Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court added a Santa Ana drug case to its list of  more than 4,000 cases that it refused to hear this year.  </P> <P> That the Supreme Court refused to hear the case should not have raised the  concern it did. The focus instead should have been on the state appellate  court's decision this past July.  </P> <P> On Oct. 22, 1986, two Santa Ana police officers were patrolling a parking lot  for drug traffickers. They saw the defendant sitting on the hood of a car. With  one officer on each side of him, the defendant was asked if it was his car; it  wasn't.  </P> <P> Following additional accusatory questions, he was asked if he had any  identification on him. He handed one of the uniformed officers his wallet,  which contained a small bindle of cocaine.  </P> <P> Prior to trial, the Superior Court conducted a suppression hearing to determine  if the bindle had been produced in violation of the defendant's right to be  free from unreasonable searches and seizures guaranteed to all of us by the  U.S. Constitution.  </P> <P> The legal issue at the suppression hearing was relatively simple: Would a  reasonable person feel free to leave under the circumstances. If, yes, then the  production of the wallet was dumb but not unconstitutional.  </P> <P> After hearing the officers tell their story and observing the defendant in the  courtroom, a local Superior Court judge determined that a reasonable person  would not have felt free to leave. No kidding.  </P> <P> But the joke comes several months later, when the Court of Appeal decides for  itself (without seeing the police officers or the defendant) that their version  of a "reasonable person" would feel free to leave.  </P> <P> The appellate court claimed its decision was compelled by past U.S. Supreme  Court decisions. I don't buy it. This court went out of its way to reverse the  trial judge and reinstate the drug charges.  </P> <P> It's not surprising that the federal court refused to hear the case. If the  California courts have a problem figuring out what a reasonable person in Santa  Ana would do when confronted by two officers who ask accusatory questions, then  why should federal justices 3,000 miles away interfere? The issue is best  determined by a local trial judge who listened to and observed the witnesses in  the courtroom as they reconstructed the Oct. 22 encounter.  </P> <P> Additionally, this case is nothing new for a Santa Ana trial judge. These  judges hear dope cases every day. They see cops testify. One of the primary  functions of the trial judge is to determine who is stretching the truth. This  isn't done in a vacuum as the appellate court seems to think.  </P> <P> The trial judge here ruled that this defendant on this particular day could  reasonably believe he was not free to walk away from these particular police  officers. That finding should not have been set aside on appeal by those judges  who do not do battle in the trenches. We cannot allow our national "war" on  drugs to take such a toll on the judicial system.  </P> <P> I am bothered by the court's actual holding in this case, i.e., a reasonable  person would have believed he was free to walk away from those officers without  further ado. But what is more troubling is that the appellate court put aside  its own institutional rules to overrule the suppression of drugs.  </P> <P> The message this sends to the trial judges is clear: You must always believe  the testimony of government witnesses, for they never stretch the truth.  </P> <P> Anyone who has ever testified in court knows that there is a natural tendency  to flavor the testimony to support one side or the other. To believe that  police officers are immune from this tendency is to believe in fairy tales.  Seasoned trial judges can recognize when testimony begins to lead down the  yellow brick road. In the real world, this defendant was not free to leave. The  Court of Appeal should rejoin the real world.  </P> <P> Constitutional law is not the sole domain of the appellate courts. Indeed, the  vast majority of constitutional decision making is done outside the judicial  system. Every government worker has the capability of violating someone's  constitutional rights. This includes local school boards, city councils,  firefighters and police officers.  </P> <P> These are the people who must implement court decisions that set constitutional  boundaries. That implementation is best reviewed by local trial judges who are  familiar with the reality of everyday government-citizen encounters. Appellate  courts should not overturn those decisions unless there is no basis in fact for  that judge's conclusions.  </P> <P> Respect for constitutional principles will erode if those principles cannot be  applied to our daily involvement with the government. The last place one  expects this erosion to occur is the appellate courts.  </P></p>

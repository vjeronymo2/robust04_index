			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: CERVENKA'S NEW LIFE AS AN OLD WIFE  </P> <P> The past two years have brought major changes to the life of Exene Cervenka. As  vocalist with the seminal L.A. band X, Cervenka was the high priestess of the  L.A. punk scene from 1976 to 1987, when the members of X wandered off to work  on various solo projects. (For the record, the group is not officially broken  up, but hasn't recorded a studio album in nearly three years.)  </P> <P> During her tenure with X, Cervenka's persona was that of a dark and brooding  loner with a stormy disposition fueled on despair and rage. Fans who quaked in  her formidable presence then would hardly recognize her today.  </P> <P> Sitting in a Hollywood coffee shop for an early-morning chat before racing off  to catch a plane, Cervenka is noticeably more relaxed and open than she was  when she stood at the center of the roiling punk scene. The radiantly happy  mother of an 18-month-old son, Henry, she left the fast track of Los Angeles --  the city that was like a muse for X -- for life in a tiny town in Idaho, where  she has lived for a year with her husband, actor Viggo Mortenson. Her neighbors  know nothing of her glory days in Los Angeles, nor that she recently released  her first solo LP, "Old Wives' Tales." And that's how she wants it.  </P> <P> "I moved to Idaho because I wanted to live in a place that still had mountains,  lakes and trees," she says as she struggles to get breakfast into her baby  rather than on the floor. "I thought that would be a nice place to raise my  son, and I've found I really love it there. I doubt if anyone there ever heard  of X and that's fine, because I didn't go there to be a musician -- I went  there not to do that."  </P> <P> She loved Los Angeles when she first moved here from St. Petersburg, Fla., "and  as a writer I was inspired by the duality of wealth and poverty you find here.  I'd never lived in a city prior to coming here, so it was thrilling to me in  many ways. But there came a point where living here was the root of all my  problems."  </P> <P> Though Cervenka's love affair with Los Angeles is over, she spent a good amount  of time here this year working on "Old Wives' Tales," a politicized synthesis  of folk, punk and country that Cervenka describes as "a record for and about  women.  </P> <P> "Women have it harder than men in this society and I don't see that improving  -- in fact, women seem to be getting more unliberated. With people like Madonna  as role models for young girls, women are being taught that what's important is  to be wealthy and sexy, and that they should use the same rotten rules men have  always used to be powerful in a man's world."  </P> <P> Cervenka's feisty views on sexual politics played a central role in the writing  she did with X, and they haven't changed. However, the 10 songs on "Old Wives'  Tales" are markedly different from her earlier work in several respects.  </P> <P> "I wrote the music for these songs and I never wrote music with X," she says.  "I always wanted to, but every time I committed myself to learning the guitar  something would come up. I not only finally found the time in Idaho, but I had  to learn because there was nobody else around to put music to my lyrics.  </P> <P> "I'm also writing about different things now -- the biggest change being that I  don't write about myself anymore. I've lost interest in autobiographical  writing because it's selfish, limiting, and I grew bored with it. I used to  turn to writing about myself when I was totally miserable, but I'm really happy  now, so it doesn't serve that purpose for me anymore."  </P> <P> Featuring guest vocals by Eliza Gilkyson and Julie Christensen, "Old Wives'  Tales" is for the most part a one-woman show, with Exene carrying the weight of  the record alone. But she is eager to share credit with producer Tony Gilkyson,  X's guitarist and a member of her touring band.  </P> <P> "My credibility as a musician has always seemed to be predicated on my  involvement with X and John," she says, referring to John Doe, the band's  bassist-singer and her husband for seven years.  </P> <P> "When John and I split up, certain male musicians treated me differently. I  guess they never really respected me -- I was just part of the baggage that  came along with X and John. Tony's always been great as far as encouraging me,  and that's why I wanted him to produce my record. He really believes in me and  thinks I can sing and write songs. I wouldn't have made this record without  him."  </P> <P> Though Cervenka's other former bandmates are conspicuous in their absence,  their musical imprint can be detected on several songs. Fans hungry for new  music by this well-loved group have latched onto a raucous track titled "He's  Got a She" as being in X's style, but Cervenka disagrees.  </P> <P> "Because it's a little peppier, people are saying that's like an X song but  it's really not. In fact, when I played that song for John, he said it was  pretty good but that it would be better if I put some more chords here and  there -- in other words, if I turned it into an X song," she says with a laugh.  </P> <P> "John and I are still involved in one another's work -- I stayed with him on  this trip to L.A. -- but we haven't worked on songs together for a while. X's  contract with Elektra is done and we haven't figured out if the band is  together or not. We're all busy with other things right now, but if we wanted  to do a benefit for a good cause I think we could."  </P> <P> The main thing Cervenka's busy with right now is gearing up for a three-week  tour of the East Coast (she'll do some L.A. dates in late November) that will  reflect her intensified commitment to social activism.  </P> <P> "This'll be a real low-budget tour and we'll travel very sparsely -- it'll be  four guys in a van with a trailer. I want to do as many benefits as I can, and  I plan to invite charities and activist groups to set up booths at the shows. I  probably won't make any money on the tour but that's OK. If people buy my  record and come and see me, that's nice."  </P> <P> LIVE ACTION: Tickets go on sale Sunday for Eurythmics' Nov. 20 concert at the  Universal Amphitheatre. . . .

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Bodycote rises to Pounds 11.5m despite setback in sales A SHARP fall in interest charges helped profits at Bodycote International, the metal technology group, rise by almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 11.5m last year despite a 12 per cent fall in sales, writes Peggy Hollinger. Mr John Chesworth, joint managing director, said the proceeds of selling Skelmersdale Packaging in December 1990 had reduced interest charges by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 36,000. Gearing was cut from about 28 per cent to less than 5 per cent. The Skelmersdale disposal accounted for the fall in turnover from Pounds 75.5m to Pounds 66.5m for the year to December 31. The group closed Brocklehurst Fabrics, the last of its traditional textile businesses, resulting in a charge of Pounds 797,000 taken below the line. The bulk of Bodycote's business is in metal treatment, first ventured into in 1979, for industries such as aerospace and automotive. Operating profits in the metal technology division moved ahead by 12 per cent to Pounds 6.6m despite a setback in the aerospace industry following the Gulf war. Mr Chesworth said that current trading in these businesses was encouraging. The motor trade was not getting any worse, he said, while 90 per cent of Bodycote's aerospace exposure was in the civil sector. Elsewhere, the workwear rental business produced record profits of Pounds 2.6m, up 20 per cent. Industrial and general operations, which include the packaging arm, saw a 22 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 2.9m, following the Skelmersdale sale. Growth in earnings per share was hampered by the Pounds 2.5m placing of 1m shares in April. Earnings rose from 27.1p to 27.8p. An increase in the final dividend to 5.75p is proposed for a total of 9.25p (8.75p).</p>

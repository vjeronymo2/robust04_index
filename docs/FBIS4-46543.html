			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fedor Yemchenko report: "Officers, Eyes Right! But No </F> Money Left"]    [Text] Mikhail Kolchev, chairman of the Independent Trade  Union of Servicemen Central Committee, and Sergey Obrezanov,  vice president of the State Security Veterans Club, held a press  conference yesterday.    "The social tension in military units and aboard naval  vessels is increasing all the time," Mikhail Kolchev said. "The  Northern Fleet command, for instance, have not received their  pay for three months. Around 140,000 officers have been forced  to rent corners of other people's apartments.    "The president and the government," the Independent Trade  Union of Servicemen leader noted, "have issued dozens of edicts  and decrees aimed at ensuring social protection for servicemen.  But these documents are not working. Local authorities are  impeding in every possible way the implementation of the state  program to build housing for officers discharged to the reserve."    Last year sufficient funds were allocated for these  purposes.  But the regions have only received half of the money. As a  result, not a single [square] meter of housing has been  commissioned in Murmansk. The housing program has been just 3  percent fulfilled.    The suits filed by the trade union with judicial organs  alleging a failure to use state funds properly have not led to  anything. Russian justice could find no legal grounds for  initiating proceedings against those responsible.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Trio halved to Pounds 2.4m and calls for Pounds 6.5m Trio Holdings, the international money and securities broker, blamed 'subdued market conditions' for the halving of pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.08m to Pounds 2.4m in the year to September 30. The group also announced a Pounds 6.5m rights issue to fund its modernisation programme and expand its operations further. The issue, of up to 27.8m new ordinary shares, is on the basis of 1-for-2, priced at 25p. The shares closed 1p higher yesterday at 24p. Mr David Hagan, chairman, said the company had already re-equipped a third of its workforce in its move to develop a comprehensive global money markets operation. He said that during the year Trio had taken management control of a Japanese broker and had also extended and updated its market operations in the London, New York and Frankfurt markets. Mr Hagan added that the group was keen to pursue joint venture opportunities in east Asia. Recent interest rate rises in the UK and US pointed to an upturn in the group's fortunes, he said. Turnover increased by 36 per cent to Pounds 99.1m (Pounds 72.7m). Earnings per share dropped from 3.1p to 0.71p and the dividend for the year is cut to a nominal 0.1p (2.5p). Regent Pacific Group, a Canadian investment company which owns 14.95 per cent of Trio, and Inuvialuit Investments, another Canadian group, have underwritten the issue.</p>

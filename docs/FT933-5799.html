			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Hongkong Bank advances 57% in first half THE Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation - the HSBC Holdings' wholly-owned subsidiary which controls its Asia Pacific activities - yesterday announced a 57 per cent increase in interim profit attributable to shareholders to HKDollars 6.37bn (USDollars 822m), up from HKDollars 4.06bn in 1992. Hongkong Bank registered strong earnings growth from its operations in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, but the figures were also boosted by a sharp reduction in provisions against bad debt. During the first half of 1992, Hongkong Bank wrote off an estimated HKDollars 1.4bn against its exposure to the Olympia &amp; York group, and this was followed by an estimated HKDollars 2.1bn provision against the Canadian property group in the second half of the year. Hongkong Bank's chairman, Mr John Gray, described the outlook for the second half as 'encouraging'. He said: 'The measures taken to correct over-heating in China's economy may mean slower growth for both China and Hong Kong in the short term, but long term they are likely to be beneficial.' At the interim stage, HSBC's Asia-Pacific operations accounted for 75 per cent of the group's pre-tax profit and 37 per cent of its assets. Wardley Holdings, which operates the HSBC's Asian merchant banking and broking activities, achieved results significantly ahead of expectations as a result of a booming Hong Kong stock market and the volatility in international currency markets. There was also a continued turnround from Hongkong Bank of Australia, helped by the strength of its treasury and trade finance divisions. In Hong Kong, the bank registered a substantial increase in trade finance as a result of continuing re-export growth from the neighbouring Chinese province of Guangdong. The company's 61 per cent owned Hong Kong retail bank, Hang Seng Bank, announced a disappointing 17.5 per cent increase in interim profit in spite of booking a HKDollars 259m profit from its sale of Wing On Bank. This reflected the tightening of net interest margins and increasing competition for deposits this sector has faced. However, Hongkong Bank said its local operations had attracted strong loan demand. During the interim period, the bank registered a 13 per cent increase in loans compared with the first half of 1992. See Lex</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Just one funeral, four weddings Sir, I've just caught up with Nigel Andrews' review of Four Weddings and a Funeral (Arts: May 12). He appears to believe that the character I played dies of Aids. He doesn't. Indeed, one of the many reasons that I wanted to play the part was that it is almost unknown nowadays for a gay character to die of anything else. I'm a little bewildered that Nigel Andrews should be so confused about what Aids is like. Much nastier, Mr Andrews, than the heart attack which so decisively and efficiently fells Gareth in Four Weddings. Simon Callow, 7 Agar Grove, London NW1 9SL</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Turkey finds it hard to sell idea of buyer's market in state assets: A look at Ankara's difficulties in realising its critical privatisation programme Mr Tezcan Yaramanci is fond of remarking that privatisation is now a buyer's market. As the man in charge of Turkey's sell-off programme, he still has to convince the buyers. For Turkey's privatisation is at a critical juncture. With access to the debt markets cut off, the government would appear to have little choice but to push ahead with rapid asset sales to bolster the balance of payments and see off a possible debt rescheduling. Yet, only this month, the government has had its way blocked. The constitutional court invalidated its use of decree powers to speed up the programme, with the effect that parliament's approval will have to be sought for any legislative changes to prepare companies for sale. The Turkish programme is suffering from a credibility gap. The latest wrangle over pricing in the oil industry, one of the sectors earmarked for disposal, merely points up the conflicting policy objectives of a government desperate to raise revenues for the budget, but also keen to keep a grip on headline inflation. The companies on offer include oil refining and distribution, telecommunications, the state airline Turk Hava Yollari and a steel concern. Back in May, Mr Yaramanci predicted privatisation receipts would reach around Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in 1994. Today, he is less confident. 'It's still the target we're running after. But if you consider we only managed to raise Dollars 1.7bn, in 10 years since the programme was launched, you know what we're up against,' he says. For few developing countries have talked about privatisation for so long with so few results. In some respects, Turkey's privatisation effort is a casualty of what a US banker called reform fatigue. Even today the government is engaged in little more than a revenue raising exercise - the Thatcherite targets of spreading share ownership and increasing economic efficiency are no longer mentioned. Indeed, in the current financial chaos, public offerings have been abandoned, with Mr Yaramanci concentrating instead on block sales of strategic stakes to industrial or trade buyers. The programme faces three main challenges. First, the international market is abrim with privatisation offers from eastern Europe to Latin America and the Far East. Second, it is all but impossible to put a value on Turkish assets, with the lira having depreciated by around 50 per cent since the start of the year. Exacerbating the problems, the government has yet to clarify key issues like labour restructuring and pricing, without which buyers are not able to forecast future earnings. Third, there are any number of special interest groups who need to be won round to the programme, from labour unions concerned about redundancies, civil servants and politicians worried about loss of status and patronage - even some private sector companies fear increased competition that might result from divestiture. For example, it was on an appeal from Social Democrat deputies that the constitutional court on July 6 overruled the government's fast track legislation. In today's conditions, bankers also point out that any disposal is likely to have to be at a large discount. This could play further into the hands of those who charge that this is little more than a distress sale. 'It's the destiny of the man sitting in this chair,' concedes Mr Yaramanci. 'As you cannot possibly make an auction where all 60m Turks participate, there will always be criticism.' Labour issues remain particularly sensitive. The government has made some progress, introducing a job loss insurance fund which will compensate workers laid off for up to eight months after their dismissal. The catch is that financing for the fund has to come from the sales proceeds from privatisation. As for labour restructuring, there are signs that the government may be backtracking on its earlier pledge to close down the loss-making Zonguldak coal mines and the Karabuk iron and steel works. Mr Yaramanci now talks of a 'partial closure, laying off some personnel'. Only two weeks ago, the government had a foretaste of the sort of battle to come, when it publicly invited domestic bids for its 51 per cent stake in Eregli Iron and Steel company (Erdemir). Mr Yaramanci's comments to reporters that the company was probably not worth its replacement value, pitched him into a slanging match with one of the company's directors, who called his comments 'criminal' and called for a stock exchange inquiry. The decision to go to public tender for Erdemir is understood to have been against the advice of the consultants CS First Boston. The move is seen more as a measure of the pressure Mr Yaramanci is under from the politicians, motivated by the need to show the World Bank and others supporting the privatisation effort that the programme is still on track. Moreover, by inviting local bids, the government is also hoping to see off the criticism that domestic investors have been ignored - a problem which led to court action on earlier sell-offs. Mr Yaramanci is understandably frustrated. However, not all the problems are within his control. The telecommunications sector has been embroiled in an embarrassing legal tussle. In April, Teletas - a joint venture with Alcatel Bell and Turkey's first privatisation - was forced to seek court protection from its creditors, as a result of the failure of the state telecom monopoly PTT to pay for its equipment supplies. The issue has since been resolved with Citibank last week lending Dollars 165m to the government to allow the PTT to settle its debts. However, the incident can hardly have helped the planned PTT privatisation. Conflicting policy objectives are equally apparent in the petroleum sector. Here, the foreign oil majors, now being courted to take a stake in the industry, complain that the government is using its control over the state run Tupras refinery, to hold down domestic oil prices, causing additional losses at both Tupras and the state-run retailer Petrol Ofisi. Mr Yaramanci insists that with privatisation of Tupras, 70 per cent of refining capacity will be in private hands, ensuring a level playing field. 'We will offer comfort and security to investors,' Mr Yaramanci declares. However, in the next breath, he reveals that the government may seek certain industrial conditions 'to protect employment and secure some capacity increases or additional investments'. As one banker put it: 'He may talk about a buyer's market, but then he seems obliged to introduce all these seller's conditions.'</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hungary considers early sale of telecom shares Hungary is considering a quick sale of state shares in Matav, the national telecommunications company, that would dwarf all previous international equity offerings to come out of eastern Europe. At the top of the agenda is a proposal to sell up to 10 per cent of Matav through a private placement with international institutional investors which could raise up to Dollars 300m. Finance ministry and Matav officials said they had not reached a final decision but were exploring options, including that of a private placement. 'That is the question we are discussing night and day,' said Mr Mark von Lillienskiold, an executive director of Matav. A closed offer of Matav shares targeted at western pension and emerging market funds would provide a foretaste of a more comprehensive initial public offering planned for 1995-1996. The mandate to advise on the initial placement is expected to be one of the most lucrative awarded in the region and hotly contested by investment banks. Although about Dollars 4bn in western portfolio investment has flowed into Russia and other east European countries in the last year, most equity has been purchased in small tranches on secondary markets. The sale of Dollars 200m to Dollars 300m worth of Matav would far surpass the Dollars 70m issue by Hungarian retailer Fotex to become the largest single international equity offering by an east European company. An issue of this scale is too much to be absorbed solely by funds specialising on eastern Europe or emerging markets in general. Mainstream pension funds, however, are expected to require more complete accounts than Matav can provide at the moment. Budgetary difficulties have encouraged the Hungarian authorities to bring forward the Matav privatisation. The new Socialist government has declared it will use privatisation revenues to pay down the national debt. Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Ameritech of the US, which last December took a joint stake of 30 per cent in Matav, have also softened their opposition to an early offering. Ameritech in particular had opposed a quick flotation because the price would have been below that at which it entered and it would have had to write down its investment. Salomon Brothers, hired by Matav to study an IPO, recommended that it wait until late 1995 or early 1996. However, Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech now appear ready to accept a compromise whereby the government gets rapid proceeds through a private placement but a full IPO takes place in a more leisurely fashion. They are also discussing a possible increase in their stake.</p>

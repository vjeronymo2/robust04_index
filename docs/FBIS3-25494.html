[passage omitted]    ANC [African National Congress] President Nelson Mandela has  condemned yesterday's attack on his supporters. He said it was  common knowledge that there were people in Natal determined to  disrupt the election.    [Begin Mandela recording] It is something which the people  of  South Africa cannot tolerate, and something which....[pauses] We  are determined that nothing is going to stop us from having this  election. [end recording]    Mr. Mandela was speaking at a meeting of the Patriotic  Front.  The front met behind closed doors today, to be briefed on the  proposed amendments to the constitution. Later journalists were  allowed in. Some of those there today, and the rest of the  multiparty negotiationg council, meet tomorrow at the World  Trade Center to table these amendments. The amendments will  give regions greater powers. But there is still no word on  whether the Inkatha Freedom Party, Bophuthatswana, or the  Conservative Party will attend.    [Begin ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa recording] We  think they are giving consideration to the proposals. We are  made to believe that the Freedom Alliance's top leaders meeting  is going to be held tomorrow, and we trust that there will be  some form of response early in the day. [end recording]</p>

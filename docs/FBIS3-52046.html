A statement issued by the Standing Committee on Foreign  Relations, which circulated today among the delegates,  reaffirmed this fact cannot be ignored by anyone "honestly  interested in helping the Cuban people overcome the current  situation."    It points out that "no country in Latin America has ever  been  subjected to such overwhelming pressure, or withstood the  hostility that Cuba continues to suffer, even though the Cold  War is supposed to be over."    The communique states the Caribbean island is living under a  partial military blockade, even though top U.S. political  leaders have rule out a possible military intervention before  the international community.    It states the U.S. Armed Forces have created a plan around  Cuba that would allow them -- with the use of tactical aviation,  aircraft carriers, and cruise missiles launched from air and sea  platforms -- to deal a hard blow in a short period of time, by  surprise or not, against important Cuban military, political,  and economic targets.    It adds the search for information on this country continues  to be one of the U.S. intelligence community's main priorities.    According to a legislative study, a total of 88 flights with  radio electronic reconnaissance planes of various types were  made up through 31 October 1993. In 1992, only 114 flights took  place.    After recalling that the Guantanamo naval station is not  important to the United States in a strategical and military  sense, the communique points out that the station was reinforced  with ships during the first six months of 1993 and that, by  year's end, the government of President Bill Clinton had ordered  a new deployment of power given the Haitian situation.    The Assembly also reported that the CIA's cover-operations,  which include attacks, sabotage, simulated self-inflicted  aggression, etc., and the CIA's support for terrorist groups  that openly operate from U.S. territory violate the Neutrality  Act.    According to the legislative commission, despite statements  by State Department officials that the government would not  allow that document to be violated, work being done by terrorist  organizations of Cuban origin in the United States is publicly  evident.    Another paragraph of the declaration charges that a frenetic  radio offensive, which is justified on the alleged principle of  free flow of information, is being unleashed at this time  against the Caribbean island under Washington's protection.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Aerostructures Hamble to join market with Pounds 90m tag Aerostructures Hamble Hold-ings, the former British Aerospace aircraft components subsidiary, yesterday announced plans for a stock market flotation valuing the company at up to Pounds 90m. NM Rothschild, which is advising the Hampshire-based group, said funds raised by the float would be used to finance future capital expenditure and repay borrowings incurred in its Pounds 47.6m management buy-out from BAe. Although the company has secured some lucrative orders since the 1992 buy-out, its ability to win further large contracts is understood to require a substantial capital injection. Mr Andy Barr, chief executive, said resources had been drained by recent work on components for the Boeing 737-700, the US aircraft maker's new short-haul model. 'It has soaked up a fair bit of capital. The flotation would help us with other orders which we are confident of winning,' he said. Despite those prospects, the company still depends heavily on BAe, for which it manufactures Hawk and Harrier fuselages as well as components for the Avro 146. That dependence, however, declined from 92 per cent of turnover in 1992 to less than 80 per cent last year. Mr Barr, a former Rover Group managing director, said new customers - including Vought and Northrop - had been attracted by improved efficiency. Operating margins, meanwhile, have increased following the introduction of Japanese-style manufacturing practices by managers recruited mainly from Rover. Those practices paid off last year with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.7m, compared with Pounds 1.7m in the eight months following the April 1992 buy-out. The improved profits were achieved on lower turnover of Pounds 70.44m against a pro-forma 1992 total of Pounds 71.3m. Lord King, Aerostructures' chairman, admitted trading was difficult, but said profits had risen year on year, and 'the group was determined to deliver further improvements'.</p>

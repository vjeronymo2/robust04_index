			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> JURY: 16 YEARS FOR BUS DEATHS  </P> <P> A jury today recommended a 16-year prison sentence for the man convicted of  causing a fiery crash that killed 27 people on a church bus in the nation's  worst drunk-driving accident.  </P> <P> Under Kentucky law, Larry Mahoney would have to spend eight years in prison  before he could be considered for parole. He was tried on 27 counts of murder,  which carried a life sentence, but the jury convicted him Thursday of 27 counts  of second-degree manslaughter, a lesser charge.  </P> <P> Mahoney, 36, was composed as he stood to hear Judge Charles Satterwhite read  each of the sentence recommendations, but he appeared to have tears welling in  his eyes by the time the judge concluded.  </P> <P> Satterwhite must schedule a formal sentencing. He could give Mahoney a lighter  sentence than the jury recommended but cannot exceed the jury's recommendation.  </P></p>

Presidents of major mining companies belonging to the Japan  Mining Industry Association made the request in a breakfast  meeting with Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry  minister.    Mining companies are struggling due to slack demand from the  auto and precious metals industries, the presidents of Sumitomo  Metal Mining Co., Mitsubishi Materials Corp., Dowa Mining Co.  and other companies told Kumagai.    They also requested the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) to promote a policy to ensure "smooth purchases"  abroad of mineral ores.    Kumagai told the executives the ministry will work hard to  help the mining industry by improving fiscal and tax systems,  MITI officials said.</p>

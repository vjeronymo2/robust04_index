			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Shortfall in G7's aid for Russia predicted OFFICIAL financial support for Russia this year from the Group of Seven countries is likely to fall short of the Dollars 43.4bn (Pounds 28.1bn) pledged at the recent G7 meeting in Tokyo, according to the Institute of International Finance. The IIF, a Washington-based economic research body founded by leading international banks, believes that only Dollars 32bn of official western support will be provided this year, largely because it expects International Monetary Fund disbursements will reach only Dollars 4bn compared with the Dollars 13.1bn IMF total agreed in Tokyo. Mr Anthony Bottrill, IIF deputy managing director, said in London yesterday that half the planned IMF standby facility of Dollars 4bn might be disbursed this year together with half the new Dollars 3bn 'systemic transition facility' that was agreed in Tokyo. The IIF does not expect Russia to qualify for the Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund first promised by the G7 last year and included in the Tokyo package. The IIF has calculated that western official support for Russia last year totalled Dollars 17.55bn, compared with a promised Dollars 24bn. While the Dollars 1bn of finance supplied by the IMF was Dollars 9bn less than projected, largely because of the non-activation of the stabilisation fund, official debt rescheduling was higher than expected and made up most of the shortfall. But Mr Bottrill said capital flight from Russia undid the good provided by western finance last year - an estimated Dollars 8bn in 1992, with funds leaving Russia at a rate a rate of Dollars 1bn a month from the end of the first quarter onwards. As much as Dollars 1.5bn of flight capital may have flowed into Russia in the first quarter of 1992, when tight fiscal and monetary policies were in place. IIF economists believe capital reflows will only resume after Russia has significantly raised interest rates and oil prices.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix K&hyph;III&hyph;B. Cultures of viable organisms containing recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molecules shall be handled in a closed system (e.g., closed vessel used for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propagation and growth of cultures) or other primary containment equipment (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological safety cabinet containing a centrifuge used to process culture fluids) which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is designed to reduce the potential for escape of viable organisms. Volumes less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 10 liters may be handled outside of a closed system or other primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containment equipment provided all physical containment requirements specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;A are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;III&hyph;C. Culture fluids (except as allowed in Appendix K&hyph;III&hyph;D) shall not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be removed from a closed system or other primary containment equipment unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules have been inactivated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a validated inactivation procedure. A validated inactivation procedure is one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which has been demonstrated to be effective using the organism that will serve as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the host for propagating the recombinant DNA molecules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;III&hyph;D. Sample collection from a closed system, the addition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials to a closed system, and the transfer of culture fluids from one closed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system to another shall be conducted in a manner which minimizes the release of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aerosols or contamination of exposed surfaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;III&hyph;E. Exhaust gases removed from a closed system or other primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containment equipment shall be treated by filters which have efficiencies equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters or by other equivalent procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., incineration) to minimize the release of viable organisms containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant DNA molecules to the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;III&hyph;F. A closed system or other primary containment equipment that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has contained viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules shall not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opened for maintenance or other purposes unless it has been sterilized by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> validated sterilization procedure. A validated sterilization procedure is one which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been demonstrated to be effective using the organism that will serve as the host  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for propagating the recombinant DNA molecules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;III&hyph;G. Emergency plans required by Sections IV&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(6) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV&hyph;B&hyph;3&hyph;c&hyph;(3) shall include methods and procedures for handling large losses of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> culture on an emergency basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix K&hyph;IV. Biosafety Level 2 (BL2)_Large Scale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix K&hyph;IV&hyph;A. Spills and accidents which result in overt exposures to organisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing recombinant DNA molecules are immediately reported to the Biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety Officer, Institutional Biosafety Committee, NIH/ORDA, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate authorities (if applicable). Reports to NIH/ORDA shall be sent to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Medical evaluation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance, and treatment are provided as appropriate and written records are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;IV&hyph;B. Cultures of viable organisms containing recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molecules shall be handled in a closed system (e.g., closed vessel used for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propagation and growth of cultures) or other primary containment equipment (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class III biological safety cabinet containing a centrifuge used to process culture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fluids) which is designed to prevent the escape of viable organisms. Volumes less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 10 liters may be handled outside of a closed system or other primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containment equipment provided all physical containment requirements specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;B are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;IV&hyph;C. Culture fluids (except as allowed in Appendix K&hyph;IV&hyph;D) shall not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be removed from a closed system or other primary containment equipment unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules have been inactivated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a validated inactivation procedure. A validated inactivation procedure is one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which has been demonstrated to be effective using the organism that will serve as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the host for propagating the recombinant DNA molecules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;IV&hyph;D. Sample collection from a closed system, the addition of materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a closed system, and the transfer of cultures fluids from one closed system to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another shall be conducted in a manner which prevents the release of aerosols or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination of exposed surfaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;IV&hyph;E.

Rotating seals and other mechanical devices directly associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a closed system used for the propagation and growth of viable organisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing recombinant DNA molecules shall be designed to prevent leakage or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be fully enclosed in ventilated housings that are exhausted through filters which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have efficiencies equivalent to high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through other equivalent treatment devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

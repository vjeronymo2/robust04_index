			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> BENNETT FEARS RISE IN COCAINE VIOLENCE  </P> <P> A shortage of cocaine indicated by rising prices in some cities may trigger  increased violence as "the same number of dogs" compete for "a smaller number  of bones," national drug control director William J. Bennett predicted. He said  wholesale price increases found by the Drug Enforcement Administration in Los  Angeles and New York indicate there is a shortage, a conclusion the DEA itself  has not yet drawn.  </P> <P> "It looks as if we are beginning to have positive effect on the flow of cocaine  into this country," Bennett said. The DEA said a kilogram of cocaine (2.2  pounds) can fetch as much as $35,000 at wholesale in New York, up from $14,000  to $18,000 last fall, and $25,000 in Los Angeles, where wholesale prices have  risen in a similar period from $10,000 per kilogram in lots of 10 or more and  $15,000 for smaller amounts.  </P></p>

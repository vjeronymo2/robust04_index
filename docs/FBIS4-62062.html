			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk believes that  the priority task of the first session of the new Supreme Soviet  is to determine the issue on the June presidential elections,  namely whether to hold them on June 26, as the previous  parliament decided, or after the adoption of the necessary  legislative basis.    During his meeting with the deputies of the new parliament  on  Tuesday in Kiev Kravchuk expressed the opinion that "from the  very beginning the Supreme Soviet should pay attention to the  conclusion of the work over Ukraine's new Constitution."    "The absence of a new Constitution makes the state's  building  and the work on choosing authorities for the various branches of  power difficult," noted Kravchuk.    In his words, under the current situation the people will  come to the elections having no notion "what the results will  be."    At the same time Kravchuk pointed out that "it will be  difficult to adopt the Constitution as a whole because "it is  necessary to at least adopt serious well-balanced decrees on  separate institutions of power to give reliable legal support to  the election campaign."</p>

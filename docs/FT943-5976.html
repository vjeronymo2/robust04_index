			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A costly presence - New research into the price of promoting and maintaining brands Even before the great soap war erupted this summer between Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, the two companies were together expected to spend more than Pounds 75m in 1994 advertising and promoting their Persil and Ariel brands in the UK. That is more than last year's total annual sales of Britain's 28th biggest grocery brand, Felix catfood. On its own, Persil's 1993 marketing and advertising expenditure of around Pounds 38m was equivalent to the total supermarket and high street grocery sales of Cadbury's Dairy Milk chocolate, and Ariel's Pounds 35m to the total grocery sales of Schweppes mixers. Such can be the cost of maintaining and refreshing a top grocery brand - a cost which is making it prohibitive even for many household names to sustain their special place in consumers' hearts by using traditional marketing strategies. Economies of scale are making life hard even for medium-sized brands. The average cost of maintaining a top 10 brand last year was Pounds 15m, about 7 per cent of sales. But for the top 70 as a whole it was Pounds 8m, more than 10 per cent of sales, according to a new study by Added Value, a marketing consultancy. For the first time, its research estimates both advertising and normally hidden 'below the line' expenditure figures. The latter covers direct marketing, sales promotion, trade promotions and public relations. 'Many brands have an uphill struggle to enter the mainstream,' comments Rahul Sen, a manager at Added Value. 'If they can create critical mass then the ratio of advertising and promotion expenditure to sales falls rapidly. But if the marketing is not quite working, the ratio becomes very high.' Sen suggests that marketers in many categories of product are too influenced by competitors' expenditure and advertising patterns, rather than concentrating on what is needed to build a credible overall presence. Only a few can afford to create that presence on television. He adds: 'The question is what happens to the rest. A lot of small brands will die.' Sen's gloomy predictions are backed by as yet unpublished research conducted by OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants earlier this year. For one of the top 10 food companies, the marketing costs of a typical food product launch - currently running at an average Pounds 3m - will take 2 per cent of operating profits, says Michael Jary, OC&amp;C director. But for a company ranking 31-40 they will account for 27 per cent of profits. For one between 51 and 60 they will gobble up 84 per cent. 'Escalating marketing costs suggest that fewer products are getting sufficient support during launch to create a defensible franchise,' says Jary. 'You don't have to be too far down the league before you can't launch a new product.' Companies have already developed branding and marketing strategies which respond to these cost pressures. For example, all commercials for Cadbury chocolates carry the corporate name; the budget is then evenly spread across selected brands, including Crunchie bars. Others, such as Bournville chocolate, are not advertised at all. Marketers at Unilever's Birds Eye Walls subsidiary now have a strict umbrella branding policy whereby all the company's advertising is designed to enhance the standing of its various sub-brands, and all new product advertising is equally designed to 'freshen' the Birds Eye image. Says John Sharpe, Birds Eye Walls' chairman: 'With the costs of supporting and developing a brand you have got to look for the best synergies.' Even so, he adds, 'we are definitely removing support from certain products to concentrate resources on priority brands, and we are also having to rationalise our product range'. 'Most companies just cannot afford to keep their whole load of brands fresh, so they are trimming, cutting their tail-end brands off,' comments John Brady, head of the consumer goods and retail practice of McKinsey, the management consultancy. This, he points out, is 'emotionally a very hard thing to do. But if you assign all relevant costs - not just advertising and promotion spends - you often find they are losing you money'. Now, however, some marketers are realising that even the synergies generated by portfolio rationalisation and classic umbrella branding may no longer be enough. Next month, for example, the first corporate brand-building campaign for Heinz should appear on Britain's television screens. Heinz has decided to withdraw all product advertising from television to concentrate its resources on direct marketing. Television will be for the corporate brand alone. This is not because the company is now a rumoured takeover target, but because of the more mundane dilemma highlighted by Added Value's research. With an advertising budget of Pounds 15m, Heinz had an average of just Pounds 0.8m to support each of its leading categories, such as baked beans, soups, baby foods and ketchups. It would have been 'a Herculean task' for Heinz to support its 350 separate variants on television, agrees a spokesman. 'There was no way we could do it. We reached a point where it was time for us to review our whole marketing strategy.' Heinz's rethink and Added Value's research suggest that for those many brands whose total sales struggle to keep pace with the marketing spends of 'power brands' such as Persil and Ariel, more such 'put up or shut up' decisions will have to be made. Comments Roger Ramsden of the Boston Consulting Group. 'Most companies are reappraising their brand portfolios as a consequence of the cost of maintaining their brand presence. Many are beginning to include private label production (for retailers) in their plans.' That is the shut-up choice. The put-up alternative? Says Sen: 'If you have classical television-led brand management and you only have Pounds 1m-Pounds 2m to spend, you are likely to lose. So you have to look at non-conventional methods to avoid the costs of entry.' Heinz has chosen a database marketing route. Muller, the sensation of the UK yoghurt market, forced its way into the branded goods charts by ploughing all its marketing budget into distribution  -offering retailers margins they could not refuse, notes Jary. As the cost of branding combines in a pincer movement with rising retailer power, more grocery brand marketers will have to develop similarly innovative strategies.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Markets: Paying a high price for poor earnings - London I am delighted to hear from the Prime Minister that policy will not alter. (Kenneth Clarke) will understand if I say that he thus comes to the Treasury at a most favourable time. Much of the hard work has been done and he should be able to enjoy increasingly encouraging trends for a long time to come. Norman Lamont House of Commons INVESTORS are hoping for Norman Lamont's farewell prediction to come true with as much fervour as they once clung to his promise of recovery ahead. Few disagree with his judgment that 'the recession is now behind us'; the fluttering hopes attach to his forecast of 'increasingly encouraging trends'. If trends do not continue to improve, the current level of the stock market is hard to justify. A rash of brokers' circulars this Friday pointed out that the price/earnings ratio for the FT-Actuaries '500' (the industrial and commercial components of the All-Share index) had risen to more than 19, above the level touched before the 1987 crash. This rise is not due to any sudden spurt in the overall level of share prices - as the chart shows, the market as a whole, heavily influenced by the biggest companies, continues to move sideways. Rather, it is due to the impact on the 'earnings' side of the p/e ratio of so many poor results over the past few months. The market tended to treat them phlegmatically because those results were not much worse than had been expected, and because they could be seen as exaggerated by the FRS3 accounting standard. But by absolute standards, they were very poor: S G Warburg's figures show reported earnings running nearly 12 per cent below the already depressed level of a year ago. Historic figures, of course, are just that: history. A more relevant number is the prospective p/e ratio. Here, there has not yet been any great drift upwards. The prospective figure for the calendar year 1993, calculated by the IBES service in New York based on the consensus earnings expectations of analysts around the world who follow London stocks, is 14.4. That figure has remained almost unchanged since the FT first began reporting it every Monday earlier this year. Still, it is only a comfortable multiple if the profits growth that analysts expect indeed materialises; and if profits continue to grow in later years. Neither of those is a racing certainty. In the short run, reported earnings could continue to deteriorate. Even when they bounce back, there may not be as much resilience in the bounce as the market - and Norman Lamont - would like to think. One ominous sign was the results of Pilkington, announced on Thursday. Pre-tax profits for the financial year just ended were down from Pounds 96m to Pounds 41m, on sales more or less unchanged at Pounds 2.6bn. The dividend  -cut a year ago for the first time since the company went public in 1970 - was cut again, by a third. There had been some encouraging signs, said Sir Antony Pilkington the group's chairman, especially the 'amazing' impact of sterling's devaluation on UK competitiveness. But there was also 'a dramatic collapse' in the German market, where the situation remains uncertain. Pilkington is, perhaps, unusually unfortunate: its shareholders could be forgiven for wondering how they seem to have missed out on the German boom while catching the full force of the recession. Since BTR's abortive bid for the company in 1987, Pilkington has underperformed the All-Share by 61 per cent. But its woes are not all sui generis. Other British companies which struggled to raise their exposure to continental Europe during the single market Europhoria are also suffering the consequences. The market's worries about European growth are one important influence on the truly remarkable divergence of the lines shown in the chart. The big companies in the FT-SE 100 have gone nowhere for weeks, while the smaller companies in the Mid 250 and SmallCap - which derive a much greater proportion of their sales and profits from the UK domestic economy - have continued to race ahead. The continued flow of rights issues from medium-sized companies has done little to dent this sentiment. On Thursday, for example, Wimpey announced a one-for-four issue at a discount of 21 per cent, to raise Pounds 104m. The company said it would be using the proceeds to buy land for housebuilding - the sort of statement that would have sent shareholders stampeding for the exit only nine months ago. This year, encouraged by the near trebling of the share price since September, investors were prepared to view the prospect with equanimity: the share price slipped only 3p on the day of the announcement, to 184p. It closed on Friday at 178p, a fall of 1p on the week. Also basking in shareholders' approval this week were the three companies that once formed part of Sir Ernest Harrison's empire: Racal, Vodafone and Chubb. All reported strong earnings, allowing Sir Ernest to wrong-foot the critics who jeered at his promise to enrich shareholders by splitting up the company: the components of the old Racal have together healthily outperformed the market since the first spin-off in 1988. Politics is harsher than business: Norman Lamont did not survive in office long enough to enjoy such revenge. How much he enjoys his time on the back benches will depend, in part, on whether he is right in believing that his policies will survive his departure. Kenneth Clarke's speech to the white-tie-and-tails ranks of the City on Tuesday will give the first detailed answer to that. Like the stock market, the new Chancellor perhaps has a nervous suspicion that the times are not quite as favourable as his predecessor makes out.</p>

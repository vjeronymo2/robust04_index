			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / People: Intrum Justitia Bo Goranson, founder and largest shareholder of Intrum Justitia, Europe's biggest debt collection agency, has resumed the position of chief executive. His resumption of executive duties follows the sudden announcement in early November that Gert van Laar had resigned as chief executive after only six months. Van Laar, a straight-talking Dutchman, left after what company advisers called a lack of 'chemistry with the other operating directors'. He is understood to have had an options package, cancellation of which has been taken into account in compensation that will be revealed in the next annual report.

The new appointments are Peter Hickson, MAI's finance director; Harry Groen, chairman of NCM, the Dutch credit insurer; Hans Bagner, a London partner in Vinge, the Scandinavian law firm. Goranson will be resigning from the supervisory board on January 14 and will be succeeded as chairman by Fred Chiswell. ***** Graeme Pearson, md of BTR Nylex, is appointed to the main BTR board. ***** Tim Clarke has been appointed commercial director designate of LAWSON MARDON Can, and commercial director of Lawson Mardon Decorated Containers; Richard Blake, commercial director of Lawson Mardon Can, will retire in December. ***** David Corkhill, formerly operations director of Nissan Plant &amp; Industrial Machinery, has been appointed operations director UK and Ireland for CLARK MATERIAL HANDLING EUROPE. ***** Stuart Cruickshank, finance director of Haagen-Dazs UK, has been promoted to controller for Haagen-Dazs Europe based in Paris. ***** John Garrett, md of the recreation division, has been appointed a director of the RANK ORGANISATION. ***** Graham Rider, BhS finance director and group finance director designate, has been appointed to the board of STOREHOUSE. ***** Jim Butler, director of BAT Industries' corporate management training education, is appointed director of the POST OFFICE's training and development group from January. ***** Chris Burton, formerly divisional financial controller at Bourne Leisure Group, has been appointed finance director and company secretary of ABB Kent-Taylor in succession to John Martin who has moved to ABB Kent Meters.</p>

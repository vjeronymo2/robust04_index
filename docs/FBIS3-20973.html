			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed L.M.: "TAB Adapted for Use in Small Batch </F> Production"]    [Text] Are electronic systems manufacturers interested in  the development in France of a TAB (Tape Automated Bonding)  process for assembling bare chips onto tape? Asked in a survey  that could lead to the creation of a company within two years,  this question again seems reasonable given the launch of the  market in multichip modules (MCM's) which consist of several  very complex bare chips assembled onto the same substrate (for  use in military, aeronautical, computing, and telecommunication  applications).  <H5>  Chips on Tape More Reliable </H5>   Chips mounted on tape can be tested before they are  assembled  in the module and thus, even in short production runs, present a  considerable financial advantage over bare chips connected by  wires or beads (flip-chips) whose faults can only be detected  after assembly. According to certain experts, tests on modules  containing the most complex chips can result in a reject rate of  up to 30 percent. For complex MCM's, assembling the chips onto  tape also has the advantage of reducing the limitations placed  on the connection pitch by the wire method (currently used for  most applications) and without seriously affecting the chip  design. Karel Kurzweil, in charge of microassembly technologies  at Bull, explains: "The dimples for the connection of the chips  on the tape are in the same locations as the pins for wire  soldering, whereas bead connection over the whole area of the  chip means that designers have to redefine the entire mounting  process." Until now, and despite these advantages, the  manufacturers of sophisticated electronic systems have snubbed  TAB technology. Tape-mounted chips require expertise in a large  number of manufacturing processes (tape preparation, putting the  dimples on the wafers, mounting the chips on the tape, and  assembling the TAB chips on the substrate) and thus require  large scale manufacture to amortize all the machinery needed.  The difference between the requirements of potential users and  the requirements of TAB technology therefore dissuaded many  outfitters. It is probable, on the other hand, that the creation  of a more flexible structure, such as that envisaged by the  general arms directorate [DGA], which would handle the assembly  of chips on tape at a reasonable cost even for small and medium  production runs, would interest MCM manufacturers.    The participants in the DGA's project know that the cost of  the service proposed will be the decisive factor. Mr. Kurzweil,  the Bull representative in the DGA project, said: "In the TAB  process, the large number of tools needed to produce the tape is  one of the drawbacks of the technology for short production  runs. You should reckon on between 30,000 to 80,000 French  francs-worth [Fr] of equipment for each production series."  However, he assured us: "We are currently trying to reduce  these costs."  <H5>  Will Euro-TAB Packaging Become a Reality? </H5>   Dassault Electronique and Bull have been commissioned by the  DGA's electronics and computing technical department [STEI] to  study the contribution that could be made by TAB technology to  military electronic systems. The two microelectronics  specialists, assisted by other partners in the fields of silicon  and tape, will have to produce prototypes to prove the economic  viability of this type of component. At the same time, the STEI  has surveyed potential users (military and civil) to determine  what their future requirements in terms of TAB components will  be. The results of the survey will be published in the second  quarter of this year. According to Roland Even, manager of the  STEI project, between Fr5 million and Fr10 million will be  invested in these studies. If the results of these evaluations  and the survey are favorable, an industrial structure,  christened Euro TAB packaging could be created within two years.  It will specialize in the supply of tape bonded chips to civil  and military outfitters for small and medium-term production  runs. The structure will in particular take charge of tape  design and control, the production of the dimpling on the  silicon wafers, the assembly of the chips on the tape, and their  testing and burn-in. Systems manufacturers will then be  responsible for assembling the chips onto the substrate. Roland  Even was reluctant to disclose precise details of how this  potential company will be structured financially, but he said  that it will accept production runs ranging from just a few  chips to several thousand, and will initially employ several  dozen people.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Deficit widens at Cathay Intl Cathay International, the China investment vehicle formed from the shell of Stonehill Holdings, announced pre-tax losses widened to Pounds 515,000 for the six months to September 30, against Pounds 170,000, but said it was on target in building up its asset base in China. Turnover rose marginally to Pounds 1.17m, but operating profit fell as a result of an increase in activities in China which have yet to make a contribution. The company is currently renovating the Fuyuan Landmark Hotel in Shenzhen, which will reopen in the first quarter of 1994. In addition, Cathay is proceeding with the redevelopment of a 500,000 sq m site in central Beijing and upgrading the adjoining Beijing Xiyuan hotel. Phase one of the project should commence during 1994, and final completion is due in 1999. The project is 60 per cent owned by Cathay. At the interim stage, however, the company's main income source was the Stonehill Business Park in north London. Mr James Buchanan, chairman, said: 'The results for the year to March 31 1994 will cover a period of significant transition from which the trend in respect of the importance of the activities in China should be clear.' The company is currently evaluating further projects in China. Its Hong Kong-based parent company, which owns 59 per cent of Cathay's shares, is involved in a number of investments in China. It has focused primarily on property and power projects. Losses per share were 0.086p (0.91p). Cathay has been unable to pay a dividend, due to the absence of distributable reserves. Following High Court approval to reduce its share capital by Pounds 3.8m, directors said the deficit on the profit and loss account had been eliminated and dividends would be resumed 'when appropriate'.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACKS, LATINOS  </P> <P> Congratulations to Frank del Olmo on his articulate essay about the combined  efforts of both blacks and Latinos in their court battle with Los County and  its Board of Supervisors ("Partners, Not Rivals, in County Suit," Op-Ed Page,  Jan. 27). Growing up in Los Angeles in the 1960s, I always thought that had  Latinos and blacks merged together in their fight for civil rights many more  successes and accomplishments would have followed for both groups. I also  suspect that the transition and accessibility for future minority immigrants  would have been made somewhat easier.  </P> <P> As Del Olmo so deftly opined, by working together to change the system all of  us benefit by the use of all of our talents. It would have worked 20 years ago.  Let us not waste another opportunity.  </P> <P> RODNEY K. BOSWELL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

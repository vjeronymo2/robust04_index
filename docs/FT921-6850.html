			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Arts: 'Niagara' and 'Summer Lightning' - Glasgow Citizens Theatre With the enlargement of its Citizens Theatre from a single theatre into a complex of three, Glasgow now has an abundance of year-round theatre that probably no other British city save London can match. The three consecutive evenings that I spent at the end of last week in its three auditoria were all absorbing, rich ones. Standards of acting, direction, design were high. Each play, interestingly chosen, proved rewarding. And the trio add up as a demonstration of both the great range and accomplishment of the Citz. I reported on Monday on the new second theatre and its production of Craig Raine's 1953. The new third theatre, an unclaustrophobic black box, seats the audience (max. 70) on three sides of the action: which concerns Blondin, the celebrated 19th-century tightrope-walker, and Carlo, the young man he once carried on his back on his 15th crossing of Niagara Falls. The play, Niagara (first performed in 1969 in Peru as El cruce sobre el Niagara), is by Alonso Alegria (1940- ). Carlo first enters Blondin's life as a know-all young whippersnapper. He has seen Blondin's every crossing of the Falls; knows which new show-off tricks actually make the crossing easier; is wise to tricks that no other spectator notices; knows, as a bystander, more about the science of tightrope-walking than Blondin does as a practitioner. What burgeons is akin to love. Critic Carlo cannot conceal, though he forgets to express, his intense admiration for artist Blondin's heroic achievements; artist Blondin can only feel grateful for the unparalleled understanding his every act receives from critic Carlo. More than that, Carlo is in love with Blondin's potential. He even touches on Blondin's innermost fantasy; he wants him to train himself to walk on air. When Blondin refuses to try for the impossible ideal of airwalking, it is his idea to carry Carlo across the falls on his shoulders. But can Blondin take such a responsibility on himself? Can Carlo? And yet what they are aiming at is not peril but a state of happiness. In the play's long final scene, they make the crossing (in white acrobats' tights, Blondin standing almost motionless on a strip of ultraviolet light, Carlo perched on his shoulders); and much of what they say is intensely like love-making talk - calling each other's names first urgently as they near the point of greatest danger, then ecstatically as they pass it, and then finally, in a wave of relief as they near safety and Canada, praising each other effusively. But this is not a gay play. Out attention may be drawn to the resemblance of this climactic scene to Tristanic passion, but the two characters are oblivious to it. And the most stimulating and multi-faceted scenes have already occurred. Alegria does not try to make us either character loveable or normal; and this is one of his finest feats. The two performances, discreetly judged, give the play all the right tension. Daniel Illsey, though at first a little studied, gives Carlo the right fervent obsessiveness. Robert David MacDonald, who has translated and directed, also plays Blondin: a nice blend of the practical man and the visionary. * * * Meanwhile across the foyer the first theatre - with that handsome gold-and-black three-tier auditorium that has served the Citz well for years  -is presenting Summer Lightning, the classic PG Wodehouse novel adapted and directed by Giles Havergal. The purist could complain that this is not really a play, that it retains Wodehouse's brilliant narrative descriptions ('it was that gracious hour of a summer afternoon . . . when Nature seemed to unbutton its waistcoat and put its feet up') and that most of the delight it gives its viewers is the same delight they would derive from reading the novel. He could even cavil that the Efficient Baxter has been eliminated and the plot correspondingly reduced . Hard of heart, however, would he be who did not often guffaw here. The device of having characters not only speak their lines in character but also provide Wodehouse's narrative comments works comic wonders. Siobhan Stanley does it with especially hilarious dryness. 'Ah]' she sighs as Millicent Threepwood, then addresses the audience: 'Millicent looked like something that might have occurred to Ibsen in one of his less frivolous moments.' Another effective device is having actors play several roles, sometimes changing costume in full view of the audience. Stephen MacDonald, who excels at this, on one occasion switches from the grave butler Beach into the quavering Lord Emsworth in mid-phrase, while being helped out of his frock-coat and into a tweed jacket. It is hard to describe the breathtaking prettiness of Helen Blaxendale as the chorus-girl Sue Brown. She has, as Nicholas Nickleby once told Newman Noggs, lips and eyes and hair. (Also cheeks, bones, arms . . . ) And she has just the amount of energetic freshness which makes you want such chorus-girls to marry into blue blood and do it some good.</p>

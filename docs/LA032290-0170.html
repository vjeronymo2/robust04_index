			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MID-WILSHIRE;  </P> <P> JEWISH TUTORS SOUGHT  </P> <P> The Bureau of Jewish Education is seeking trained tutors to help the children  of Soviet Jewish immigrants with their schoolwork.  </P> <P> According to a spokesperson for the bureau, more than 1,700 Soviet Jews settled  in Los Angeles in 1989, and 3,000 more are expected this year.  </P> <P> The immigrant parents do not usually speak English, and their children  typically need help with both their English- and Hebrew-language studies.  </P> <P> The bureau, at 6505 Wilshire Blvd., is the educational arm of the Jewish  Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles. It provides services to 25,000  students in Jewish schools and educational programs.  </P> <P> Only skilled tutors are sought because no training is available.  </P> <P> Children to be tutored range in age from 5 to 18.  </P> <P> For more information, call Esther Krisman at (213) 852-7702.  </P></p>

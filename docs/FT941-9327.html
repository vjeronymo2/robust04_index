			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kuwait considers hedging to stabilise oil revenues Kuwait is considering the use of financial hedging instruments such as oil futures to help stabilise government revenues, which have been badly hit by low oil prices. Some international banks are said to have made recent representations to Kuwaiti government officials on the advantages of using futures' contracts to hedge a portion of their oil revenues. They are reported to have have cited Mexico as an example of an oil producer that uses hedging techniques to cover about 10 per cent of its petroleum export revenues. No decision has been made on whether to adopt such a strategy, according to industry officials. But they stress the importance to the country of stabilising government revenues, which are overwhelmingly dependent on the prices of oil and petroleum products. Bankers and industry analysts have suggested in recent months that members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries could reduce their vulnerability to sharp falls in volatile short-term oil prices by adopting hedging strategies. Some Opec members, however, are restricted by domestic laws that bar such practices. The hedging issue is just one element of a current debate in Kuwaiti government circles over ways to reduce the impact of wildly fluctuating oil revenues. One of the most contentious issues is whether Kuwait should expand its international exploration and production activities in non-Opec countries, where any discoveries would fall outside the Opec quota system. Opec has blamed independent producers for undermining already weak oil markets by expanding production at a time of low prices.</p>

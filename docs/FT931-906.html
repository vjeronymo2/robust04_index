			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Severn bridge work halted CONSTRUCTION work on the Pounds 300m project to build a second road bridge across the River Severn was halted yesterday by a dispute over bonuses. About 500 members of the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians staged the one-day stoppage after negotiations with management failed to produce agreement. Ucatt members voted 89 per cent for strike action in a ballot. They will attend a mass meeting on Monday to consider further action.</p>

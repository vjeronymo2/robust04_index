			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHARLES ROTHENBERG  </P> <P> It is a disgrace for the state of California that a criminal such as Charles  Rothenberg is to be loosed shortly onto our streets, with no more incarceration  than that meted out for lesser crimes.  </P> <P> His crime was as heinous as premeditated murder, even worse. He condemned his  young son, David, to unspeakable agony in an unsuccessful attempt to kill him  by burning him alive. He had torture, murder and twisted hatred in his heart.  </P> <P> Rothenberg was and is an obsessed, homicidal maniac.  </P> <P> The state of California, the governor, the Board of Prison Terms and the  Legislature, must bear full responsibility for any criminal depradations  Rothenberg commits in the future. The people of this state, as well as the  nation, will be watching in horror.  </P> <P> How can any civilized nation or government release such a man on society -- and  on David and his family?  </P> <P> Merely saying that the state law under which Rothenberg got off with a slap on  the wrist has been changed, is just not enough. More should be done to prevent  his release from prison.  </P> <P> REBA WILLIAMS  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

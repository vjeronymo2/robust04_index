			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Sprint/EDS drop Dollars 30bn merger after value dispute Sprint, the US telecommunications group, and Electronic Data Systems, the world's largest computing services company, said yesterday they had abandoned negotiations for a Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn) merger but were still exploring other forms of strategic relationship. The merger failed, according to sources close to the negotiations, because of a disagreement over the value of Sprint, the third largest US long distance operator, which is believed still to be seeking an alliance with a European telecoms group. It has had talks with the French and German state telecoms operators. One source claimed yesterday that potential European partners had been contemplating an equity investment in Sprint or the combined Sprint/EDS. The collapse of the merger talks came three weeks after the two companies announced they were in discussions which might have led to the creation of an information services powerhouse, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 30bn and annual revenues of more than Dollars 20bn. This is the latest multi-billion dollar engagement called off between companies in the converging US industries of telecoms, cable television and computing. The immediate reason was money. The proposal involved EDS shareholders getting one new share in the combined company for every EDS share. EDS thought Sprint shareholders should get 1.1 shares in the new business, while Sprint demanded 1.3. EDS is a subsidiary of General Motors. To help the merger negotiations, GM said it would consider spinning off EDS. GM said yesterday it would continue to consider a spin-off if such a move would help EDS 'attain its strategic objectives'. Lex, Page 20</p>

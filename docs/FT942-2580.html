			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Slough makes final offer for Bredero Slough Estates has extended its offer for Bredero Properties until July 6, but it stated that the offer was 'final and will not be increased'. Slough offered 10p a share for the remaining 50 per cent of the property developer that it doesn't already own, but by initial close of the offer on Thursday, it had received acceptances from only 6.76 per cent of outside shareholders. Sir Nigel Mobbs, Slough's chairman, said yesterday: 'No other proposals have been made which would secure Bredero's future as an independent company, or provide a better return to Bredero's shareholders.' The share price rose last week when British Land purchased a 6.9 per cent stake, but Bredero's board said it had received no proposals from the company, and it continues to recommend the offer.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE SUMMIT;  </P> <P> A PARTNERSHIP HAS ITS FIRST TEST;  </P> <P> MOSCOW HAS VALUE AS A BRIDGE TO BAGHDAD, AND BUSH NEEDS GORBACHEV'S COOPERATION  -- BUT CHECK THE PRICE TAG CAREFULLY.  </P> <P> The Sunday summit in Helsinki is both a symbol of the new superpowers  relationship and its first serious test. So far, the Persian Gulf crisis has  seen the United States and the Soviet Union acting in concert, pursuing  different but overlapping goals. The Bush-Gorbachev meeting will show how much  their differences limit their cooperation.  </P> <P> The superpowers need each other to achieve their regional goals. Without at  least tacit Soviet support, the United States cannot isolate Iraq, deter  further aggression and compel Saddam Hussein to restore the status quo in  Kuwait. The image of "Saddam against the world" -- key to U.S. policy -- can be  advanced only with Soviet cooperation. For the Soviets, such collaboration  could secure what 30 years of costly involvement in the Middle East did not:  the role of coequal.  </P> <P> But continued Soviet cooperation should not be taken for granted. The  superpowers' interests are mutually supportive; they are not identical. To  avoid surprise and costly mistakes, Soviet goals must be factored into the U.S.  strategy at the summit and beyond.  </P> <P> First, it is worth noting that the Soviets had little choice but to condemn  Iraq. The invasion and annexation destroyed a growing relationship with Kuwait  from which Moscow intended to draw significant dividends. It also, as one  Soviet spokesman noted, "gave the United States a pretext to get both feet  firmly planted in the gulf, thus securing for itself enduring presence and  influence in this strategic region" -- a change in the balance of power that is  clearly not beneficial to Moscow.  </P> <P> A keen sense of strategic priorities determines Moscow's stand. On the global  chessboard, the relationship with the West is dominant; Iraq is merely a pawn.  The economic, political and military benefits accruing to Moscow from its  alliance with Baghdad are dwarfed by the expected advantages of siding with the  West and such key Arab nations as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria. As Pravda  succinctly put it: "Saddam Hussein owes Moscow $20 billion, but the Soviet  Union could obtain considerably more from the West."  </P> <P> Money is not the only consideration. The Soviets expect other tangible rewards,  from relaxed technology transfers to arms-control concessions. This "linkage"  is likely to be raised at the summit. If so, the Soviets will be reminded that  supporting international sanctions against Iraq was not only the right thing to  do; it was also in their interest.  </P> <P> The economic calculus is anything but clear-cut. As the world's largest oil  producer, the Soviet Union can expect an initial windfall from soaring oil  prices, even if export quotas remain unchanged. According to one Soviet  analysis, "at $30 a barrel, the Soviet Union would increase its oil revenue by  $7.25 billion -- the equivalent of its entire trade deficit for 1989." A  similar jump in the price of gold -- at 300 tons a year, another key export --  could also bring a handsome profit and a much-needed economic boost. But an  oil-driven recession in the West is hardly in Moscow's long-term interest. To  quote Pravda: "The Soviet Union does not want the collapse of Western  economies, as it is trying to obtain economic assistance from them."  </P> <P> At the summit, both superpowers will need to reconcile these conflicting  considerations.  </P> <P> Operation Desert Shield requires an even more complex balancing act. The  Soviets do not want to see the United States firmly entrenched -- or bogged  down -- in the Persian Gulf. To put their house in order, they need a stable  international environment, reduced Western defense spending and ready access to  international credits, investment and technology. War in the Persian Gulf would  diminish these prospects, forcing the Soviets to make some hard choices. Hence  Moscow's preference for a diplomatic solution, particularly one allowing it to  share the glory but avoid blame.  </P> <P> A Soviet bid for a political settlement might be forthcoming. Soviet  commentators maintain that a permanent channel of communication, consultation  and even influence with Iraq remains open. They say that the Soviet Union  "enjoys authority with all sides to the conflict, retains the Iraqi  leadership's trust, and has a solid experience of contacts with all regional  players. This guarantees that any Soviet initiative will be favorably  received." If so, the Soviets might be in a position to help Hussein back off  from the brink -- provided he is ready.  </P> <P> The issue of Soviet military advisers in Iraq should be viewed in a similar  light. Western analysts have asserted that the advisers remain against  Gorbachev's better judgment and only because troglodytes are circumventing  official policy. That is nonsense.  </P> <P> The very nature of Soviet politics leaves little room for rogue operations.  Most important, removing the advisers from Iraq may not be in the West's best  interest. The 193 acknowledged "military specialists" are unlikely to have a  significant operational impact, even if hostilities were to break out.  Conversely, the advisers -- and thousands of Soviet-educated Iraqi officers --  could serve as an important bridge to the Iraqi military, both for now and with  an eye to a post-Hussein regime. This could be the dowry the Soviets bring to  Helsinki.  </P></p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Comment): Give and take - John Plender looks in vain for fiscal logic and finds politics instead This was clearly in-tended to be a pro-business Budget. But is that what Kenneth Clarke actually delivered? The answer would be yes, if fiscal handouts were all that mattered: somewhat bizarrely, the biggest single item of tax relief in the whole package was the Pounds 605m of transitional relief to cope with the impact of the first five-yearly review of valuations for business rates. Yet while such largesse will no doubt be welcomed by the business community, there remains a problem. As with Mr Clarke's first Budget, it is remarkably difficult to find any coherent pattern in the welter of business taxation measures that the chancellor expects to promote a strong and thriving economy. Mr Clarke's rhetoric puts all the emphasis on manufacturing and small business. Many of the Budget measures do indeed point in their direction. Exporters can expect a 10 per cent reduction in premiums from the Export Credits Guarantee Department, along with increased cover for some developing markets. The growth of the venture capital sector will be enhanced by changes to the enterprise investment scheme introduced last year. Fine tuning of the loan guarantee scheme and changes in insolvency legislation, to be undertaken jointly with the Department of Trade and Industry, are worthwhile, if worthy, structural changes. The reduction in the administrative burden in relation to VAT and PAYE will, meantime, be widely welcomed in the small business community. The broad thrust of Mr Clarke's rhetoric is further underlined by the contrast between what he is prepared to do for small business and what he is happy to take from the upper echelons of the financial services sector. Private investors in Venture Capital Trusts will benefit from income tax relief at 20 per cent, capital gains tax reinvestment relief on new shares of up to Pounds 100,000 a year, and exemption from tax for all income and gains on the investments concerned. This is an undeniably generous break for investment in unquoted companies. Sophisticated investors in deep discount bonds and index-related securities are, on the other hand, singled out for anti-avoidance measures. Tough, in fact, on City folk. This is a far cry from the Thatcher era, when Mr Clarke's predecessors rejoiced in the job-creating potential of a financial services sector that today accounts for 18 per cent of GDP. Yet at second glance Mr Clarke's stated bias is less pronounced than it appears. The beer, wine and spirits industry, hardly at the small end of the enterprise spectrum and well looked after over the years by Tory chancellors, has escaped any increase in duty. Note, too, that reliefs from capital gains on investment in unquoted companies are now to be extended to another heavily cosseted group, the farmers. Also to property investors and developers - though the property industry will complain it is also the victim of anti-avoidance measures. On the central issues of corporation tax Mr Clarke's instincts appear to be fairly consistent. He has once again resisted the demands of industrialists for an increase in the capital allowances for investment in plant and machinery. The industrialists' argument was that an increase in the present 25 per cent allowance would encourage investment by lowering corporation tax bills and reducing the cost of capital. Yet there is academic evidence to support Mr Clarke's judgment, which suggests that the impact of such tinkering would be modest. The chancellor has also decided against following his predecessor in reducing the rate of advance corporation tax and the associated tax credit - a pro-business measure in that companies will not find themselves confronting higher funding costs for pension schemes because of a reduction in pension fund dividend income. This brings us to the central question. The chancellor boasted of the government's record in improving competitiveness and sharpening incentives through the development of the tax system. Yet the chief way of fulfilling those objectives, apart from establishing a sound macro-economic policy stance, is to ensure the overall taxation of savings and investment offers investors and businessmen the right sticks and carrots. This the present system signally fails to do. The corporation tax system is not neutral as between debt financed and equity financed investment. Investors pay corporation tax on some profits, but not on others; they sometimes pay income tax on dividends, sometimes not. In effect, the imputation system of tax introduced in 1973 encourages high dividend distributions in a world where tax exempt investors like pension funds constitute the majority of equity shareholders. There is also a growing debate as to the potential constraints that this implies for investment in plant and machinery given the increasing evidence that internal finance is not a perfect substitute for external finance for corporate investment. The related policy issues, which were to be explored by Mr Stephen Dorrell before his move from the Treasury to the heritage ministry, were driven off the chancellor's agenda by the intervention of Lord Hanson, who argued that a Tory government was being seduced by Labour-style policies. Here, then, is the most important dog that failed to bark in the Budget speech. All we have, instead, is a few marginal changes to Peps, Tessas and personal pension arrangements on the savings front, and the basic assertion that low corporation tax rates for the successful are better than high capital allowances for all. That is not to say that the Budget is without logic. Simply that the logic is political rather than fiscal. Mr Clarke has no aspiration towards the wider reforms that would be needed to deliver the robust business enterprise he claims to want.</p>

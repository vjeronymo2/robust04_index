			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: European prices rebound after opening sharply lower European government bonds opened sharply lower following the overnight sell-off in US Treasuries and plunged further on shocking German M3 money supply numbers. However, prices rebounded towards the close on heavy short-covering in the futures pits and speculation that the Bundesbank, whose council meets today, may lower interest rates. While those hopes were partly dampened by comments from Mr Guntram Palm, a member of the central bank council, who described the M3 figures as 'alarming' and said he saw no room now for a further reduction in official rates, many traders said this did not exclude the possibility of fixed-rate repos at a significantly lower rate next week. Long-term investors remained sidelined, ceding the stage to short-term traders. Dealers also reported more selling by highly leveraged players, including US hedge funds. 'This price action is scaring the hell out of investors - volatilities have risen so much no one wants to get involved,' said Mr Karl Haeling, head of the futures and options group at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. 'The market is moving on pure emotion, pure psychology. The sell-off won't end on anything logical, but simply when the last seller sells.' Many futures exchanges across Europe registered new record volumes yesterday, and as a result of extreme volatility several of them called for extra margins on certain futures contracts during the day. While a double-digit German M3 number had been expected, the publication of a 20.6 per cent annualised growth rate for January triggered another sharp bout of selling on fears that the data would further delay the Bundesbank's already slow pace of easing. German bunds fell by more than two points after the release, dragging the rest of Europe down with them. Prices were further pressured by the Mr Palm's comments and disappointing results of the Treuhandanstalt's latest 10-year auction, which saw virtually no retail demand. However, the late short-squeeze helped bund futures recoup most of their losses. The March bund future stood at 95.51 in late London trading, down 0.62 point on the day but well above its 93.80 day low. French bonds tumbled in line with bunds and were pounded by more foreign selling. Prospects of FFr18bn to FFr20bn of today's new 10 and 25-year supply also weighed on the market. However, rumours that the Bank of France had bought OATs via inter-dealer brokers helped calm the hectic market, and some observers were confident today's OAT auction should go smoothly. 'There may be better demand than expected,' said Mr Steve Major, European economist at Credit Lyonnais in Paris. The notional OAT contract on Matif fell by 1.36 points to 124.38 on the day, but crept higher to 124.96 in late London trading on Globex. UK gilts slid in line with other European markets, despite an early offer from the Bank of England to buy cash bonds from market-makers. 'The Bank came in early, offering to take paper off distressed market-markers' hands,' said a senior gilt dealer. While he felt the offer was not heavily taken up, another trader said the Bank had been 'a very aggressive buyer'. The Bank declined to comment on rumours of its market-smoothing intervention. Gilts also staged a late recovery, with the June long gilt future closing 1/32 point higher on the day at 110 31/32 , off its 109 7/32 low. Japanese bonds were whipped around by jitters surrounding the auction of Y1,200bn of 10-year bonds. The market sold off ahead of the auction as participants feared a lack of demand for the paper. However, results showing better than expected support for the auction prompted a small recovery, said Mr Adam Chester, international bond strategist with Yamaichi International. The JGB future rose by 0.70 points to 110.50 in London, from a Tokyo close of 109.65. After heavy overnight selling in Tokyo and London had prompted big early declines in New York, longer-dated US Treasury prices rallied strongly yesterday to stand little changed in late trading. By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year bond was down only  1/16 at 93 3/16 , yielding 6.782 per cent. Earlier in the day, the bond had been almost a full point lower. There was little movement in prices at the short end of the maturity range throughout, with the two-year note up 1/32 at 99, yielding 4.774 per cent. Traders said the downward momentum from overseas markets, where investors had sold US bonds heavily overnight, spilled over into New York trading at the opening. The selling of the past few days had been inspired by fears that the Fed, which raised interest rates a month ago, would tighten monetary policy again to prevent the rapid expansion in the economy from reigniting inflation. Concern about inflation has been rising recently because several indicators have suggested prices may be heading upward. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported a 1.0 per cent increase in wages and salaries during January, which was double the growth rate of the previous month and a worrying sign that wage inflation may be picking up alongside the fast-growing economy. The wages data, plus the overnight declines, pushed longer-dated prices sharply lower from the start. But the selling in New York was not as pronounced as in overseas markets, and with a lack of buyers, rather than an abundance of sellers, being the main problem, prices quickly bottomed out. By midday the 30-year bond had halved its losses and by late afternoon had edged close to opening values.</p>

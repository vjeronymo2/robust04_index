			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> Vladimir Novikov]    [Text] Murmansk, 23 May -- The talks between the foreign  ministers of Russia and Britain held here today were conducted  in the spirit of constructive and frank exchange of views. The  talks were part of the current official visit to Russia by the  head of the British Foreign Office. An ITAR-TASS correspondent  has learned from sources close to the Russian delegation that  the British side was interested in Moscow's reaction to  Ukraine's appeal to the UN Security Council regarding the  situation in the Crimea. Russia has nothing against such an  appeal and believes that a call for a political settlement  coming from the UN Security Council would be of use to all sides.    According to the same sources, during the talks the two  sides  discussed crises in various CIS countries in terms of a more  active CSCE participation in their settlement. On the Bosnian  issue, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to acting on  the basis of common understanding of the aims and in the spirit  of agreements reached at the Geneva meeting of the foreign  ministers of Russia, the United States, and five EC countries on  13 May.    Discussing the issue of Russia joining NATO's Partnership  for  Peace program, participants in the meeting agreed that military-  political cooperation should not be restricted by the provisions  of the outline document. Russia is a nuclear state, and it  cannot be put on a level with other countries. An agreement  that would take its specific features into account has to be  drawn up. The forthcoming visit to Brussels by Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev will be the first step in this direction.  The agreement concerned -- be it a protocol or a program -- has  to answer the question of how Russia is to cooperate with NATO  in such areas as peacekeeping, conversion, consultations, and  contacts between the military.</p>

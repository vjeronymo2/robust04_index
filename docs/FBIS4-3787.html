The meeting stressed: The people from higher levels  downward across the municipality should further be mobilized,  clearly understand the situation, be inspired with enthusiasm,  enhance the sense of urgency and the sense of responsibility,  firmly attend to the work of the second quarter of the year  which is the key season of the whole year, make consistent  efforts, go all out to grasp the fulfillment of the work,  comprehensively speed up the progress of the work in all  aspects, maintain a good development trend, comprehensively  fulfill the 1994 targets and tasks, and fight for making key  breakthroughs and development.

Li Shenglin, deputy secretary of  the municipal party committee and executive vice mayor of the  municipal government; Nie Bichu, chairman of the municipal  people's congress standing committee; and Liu Jinfeng, chairman  of the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference were present at the meeting.    Gao Dezhan and Zhang Lichang pointed out in their speeches:  Since the beginning of this year, the party committees and  governments at various levels as well as all people of the  municipality have taken Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building a socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic  line of the party as guidance, done solid work and gone all out  to do pioneering work according to the arrangements made at the  second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party  committee and the overall work situation of the party as a  whole, and maintained a good work development trend. The  economic operation situation is good. When comparing the first  quarter of this year with the same period of last year, the  gross domestic product of the municipality increased by 12.4  percent when calculated in terms of comparable prices, the total  output value realized by the industries at or above the township  level increased by 14.6 percent, the foreign export trade volume  increased by 23.2 percent, the amount of foreign capital used  according to agreements increased by 55.4 percent, the total  volume of retail sales of commodities increased by 30.3 percent,  and the revenues increased by 24.6 percent. Faster progress was  made in deepening reform of enterprises, readjusting and  transforming old enterprises with foreign capital, renovation of  dangerous, shabby, one-story houses, and construction of the new  coastal area. Sixty-six key projects are under smooth  construction. The tendency to increase the amount of foreign  capital for use has been strengthened. Markets are being set up  with high starting points. The construction of the spiritual  civilization has been strengthened. The preparatory work for  the 43d world table tennis event is positively being carried  out. An upsurge of learning from advanced models has started.  The anticorruption struggle has continuously and deeply been  waged. The broad masses of cadres and people are inspired with  enthusiasm and satisfaction. A municipal situation  characterized by a developed economy, political stability,  social progress, stability, and unity has further been  consolidated and developed. Gao Dezhan and Zhang Lichang  pointed out: The second season is an important key period as  well as a golden season. Therefore, we must accelerate the  progress of the work in all aspects, ensure that the semi-annual  goals are exceeded by the end of the second quarter, also strive  to fulfill the tasks in a faster and better way, and lay a solid  foundation for comprehensively fulfilling the annual tasks.    Gao Dezhan stressed in his speech that we should profoundly  understand the work situation of the whole party, upgrade the  awareness of going into action under the overall situation, and  positively and comprehensively promote the work in all aspects  under this overall situation. To this end, he set forth four  requirements: First, we must ceaselessly deepen our  understanding to clearly understand and be submitted to the  overall situation. We should firmly foster the idea about the  overall situation, further enhance the awareness of grasping the  favorable opportunities, and persist in the quintessence of  emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. Second,  there must be new ideas and methods for development. We should  actually shift the focus of economic construction onto the orbit  of relying on scientific and technological progress, upgrading  the quality of laborers, and increasing economic results as well  as the orbit of relying on science and technology to make  development so as to maintain sustained, fast, and sound  development of the national economy.    Third, we should  accurately handle the relations among reform, development, and  stability. We should further foster the ideology of relying on  reform to promote development and concentrate greater energy on  deepening reform. Simultaneously, we should regard the  maintenance of stability as a great matter relating to the  overall situation and realistically attend to it. Fourth, we  should persist in the principle of "taking a two-hand approach  and being sure that both hands are tough" and ensure faster  economic development and comprehensive social progress.    Gao Dezhan pointed out: To develop the work in all aspects  in a faster and better manner in the new situation, the leading  cadres at various levels must further grasp the major tasks as  follows: First, closely in line with the overall party work  situation, we should unswervingly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics. We  should conscientiously study original works and systematically  conduct the study on special topics on the basis of thoroughly  reading the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping." Persistently according to the principle of linking  theory with practice, we should ensure that we apply and arm our  heads with what we have studied and use what we have studied to  guide and promote our work. Meanwhile, we should organize the  broad masses of cadres to deeply study the theory on and the  basic knowledge of the socialist market economy. Second, we  should conscientiously carry out the system of responsibility  for the fulfillment of the fixed tasks to ensure the fulfillment  of all tasks. According to the requirements for reality,  firmness, and perfectness, we should divide tasks and assign  them to individuals. We should strive to make the targets more  advanced and to integrate contents of the targets further,  embody the overall work situation and general work levels,  strictly make assessment, and ensure both reward and  penalization. We should improve, as soon as possible, where we  lagged behind in the first quarter of the year. We should  strengthen mid-term promotion and pay firm attention to  supervision, examination, and implementation. Third, we should  realistically improve our work style and exert efforts to firmly  grasp the fulfillment of the tasks. Recently, the central  leading comrades made a series of important instructions on  improving the work style which hit the mark and are to the  point. We must implement the instructions one by one. By  summing up the work done in the first quarter, the leading  bodies at various levels should conscientiously examine the  existing problems in work style. Some of them should especially  convene democratic meetings to solve the problems in this  aspect. We should emphasize "working solidly," telling the  truth, think out real methods, do concrete deeds, and seek real  efficiency. Fourth, we should further change the government  functions and try every possible means to do solid deeds for  enterprises. On the basis of persistently doing concrete deeds  for the people, this year, in changing the government functions,  we should focus our efforts on trying every possible means to do  concrete deeds for enterprises. To do solid deeds for  enterprises, we should have initiative, be concerned with and  cherish enterprises, and regard the things of enterprises as our  own. All departments should regard the difficulties and  problems reflected by the enterprises as a key task that should  first be handled for enterprises. Gao Dezhan urged that the  leading cadres at various levels should have a good mental state  and a solid work style, guide the broad masses of cadres and  people in the municipality, work with one heart and soul in an  arduous manner, and strive to comprehensively fulfill all  targets and tasks of this year and make key breakthroughs and  development in all work.

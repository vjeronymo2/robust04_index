			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bass weak Further worries over the domestic brewing market were evident as Bass once again bore the brunt of market anxiety. Kleinwort Benson was one of two houses to chop its figures on the hotel and brewery group, blaming a combination of tough domestic competition and increased capital expenditure in its pub estate. The broker now expects profits of Pounds 555m, down Pounds 18m, for this year, and for Pounds 618m, down Pounds 10m, for 1994. NatWest Securities also raised fears over the domestic market and issued a sell note on the stock. The house warns that the battle being joined for market share, chiefly with Courage, will eventually be won by Bass but cost it 'reduced profitability over several years.' NatWest cut its forecasts to Pounds 572m in 1993 and Pounds 595m in 1994. The shares dropped 13 to 562p in turnover of 1.6m.</p>

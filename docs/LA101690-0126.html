Officials confirm that he's being  considered by the Social Ecology Program as an adjunct professor. "That's a  fancy term for instructor," Agran says. He's taught at the UCLA law school and  the UCI graduate management school, but this time he's interested in foreign  policy. Chris Pasles and Tom McQueeney  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> HORSZOWSKI: AT 97, A PIANIST'S PIANIST  </P> <P> Mieczyslaw Horszowski, who played an astonishing recital at the Dorothy  Chandler Pavilion on Wednesday, has always been a pianist's pianist.  </P> <P> He never courted a mass audience. Flash and fuss were never his specialties.  For him, the music came first.  </P> <P> While other keyboard heroes zealously cranked public-relations machines,  Horszowski went about his more serious business with gentle, almost selfless  determination. While his rivals embarked on vast international tours -- and on  ego trips that reached even farther -- Horszowski concentrated on basics.  </P> <P> He stayed fairly close to the East Coast, having moved to New York in 1940. He  taught a long parade of accomplished students. He played chamber music, often  with the likes of Casals and Szigeti.  </P> <P> He demonstrated a rare concern for such old-fashioned values as classical  purity and interpretive integrity. Although his playing always revealed a  striking independent character, he steadfastly avoided the traps of  exaggeration and distortion.  </P> <P> He offered enlightened surveys, often in unglamorous locales, of the complete  sonata repertory of Mozart, and he championed the late keyboard output of  Beethoven. As the decades passed, he developed a fiercely devoted following.  His name gradually became a household word -- but only in the homes of  connoisseurs.  </P> <P> Logic would suggest that Horszowski should have stopped playing in public a  long time ago. Fortunately, art is not always dictated by anything so mundane  as logic.  </P> <P> At the age of 97, he is still venturing strenuous recitals, without apology. He  is still giving object lessons in style, in sensitivity and in the  communicative force of simplicity.  </P> <P> It would be silly to pretend that his fingers can manage all the things today  that came so easily when he was a boy of 87. It would be a disservice to the  achievements of Horszowski in his prime to claim that his technique at twilight  matches that of high noon.  </P> <P> Any pedant could cite the smudged phrases, the lapses of concentration or the  linear approximations that materialized from time to time during his 2-hour  marathon at the Music Center. One had a right to expect some lapses. Actually,  there were far fewer than one had a right to expect.  </P> <P> Horszowski began the evening crisply, and a bit stiffly, with Bach's French  Suite, No. 6 (BWV 817). Without worrying much about the niceties of Baroque  scholarship -- that is a problem for another generation -- he stressed  universal virtues: contrapuntal clarity, rhythmic propulsion and abiding poise.  </P> <P> In Beethoven's F-major Sonata, Opus 10, No. 2, he introduced the contrast of  expressive freedom. Without a hint of emotional indulgence, he allowed the  phrases to breathe with poignant fluidity.  </P> <P> After intermission he explored some character pieces of Schumann -- the  "Arabeske," Opus 18, and the "Papillons," Opus 2 -- painting with brisk  strokes, muted colors and reasonably bold accents. In four Chopin miniatures --  culminating in the festive, seldom-performed Bolero, Opus 19 -- Horszowski  dealt in rhapsodic images that never cloyed. He made the poetry sound as  natural as casual conversation.  </P> <P> At encore time, he generously volunteered the inevitable "Traumerei," dreamy  indeed, plus Chopin's F-minor Etude, Opus 25, No. 2.  </P> <P> For once, the instant standing-ovation was justified.  </P></p>

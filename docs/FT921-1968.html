			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar breaches new barrier THE DOLLAR broke out of its recent narrow band, breaching DM1.68 in brisk late trading after chipping away at the barrier all day, writes Neil Buckley. Dealers said the market had been daunted by rumours of a large sell order at DM1.6780. These orders were either filled or taken out, and the dollar suddenly surged through this level in late afternoon. It closed at around DM1.6825/35, after an Asian close of DM1.6725/32, and at Y134.40/50, from Y133.71. The rise surprised many dealers who had predicted that the dollar would spend the next week or two in a consolidative phase, restricted to the DM1.6350-DM1.6720 range. However, determined buying by a handful of speculators, notably a south-east Asian central bank and a Middle East investor, sparked off a rally. This was backed by a strong Philadelphia Fed survey of business confidence, which leapt from -0.9 to +18.9. The dollar was also strengthened by comments from Mr John Laware, the Fed governor, who said he was satisfied by the current level of the dollar against the yen. This contrasted with comments in January that a stronger yen level of around Y120 was needed to restrain the huge Japanese trade surplus. Now, however, the Fed does not seem worried enough about the yen level for it to help the Bank of Japan with intervention. 'Given the recent data, we could see a further spurt by the dollar next week, especially if the figures are good,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International. 'Everything does point to a US recovery in the second half-year, although this might not be as strong as the market expects.' In Asia, the dollar had been very steady in thin and uneventful trading. The Tokyo markets were closed for a national holiday. The D-mark was generally mixed. It rose against the Swiss franc to SFr0.9100, from a previous SFr0.9070. Dealers said more intervention by the Swiss National Bank - for the third time this month - was possible on Monday if the SFr0.9100 barrier was breached. It fell, however, against the French franc, despite worries about this weekend's regional elections in France, in which the ruling socialists are expected to do badly. It also fell against sterling, although dealers said this had more to do with the stronger dollar than any improvement in sterling sentiment. Sterling closed at around DM2.8619 from a previous DM2.8573, and improved within the ERM to 47 per cent of permitted swing below its central rate, from 50 per cent. Against the dollar, sterling fell to Dollars 1.7007, from Dollars 1.7120.</p>

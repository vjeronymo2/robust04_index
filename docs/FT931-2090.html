			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram chairman under pressure MR BILL ROONEY, chairman and chief executive of Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms company, is under pressure to relinquish one of his two posts. Some institutional shareholders believe Mr Rooney must take some of the blame for the recent surprise profits warning. A financier close to the group said: 'There is a question mark over Mr Rooney's role. 'I think it will be very difficult for him to stay as chairman and chief executive.' The company's directors, and advisers NM Rothschild and Panmure Gordon, have made it clear that they will be listening to what shareholders have to say at today's presentation of its results. Last week the company said the 1992 pre-tax figure would be not less than Pounds 26m, down from a restated Pounds 36.2m in 1991. Analysts had predicted Pounds 37m to Pounds 40m. The directors will decide shortly after today's meeting whether to seek a replacement for Mr Stuart Greenword, finance director, and the company's auditors, Arthur Andersen. A number of big shareholders have already told the company that Mr Greenword's position has become unten-able. One said: 'It is not just that pre-tax profits will be far less than we thought. We are talking about a serious breakdown in communications between the company and its shareholders, which has happened once too often.' Spring Ram's profit warning followed haggling with its auditors over the implementation of more conservative accounting principles. Some Spring Ram directors feel its auditors were too conservative in its accounting methods in order to counteract the damage of last year's revelation of false accounting at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary.</p>

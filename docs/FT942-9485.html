			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Doctors resolve dispute with OFT A dispute that threatened to lead to legal action by the British Medical Association against the Office of Fair Trading has been resolved. In February the Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommended that the BMA should stop publishing fee guidelines for private practice by consultants. The government accepted the recommendation, saying the commission had established that doctors following the recommended scales could charge higher fees than would otherwise be possible, and the BMA immediately agreed to stop publishing and distributing the guidelines. Since February, however, a disagreement has raged between the BMA and OFT over the form in which its undertaking to stop publishing the guidelines should be formally expressed. The BMA complained that a form of words demanded by the OFT went beyond the scope of the original commission recommendation on private medical services, and could have been interpreted to cover guidance on such activities as certificates written by general practitioners and medical examinations for legal actions. After taking counsel's opinion, BMA officials told the OFT that, unless the matter was resolved satisfactorily by the end of last week, they would seek judicial review. The BMA said yesterday that a satisfactory form of words had now been accepted by both sides. Although the BMA agreed to withdraw its guidelines after the government accepted the commission report, it has made clear that it regards the entire issue as perverse. Private medical insurers such as Bupa and PPP will be free to continue issuing guidelines.</p>

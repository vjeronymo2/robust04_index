			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian government considers it unacceptable to  change unilaterally the present international regulation of  navigation in the Black Sea gulfs and hopes that Turkey will  review its position on this issue. This was said in a note sent  by the Russian Foreign Ministry to the Turkish Embassy on April  29 in connection with the adoption of a navigation regulation in  the Black Sea gulfs by the Turkish government, an official  representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Mikhail Demurin  said at a news briefing in Moscow on Thursday.    In his words, "a number of articles of the regulation  adopted  by Turkey envisages the procedure of passage through the gulfs  and considerable restrictions up to the complete ban on such  passage for certain categories of vessels depending on their  length, draft, cargo, etc." Demurin said that these articles of  the regulation go beyond issues of navigational safety and  contradict international convention.    In Demurin's opinion "the steps taken by the Turkish side  regarding the gulfs can create unnecessary complications in this  region. They should be perceived as an attempt to replace  international regulation on this issue by domestic legislation."</p>

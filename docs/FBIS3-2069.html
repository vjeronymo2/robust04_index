Well, strange or not, truth can certainly be a gripping  addition to an otherwise fictional tale, as a group of Beijing  short story writers have recently demonstrated.    Using a style called "new experience fiction," the writers  set their fictional narrators firmly in the maelstrom of real  life. Real policemen, real doctors, even real millionaires  provide the nitty-gritty details that form the springboard from  which the narrator leaps into the world of the imagination.    The ensuring tale is a form of contemporary history--with a  spin.    With support from a number of literary magazines in Beijing,  the first batch of "new experience" works has already been  published.    The pioneer is Chen Jiangong, a Beijing-based writer. His  first nouvelle [word as published throughout] in the style is  "With a Criminal Record," published last September in the  Chinese language literary bi-monthly, Chinese Writers.    The nouvelle reveals what the first-person narrator sees,  hears, and feels about the work of a policeman in charge of  neighbourhood security.    Every bit of the detail is real, Chen claims. The story  records what the policeman says and does, what happens to the  policeman and the people around him and, above all, what  thoughts these events trigger in the writer himself.    "New experience fiction' should, first of all, tell the  personal experience of the narrator--who is not just a  bystander, but also a participant in events," Chen Jiangong  explains. "In this way, the story links the material world with  the mental world, where fiction or non-fiction can take place  with cause and effect, or without cause and effect."    He believes that the personal accounts, which bear some  traits of news-feature style, may be more readable than  conventional fiction.    "New experience" writers may spend exhausting weeks of  research preparing for a story.    For example, Bi Shumin, before writing her nouvelle  "Appointment with Death," visited many hospitals and  crematoriums, jotting down volumes of notes, and even lay down  in hospital beds where sick patients had been.    "Tears ran down my cheeks many times when I did interviews  at  a hospice in Beijing," she recalls. "I am not a woman who  always sheds tears, but I was so saddened there that I seemed to  be immersed in salt water."    However, when she began to write, "I became very detached,"  she says.    And she learn from the experience. "It was death that gave  me courage and joy, and taught me to treasure life and love the  elderly."    She created a story that linked scattered scenes in the  minds-eye of her fictional narrator.    "Can writers write like this only after having personal  experience?" some one asked Bi.    She replied: This is the way I write this kind of fiction.  I simply hammer into pieces the true-life stories I have  collected and grind and mash them together with my own ideas and  emotions to form a whole."    Xu Moqing, another writer now living in Beijing, has also  ventured into "new experience" fiction.    His most recent nouvelle is called "How Much Time Does It  Take to Become Rich."    Xu tries to answer the question posed by his books's title  by  setting himself up as narrator against Ke Zijiang, a millionaire  in Fujian Province. In this way, he says, "I can dissect myself  so as to see the world more clearly, as if using an X-ray."    As a result, instead of "playing god" as the narrator does  in  conventional fiction, the "new experience" fiction drives the  narrator into the mundane world and makes him or her see his or  her own weakness," Xu said.    "The narrator joins the men-in-the-street in their joys and  sorrows."    "New experience" fiction has aroused keen interest among  literary critics and writers.    Critic Xing An says that a style similar to "new experience"  already exists, for example, Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood,"  which the author describes as "non-fiction".    Because "new experience" fiction stresses the need for the  writers to involve themselves in the real world, it depicts a  complicated and broad social arena that readers may understand  more easily, Xing says.    "New experience' fiction is not only a literary creation,"  he  says. "It also is the writer's involvement in making  contemporary history."    Writer Mu Guozheng says that "the word used most in tens of  thousands of literary critiques since the founding of New China  is 'death'."    Throughout New China's various social periods, from the  Great  Leap Forward Movement (1959) to the "cultural revolution"  (1966-76), critics invariably prompted literary works that had  "death."    However, as time passed, novels once widely-acclaimed as  having "deep social implication" are now almost forgotten, Mu  says.    Over the past decade, there have also been works of "depth,"  but many--borrowing ideas and philosophy from the West--are very  difficult to understand.    After going through so many twists and turns over the years,  Mu says he believes that "new experience" fiction may attract  more readers to Chinese literature because it departs from the  pursuit of "depth" and tries instead to give vivid portrayals of  the lives of common people.    Whatever the critics' comments, "new experience" fiction is  sure to stay and grow for a while, but it will take time to see  whether it will catch on with the public.</p>

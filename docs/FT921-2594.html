			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Midland news surprises THE TIMING of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's agreed bid for Midland Bank surprised the London market and triggered a burst of speculative buying throughout the sector. Midland Bank shares were immediately marked sharply higher, amid growing speculation that a counter-bid could be in the pipeline. Shares in other banks perceived to hold attractions for overseas bidders also came in for heavy support. The market's surprise at the news was evident from the performance of Midland's shares. They opened marginally firmer at 254p and then rocketed, according to dealers, to around 340p bid before coming off on profit-taking and closing a net 76 ahead at 329p. Turnover had jumped to around 22m shares by the close. Traders spoke of the possibility of counter-offers to the Hongkong Bank bid. In recent weeks there has been a series of rumours linking Midland with Lloyds Bank and Barclays. Last week the market was rife with the story that Hongkong Bank would launch a rights issue with its full-year figures to help finance a bid for Midland. Banking specialists said a Hongkong Bank bid for Midland would have to approach 400p to succeed and that in the event of a contested bid the takeout price would probably be in the region of 500p. TSB, regarded as a potential bid target in the sector, improved 5 1/2 to 131 1/2 p on turnover of 13.6m. Royal Bank of Scotland, subject of an unsuccessful Hongkong Bank bid around a decade ago, put on 6 to 176p. Lloyds Bank's rumoured interest in Midland chopped the Lloyds share price by 6 to 388p in turnover of 3.8m shares. Standard Chartered, which fought off a Lloyds Bank takeover attempt in the mid-1980s, added 10 at 443p. Barclays Bank rose 5 to 341p, NatWest 7 to 302p and Abbey National 6 to 275p. Hanson busy Industrial conglomerate Hanson was the subject of speculative talk that it was considering mounting a 'mega-bid' shortly. There were a number of potential targets being rumoured, with some talk focusing on Lonrho, the international trading group. Tobacco concern BAT Industries was also being touted as a possible target, although other suggestions were that Lord Hanson's group might make a large disposal, with BAT being mentioned as a potential buyer of its Imperial tobacco business. Hanson shares added 4 1/2 at 223p in turnover of 5.7m, Goldman Sachs leading strong buying from the US. Lonrho rebounded 14 to 99p in average turnover of 7.4m, while BAT was up 7 1/2 at 655p. MTM activity Bid speculation swirled around MTM, the specialty chemicals group, following the apparent rejection by the Stock Exchange of requests for suspension of the share quotation in the wake of two profits warnings within a week and an official enquiry by the Exchange. The shares closed 16 higher at 107p, making an advance of around 43 per cent over the past two trading sessions. Traders believe that any predator, which is likely to come from the blue chip ranks, might have to pay as much as 130p a share for the equity, valued at about Pounds 115m after allowing for MTM's debt of Pounds 70m. However, trading volume yesterday was light at well under 1m shares. News that US investors have in excess of 10.6 per cent of BP stock, compared with holdings last revealed in the region of 8.7 per cent, helped to keep the BP share price steady at 266 1/2 p in good turnover of 6.5m. Last week's BZW buy note prompted further support for Enterprise Oil, which gained 7 to 378p. A suggestion that Norwich Union was about to unload a large block of Goal Petroleum was regarded as unlikely by oil sector specialists, who said a selling order in recent days could have been misinterpreted by the market. However, Goal lost 3 to 41p. Housebuilding and construction group George Wimpey raced up 16 to 147p after the company announced a maintained dividend and a reduction in gearing to around 35 per cent. The fall in WPP, the world's largest marketing services group, was extended as the market reacted to the fall in profits and dividend omission announced this week. At 68p, the shares lost 12, after dropping 15 on Monday. Elsewhere in the media sector, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi closed little changed at 17p on turnover of 16.6m, with advertising shares paying little immediate heed to the optimism emanating from the US after the latest statistics on housing starts. Trading in Glaxo was subdued as the London market awaited developments from France, where an official enquiry has been mounted into the group's promotion of Imigran, a migraine treatment. The stock fell 12 to 771p with 2.9m shares traded as US sellers made their presence felt in London. UK analysts regard the latest developments as casting further uncertainty over Glaxo's pricing policies, but point out that the official moves in France and Denmark - hints of similar moves in Italy were not believed yesterday - imply recognition of the large markets on hand for Glaxo's products. The drugs sector remained under the shadow cast by the prospective sale of Wellcome shares, and also by the signs of economic recovery in the US which will switch investment attention away from defensive stocks, such as the pharmaceuticals, and towards the cyclical sector. However, most pharmaceutical leaders followed the general advance in UK equities and also benefited from the brighter tone on Wall Street. SmithKline Beecham rose 7 to 872p and Fisons added 10 1/2 at 366p as the Midland deal revived bid speculation across the range of the market. Wellcome remained dull, easing 2 to 963p in late trade. Following the news on Midland Bank, renewed bid talk dominated the industrial and engineering sector. Vickers, 8 stronger at 162p, Glynwed International, ahead 5 at 230p, and Morgan Crucible, 8 higher at 255p, all found themselves the subject of fresh takeover talk. Dowty Group climbed 7 to 115p after chief executive Mr Bruce Ralph told a news agency that the aerospace and polymer group was close to finding a partner for its loss-making information technology division. Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull said: 'A deal in the next few months would bring much needed cash and transform the Dowty balance sheet.' The share price has been undermined in recent weeks over dividend fears. Dowty executives were meeting institutions at James Capel yesterday and were believed to be soothing nerves over the dividend payment in the light of the IT talks. BTR announced it was undergoing a 'strategic review' which would include the disposal of the group's 59 per cent stake in Hawker Siddeley Canada. Analysts estimated this could fetch Pounds 100m. The shares rose 8 to 412p. Optimism over the US economy helped Siebe to add 13 at 607p and TI Group 15 at 640p. A profits warning following a fall in the share price of Rothmans Holdings in Australia had no immediate effect on Rothmans International. In London, Rothmans International 'B' nudged a penny higher to 1039p. Among food retailers, Tesco gained support from a Kleinwort Benson recommendation, rising 5 1/2 to 252 1/2 p. Kwik Save climbed 8 to 562p on a more positive view expressed by analysts about the company's long-term prospects. This followed a recent profits downgrading on concern that price-cutting to protect its market share would erode margins. Another firm feature of the sector was Iceland Frozen Foods, gaining 4 to 464p on hopes of good figures next week. Stores were slightly firmer overall, in spite of a lack of any great enthusiasm about today's retail sales data, which is expected to show flat volume in February. Marks and Spencer finished 4 1/2 higher at 319p, while Lloyds Chemists continued to attract demand, rising 4 to 347p. Encouraging comments from Hoare Govett about Hillsdown, and the general view that the shares are undervalued, pushed the price up 2 to 176p. Brewing and other drinks groups were generally firm. Guinness was 8 higher at 568p and Bass rose 6 to 549p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (20).

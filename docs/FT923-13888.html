			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Public-sector pensions lose their edge TRADITIONAL assumptions that greater job security and pension rights in the public sector justify the pay gap between it and the private sector can no longer be made, according to the review body. In recommending pay rises of up to 24 per cent, which the government yesterday refused to pay in full, the review body's nine members point to changes in the relative values of job security and pensions in the two sectors. An evaluation for the review carried out by Price Waterhouse, the consultancy, shows that the Civil Service pension scheme is worth less to the recipient as a percentage of salary than schemes provided in the private sector at comparable levels. The report says: 'The low contributory rate and index-linking of the Civil Service scheme are no longer sufficient to outweigh other advantages of typical private-sector schemes. 'Our pay comparison study revealed that 60 per cent of the private-sector comparators to our Civil Service and armed forces remit groups were in pension schemes which had given increases fully in line with inflation in the last few years.' The report says relative job insecurity in the private sector is substantially offset by generous compensation packages. Moreover, most chief executives in Next Steps Civil Service agencies are on short-term contracts and staff reductions of 20 per cent are planned in the armed forces. Among other reasons put forward to explain the recommended salary rises, the review body says that since its last fundamental review in 1985 the pay of the group covered - at present numbering 2,140 - has risen 7 per cent in real terms. Meanwhile, average earnings for comparable employees in the private sector have risen 40 per cent. Figures compiled for the report in March show that private-sector jobs similar to those of permanent secretaries commanded salaries of Pounds 189,000 - more than Pounds 100,000 above the pre-review pay of permanent secretaries. The review body says top jobs in the public sector are among the most responsible in the country. 'As a matter of principle, pay levels must be set so as to maintain in the long term an adequate supply of people of the highest quality to fill them,' it says. On recruitment and retention, the review says there are no shortages of talented staff in the armed forces and Civil Service. In the judiciary, problems are less pressing than in previous years. 'However, our concern is essentially with the longer term,' the report says. A failure to realign the relative pay of those covered with the private sector might weaken morale and eventually undermine long-term succession planning. The review body also draws attention to difficulties of differentials with groups of workers immediately below those covered by the report. 'The compression of differentials can have damaging effects . . . An inadequate differential is easily felt to be a devaluation of the worth of the post and the individual, with a consequent potential loss of motivation.' As well as pegging the rises recommended by the review body, the government has rejected an increase in London pay for grade three civil servants. The review body also made recommendations for increases in pay differentials between various levels of the judiciary to reflect the increase in the workload and administrative responsibilities taken on by certain judges. The recommendations were defeated, however, by the government's imposition of the flat-rate increase for all members of the judiciary, leaving particular difficulties experienced in recruiting county court judges and circuit judges to be addressed at a later stage. 14th Report on Top Salaries.

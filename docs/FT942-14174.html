			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Barclays Bank Mr Martin Taylor's first management changes at Barclays Bank are gentler than many had expected. He has not wielded the hatchet, which might have damaged morale throughout the organisation. The new structure contains the seeds of something radical just the same. One can quibble about the uncomfortable position of the UK corporate business division suspended between the clearing bank and BZW, and about the awkward dual reporting line of its boss, Mr Graham Pimlott. But the new structure, which will eventually be reflected in the segmental breakdown of the bank's accounts, will give group management a better idea of how different parts of the group are performing. It will also assist in the efficient allocation of capital to the group's various activities. That will shed light on the overall capital ratio that Barclays requires, a question which Mr Taylor re-opened soon after his arrival. He is probably right to argue that more internal competition for capital could be desirable in a market where slack loan demand means banks' capital resources are not being stretched. The more difficult decisions may come as the new structure beds down and the group can discern which of its parts are delivering real value. Despite the fanfare with which they were unveiled, Mr Taylor's changes only represent a good start. More will be needed to keep up the momentum in Barclays' share price which has out-performed the sector only modestly since his appointment last August.</p>

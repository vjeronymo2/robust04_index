			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL STOUT'S PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF L.A. BROADCAST NEWS  </P> <P> He was the Edward R. Murrow of my generation. A newsman's newsman.  </P> <P> I worked in the same CBS building as Bill Stout for the past 12 years. Our  communication consisted only of brushing shoulders and passing casual hellos,  but he gave you pride you worked for CBS.  </P> <P> We lost part of Bill Stout with his illness in 1987. But only on the outside.  His pace measurably slowed, his facial coloring was chalky. But what counts  inside never lost a beat. His biting commentaries still stung, and his writing  still made lasting impression.  </P> <P> A part of CBS has moved on, has been lost to the ages.  </P> <P> MICHAEL MASTERSON, Marina del Rey  </P> <P>  Stout, a commentator for KCBS Channel 2, died in Los Angeles Dec. 1. In 1987,  he suffered a major heart attack.  </P> <P> </P></p>

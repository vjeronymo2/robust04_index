			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RENTS DOUBLED AFTER PROJECT GOT BIG SUBSIDY;  </P> <P> DESPITE $31 MILLION IN FEDERAL AID, HOUSING SAID TO LOOK LIKE SLUM  </P> <P> A low-income housing project that got $31-million worth of federal  rehabilitation subsidies through the political influence of a prominent  Republican consultant has more than doubled its rents but still resembles a  slum, congressional investigators said Monday.  </P> <P> Federal funds for the Seabrook, N. J., development were supposed to be used to  modernize and improve 57 structures originally built during World War II as  temporary housing for farm workers.  </P> <P> Today, however, almost two years after rehabilitation work began, the 326 units  provide no refrigerators for tenants, the buildings lack rain gutters or  downspouts and the nearest laundry facilities are more than a half mile away  over a dirt road.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Cinder-Block Barracks'  </P> <P> Investigators who visited the site found "row upon row of cinder-block barracks  . . . water damage resulting from roof leakage, exposed electrical wiring and  shoddy construction," according to Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of  the House Government Operations subcommittee on housing and employment, which  is examining political favoritism at HUD.  </P> <P> The vacancy rate in the costly project is 20%, Lantos added.  </P> <P> Paul J. Manafort, a former campaign adviser to President Bush who is now a  partner in a high-powered lobbying firm, acknowledged in testimony Monday that  he has never visited the development, which earned his company a fee of  $326,000 for getting Department of Housing and Urban Development approval of  the subsidies in 1987.  </P> <P> Manafort, who is also a 20% owner of the development company for the Seabrook  units, said that federal tax credits from the project, which constitute an  additional form of subsidy, already have been sold to investors for $3.3  million.  </P> <P> Yet the promised rehabilitation is still not finished, and the project still  does not have a single permanent occupancy permit from municipal authorities,  Manafort and his partner, Victor Cruse, acknowledged.  </P> <P> Under HUD's moderate rehabilitation program, rent subsidies totaling $31  million will continue for 15 years.  </P> <P> "We played by the rules," Manafort said in defense of himself and his  consulting firm, Black, Manafort, Stone &amp; Kelly, and the way it obtained  funding for the Seabrook development with the aid of Deborah Gore Dean, once a  top assistant to former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.  </P> <P> However, Lantos challenged Manafort's insistence that the $4.4 million put into  the Seabrook development by the investors represented a sizable risk.  </P> <P> "There was a sweetheart deal with Debbie Dean that was implemented and stands  implemented," Lantos contended. "Nothing could be less risky than this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rents Up Sharply  </P> <P> Under questioning by Rep. Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park), Cruse said  that rents at the development ranged from $250 to $300 a month before  rehabilitation began in December, 1987, but since have been raised, ranging  from $552 for a one-bedroom unit to $756 for a three-bedroom apartment.  </P> <P> The bulk of these increases would be paid by tax dollars. Federal law provides  that tenants who meet the low-income requirements established by HUD have to  pay only one-third of their income for rent, and the U.S. government picks up  the remainder as part of the subsidy.  </P> <P> Cruse, former deputy housing commissioner of Connecticut who became a partner  of Manafort on the Seabrook development, said that the municipal government of  Upper Deerfield, N. J., made its building codes more demanding during the  rehabilitation work.  </P> <P> When asked why the buildings did not have gutters and downspouts, which city  officials insist be installed, Cruse replied: "We are presently putting them on  . . . . The buildings survived 40 years without them."  </P> <P> He acknowledged that the developers were under pressure to provide laundry  facilities and improve the landscaping before the city would grant permanent  occupancy permits. At present, he said, 182 of the 326 units have temporary  permits, but he estimated that the rest would be ready for rental by the end of  the year.  </P> <P> Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N. Y.) said that low-income tenants could have had much  better housing for the $31 million committed by HUD for the Seabrook  development.  </P> <P> "We find an extremely alarming situation," Weiss said. "The biggest profits go  to consultants and developers and, when they get through -- it (the housing) is  scandalous."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Admits Using Clout  </P> <P> Manafort, who acknowledged that the political clout of his firm had helped get  the HUD money for the project that he later joined others in buying, dissented  when Weiss termed his operations influence-peddling.  </P> <P> "You might call it influence-peddling. I call it lobbying," he said. "That's a  definitional debate."  </P> <P> Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) asserted: "Seabrook was a bum deal . . . .  Probably most of what happened at HUD is probably not illegal, but something  about it just smells."  </P></p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): The week ahead MONDAY: Last October, East Midlands Electricity announced it was to give back Pounds 186m to shareholders as a special dividend, or 85p per share. It chose this route rather than buying back shares. The interim dividend might, therefore, be less generous than those of other regional electricity companies; nonetheless, at least 15 per cent is expected. TUESDAY: Eurotherm, the industrial process control equipment supplier, has performed well in recent years by cutting costs and improving productivity. Confirmation that order book strength has been translated into higher sales could come when the company reports its results for the 12 months to October 31. These should show pre-tax profits up from Pounds 20.1m to about Pounds 26m. TUESDAY: Wessex Water, one of the smallest but best- regarded, of the 10 big privatised water and sewerage groups in England and Wales, should report a profits rise of more than 10 per cent to Pounds 58m-Pounds 60m (Pounds 53.4m) pre-tax. The dividend is forecast to go up by a similar margin to 4.5p (4p). Regulatory and pricing issues apart, investors will be waiting for a progress report on the company's waste management joint venture with the UK arm of WMX, the US-based world leader in the field.</p>

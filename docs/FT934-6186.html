			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Elections in Russia: Search for recipe to turn tanks to sausage Russia's Choice, the pro-Yeltsin bloc that began by dominating the economic agenda of the election campaign, is having to bend to meet the political limits to reform. 'Any government which allows 80 per cent of industry to go bankrupt won't even have time to complete financial stabilisation because it will be immediately thrown out of office,' says Mr Denis Kisilyov, a Russian economist at the World Bank office in Moscow. As the parties competing for pro-reform voters have increased their promises of ways to kick-start economic growth without a financial squeeze that will throw millions out of work, Russia's Choice is having to respond with a softening of its own programme. It is still promising radical land reform, an elimination of most subsidies and further liberalisation of foreign trade, but it is having to fudge the issue of how much unemployment it is prepared to countenance as a result of its promised financial austerity. Russian output is expected to decline this year by 16 per cent, slowing just a little from an 18.8 per cent fall in 1992. Incorporating an increase in exports and the trading sector, only gross national product is expected to decline somewhat more slowly than last year. When the deputy prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the leader of Russia's Choice, launched market reforms in January last year with a liberalisation of prices and imports, he hoped that state-owned enterprises would automatically adapt to market conditions, loss-makers would go to the wall, and both inflation and output would stabilise. This in turn would pave the way for new investment and the creation of new businesses. But today, with inflation at 20 per cent a month, and production still falling, the radicals say the problem is they never achieved a tough financial policy in the first place. If allowed to pursue what Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, described yesterday as 'a painful but absolutely necessary transformation', Russia's Choice is promising to bring inflation down to 4-5 per cent a month by the end of 1994. But the consensus uniting Mr Gaidar's critics, including the Party of Unity and Accord, set up by three rebel pro-reform ministers, is that inflation cannot be fought through a restrictive financial policy alone. They say the very structure of an economy geared towards defence production, with obsolete technology and very little competition, means that the state must play a much more active role in restructuring the economy. 'When people go to the shops, they want to buy sausage, not tanks,' says Prof Nikolai Petrakov, a parliamentary candidate for the electoral bloc headed by his fellow-economist, Mr Grigory Yavlinsky. 'We are having to repent for this unnatural economic system built up by the Communists . . . .It is not enough to allow private farming. Farmers need roads and equipment.' They say that mass unemployment would simply cause a popular backlash which would bring communists or neo-fascists into power. Mr Arkady Volsky, the leader of Civic Union, the most conservative of the pro-reform parties, is even continuing to cite China as an example of the merits of gradual reform and increased state control over the economy. The only problem is that Russia is dominated by obsolete heavy industry rather than agriculture, and has a democracy instead of a one-party state. But elements of the new critique have rubbed off on Russia's Choice, and are likely to be reflected in the economic policies pursued after the elections. For instance, the prime minister, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is likely to remain in his post as the most suitable compromise figure for both conservative and radical reformers, said this week that 'no government' would allow mass unemployment. Russia's Choice is downplaying the unemployment issue, with Mr Gaidar claiming that allowing enterprises to go bankrupt would in most cases mean reorganising them rather than closing them down. Mr Gaidar still differs from other politicians in that he remains keen to cut back the state's role on the grounds that Russian bureaucrats are incapable of running a market economy. But there is another point he has already embraced, and that is calls for increased protection for Russian producers and entrepreneurs against foreign competition. Last week he agreed to restrict the activities of foreign banks. He also categorically denied any plans to break up big enterprises such as Gasprom, the country's monopoly gas-producer, despite hopes by the World Bank he would endorse such proposals. Finally, he promised to use import tariffs to defend Russian producers. Calls by Civic Union and the smaller Democratic party for the creation of large financial-industrial groups capable of withstanding international competition have already been taken over by the government. A presidential decree allowing for their creation is to be published soon. Efforts will also continue to restore trading ties with former Soviet republics - a natural market for Russian companies after seven decades of state planning interlocked their economies. Another target for changes is likely to be the government's mass privatisation programme. Even Mr Sergei Vasiliev, one of the main economic ideologues for Russia's Choice, admitted yesterday that the programme was imperfect. But he said its flaws, including big benefits given to employees, and the distribution of shares for vouchers instead of money, had been the result of necessary compromises with conservatives. Finally Mr Chernomyrdin, who has refused to explicitly endorse any of the parties, echoed the promises being made by all parties, that economic reforms would be accompanied by better social protection for Russians. 'If, like Gaidar, you tell an ambulance driver that all he is ever going to earn is Rbs30,000 (Pounds 20) a month, then he will cast his vote for the Communists,' claims Prof Petrakov, the economist and candidate. The unspoken conclusion of this consensus is that Russia will have to live with high inflation for some years to come, albeit avoiding Ukrainian-style hyperinflation, while looking for ways of promoting investment in enterprises which can produce sellable goods.</p>

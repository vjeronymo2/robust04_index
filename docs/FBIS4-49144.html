			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Questions Still on PLA Troops"] </F>   [Text] It was a tragic waste of what should have been an  ideal opportunity to allay Hong Kong's fears about one of the  most uncertain parts of life after 1997.    Ever since Chinese patriarch Deng Xiaoping overruled his  Foreign Minister a decade ago, and declared that China would  definitely station troops in the territory after 1997, there  have always been doubts about what role they would play. Doubts  which were only reinforced by the events of June 4, 1989 in  Tiananmen Square.    No one disputes Beijing's right, as a matter of sovereignty,  to garrison Hong Kong, just as Britain has done for the past 150  years. The future People's Liberation Army (PLA) contingent has  a legitimate role to play in everything from conducting air sea  rescues to defending Hong Kong against outside threats.    But what is desperately needed is more information on what  form their presence will take. More than 100 Beijing-appointees  travelled to Guangzhou yesterday in search of that, on a  long-anticipated trip they hoped would give them some idea of  how the PLA is training the soldiers who will be coming to Hong  Kong in 1997.    Instead all they got -- during day one of their two-day  visit  -- was a long lecture on the revolutionary role of the Red Army,  the PLA's pre-1949 counterpart, and a glimpse of some army  barracks.    Lectures on the Communist Party's past are the last thing  that is needed if Hong Kong is to be reassured that the troops  who will be stationed here will be a modern, disciplined and  professional force.    Bland reassurances, such as local XINHUA (the NEW CHINA NEWS  AGENCY) deputy director's remark yesterday that "it's our own  army protecting us: isn't it laughable to be worried" are not  enough either.    What Hong Kong needs are some solid answers. What exactly is  the training programme for the troops which will be sent to Hong  Kong? How many will they number and who will be their commander?  What part of China will they come from, and where will they be  stationed in Hong Kong? Will they speak Cantonese and English  and understand the local customs and culture? Some of these  matters may become clearer, when the long-awaited Sino-British  agreement on military lands is unveiled within the next few  months. But most such details can only come from China.    The Beijing's appointees' trip is not yet over, it can only  be hoped that today's concluding part of the tour of military  facilities will be more productive and produce answers to some  of these questions.</p>

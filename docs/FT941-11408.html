			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Dutch cable viewers get CD sound Dutch cable television viewers will be the first in Europe to sample a music channel that squeezes up to 68 channels of CD-quality music down the cable between the sound and pictures of the television channels. Music Choice Europe transmits the digital sound in the spare spectrum between broadcasts. Once it reaches the home, a directional coupler splits off the music part of the signal and feeds it to a Music Choice Europe tuner. The tuner plugs into the amplifier of any hi-fi system.

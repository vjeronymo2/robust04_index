			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Twenty-two employees at Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston have been charged with  stealing computer chips and trading them for cocaine and marijuana, police  said. The arrests capped a six-month undercover investigation that began after  police were tipped to the illegal activities, said Capt. Mike Smith of the  Sheriff's Department. The company, which has 4,000 employees and is the  nation's third-largest maker of personal computers, hired a private  investigator who posed as an employee to help police in making drug  transactions, he said.  </P></p>

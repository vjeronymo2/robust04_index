			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- U.S. Ambassador to Japan  Walter Mondale on Thursday voiced hope for a successful  conclusion of stalemated trade negotiations between the two  countries, a Foreign Ministry official said. In a meeting with  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Mondale said he strongly hopes a  planned meeting between U.S. and Japanese trade officials in  Washington on Thursday will successfully find ways to resume the  stalled economic framework talks, the official told reporters.    The meeting, involving senior officials from Japan's  Ministry  of International Trade and Industry and the Foreign Ministry and  their U.S. counterparts, marks the first attempt by the new  government in Tokyo to resolve differences with Washington over  the stalled trade talks. The U.S. envoy also reportedly spoke of  the need for both sides to try to flexibly meet each other  halfway in a bid to restart the negotiations on establishing a  new framework for bilateral trade.    Noting that healthy economic relations between the two  economic superpowers is crucial, Hata also expressed hope for  early resumption of the framework talks, the official said.    The bilateral negotiations on ways to widen foreign access  to  the Japanese market were suspended after the two countries  clashed at the February meeting of U.S. President Bill Clinton  and then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington.    At the summit, Hosokawa rejected U.S. proposals for  "objective criteria" or numerical targets to measure the  progress of Japanese imports.    Mondale and Hata also agreed on the need for cooperation  between the U.S. and Japan to encourage North Korea to remove  concerns about the communist country's suspected nuclear weapons  development program, the official said.</p>

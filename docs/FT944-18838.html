			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper's advance boils over London Metal Exchange traders watched anxiously yesterday morning as the three months delivery copper price dipped below the Dollars 2,500-a-tonne mark. The price reached a 3 3/4 -year high of Dollars 2,578 on Wednesday but the mood of the market changed the following day with the expiry of the September position at the New York Commodity Exchange. Tightness in that contract had been underpinning LME copper prices, dealers explained. Stop-loss selling orders were triggered on Thursday as the three months price fell through support at Dollars 2,550 and a short-term trend line at Dollars 2,540. Further important chart levels were breached yesterday morning, traders told the Reuters news agency, with continued stop-loss selling accelerating the decline. 'The worrying thing about copper is that the market can go down to Dollars 2,150-2,200 and still be above the major uptrend line,' one dealer said. Moreover, the copper market's upside potential is limited as its recent support around Dollars 2,520 should now offer resistance. Yesterday's early fall was halted at Dollars 2,495 a tonne by the appearance of scale-down buying and some bargain-hunting. But by the close of the afternoon ring late selling had taken the three months contract to Dollars 2,490.50 a tonne, down Dollars 40.25 on the day and Dollars 80 on the week. The announcement first thing yesterday of a 1.16 per cent fall in LME warehouse stocks of copper did little to relieve the market's gloom; but a 0.66 per cent fall in aluminium stocks was enough to underpin a rally in that metal's prices. After an early dip to Dollars 1,601 a tonne the three months position rose to Dollars 1,624 before closing at Dollars 1,617 a tonne, down Dollars 2 on the day and Dollars 14 on the week. Dealers said that the recovery was fuelled by speculative buying and short-covering and suggested that the strength of chart-inspired support around Dollars 1,600 boded well for an early attempt on the contract's overhead objective of Dollars 1,650 a tonne. The gold market ended lower on the week after briefly rising to Dollars 400 a troy ounce in response to a report, later denied, that Russia planned to halt exports of the metal. At the London bullion market the price ended Dollars 2.20 down overall at Dollars 393.80 an ounce, but traders said it had done enough to foster hopes of a renewed advance next week. 'Gold's uptrend remains intact down as far as Dollars 388-Dollars 389,' one dealer pointed out, though he added that a retracement to that level would long delay a fresh assault on Dollars 400. The outlook for coffee prices appears less promising. In spite of the continuing dryness in Brazilian growing regions the November futures price at the London Commodity Exchange fell by Dollars 187 this week to Dollars 3,880 a tonne. 'It's looking fairly weak. Nobody is in the mood to buy, the roasters have backed off and we're just drifting,' said one trader as the price extended its decline yesterday. But others noted that concern about the Brazilian weather situation was ensuring that selling pressure remained fairly light, enabling the price to finish Dollars 40 above the day's low. Reuters reported that the latest forecast indicated continued dry, warm weather over the weekend in most Brazilian coffee growing areas, though a few scattered storms were possible.  ---------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------------- Aluminium            -15,550   to   2,314,100 Aluminium alloy         +120   to      25,460 Copper                -4,250   to     360,800 Lead                  +1,100   to     371,775 Nickel                  +162   to     144,432 Zinc                  -1,250   to   1,233,550 Tin                      +45   to      32,230  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

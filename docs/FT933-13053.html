			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / High job turnover means poor training, says OECD COUNTRIES with the highest levels of job mobility are generally failing to provide adequate training, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In its annual report on employment, published yesterday, the Paris-based think-tank of 24 industrial nations warns that deregulation of the labour market can conflict with the goal of a well trained, well paid and stable workforce. The report, which makes veiled criticism of labour market developments in the UK and the US in the 1980s, appears to reflect the influence of the US administration. 'It seems clear that the major asset of OECD countries is the quality of their labour,' Mr Tom Alexander, a senior economist at the OECD, said. 'It is important that that quality is consistently reinforced and renewed.' The report says young people in France, Germany and Japan, where employment stability is greater, are more likely to receive formal training than those in the US, which has a relatively high job turnover. The US experience of strong employment growth combined with a fall in real wages for the lowest paid workers 'has given rise to concerns' that jobs can be bought only at wages that create a class of working poor. The OECD is also concerned about the rise in the number of part-time and temporary workers, especially in Europe, some of whom are offered 'only sub-standard employment and income security'. It found that 20-30 per cent of part-time workers would prefer a full-time job and that in some European countries 60-80 per cent of temporary workers are seeking full-time jobs. The report says it is difficult for countries with a high job turnover to copy the special relationship between workers and companies found in Japan. It supports 'industrial relations systems which are structured to enhance worker participation in the enterprise'. An analysis of 13 OECD countries found average job tenure to be 8.7 years, with the US at the bottom end on 6.7 years and Japan at the top with 10.9 years. Unemployment rates of more than 10 per cent are present in half of the OECD countries and the overall figure is expected to peak at just under 9 per cent (36m) in the second half of 1994, a similar percentage to the last peak in 1983. Unemployment is restraining pay rises with unit labour cost increases in the business sector slowing to 2.5 per cent in 1992.

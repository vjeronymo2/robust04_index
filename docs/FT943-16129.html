			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / People: Snee moves to JP Morgan Less than a week after SG Warburg's Nick Snee, 29, was named the top-rated European Motor industry analyst, he has been poached by a rival US investment bank. Snee, who has worked at Warburg since 1987, is joining JP Morgan Securities, the London stockbroking arm of the New York commercial bank. Snee, who will be a vice president, has been hired to initiate JP Morgan's coverage of the European car industry, one of the biggest pan-European stock market sectors. JP Morgan Securities is a relative latecomer to European stockbroking and the firm did not figure in the recent Extel rankings. SG Warburg remains the market leader but several US brokers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch have been increasing their market share. Europe's motor industry lends itself to cross-border comparison and Merrill Lynch and Lehman already rank among the top five firms analysing the European sector.</p>

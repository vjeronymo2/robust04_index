			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Yerah Tal] </F>   [Text] Likud Knesset Member [MK] Dan Meridor does not rule  out the possibility of a territorial compromise if Israel's  security is assured. This was reported by several people who  attended a meeting of the "Kefar Vitkin group," the joint forum  of Likud and Labor MK's on 17 June. The same sources also  claimed that Likud MK's at the meeting expressed no opposition  to the relocation of settlements and their concentration in  large settlement blocs.    The Kefar Vitkin group reconvened at MK Mikha'el Eytan's  house in Kokhav Ya'ir on 17 June. The Labor MK's who  participated in the meeting were Gedalya Gal, Ori Or, Eli  Goldschmidt, and Rafi Elul, who recently joined the forum in the  place of Efrayim Sne who resigned after being appointed health  minister. The fifth Labor MK in the forum, Deputy Education  Minister Mikha Goldman, was abroad and therefore absent from the  17 June meeting. The Likud was represented by MK's Dan Meridor,  Mikha'el Eytan, David Magen, Avraham Herschson, and 'Ovadya Eli.    The forum continued a discussion that started at their first  meeting two weeks ago, at Gedalya Gal's home in Kefar Vitkin.  The debate focused on the definition of the security  requirements Israel must insist upon when signing political  agreements.    Although the participants agreed to maintain secrecy, some  details of the discussion have been learned. MK Ori Or, the  chairman of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee,  asserted that progress on the Palestinian track must be  expedited. He noted the need to hold elections expeditiously in  the territories, even at the expense of movement on the Syrian  track.    Or said that there should be no rush to reach an agreement  with Syria. The government should not feel under pressure and  try to reach an agreement with the Syrians before the 1996  elections. In his opinion, such pressure could result in an  agreement that was bad for Israel. In Or's opinion, Israel  should not agree to the stationing of UN observers,  international forces, of U.S. soldiers in the territories or on  the Golan Heights. He prefers joint patrols, similar to the  ones now being carried out by Palestinians and Israelis in the  autonomous areas.    Or said that Israel's security needs necessitate its  continued control over the Golan Heights, the Jordan Rift  Valley, the northern part of the Dead Sea, and the Jerusalem  area, as well as several strategic points where Palestinian  autonomy should not be permitted. Or mentioned the possibility  of creating Jewish settlement blocs in Judaea and Samaria and  did not rule out the possibility of uprooting remote or isolated  settlements and relocating them inside the Jewish settlement  blocs.    Meridor enumerated the threats to Israel's security that  would be posed by the establishment of a Palestinian state. As  stated before, several participants claimed that Meridor did not  categorically reject a territorial compromise if Israel's  security was guaranteed. According to these sources, Likud MK's  did not express any opposition to lumping the Jewish settlements  in the territories together in large blocs.    Yesterday, Meridor denied that he had expressed readiness  for  a territorial compromise. He was furious that details of the  meeting had leaked to the media and said that if these leaks  continued he would propose to dissolve the forum.    The forum members will apparently meet in another two weeks  at Eli Goldschmidt's home in Kibbutz Deganya.    The LEHAVA [Hebrew acronym for Renewal in the Likud  Movement]  group has begun signing up Likud Central Committee members on a  manifesto expressing support for the possibility of territorial  compromise. The group's members have called for an urgent  convention of the Likud Central Committee, in which they intend  to put their political plan to a vote.    Statements in support of the Allon Plan, which were voiced  by  Dani Kohen, the group's chairman, at a convention of the "Third  Path" two weeks ago, drew sharp criticism from the Likud  spokesman who asserted that "Dani Kohen was a marginal figure in  the Likud."    In response, Kohen said that the LEHAVA group comprised  several hundred party members, including several dozen central  committee members.    The LEHAVA manifesto stipulates that Israel's political plan  should include its opposition to the establishment of a  Palestinian state in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip and a  total rejection of the Right of Return. The plan should note  Israel's readiness for a territorial compromise -- which would  only be spelled out in detail in the framework of negotiations.  Autonomy would only apply to individuals and not to  territories, and Israel's continued sovereignty over the Jordan  Rift Valley, the northern part of the Dead Sea, the Golan  Heights, metropolitan Jerusalem, the 'Etzyon Bloc, the Qatif  Bloc, and in all the areas of Jewish settlement considered vital  for security would be guaranteed.    It should be noted that despite being entrusted with the  task  by the party's central committee over six months ago, the Likud  bureau has still not formulated a draft proposal for a political  plan.</p>

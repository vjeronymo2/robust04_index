			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> OFFICER'S PARTNER OFFERS HELPING HAND  </P> <P> Anaheim Police Officer Martin Curry knew his partner, Mike Helmick, needed some  help.  </P> <P> Helmick's wife, Nancy, 32, is suffering from a rare form of terminal cancer,  and the insurance will no longer cover the enormous expense of further  treatment.  </P> <P> So Curry looked to his friends, and the Chamber of Commerce, and organized a  4,000-seat pancake breakfast this Sunday to raise funds to help pay for the  mounting medical bills.  </P> <P> "I think Marty just saw another officer in need and decided to lend a helping  hand," Detective Werner Raef said. "Everybody just kind of kicked in after that  and really got on the bandwagon."  </P> <P> California Angels pitcher Jim Abbott will speak at the $3-per-person breakfast,  made possible with the help of donations from Bridgford Foods, Karcher  Enterprises, and Smart and Final Iris, organizer Tom Kissler said.  </P> <P> Raef said many officers had transferred portions of their accumulated time off  to Helmick so that he would be able to spend more time with his wife and  3-year-old daughter Brittney. And about three months ago, the police  association passed a hat around, collecting about $8,000 to help Nancy.  </P> <P> "They're all together in a sort of a common cause," Kissler said.  </P> <P> Raef expected about 250 members of the 320-officer force to attend the  breakfast, which will be held from 7:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at Martin Hall in La  Palma Park in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Organizers hope the event will raise about $25,000 for Nancy Helmick, who has  sarcoma cancer that attacks the lungs and heart.

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / International Company News: Weakened demand for elevators hits Kone Profits for 1993 tumbled sharply at Kone, the Finnish lifts and cranes group, after its main European market was hit by falling prices and weakened demand for new elevators. Group income after financial items fell to FM328m (Dollars 57.8m) from FM457m. The pre-tax result was FM430m after including a FM102m extraordinary gain, arising mainly from the sale of the company's marine technology division, MacGregor-Navire. Earnings per share fell to FM30.64 from FM46.09. Selling MacGregor-Navire meant group sales fell 4 per cent to FM10.8bn from FM11.3bn. Excluding the disposal, sales were up 4 per cent. Kone said conditions were difficult in all its main markets, except Asia. Europe accounts for 72 per cent of sales, followed by North America with 13 per cent, and Asia-Pacific with 11 per cent. Conditions in Europe meant Kone Elevators, which accounts for 76 per cent of group sales, had a difficult year, even though maintenance and modernisation business developed favourably. A conscious drive to develop maintenance operations helped the group end 1993 with 354,000 elevators under contract, compared with 338,000 at the start of the year. Some 60 per cent of Kone Elevator's sales now arise from maintenance work. Deliveries of harbour and shipyard cranes quadrupled, allowing Kone Cranes to lift its result compared with 1992. The group's third division, Kone Wood, also improved. Kone was encouraged by 3 per cent growth in new orders, to FM8.3bn. 'Elevator demand continued to decline in Europe, but industrial crane demand bottomed out. Growth was pursued in east Asia, where both elevator and crane demand remains lively,' it noted. The year-end order-book amounted to FM6.4bn, up 5 per cent on 1992. A dividend of FM9 per A share and FM10 per B share is proposed.</p>

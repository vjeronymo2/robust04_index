			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands Will Not Send Any </F> Troops To Rwanda Due To Major Risks Involved"]    [Text] The Netherlands will not be sending any troops to  Rwanda. The security risks are regarded as being unacceptably  high. The cabinet decided this on Friday [20 May] at the behest  of Defense Minister Ter Beek.    The UN Security Council decided earlier this week to send a  unit of 5,500 Blue Helmets to war-torn Rwanda to protect the  refugees and the humanitarian aid workers.    The Rwandan rebels immediately threatened to regard the UN  troops as enemies if they tried to form a buffer between  themselves and the government troops. It is becoming  increasingly clear that the UN force for Rwanda will have to  consist primarily of troops from other African countries.    Informally, the Netherlands is being sounded out by the  United Nations to send technical support troops. The government  considered the possibility of deploying military policemen or  logistics and transport troops -- a so-called "movement control  unit" -- from the Army.    Due to the crackdown on illegal immigrants in the border  areas of the Netherlands, however, there were no military  policemen available. Several dozen Army troops could be  provided, but they would be in too great a danger today.    Netherlanders run a particular risk in Rwanda because they  closely resemble Belgians, it was admitted in The Hague. In  light of the colonial past, Belgians in Rwanda and Burundi are  in greater danger than other westerners. The only Netherlander  in Kigali was stationed at the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in  Rwanda] observer mission headquarters and had to be evacuated  with the Belgians.    Since UNAMIR was set up in Arusha in August 1993, nine  Netherlands observers, officers and noncommissioned officers in  the Army, have been stationed in the area along the  Ugandan-Rwandan border. On Friday, the government decided to  assess the need to increase the number of observers.    Furthermore, a study was launched to establish the need for  military air transport for troops, foodstuffs, or medicines.  The Air Force might be able to make a number of F-27's  available. It is virtually out of the question that the sole  Hercules C-130 owned by the Air Force will be used for this  purpose. The problem is that its Netherlands crews are still  undergoing training with the Belgian Air Force.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> UCI LIBRARY: A NEED FOR REVIEW  </P> <P> Serious problems, including charges of racism and low employee morale, have  plagued UC Irvine's library for more than a year. A recent faculty report  focused blame on the library's chief administrator, Calvin Boyer.  </P> <P> It asked the university administration to evaluate him immediately and to  review UCI's policy for the head librarian, a post that is not subject to the  same review as department heads. UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason should follow  through on these recommendations.  </P> <P> The faculty committee conducted its study after receiving complaints that some  employees had mocked Asian and Middle Eastern library patrons. There were also  concerns expressed by library staffers that minority and women workers were  denied promotions unfairly and charges that the library had dragged its feet in  minority recruitment on a campus where half the student body consists of  minorities.  </P> <P> The committee found the problems were more the result of poor management and "a  highly politicized work environment" than of any intent by library officials to  mistreat minorities or women. It described the library as in a crisis stemming  from a "very serious morale problem."  </P> <P> Reacting to the report, Boyer said press attention and the faculty study had  exacerbated the library's problems. He said that mistreatment incidents were  isolated and that the record on hiring was good. That's not an adequate  response. The administration should review Boyer's tenure and take appropriate  action to ensure that the library's leadership is in step with the changes  taking place as UCI heads into the 21st Century.  </P></p>

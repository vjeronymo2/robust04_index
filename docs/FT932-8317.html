			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Belgian drug group to double Chinese output JANSSEN Pharmaceutical of Belgium plans to double its manufacturing capacity in China over the next two to three years to meet rapidly increasing demand for western medicine. Mr Jerry Norskog, head of Janssen's Dollars 28m Xian joint venture, said the company would increase production to 2m packs annually as part of long-term plans to improve the range and volume of its drugs. The move coincides with a drive by foreign pharmaceutical companies to gain entry to the China market in the light of new regulations that will benefit local producers. 'We have successfully fulfilled our first phase of strategy,' said Mr Norskog. 'We will be able to produce 2m packs of preparations a year when expansion is finished in two to three years. Our target is to supply the greater China market - not just the mainland, but also Taiwan and Hong Kong.' Janssen is likely to pick Xian, south-west of Beijing, for a planned second plant. 'There we could get more personal attention and government support, though it might lag behind the coastal areas in infrastructure.' said Mr Norskog. Dr Paul Janssen, founder of Janssen Pharmaceutical, who has been visiting China, was due this week to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Nanjing Medical College to support further research into an Aids cure. They are examining combining traditional Chinese medicinal herbs with western medicine. Xian Janssen Pharmaceutical is regarded as one of China's most successful joint ventures. Among its bigger-selling products are Sibelium, a palliative for migraine and dizziness, and Hismanal, an anti-histamine. China has about 1,100 pharmaceutical plants with a turnover, in 1991, of 28.4bn yuan (Dollars 5bn). Most produce bulk pharmaceuticals. China spends Dollars 700m a year on imported drugs.</p>

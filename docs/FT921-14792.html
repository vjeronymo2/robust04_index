			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Lloyd's to support market reforms THE COUNCIL of Lloyd's will tomorrow respond positively to a series of suggested reforms of the insurance market, Richard Lapper writes. One member of the 28-strong council, which governs the market's affairs, said there had been a 'marked degree of unanimity' about the conclusions of a report drafted by a task force. 'Without exception, we all feel very positive about it,' he added. The task force, chaired by insurance broker Mr David Rowland and advised by McKinsey, the management consultants, has examined Lloyd's capital structure, competitiveness and cost base. Its report is expected to recommend the maintenance of Lloyd's controversial principle of unlimited liability, but it is also expected to introduce a cap limiting the 'excessive' losses of Names - individuals whose assets provide the market's capital. Its 200 pages will contain more than 50 other recommendations.</p>

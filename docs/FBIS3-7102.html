He said that at a Korea-U.S. trade meeting held at the  Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, the United States agreed to  exclude Korea from a cattle epidemic area, paving the way for  the exports of Korean beef to the United States.    Also at Wednesday's meeting, the United States protested  over  Korea's recent discarding of a large amount of American sausages  for the expiration of their marketing period.    According to the official, a U.S. delegate said it was  unreasonable for Korea to sharply shorten sausages' tolerable  marketing period from 90 days to 30 days and discard imported  American sausages based thereon.    The United States further asked Korea to allow the imports  of  the heads of codfish. But, Korea said it cannot at least until  due steps are taken to ensure the sanitary handling of codfish  heads which are used in the United States only as a livestock  feed material, the official said.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> EVERYTHING'S JAKE  </P> <P> "The Two Jakes" (citywide) may be the only movie in memory with a prerequisite:  Before seeing it, see "Chinatown" -- again or for the first time.  </P> <P> "I don't want to live in the past," Jack Nicholson's detective, J.J. (Jake)  Gittes, says fervently. "I just don't want to lose it." Well, lose Jake's  "Chinatown" past and you cut yourself off from "The Two Jakes' " deepest  meaning.  </P> <P> Frankly, it's almost impossible to judge how "The Two Jakes" would seem to  someone who had never seen "Chinatown," since once you've seen that classic  it's with you inextricably. I've seen it probably once a year since 1974. The  best I can say is that the intricate weave of Robert Towne's "Jakes" screenplay  stands on its own, but with nothing like the richness it will have for  "Chinatown" veterans.  </P> <P> That past makes the elegiac "Jakes" funnier, deeper, even more evocative. It  reinforces its great theme, the "development" of Los Angeles and the price tag  for that "progress," a theme planned to stretch across three films. The third  seems absolutely essential now after the riches of "Jakes."  </P> <P> In "Chinatown," Roman Polanski was the perfect conduit for the edgy, dangerous  sensuality of '30s Los Angeles; director Jack Nicholson's very American  sensibilities may be just right for the brash, brighter postwar section of the  trilogy.  </P> <P> The story pulls Gittes back where he doesn't want to be, to his memories of  "Chinatown's" mesmerizing Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway), whose life he  couldn't, finally, protect. (In "Jakes," David Keith's hard-nosed cop, Loach,  is the son of the policeman whose single shot killed Evelyn in the presence of  her 16-year-old daughter, Katherine.) A wire recording Jake makes at the scene  of an illicit love affair mentions Katherine Mulwray's name, and Jake, the good  detective, is off to search for this fragile icon of his memories.  </P> <P> It's a briskly challenging plot, probably easier than "The Big Sleep," the  high-water mark in tangled detective stories, but only slightly. The difference  is that there's the sense of something valuable at the bottom of "The Two  Jakes' " mystery; the vision of a city being raped a second time in the name of  progress.  </P> <P> "Jakes" has its second-stage villain too, oil baron Earl Rowley (Richard  Farnsworth.) Quite understandably, he's not the towering figure that John  Huston's Noah Cross was -- we will not see Huston's kind on screen again. Also,  Cross' sins were sexual as well as financial; we see only the business side of  Rowley. Huston made you believe Cross' pure, genial pan-amorality. There's  something intrinsically decent about Farnsworth that keeps Rowley from being a  true monster.  </P> <P> The film opens with the same punch to a husband's pride as 'Chinatown" did.  It's 1948, and postwar euphoria is in the air. Jake Gittes' investigation  business has prospered since the bloody ending of that story some 11 movie  years earlier. He's now a 6-handicap member of a country club and an  unpersuasively engaged man, while the husband receiving the bad news of his  wife's infidelity is a very rich real-estate developer. He and Jake share  identical two-tone shoes and even the same name; the client is Jake Berman  (Harvey Keitel), and it's his wife, Kitty (Meg Tilly), who's soon to be  surprised at the Bird of Paradise Motel in Redondo Beach.  </P> <P> As the Jakes commiserate, a small earthquake (not the last temblor in "Jakes,"  either) shakes Gittes' low, Moderne offices. Suddenly you realize the scene's  peculiar power: Except for those that are about earthquakes, none of the slew  of movies that have tried so hard to capture the mood of Los Angeles have faced  this essential fact of life here -- you cannot even trust the ground under your  feet.  </P> <P> That feeling of instability may lie so deep it's almost subliminal, but it's  there, certainly perceptible to a writer who picks up emotions and motivations  as seismically as Towne. He's made these shocks and aftershocks part of the  fabric of the film, a weave of facts and memories caught so precisely that we  can feel life in the Los Angeles Basin just at the end of the Second World War.  </P> <P> Towne serves up the pleasant and the venal with equal relish; angora sweaters  and anti-Semitism; lone oil wells dotting neighborhoods like tireless dunk 'em  birds and "The Whistler" coming out of a Hudson convertible's radio; country  clubs and G.I. tract homes where neither Jews nor Mexicans need apply; old  Pasadena influence and up-and-coming gangsters.  </P> <P> The ruminative narration was reportedly written by Nicholson and laid on last.  It's serviceable and even helpful; only in a few places of metaphor overload  does it sound as though Nicholson had been watching too much Edgar Ulmer or  listening to too much of Joe Frank's Work in Progress. Clearly, it ain't Robert  Towne, but t'will serve.  </P> <P> It is, in any event, a lovingly assembled cast in a brilliantly detailed  production, with special notice to Vilmos Zsigmond's haunting cinematography,  which seems somehow to have captured the light as it was, pre-smog. By now  Nicholson owns J.J. Gittes, and he has thought carefully about the experiences  that shaped Jake over the last 11 years. They're all there for the reading --  in his face, his comfortably thickened body, in his fleeting look of  melancholy.  </P> <P> There are layers and layers, too, to Harvey Keitel's beautifully detailed work  as Jake Berman, and an absolutely perfect performance by Meg Tilly as the  serenely beautiful Kitty. Madeleine Stowe is hilariously good as the  angora-wearing widow. It's wonderful to see James Hong's Khan out of servant's  livery and into his own nursery garden, to see Perry Lopez's remarkably fair  Captain Escobar, there to balance David Keith's perfect louse, Loach, and to  revel in Eli Wallach's smoothie, Cotton Weinberger, who may just recall Jerry  Geisler.  </P> <P> And as for the optimistic thought that there will be a final chapter, it cannot  come a moment too soon.  </P></p>

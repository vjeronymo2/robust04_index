			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Letter: Slide in Tiphook shares shows need for action on insider deals Sir, On the morning of Thursday, April 29, Tiphook announced that profits for the year would be below previous expectations. The company's shares had fallen by 11 per cent during the three days preceding this announcement, a period when the market was relatively stable. The prima-facie evidence of insider trading is strong and yet few can have confidence, on the basis of past experience, that anything concrete will emerge from any formal investigation instigated by the Stock Exchange. The time has long passed for a radical review of a process that is clearly not working. A change of style from the investigator, enhanced resource, and, possibly, greater co-operation with relevant SROs is required. I have no doubt that a more robust and structured process would be successful in identifying wrongdoers and those who act on their behalf. Paul Myners, chairman, Gartmore Investment Management, Gartmore House, 16-18 Monument Street, London EC3R 8QQ</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Saudi-owned network wins right to buy UPI UNITED Press International, the embattled US news agency, will be sold to the London-based Middle East Broadcasting Centre for Dollars 3.95m in cash, a federal bankruptcy court judge has ruled. The Saudi-owned news network, which uses satellites to broadcast news to the Middle East, said it was willing to inject up to Dollars 12m over the next two years to make UPI viable and profitable. Judge Francis Conrad said: 'Lord knows, in this economy, we need to keep as many reporters alive and eating as we can.' In accepting the Middle East Broadcasting offer, Judge Conrad rejected a competing bid of Dollars 3.75m from Mr Leon Charney, a US property lawyer. Mr Charney said he had been forced into a last-minute bidding war and said he might appeal the decision, agency reports suggested. During the bankruptcy court hearing to determine the fate of the 85-year-old news agency, all three potential rescuers increased their offers. The Rev Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who earlier this month withdrew his Dollars 6m bid for UPI, raised his offer for some of the wire service's assets, its name and access to its photo library to Dollars 900,000 from Dollars 500,000. Middle East Broadcasting, which raised its bid from Dollars 3.5m, was the early favourite of UPI creditors, who are owed about Dollars 60m. After the decision Mr Dennis O'Dea, lead attorney for the creditors, said: 'The proposal is the highest and best offer for the assets of UPI.' Mr Charney, who initially offered to pay Dollars 3.6m in cash and equity for UPI, increased his offer to Dollars 3.75m in cash and said he was willing to match Middle East Broadcasting's infusion of funds to revive UPI. Whether anyone can save UPI remains to be seen. The news agency has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors twice in the past 10 years. It is currently owned by Infotechnology, a company that itself filed for bankruptcy protection last year. Mr Robertson rescinded his earlier takeover offer after advisers said he would need to spend about Dollars 31m in the next 18 months to make the news agency viable. At the bankruptcy hearing Judge Francis Conrad said: 'The overriding concern is for UPI employees. They must be living in Dante's hell.'</p>

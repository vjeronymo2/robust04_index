			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Germany to tighten curbs on far right MR Manfred Kanther, Germany's interior minister, yesterday pledged to step up surveillance of far-right organisations as the number of racist crimes was reported to have risen dramatically last year. Crimes committed by far-right groups increased by 70 per cent in 1992 to 2,584, of which 17 led to deaths. More than 90 per cent of the violence was directed against foreigners, the office for the protection of the constitution, the German internal security agency, said in its annual report. The wave of politically-motivated violence is continuing this year, with 1,300 crimes reported in the first six months. The number of people joining far-right organisations rose by 2,000 to nearly 43,000 last year. Members were spread in 82 groups, as compared with 76 the year before. Mr Kanther said the security services would intensify their surveillance of groups from both the far right and the far left. But he stressed that police and legal actions should be combined with social and educational measures to prevent more youngsters from joining existing far-right organisations. Mr Kanther blamed the media for showing violence on television and called on municipalities to take measures to get young, jobless people 'off the streets'. Such words are likely to provide little comfort to organisations which have been lobbying for tough action to crack down on far-right violence. Leaders of the local Turkish community, whose members have been regularly singled out for murder attempts, have been calling for a strict anti-discrimination law as well as bans on extreme political organisations. They say that the conservative government has been reluctant to investigate the links between the aggressors and far-right political groups. The federal Interior Ministry last year banned three of the 84 existing far-right groupings in Germany. Legal suits have also been brought against two of their leaders for abusing the freedom of expression guaranteed in the constitution. Mr Kanther said bans were a last resort. He added that no new law was needed but that the existing legal framework should be improved. Measures proposed by the government aim to facilitate police investigations and to introduce higher penalties for people obstructing the judiciary. Far-left groupings increased their membership by 2,000 last year to 28,500 members.</p>

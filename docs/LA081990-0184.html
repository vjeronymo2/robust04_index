			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUNDAY IN THE PARK  </P> <P> Since Kirkpatrick's review of Giroux's "A Deed of Death" in large measure  emphasizes the latter's "inadequacies," it seems in order to question the  reviewer's opening sentence/paragraph:  </P> <P> When did streetcars "rattle through Westlake Park"?  </P> <P> In the 1920s and much later, streetcars ran past the swank shops on Seventh  Street -- the park's southern boundary.  </P> <P> And perhaps past the then quality apartments and hotels on Sixth Street, along  the northern edge of the park. I can't pinpoint them at the moment.  </P> <P> But to my knowledge, in modern times the only street through the park was and  is trackless Wilshire Boulevard; the famed motorized thoroughfare extended east  through the park many years after the nearby 1922 William Desmond Taylor murder  on Alvarado, the park's eastern boundary.  </P> <P> How young is the captious Mr. Kirkpatrick -- or when did he arrive from  elsewhere? I was attending junior high school a little more than a mile south  east of Westlake Park in 1922. Even those "nearby orange groves" he included in  the opening sentence were something you saw only on a Sunday drive in the  country.  </P> <P> JOHN CORNELL  </P> <P> SAN MARINO  </P> <P> The Book Review welcomes expressions of all views from readers.

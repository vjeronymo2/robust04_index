			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONEY: THE ART OF THE MATTER  </P> <P> First the facts and, then, the two inevitable questions: This week the two most  expensive paintings in history -- Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet"  and Pierre Auguste Renoir's "At the Moulin de la Galette" -- were sold at  auction for $82.5 million and $78.1 million respectively to Japanese paper and  real estate magnate Ryoei Saito. The Renoir, considered by some the finest  painting the artist ever made, has been in American hands since 1929. The Van  Gogh, though privately owned, has hung in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art  since 1984.  </P> <P> So, now to the first of the questions: Are those paintings really worth all  that? After all, works by Paul Cezanne, a painter of greater art historical  significance than Van Gogh, currently are valued at much less. Well, yes, but .  . . As the critic Robert Hughes has observed, when art becomes a commodity --  which it unfortunately is when it hits the auction block -- it is one whose  only index of value is the desire of individuals to own it. A particular desire  raised to the level of fetish, which is a fairly accurate description of the  Japanese fixation on Van Gogh and, to a somewhat lesser extent, on the  Impressionists, is powerful indeed.  </P> <P> Mr. Saito obviously was aflame with such desire. As he told Japanese reporters  in Tokyo Friday, "I borrowed the money from the bank, and I will continue to do  it to buy good art when it becomes available."  </P> <P> Others among his cash-rich countrymen obviously share his obsession. In fact,  last year, Japan imported $1.87 billion worth of art. That's a lot, even at  today's prices.  </P> <P> And so now to the other question: Are more of the masterpieces currently  hanging in the United States likely to make their way to Japan? Yes, but that  affirmative answer is alarming only if America persists in its neglect of its  artistic patrimony. Just as brash, culturally ambitious Americans once scoured  Europe for paintings and sculpture to carry home, so prosperous Japanese are  doing much the same here now. In fairness, it has been a two-way trade. One of  the finest collections of Japanese painting in the world currently occupies its  own wing in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.  </P> <P> What has changed is the American tax code, and our great public museums are  losers because of it. Formerly paintings such as those sold this week might  well have been donated to public collections by owners able to deduct their  market value from their tax liability. Today, such donors only can deduct the  amount they paid for the work. That virtually guarantees that such collectors  will send their art to the auction block rather than to our museums. Restoring  the full deduction would be the best sort of investment -- one that will pay  rich dividends for generations to come.  </P></p>

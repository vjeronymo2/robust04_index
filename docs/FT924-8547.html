			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Shares of Italian state holdings soar THE PROSPECT of the Italian government unveiling privatisation plans within the next two weeks is encouraging heavy speculation in the shares of those state-controlled companies already quoted on the bourse. Yesterday the Milan stock exchange authorities had to suspend dealings temporarily in no fewer than nine quoted stocks controlled by the state because their price had risen above the 10 per cent ceiling permitted in a session. Speculative interest has heightened following the leak last Friday of a highly sensitive document outlining the government's plans and naming companies and financial institutions in line for privatisation. The leak forced the government to deny plans were so finalised. However, the stock market seems unconvinced especially as the government is committed to revealing its plans by November 19. Particular attention yesterday focused on the state-held banks and financial institutions, considered the easiest to sell off. Credito Italiano, the sixth largest commercial bank, was the first to have it shares temporarily suspended after quotations had risen nearly 20 per cent. On Monday, the state holding company IRI approved the sale of its entire 67 per cent stake in Credito. Other shares suspended included Banca di Roma and Banca Fideuram, and the Assitalia insurance group. The Party of the Democratic Left (former communists) yesterday called for a parliamentary debate on privatisation. 'We are not against privatisation but we are concerned by the (government's) confused and disorganised approach which also fails to address the whole question of industrial policy,' a spokesman said. A similar statement came from the CGIL, largest of the three main union confederations.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Greek Cypriots go to polls GREEK Cypriot voters gave Mr George Vassiliou, the incumbent, a commanding lead of 7.5 percentage points in yesterday's first round of the Cyprus presidential election. Mr Vassiliou, an independent backed by the island's powerful Communist party, did better than expected, winning 44.2 per cent of the vote to 36.7 per cent for his right-wing opponent, Mr Glascos Clerides. Mr Paschalis Paschalides, a political newcomer supported by the centre-right Diko party and the Socialists, finished a poor third with 18.6 per cent. Mr Vassiliou is now favourite to win a second five-year term in next Sunday's run-off ballot against Mr Clerides. The vote is widely seen as a referendum on the latest United Nations proposals for reuniting the Greek and Turkish communities on Cyprus. Mr Vassiliou has played an active role in developing the UN 'set of ideas', which proposes a settlement based on a federated state with Greek and Turkish Cypriots living in separate zones. Mr Vassiliou said the election results indicated that there was strong Greek-Cypriot backing for his efforts 'to exploit the favourable international climate, to increase the pressure on Turkey and to reach a just and viable solution' of the Cyprus problem. The island has been partitioned since 1974, when Turkish troops took over northern Cyprus in response to an Athens-led coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece. Mr Clerides is expected to seek an alliance with Diko ahead of the second ballot, offering prominent centrists cabinet positions in return for their party's support.</p>

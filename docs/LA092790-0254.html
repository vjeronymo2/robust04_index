			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> TAGLIABUE HAS JOB: CLEAN ANIMAL HOUSE FOR WOMEN WRITERS  </P> <P> In the last 20 years, since women sportswriters have been allowed to interview  athletes in locker rooms, there have been some uncomfortable incidents, from  fraternity house-style heckling to a USFL player running a razor up the leg of  one writer. Jack Morris, a Detroit Tigers pitcher, said to a Detroit Free Press  summer female intern, "I don't talk to women when I'm naked unless I'm on top  of them or they're on top of me." The intern was a Harvard graduate; Morris was  from the school of Neanderthal thinking.  </P> <P> Women have had to suffer fools in locker rooms for a long time, but nothing as  reprehensible as what happened recently in the New England Patriots' locker  room. During the middle of an interview, several naked players surrounded  Boston Herald sportswriter Lisa Olson, reportedly inches from her face, and  dared her to touch their genitals. Difficult as it may be to believe, owner  Victor Kiam later made it worse.  </P> <P> Within earshot of several male reporters in the locker room after Sunday's  game, Kiam called Olson "a classic bitch." Much more offensive than that, Mr.  Remington Shaver told a Herald reporter the Patriots could "wiggle their  waggles in front of her face as far as I'm concerned."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Kiam, now deeply concerned with damage control from his outrageous  remarks, issued a statement of apology that ended with, "I now hope that we can  get back to preparing our team for the Jets game on Sunday." Olson did not  accept it. Good for her.  </P> <P> NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, just two weeks ago, warned Falcons Coach Jerry  Glanville in no uncertain terms that the league would not tolerate one coach  calling another a "jerk" as Glanville did Houston's Jack Pardee. Tagliabue  moved quickly and decisively to head off what he perceived as a behavior  problem that would negatively affect the league's image.  </P> <P> When asked Tuesday about the Patriots' sleazy behavior with Olson (which  happened on Sept. 17), Tagliabue was noncommittal about whether the league  would take action beyond the Patriots issuing a token fine of $2,000 to one of  the players, reportedly tight end Zeke Mowatt. "I really don't have all the  facts," Tagliabue said, "so I don't want to comment because I'm not all clear  what has happened."  </P> <P> Kiam and General Manager Patrick Sullivan already have apologized. A Patriots  public relations man was standing nearby and has acknowledged seeing at least  part of what happened. Ronnie Lippett, a veteran Patriot with a touch of class,  sought out Olson and told her to hang in there, that she was only doing her job  and doing it well at that. Tagliabue ought to tell Kiam and the Patriots -- and  the 27 other clubs for that matter -- publicly that this behavior will not be  tolerated, that violators will be hit with heavy fines and meaningful  suspensions.  </P> <P> No precedent-setting rule is needed; the NFL already has one that calls for  equal access to all accredited reporters. If the Patriots players or any others  don't like it -- which is their prerogative -- then tell the woman you'd like  to get dressed before conducting an interview. Or, if you feel even stronger  about it, tell her you'll talk to her outside the locker room.  </P> <P> The smaller issue here is sports locker rooms. The locker room isn't always a  battleground for women reporters. The Post's Christine Brennan estimates she's  been in "more than 500 locker rooms in my 10 years and I've never had a bad  incident." Also, the vast majority of players aren't interested in harassing  women; they want to get dressed and go home.  </P> <P> But there are always the boys from Animal House who think that because they are  professional athletes they're also above the law. They can say or do whatever  they want and get away with it. And to show just how rough and tough they are,  these brainless bullies surround a woman in a locker room and behave boorishly.  </P> <P> How manly.  </P></p>

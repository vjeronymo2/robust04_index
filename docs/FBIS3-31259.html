			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jiri Hracek and Jiri Stastny: "Kalvoda and Pilip </F> Disagree With Klaus and Advocate Military Intervention in  Bosnia"]    [Text] Representatives of the Civic Democratic Alliance  [ODA] and the Christian Democratic Party [KDS] yesterday  rejected Prime Minister Klaus's statement about the government's  disapproval of air intervention in Bosnia. According to the ODA  Political Board, it is a tragic error to assume that, when  diplomatic means become exhausted, it is wrong to resort to the  use of force.    "This is the moment that has now come in the former  Yugoslavia, and especially in Bosnia. We demand that our  country support NATO's decision on vigorous military  intervention in this area," says a statement issued by the  ODA Political Board. ODA Chairman and Deputy Prime Minister Jan  Kalvoda energetically raised their objections to Vaclav Klaus's  statement of Wednesday [9 February]: "I am surprised by the  information that the government is opposed to air strikes. If  such a statement was made, I have to say that the government did  discuss the issue, but without adopting any resolution."    In an interview for CESKY DENIK, KDS Chairman Ivan Pilip  also  reacted to yesterday's statement of Vaclav Klaus: "We all  saw the Sarajevo marketplace. What is happening there is very  unfair." [allusion to Klaus's remark that air strikes  against Bosnian Serbs would be "unfair"] For two reasons, his  party advocates intervention in former Yugoslavia. "First, from  the viewpoint of political morality. The world is globally  interlinked, which is particularly true of Europe. The world  made a mistake by addressing this problem by means of indecisive  wavering and resolutions. This approach has evidently  contributed a great deal to the situation being the way it is  now." Citing the second reason, Ivan Pilip said that, in the  course of its history, our country has repeatedly been in a  position when it needed closer links to the world. "Therefore,  we should not approach these problems by arguing that everyone  must settle them on his own," the KDS chairman added.    A statement approving of the NATO decision was issued  yesterday also by the Club of Nonaligned Activists [KAN]. "We  believe that, when women and children are being crippled and  murdered, it is no longer war but genocide. Unlike Vaclav  Klaus, we see precisely the shelling of the innocent as the  unfair conduct of war," says the KAN statement.</p>

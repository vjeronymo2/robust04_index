			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / BT3 share sale methods backed The National Audit Office, the public-spending watchdog, yesterday endorsed the methods used by investment bank SG Warburg to co-ordinate the sale of the government's remaining stake in British Telecommunications last year. The tactics attracted strong criticism from institutions. They objected to Warburg's efforts to prevent the sale of new shares to those who disposed of shares or sold shares they did not own immediately before the BT3 global offering. Warburg had used a variation of the so-called global bookbuilding technique, in which the price at which the new shares are sold reflects market demand on the day of the offering. There have been suggestions that in similar bookbuilding operations in London investors manipulated share prices by dumping stock or selling short immediately before pricing. This would have allowed them to buy the new shares more cheaply. Warburg tried to ensure that those who had recently sold BT shares were not allocated new shares. The study found that Warburg won 36 per cent of the Pounds 20m of commissions from the international portion of the offering, down from 41 per cent of commissions on BT2. The watchdog praised the techniques used in the BT3 offering, and said that 77 of 78 institutional investors interviewed regarded the sale as a success. Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, said the sale had raised Pounds 5.2bn, in line with Treasury expectations.</p>

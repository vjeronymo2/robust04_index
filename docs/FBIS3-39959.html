			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA report: "EU Proposal Could </F> Provide Support for the North"]    [Text] Brussels -- The EU [European Union] Commission is  putting forward a new proposal on regional policy in the  membership negotiations. The proposals opens up the possibility  of additional support for Norrland.    "Understanding of the problems of Norrland is growing in the  EU," European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel commented.    The Commission is proposing that a new category of support  be  introduced which will mean that additional support can go to  regions with a low population density -- fewer than 7  inhabitants per square kilometer.    This would cover large areas of Norrland. It is therefore a  proposal which is fully in line with the Swedish Government's  demands in recent weeks.    The EU Commission has made its proposal after member  countries were unable to reach agreement on support for the  northernmost regions of Norway, Finland, and Sweden.    But when the proposal was discussed by the EU countries on  Monday [21 February] evening it ran into opposition chiefly from  France and Spain who are opposed on principle to any changes to  the EU's current rules. However, the proposal had the support  of several member countries.    The Commission is proposing that the new category of  support,  which is being called 1(A), should provide a slightly lower  level of support per inhabitant than Objective 1 support, which  is paid to poor regions. But it will be a level of support that  is higher than that from the other support funds, to industrial  and agricultural regions with problems -- so-called Objective 2  and Objective 5B support. Unlike other proposals this would  also mean that a new permanent form of support would be  introduced.    In its proposal, which TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA has seen,  the Commission writes that this new form of support could also  solve the special problems of the inland regions of Sweden south  of Norrbotten.    The Swedish Government has demanded the highest possible  level of support for Sweden's four northernmost provinces and  for Halsingland and Gavleborg province. But Ulf Dinkelspiel has  said that the important thing is that the EU recognizes  Norrland's special problems.    On Monday Dinkelspiel met the EC commissioner responsible  for  regional policy and probably discussed the new proposal. He was  unwilling to say whether the new proposal fits the bill for  Sweden. But he looks clearly satisfied, after being criticized  at home for making demands that looked too much like ultimatums  in the negotiations on regional policy.    "There are some interesting ideas in the proposal,"  Dinkelspiel said.    The new proposal states that countries like Finland and  Norway can have some regions which are classified as Objective 1  regions and which will therefore receive the highest possible  level of support. Other regions which do not fully meet the  EU's poverty criteria will receive support according to the  criteria of Objective 1(A).    Payments from other support funds, such as Objectives 2 and  5B, will not be affected by the new category of support.    The EU Commission has also put forward a concrete proposal  about the circumstances under which the applicant nations may  give additional support to farmers in their northern parts over  and above the normal EU support for agriculture. One of the  conditions is that such support will only go to agriculture  north of the 62nd parallel, which is more or less on a level  with Sundsvall in Sweden.    But farmers south of this line will also be able to receive  support in certain cases. Among the criteria being proposed is  that population density must not exceed 10 persons per square  kilometer. The size of support will be based on the number of  animals on or the cultivated area of each farm.    However, the EU Commission is proposing that the applicant  countries must foot the bill for all of this additional support,  while the Swedish Government wants the EU budget to be  responsible for a large proportion of this money.    This proposal from the Commission looked to be winning the  support of member countries on Monday evening.    Dinkelspiel will meet the EU ministers for negotiations  today. But yesterday evening it was still unclear whether the  meeting will lead to any further agreements.    The two sides are close to an agreement on tourists'  duty-free alcohol allowances and other regulations covering  travelers. On Monday evening the EU countries agreed to give  the applicant countries two alternatives for how long they are  to be allowed to limit the import of alcohol and tobacco on  which tax has already been paid. Either a four-year  transitional period with no possibility of extension or a  two-year transitional period with a review thereafter which  could make an extension possible -- on the lines of the  so-called Danish model.    This offer will be put to Finland today in a so-called  minipackage, which will also include summer cottages, Aland, and  the ferries which sail between Sweden and Finland.    Yesterday evening it was unclear whether the proposal on  regulations covering travelers will also be raised in the  Swedish negotiations.</p>

Oil prices have jumped, though perhaps too late in the period to have a great effect, gas prices have slid, and refining margins have tumbled. What earnings gains emerge will largely come from cost-cutting. Paul Ting, an analyst at Oppenheimer in New York, forecasts earnings per share declines particularly at Exxon (69 cents compared with 87 cents in the previous quarter), Texaco (60 cents, down from 69 cents) and Chevron (falling to 50 cents from 65 cents, due to poor refining margins in the US). Better news, he says, will come from cost-cutting or restructuring at Amoco (up from 74 cents in the first quarter of the year, to 79 cents) and Mobil (at Dollars 1.25 a share, a little weaker than the Dollars 1.31 of the first period).</p>

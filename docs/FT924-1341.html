			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Joint venture helps Wessex Water rise by 11% to Pounds 44.3m WESSEX WATER, supplier of water and sewerage services from Bristol to Bournemouth, announced a 11 per cent rise in interim profits helped by the first full contribution from its joint venture with Waste Management of the US. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 39.8m to Pounds 44.3m in the six months to September 30, despite lower interest earnings as capital investment eliminated cash holdings. Mr Nicholas Hood, chairman, described the results as'sparkling' and said they reflected tight control of operating costs. Turnover increased 8.3 per cent to Pounds 102.3m, mainly reflecting average price increases of 8 per cent. Recession led to an estimated 1.5 per cent fall in metered income from business and factories. Operating profits rose 24 per cent to Pounds 42.1m as costs were held steady at Pounds 44.9m, reflecting restructuring advantages and tighter cost control. Net interest earnings fell to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 6.1m) as Wessex went from net cash of Pounds 15m to net borrowings of Pounds 9m. Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 74m (Pounds 52m) and is forecast to reach Pounds 130m for the full year. Wessex Waste Management, the 49.9 per cent owned joint venture with Waste Management, made trading profits of Pounds 3.2m and remained on target, Mr Hood said. Five smaller waste businesses were acquired during the period at an initial cost of Pounds 6.3m. Earnings per share increased from 36.2p to 40.6p. The interim dividend goes up to 7.3p (6.6p). COMMENT Wessex is one of the best regarded water companies, both in terms of its core business management and the unregulated waste venture, and there was nothing in these figures to challenge that reputation. The jewel to provide Mr Hood's sparkle was control of operating costs. This flowed from reduced central overheads and cost control among individual business units, although overall costs were slightly flattered by a one-off reduction in depreciation. Outside the core, Wessex Waste Management continued to make progress and looks set to beat initial forecasts of a Pounds 6m contribution, which would be more than 7 per cent of trading profits. Full year forecasts of Pounds 85m put the shares on just under 8 times with a yield under 5 per cent. That is expensive relative to the sector, especially given yesterday's 7p rise to 584p.</p>

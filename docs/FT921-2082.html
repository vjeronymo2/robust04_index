			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / 'Male-dominated' industry attacked INDUSTRIES in the UK are male-dominated and have much to learn about equal opportunities, according to Ms Hilary Williams, the British Gas executive who won a sex discrimination battle against her employer on Wednesday. An industrial tribunal in west London told the company to reinstate her as marketing services manager of its south-west region. 'Male-dominated industries will have to learn that there is a wealth of talent which happens to be female, and that even at the best of economic times you cannot afford to waste it,' Ms Williams said. 'Companies must make the very best use of all human resources. It's only economic sense.' Ms Williams took action against British Gas after she was replaced by a male colleague in her Pounds 45,000-a-year post and was subsequently told by the regional marketing director that she had taken the news like a man - 'even though you are the wrong shape'. After her demotion Ms Williams - who was once tipped to be the first female regional director with British Gas - continued working for the company in spite of her claim that she had been a victim of discrimination. The Equal Opportunities Commission said yesterday that her victory was timely as it followed a survey of women directors showing that three quarters of them believe sexual discrimination is common in the workplace. Ms Williams' case was important, the company added, because she was a high-flyer and British Gas was at the heart of a significant industry. The company is also a participant in Opportunity 2000, the business-led initiative on the employment and promotion of women. The tribunal awarded her compensation of Pounds 8,000 and told British Gas to reinstate her in her original job. Ms Williams said she wanted British Gas to employ her where her skills were most effective, but added that many other women felt unable to pursue similar claims. 'In these sorts of cases it is up to the person who complains to prove there has been sexual discrimination, and that is very difficult,' she explained. 'Many women may feel they do not have enough evidence.' Ms Williams warned women considering similar action: 'It has been an ordeal.' But she added: 'I do feel my case demonstrates that career women should expect fairness in a way in which they perhaps don't at the moment. No company, however large, is above the law.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.L.: "Friends in Abuse of the Regime: This Is </F> How the Communists Themselves Have Defined the Most Important of  Their Party's Occupations"]    [Text] The very phrase "material of a Central Committee  plenum" evokes bad memories in journalists with pre-perestroyka  experience. But the 45 seats of the communist faction in the  Duma and the 400,000 circulation of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA compel,  whether we like it or not, an entirely serious attitude toward  plenums of the communists. In addition, when the red  chiefs--Chikin, Zyuganov, and Tuleyev--consolidate, creating a  new movement with the participation of Govorukhin and Glazyev,  this also is reason to once again ask: Who are the communists  today, what are they doing, how does their internal program  differ from the street slogans?    Those who have not forgotten the red banners at the White  House and Ostankino in October would be pleasantly surprised  upon reading the material of the recent plenum of the Communist  Party of the Russian Federation Central Executive Committee. The  communists advocate conversion, a fight against crime, and a  national information space. No one is summoning anyone to the  barricades, on the contrary, the current contradictions may be  resolved only by the nonviolent path under conditions of civic  peace. In addition, party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov is calling  for the "open and honest adoption of the so-called `local  concerns theory.'"    Painting the portrait of his organization, Zyuganov is  altogether critical in a manner that is not communist. Even  earlier it might have been suspected that the Communist Party of  the Russian Federation was mainly a party of retirees, whose  primary cells it was easiest to create under the auspices of  district social security departments. The report confirmed this  impression. "The age and social composition of our primaries do  not yet correspond to the requirements of the times....  Exclusive party groups and restrictive party activities  frequently become a venue for the like-minded in their narrow  circle to unburden themselves, abusing the current regime, and  are essentially a means of psychological release, not  psychological mobilization. And several levels higher--street  demonstrations which are also of practically invariable  composition and are increasingly amounting to the role of  psychological safety valve as well."    Do not be deluded by the "local concerns theory" and the  "age  composition of the primaries": Even at the present time the  Communist Party is preparing--in a coalition, it is true--to  enter into control of the state. It is obvious that the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation will, for all that, be  seeking support not in the district social security departments  but among the agrarians and miners, having caught very precisely  the demands of certain strikers for early presidential elections.    Mention has been made repeatedly of the political plasticity  of Gennadiy Zyuganov. In the eyes of some he is a socialist, for  others, a hard-line Leninist communist. The present report  identifies Zyuganov's approach to the future presidential  elections. It is clear to the communists that the present  president should not take part in them. But it is important and  not, I believe, out of the question for those who voted for the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation that Zyuganov would  not like to see Rutskoy among the candidates either. "After all,  the amnesty was adopted," Zyuganov argues, "to ensure the most  painless possibility of the departure of all politicians who  wittingly or unwittingly dragged the country into chaos and  fratricide."    Nor would the leader of the communists care to have  Zhirinovskiy as a competitor either. Without naming Vladimir  Volfovich directly, Zyuganov warned the communists against some  "social messiah" capable of creating in society "a belief in  simple and most rapid solutions for all problems."    As ensues from the plenum material, the leaders of the  communists feel more lively and confident in the Duma than in a  dialogue with their own party. By all accounts, the sole  solution for political survival is an attempt to create some  mass movement of the left. It cannot be ruled out that the name  "communist party" will be buried en route. Otherwise with the  inevitability of the change of seasons the present communists  will be quitting the political highway together with the  generation which they, mainly, represent.</p>

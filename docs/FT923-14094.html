			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Sotheby's relieved at sale of Rembrandt: Saleroom A WAVE of relief washed over the auction room at Sotheby's yesterday as Rembrandt's impressive portrait of Johannes Uyttenbogaert was knocked down at Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 4.18m with premium). It was bought by Dr Otto Naumann, a dealer, on behalf of the man sitting beside him, Dr Alfred Bader, a Milwaukee-based collector of Dutch 17th-century painting - predominantly of the Rembrandt school. Dealers and collectors have been playing a waiting game to see what happens in the market for Old Masters. Sotheby's showed signs of nervousness ahead of yesterday's auction and can seldom have expended more energy on trying to find buyers. The picture - which had an impeccable country house provenance and the blessing of the Rembrandt Research Project - was offered with an extremely cautious estimate of Pounds 3m-plus. A small Rembrandt panel bought in at Christie's in April had drawn bids up to Pounds 6m. A Sotheby's saleroom notice announced that an overseas purchaser who applied for an export licence immediately after the auction would not be obliged to pay the purchase price until after the licence was granted - or in six months if that were sooner. Mr Julien Stock, head of Sotheby's Old Master department, said he had known before the sale that he had a buyer but not an underbidder - a second interested person to bid up the price. Dr Naumann also secured a striking canvas by Giulio Cesare Procaccini of a strangely smiling Judith clutching the head of Holofernes. It was offered with a low estimate of Pounds 25,000-Pounds 35,000 and realised Pounds 209,000. Guido Reni's David with the Head of Goliath, the second main lot of the sale, fared less well. Mr Stock said there had been four serious contenders for the picture but none materialised on the day. Bidding on the picture stopped at Pounds 1.25m - one bid more would have secured it. The vendor was one of many at Sotheby's - and tomorrow at Christie's - prepared to sell at a considerable loss. The Reni canvas was bought for Pounds 2m at Sotheby's in 1985 when the National Gallery in London had hoped to acquire it. Bidding on Lucas Cranach the Elder's sensual personification of Justice crept up to Pounds 350,000, and a number of lots sold surprisingly well. An extravagant architectural capriccio by Francisco Gutierrez made Pounds 181,500 (estimate Pounds 30,000 plus) and another 17th-century Spanish picture, a still life by Juan de Espinosa, realised Pounds 143,000. The morning session totalled Pounds 7,422,800 with a respectable 71.32 per cent sold by value.</p>

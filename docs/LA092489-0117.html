			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: NEW-LOOK COINS? MAYBE LAWMAKERS WILL FLIP FOR IT  </P> <P>  -- Most members of Congress say it's time for a change in change. But others  think the idea isn't worth a plugged nickel. At least 260 House members and 66  senators are co-sponsoring legislation to change the "tail" sides of coins,  replacing such pictures as Thomas Jefferson's home and the Lincoln Memorial  with themes celebrating the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The "heads" would  still carry portraits of Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson, Franklin D. Roosevelt,  George Washington and John F. Kennedy, although the portraits would be revised.  Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) blocked similar legislation in the House last  year. "On a scale of importance from one to 10, coin design change rates a  zero," he said. And U.S. Mint Director Donna Pope said there is no evidence  that anyone who doesn't collect coins "is dissatisfied with current coin  designs, or even favors new ones."  </P> <P>  -- Famous fans sang the praises of Irving Berlin, "a legendary man whose words  and music will help define the history of our nation," in the words of  President Bush. Bush joined a Boston crowd of thousands in singing "God Bless  America," one of the classic songs by Berlin, who died Friday at age 101.  Ginger Rogers, longtime partner of Fred Astaire, said working with Berlin in  the 1935 film "Top Hat" was "like heaven." Morton Gould, president of the  American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, said Berlin's works are  "part of our language, part of our heartbeat, part of our soul." Former  President Ronald Reagan expressed his sorrow in a statement that called the  composer "a wonderfully talented man whose musical genius delighted and stirred  millions, and will live on forever." John Wallowitch, who had organized  Christmas Eve serenades outside Berlin's Manhattan townhouse for more than two  decades, said he and three friends went to the home after Berlin's death.  Wallowitch said: "We just stood there and cried a lot and sang: 'I'll be loving  you always.' "  </P> <P>  -- Two rare books written or printed by Benjamin Franklin were stolen from the  University of Pennsylvania library, police said. Franklin printed "A Sermon on  Education," by Richard Peters, in 1751. It includes a pamphlet by Franklin  called "An Idea of an English School" and is worth $10,000. The second book, "A  Log of Books to Be Sold," was written by Franklin in 1744 and is worth between  $25,000 and $50,000. DAVE JOHNSON  </P></p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Frank talk, Mr Kohl The Franco-German summit, due to start today, is not just another routine event. It is also an opportunity for frank, private talk about the European Union's role in the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. With the deadline two weeks away, this may be the final chance. Last week, Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, agreed with the British prime minister that failure of the round would be 'intolerable'. He will need to transmit this understanding to the French leaders. Public denunciations would be counter-productive. But this should not prevent a quiet proffering of both a carrot and a stick. First, though, must come appreciation of the position. It is in the interests neither of the European Union nor of any single member to see the round fail. It would be still more ruinous if that failure were to be caused by the recalcitrance of the EU. Maddest of all would be failure over agriculture. Even in France, agriculture employs only 6 per cent of the population and generates 3 per cent of gross domestic product. This French neurosis does not show appreciation of the country's long-term economic interests. Should the round fail over the issue, the European Union would confront three crises. The first would be over the credibility of its desire to act as a positive force on the world stage. The second would be in transatlantic relations. The last and deepest would be over Europe's place in the world. If the round were to founder, to what role, other than a marginal one, could the EU aspire? The US has alternatives, notably its close relationship with the world's most economically dynamic region, as this month's meeting on Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) in Seattle indicated. Is the EU to focus its efforts on increased trade with a bankrupt Russia, a troubled eastern Europe and the mostly stagnant members of the Lome convention? Both the European Union and France must remove themselves from the hook on which they are impaled. This can be done by accelerating the EU's move towards world prices for agricultural commodities and simultaneously increasing compensation to farmers. The latter would be particularly important if - as the French fear, but the European Commission denies - the Blair House accord were to prove more restrictive than the EU's agreed reforms of its common agricultural policy. In addition, the French should be assured of strong support where their case is rather stronger, as it is over audiovisual services and, above all, over the obstacles being created by the US. The EU needs to go on the offensive. It can readily do so. The US is vulnerable over its miserly attitude to liberalisation of trade in textiles, over its last-minute amendments to rules governing anti-dumping and services and, first and foremost, over its desire to play fast and loose with multilateralism itself. The Germans are right not to hector the French in public, but they must play the frank friend in private. France needs to understand that it cannot exercise a veto that it does not, in fact, possess. This is the stick. Assistance with the resultant political problems is the carrot. In the end, however, it is up to French politicians to persuade their people of the evident truth that clinging to an agricultural past will not give them a better future.</p>

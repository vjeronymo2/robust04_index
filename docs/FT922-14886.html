			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Valuers accused of knocking down the housing market: The competing theories for the continuing decline in prices LAST autumn building societies and estate agents thought that the worst news was over in the housing market and that recovery would get under way soon. They were badly wide of the mark. November to January saw house prices fall by more than 1 percentage point each month, according to two main house-price indices, published by Halifax and Nationwide building societies. On Tuesday Nationwide published figures showing that prices fell again in February, although less steeply, by 0.2 per cent. This encouraged some observers to say that the housing market may finally have bottomed out. After two years of deep gloom the consistently downward trend is a nasty surprise for mortgage lenders and home owners alike, many of whom had expected a recovery in the market months ago. The shock is particularly disagreeable if you are a prospective purchaser who has made an offer on a home after persuading the seller to cut his price substantially, but still find that the valuer's price is less than the one you are offering. Estate agents report cases in which buyers, finding that they have to raise several thousand pounds more because of a low valuation, are forced to withdraw an offer. Mr Derek Taylor, general manager of Halifax's estate agency chain, says: 'A first-time buyer looks for a very high percentage mortgage loan and has got little cash to put in and may want a 95 per cent mortgage. So if the house is valued down by a couple of thousand pounds, it is a lot of money to them.' Several reasons are given for the price collapse: first-time buyers are still reluctant to enter the market; people who bought at the top of the housing boom in 1988, and who expected to become second or third-time buyers in the early 1990s, find themselves grounded; and an upsurge in home repossessions - 74,500 in 1991 - has drowned any reviving demand. Builders, some estate agents, and housing market analysts suggest a further factor. They believe that valuers and surveyors are talking the market down with pessimistic house-price estimates. Mr Frank Harris, a City estate agent, gives one example: 'We were horrified at a drop of 15 per cent by one valuer, when we could show from our records that the market in the City had dropped by only 2 per cent or 3 per cent.' Virtually no lenders, and very few estate agents, can be found who are willing to criticise valuers in public. A typical view is that it is difficult to value property in a falling market and the general public should realise that the days of inflated house-price expectations are gone. Royal Life Estates, the largest UK chain with 584 residential offices, said: 'We have been struggling for the past two years to get people to be realistic about what their homes are now worth. It is a very fine line between getting the valuation level with what potential vendors are prepared to accept and what a building society is prepared to lend on.' Some outside specialist observers of the housing finance industry, however, are convinced that unnecessarily low valuations are a serious handicap to the market. John Wriglesworth, a housing finance specialist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the City stockbroker, says: 'Many valuers are being ultra-cautious, because they are scared of possible legal actions, and this is killing some transactions and stopping the market reviving.' One estate agent who agrees is Mr Harry Hill, joint general manager at Hambro Countrywide, another of the large estate agency chains. 'In my view, the valuers are causing part of the fall in house prices,' he says. 'We did a survey of our experience in 50 sales in two separate areas and found that in one area 27 out of 50, and in the other 23 out of 50, had been downvalued.' Mr Hill says that valuers sometimes cut a valuation by suspiciously small amounts. 'Valuers are always working from an agreed purchase price arrived at after lengthy bargaining, so to value the property differently by Pounds 150 is extremely pedantic.' Why should that be happening? One unprovable, and hotly denied, theory is that the lenders have issued secret instructions to valuers to cut prices back to the bone. On that view, some valuations now reflect not the normal sale price of a house, but rather what it would fetch if it was offered in a distressed sale or after repossession by the lender. Newly built houses have been especially prone to this kind of downgrading. Last September the House Builders Federation voiced its members' suspicions at a meeting with several large lenders. Mr Paul Hale, managing director of Nationwide Building Society Surveyors, says: 'It is not in the interests of lenders or valuers to ensure that a deal goes under by downvaluing deliberately.' A more plausible theory is that valuers have become ultra-cautious because they fear being sued if their valuation is proved wrong. Even when there is no litigation, querying of valuations has become more common. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors' insurance arm says claims against about 4,000 firms that use its insurance schemes have increased since 1988. That year it had about 350 claims, costing about Pounds 2.5m. By 1990 there were more than 700 claims and the cost jumped to Pounds 18m. Mr David Gilchrist, general manager at Halifax Building Society, points out: 'There may may be some nervousness out there. It is always difficult to make a judgment when there are few buyers and fewer transactions around.'</p>

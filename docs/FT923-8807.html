			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Lunn Poly optimistic on winter bookings OVERCAPACITY IN the summer travel market will restrict holiday company profits, but bookings for winter holidays are 12 per cent ahead of the level at this time last year, a report by Lunn Poly, the travel agent, said yesterday. It said companies had overestimated summer demand, leading to discounting and a probable fall in profits. It said more than 7m people would take an overseas package holiday this summer - up 15 per cent from last year and up 6 per cent from 1990. Lunn Poly said industry sales for the 1992-93 winter season were 12 per cent ahead of last year. Last winter matched the record winter of 1988-89 with almost 1.9m taking a winter break. Tenerife and Florida were the most popular 1992-93 winter destinations.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HARD-WORKING HEAVY METAL FAN SPEAKS OUT  </P> <P> From time to time the newspapers run articles about organizations that are  trying to ban heavy metal music because they feel it is a bad influence on  teen-agers.  </P> <P> I am a hard-working student at Dana Hills High School who strives to get good  grades. I also listen to heavy metal music. My parents had trouble adjusting to  my interest in heavy metal, but I pointed out to them that I do, indeed, get  good grades and that I was aware of their concerns. I made a deal with them  that if I started doing poorly in school, then they could take my tapes from  me.  </P> <P> I am very lucky to have the parents I have. Many won't even give the music a  chance, much less their children, and others form activist groups that focus on  the negative side of heavy metal rather than looking at the positive.  </P> <P> It seems that these parents don't remember that our ancestors fought a  revolution to win the rights we have today. One of these is the freedom of  speech -- and music is a form of speech.  </P> <P> Admittedly, some heavy metal bands do cause problems and are nothing but  trouble. But there are a lot of other metal groups that do not. Many parents  mistakenly feel that rock bands with long-haired singers and loud voices are  bad, but they should take the time to listen to the music and see for  themselves that it is not.  </P> <P> BRIAN UNDERWOOD  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

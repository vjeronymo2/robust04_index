			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / MPs step up calls over child agency Pressure on the government to reform the controversial Child Support Agency increased yesterday with demands for change from MPs. Members of the Commons social security committee were, however, divided over how far the changes should go, and its recommendations came in for immediate criticism. The agency was set up to ensure that absent parents, usually fathers, make proper financial support for their children. It was bitterly attacked during its first year of operation for making unrealistic financial demands, and for the poor quality of its administration. Ms Ros Hepplewhite, chief executive, resigned in September. The committee calls in its report for special treatment for couples who split up before the agency was established, reponding to complaints that it had interfered with 'clean-break' settlements. The committee recommends changes in the way earnings and maintenance are calculated, and improved social security safety-net arrangements for single parents. Although the committee's final report was unanimous, Conservative members had earlier rejected proposals for further change, including an independent appeals system and more beneficial financial arrangements for single and absent parents. The government is expected to revise the maintenance formula used by the agency, but is unlikely to want to embark on the committee's wider programme for change. Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the committee, emphasised that it remained united in the view that establishing the agency, 'revolutionary as it is', was right in principle. However, Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said the report would be 'condemned as tinkering with the problem'.</p>

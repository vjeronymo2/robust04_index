			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Lusaka talks are still covering specific issues  of the national police force. Blondin Beye and the observers  today met with the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA]. The government did not take part in the meeting  and is not aware of the outcome of the meeting. Pedro Manuel  reports from Lusaka:    There are contradictory reports about the new text dealing  with specific issues. Yesterday the mediator and the observers  were reported to have drafted a new document. Meanwhile,  reliable sources say the mediator and the observers failed to  put the final touches on the new document because UNITA did not  cooperate. UNITA successively postponed its comments on the  specific principles ruling the police force, alleging that it  needed more time to evaluate the main document. Finally, this  afternoon the UNITA negotiating team presented its position to  the mediator and the observers, but it has not been possible to  confirm this in view of the news blackout [preceding word in  English].    Meanwhile, the government is awaiting for Blondin Beye to  give details about this afternoon's meeting between the  mediator, the observers and UNITA. There are rumors that  government and UNITA delegations will meet face to face tomorrow.</p>

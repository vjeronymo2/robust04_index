			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday  said "comprehensive" sanctions against North Korea following  reports of its decision to withdraw from the International  Atomic and Energy Agency (IAEA) are "premature" at this point in  time.    Instead, he said only "limited" sanctions, such as the  IAEA's  Board of Governors' decision to suspend nonmedical technical  assistance to Pyongyang, are appropriate "at this point in time"  because it symbolizes the concerns of the international  community.    The Philippines, a member of the IAEA's Board of Governors,  supported the 10 June resolution of the Vienna based nuclear  watchdog on the suspension of assistance to North Korea. The  resolution was largely symbolic because Pyongyang has never  availed of such technical assistance.    "We (the Philippines) are not prepared to think of  comprehensive sanctions at this point in time. We would rather  encourage further dialogue between the IAEA and North Korea and  its (Pyongyang) dialogue partners," Mr. Romulo said.    "Moreover, we continue to believe that China can be the  country that can make the difference and be a moderating force  in this rather regrettable situation on the Korean peninsula,"  he added.    He said the Philippines backed the IAEA action because it is  a timely and limited measure "called for by the specifics of the  situation" since the Stalinist North has yet to fully comply  with current nuclear testing standards.    The United States, South Korea, and Japan have voiced their  concern on the Stalinist state's refusal to comply with IAEA  requirements on nuclear inspection of North Korea's suspected  nuclear facilities in Yongbyon.    The three have threatened to impose sanctions on North  Korea,  with Tokyo reportedly contemplating on a package of possible  steps such as a ban on cash remittances and trade restrictions.  Remittances from the Korean community in Japan to the Communist  North is estimated to amount to over $1 billion a year.    The foreign affairs chief said it is important to explore  all  avenues for peaceful dialogue and to exhaust "every means of  promoting" discussion before the international community resorts  to sanctions.    In this light, the Philippines is against possible economic  sanctions against North Korea. The foreign affairs chief  considers such sanctions "comprehensive."    The Philippines called on North Korea to remain within the  IAEA "for the sake of finding a peaceful solution to the issue"  after Pyongyong declared its withdrawal from the Vienna-based  U.N. agency.    Mr. Romulo, who spoke to Philippine Ambassador to Vienna  Reynaldo Arcilla yesterday morning, clarified that the IAEA  Secretariat has yet to receive North Korea's notice of  withdrawal.    Under Article XVIII.D of the IAEA's statute, a state may  withdraw from membership in the Vienna-based institution only if  formal notice is given to the IAEA's depository state -- the  United States. Until now, the IAEA Secretariat has not been  informed by the U.S. Government of a withdrawal notice from  North Korea.    It further clarified that a "State's obligations under a  safeguards agreement with the IAEA are independent of membership  in the organization." Thus, North Korea still remains legally  bound by its safeguards agreement with the IAEA under the  non-proliferation treaty (NPT) agreement.</p>

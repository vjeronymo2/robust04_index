			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Business backs urban initiative The government will press ahead with its drive to revitalise urban centres following a solid endorsement for its quality initiative from business leaders yesterday. The government launched its Quality in Town and Country initiative in July with the publication of a discussion document and invited interested parties to comment. Mr Paul Murrain of Oxford Brookes University, who assisted in compiling the response document, said that about 95 per cent of the respondents thought the government's quality initiative was valuable. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said yesterday at a symposium organised to consider the results of the document that the response had stiffened his resolve to continue with the initiative. He committed the government to promoting a proper mix of uses in development, taking action to increase transport choice, advancing town centre management in general and discussing how and when design should be addressed in the planning system. Mr Gummer added that the quality initiative would be applied in developing a new vision for the River Thames. A study to identify the development potential of the banks of the Thames was under way, and he would publish a new strategic planning guidance for the river in the new year. Mr Roy Swanston, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said there was a close correlation between the degree to which towns had maintained the quality of their townscape and their economic fortunes.</p>

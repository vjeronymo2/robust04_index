			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / VW squeezes out vice-chairman in reorganisation MR DANIEL Goeudevert has been squeezed out of his post as vice-chairman of the Volkswagen group as a result of a 'structural reorganisation', VW said at the weekend. He will leave at the end of July by 'mutual agreement'. His main duties, responsibility for the VW brand - accounting for two-thirds of group sales - will be taken on by Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman. Only four of the 10 management directors who were on the board at the time of Mr Piech's appointment are still in their former positions, but Mr Goeudevert will continue as a consultant. Once favourite to become group chairman, he lost to Mr Piech in last autumn's selection, when the scale of the group's crisis was becoming clear. Since then he has increasingly appeared the odd man out, especially following the arrival in March of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua as group production and procurement director. This further eroded his operational role, leaving him basically in charge of marketing the VW marque, while Mr Lopez was adopted as the chairman's closest confidant. Mr Goeudevert's intellectual approach set him further apart from the engineering duo committed to rescuing Germany's biggest volume car manufacturer. He was also tainted by Mr Piech's accusation that the former group board had failed to do its 'homework' during the eight prosperous years, before VW was overtaken by recession in the second half of 1992. After a DM1.25bn (Dollars 737m) loss in the first quarter of this year, the group is heading rapidly back into the black, according to Mr Piech. While markets languish in recession, most of the progress in cutting losses is being made through large-scale labour cuts and pressure on components suppliers for rapid cuts in parts prices. Mr Lopez, who was brought in from General Motors to cut VW's procurement and manufacturing costs, was accused at the weekend of driving Giesserei Mittelmann, a metalworking company, into bankruptcy. 'We are Lopez's first victim,' a lawyer acting for the company said. A Mittelmann official said that having already agreed to reduce prices by 7 per cent, he received last month a demand for further cuts from the start of 1994. A VW manager reportedly told him that unless he agreed to reductions of 28 per cent on products accounting for a third of Mittelmann's sales, the contract would go to Spain.</p>

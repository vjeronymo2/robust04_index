			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of speech by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de </F> Gortari to the second working session of the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit at the Barahona Hall of the Convention  Center in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14 June]    [Text] Mr. President of Bolivia,    Mr. President of Colombia and host,    Your Majesty,    Gentlemen heads of state and government,    Leaders of international organizations,    Ladies and gentlemen:    The solidarity of the people of Mexico is with the people of  Colombia in the region of Cauca and Huila.    We are here today, on this generous Colombian soil, to  continue to strengthen our relations, to progress in our  commitments, and to project our presence toward Ibero-America,  and through it to the rest of the world.    We have a large task before us. We share the challenge of  achieving greater economic growth and more justice for our  people in a more competitive world.    It has been said, and with reason, there are no sole  solutions. This is why the diversity that characterizes us, due  to the cultural background we share, demands joint efforts in  areas that are indispensable to expand the domestic progress of  each of our nations. This is where we find, amid other shared  concerns, trade and investment, the two topics suggested for  this meeting.    This fourth summit offers us the opportunity to seek  agreements regarding these issues. I am convinced we must  continue to promote our current regional agreements and draft  new treaties that will better coordinate economic policies and  expand the margins of exchange, investment, and the creation of  jobs throughout Ibero-America. Many of these agreements  encourage trade liberation and allow a more efficient  participation of our countries in international markets. This  is why we view with optimism the progress made within Latin  America to form subregional trade zones.    Likewise, bilateral commercial agreements on the continent  and in the Iberian countries are important. These agreements  allow the whole region to grow closer.    Far from being centrifugal forces, these bilateral and  multilateral agreements can become the foundation for a new  concept of regional integration. Mexico has promoted commercial  agreements to the north and south of the continent, in Europe,  and the Pacific Rim. This is why we welcome the talks among our  peoples, as we are doing today, to enrich ourselves with all the  diversity that makes us different and to take advantage of all  that we share.    The most encouraging thing today is the shared certainty  that  free and just exchange of capitals, assets, and services is  helpful for us all. The signing of the agreement that ended the  GATT Uruguay Round on 15 April opens new doors in international  economic relations, because it better defines the legal  framework that regulates international trade, and today, for the  first time, includes the agricultural sector in commercial  negotiations.    We must make more progress in certain aspects of  multilateral  trade, however. It is important that we give greater  recognition to the efforts being made toward unilateral opening  and change. It is necessary for us to expand the agreement to  include services and labor and environmental issues.    It is essential to progress by making larger adjustments in  monetary policies, technological exchange, and shared production  in order to broaden trade openings and investments.  Ibero-America must intensify its influence at multilateral  forums, especially at the new World Trade Organization.    Messrs. chiefs of state and government, I also want to  congratulate and commend President Cesar Gaviria for his new job  as OAS secretary general. We feel his job is ours.    When we began holding Ibero-American summits in 1991, we  stated their original purpose was to become a regional and  political forum by acknowledging common historical roots and  making future tangible proposals. As we have rightfully  insisted, the Ibero-American community's pivotal point lies in  the convergence of trade and social, cultural, and educational  commitments.    Our nations' priority is to guarantee the welfare of the  less  fortunate. We cannot progress if we have inefficient and  isolated economies, but we cannot move forward if we have global  yet socially irresponsible economies. We must insist that  economic recovery go hand in hand with a deliberate social  reform and a pluralistic democratic progress.    It is necessary to strike a balance to ensure that economic  growth, social welfare, democratic progress, and an efficient  entry into the world economy will come about together. This has  been one of Mexico's deliberate objectives: to embark  simultaneously on an economic reform to guarantee a great social  reform and a pluralistic progress, as well as to diversify our  relations to promote internal transformation efforts.    Other Ibero-American nations have progressed with their own  projects that meet their peoples' needs. Their efforts  strengthen our common goals.    Each effort at integration among our nations should not  become a pretext to avert the flow of trade or create nontrading  blocs. We can reach GATT-compatible agreements that will become  the engines of economic activities, investments, job creation,  and income distribution, which is what matters the most. With  this in mind, we will augment our voice in the region, thereby  linking Ibero-America together, crossing seas, sharing our  concerns and reaffirming our world presence.    The possibility of reinforcing our world efforts lies in our  resolve to work together. This is why, taking up the  liberator's ideal, we can certainly say what he did: "I take  this hope as a revelation." Thank you very much.</p>

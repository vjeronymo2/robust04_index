			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 23 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The Guatemalan  National Federation of State Workers Unions [Fenasteg], which  began a 72-hour strike today to demand a 40-percent salary  increase, has demanded the resignation of President Ramiro de  Leon Carpio.    Fenasteg has also demanded the intervention of the  Inter-American Human Rights Court to guarantee the security of  40 workers who, as of this morning, seized the government house.    Fenasteg leader Armando Sanchez, who leads the 40 workers  who  are occupying the National Palace and another 5,000 workers who  are demonstrating in the outskirts, has told NOTIMEX they will  not leave the building.    Sanchez has blamed De Leon, who took power on 6 June 1993,  for the situation of "ungovernability," the wave of violence and  insecurity, and the economic, political, and social crises  Guatemala is facing.    Sanchez has said: "Guatemalans are disappointed with the  current government. Everyone has made a mistake by believing  Ramiro de Leon was going to be a fair president who would  readdress the country's fate."    Sanchez has said there is a consensus regarding De Leon's  resignation. He has said: "As the situation is progressing in  Guatemala, any sector might try to overthrow de Leon."    Sanchez explained the national strike is aimed at pressuring  the government into complying with its promises to overcome the  levels of poverty affecting 8 million people in Guatemala.    Sanchez said a group of 100 workers has met with Jose  Francisco Guerrero, president of the Central American Parliament  [Parlacen], whom they asked to form a commission to mediate in  the labor conflict.    The committee members are reportedly Sergio Ramirez, former  Nicaraguan vice president; a Honduran delegate; Vinicio Cerezo  Arevalo, former president of Guatemala; and members of the  Parlacen Board of Directors.    The union leader said a communique will be sent within the  next few hours to the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras,  Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, asking them to intervene and  attempt to try and convince De Leon Carpio to soften his  position.    Sanchez, in an interview at the National Palace, said a  motion was also presented in Geneva, Switzerland, demanding  respect for labor and human rights in Guatemala.    About 100 policemen have surrounded the building, while some  40 members of the Presidential General Staff, geared with gas  masks, are awaiting orders to evict the union members.    Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman, Government  Ministry  personnel, and National Police Director Mario Cifuentes, among  others, are inside the building.    De Leon Carpio is touring Chimaltenango, some 57 km west of  the capital.</p>

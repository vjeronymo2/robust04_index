			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Bank property sales net Pounds 200m STANDARD Chartered has raised Pounds 200m from a series of property sales in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. The properties, which include its Hong Kong headquarters and several branches, cost the bank only Pounds 13m and were valued in its balance sheet at Pounds 77m. It has owned many of them for decades. Mr Rodney Galpin, the chairman, who is due to retire next year, said the sales were carried out as part of the bank's strategy of concentrating on its international banking businesses. They followed the sales at the end of 1989 of the bank's London headquarters and its Singapore office block for a total of Pounds 403m. The largest of the latest disposals is of Standard's interest in its Hong Kong headquarters building - which cost the bank Pounds 2m - to Amoy Properties for Pounds 74m. Last week, it announced the disposal of 13 Hong Kong commercial buildings, occupied by branches, to Koon Wah for Pounds 64m. A number of residential, commercial and investment properties in Singapore and Malaysia are also being sold. Some date from Standard Chartered's beginnings in UK colonial banking before the First World War. The sales mean that some of the company's Asian operations will now have to pay rent on the premises they occupy. However, a Standard executive said that in 1993 the bank would earn more from investing the sale proceeds than it would be paying in new rents. The deals will also lead to a Pounds 180m increase in the bank's tier one or core capital, a measure of balance sheet strength. Standard Chartered shares rose from 544p to 568p.</p>

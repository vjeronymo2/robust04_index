			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Notts Tec warns over pit closures CONTINUED pit closures in Nottinghamshire would have a 'devastating' effect on the economic and social life of the county, the North Nottinghamshire Training and Enterprise Council (Tec) warned the government yesterday. It called for a national energy policy based on the use of coal as a strategic fuel. This is the first political intervention by a Tec, 82 of which have been set up to bring training closer to the needs of the private sector and to foster business growth. 'Everything we do on the training and enterprise front can be negated by a rapid reduction of the (coal) industry,' said Mrs Pat Richards, chief executive of North Nottinghamshire Tec. The stand taken by the Tec reflects disquiet in the region's business, voluntary and political circles about the plans of - and for - British Coal. Nottinghamshire County Council has this week published its coalfield strategy for this year. It opposes coal imports and urges support for deep-mined coal. The council and the Tec are to put pressure today on Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, when he visits pits in the county. They will seek assurances about the future of the local mining industry under whatever organisation emerges after privatisation of British Coal. The council and Tec are seeking a meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to urge a review of coal policy. Letters, Page 21</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: Numbers plucked out of the sky  -IT is playing a bigger role as companies struggle to improve their green record Pressure on business to improve its environmental performance will increase the load on information systems and on the people who manage and design them. This is because environmental management is largely about managing information. If a large company such as ICI, for example, were to take part in the EC's impending Eco-audit scheme, it would probably have to audit its 220 manufacturing sites in 40 countries and ensure that the results were accessible for inspection. This would place a heavy load on its existing information systems. It is still unclear, however, what specific tools will be needed for the job. One of the messages from business and politicians is for companies to improve their environmental performance by conducting regular audits to measure progress. But these procedures are relatively new and there are no universally agreed standards, although the overriding emphasis is on the collection and systematic storage of information. There is also pressure to develop standards for environmental reporting to be included in the year-end accounts. UK law is not yet as strong as that in the US which forces certain industries to publish precise information on emissions, in the Toxic Release Inventory. But it looks likely that EC legislation will eventually force member states to provide more information about industrial pollution. Another demand for data will be driven by eco-labelling schemes for consumer products, which are planned by most developed countries, as well as the EC. To obtain a label companies will have to provide comprehensive information about their products and manufacturing processes. Martin Houldin, environment specialist at management consultants KPMG, says much of the necessary information already exists within companies. 'The challenge is to extract the data from various parts of the business, consolidate it and then present it to managers in an acceptable format,' he says. This process will, initially, demand the skills of an information manager who can understand the function of the information and who knows how the data is generated and where it is stored. The UK government, for example, is looking for a consultancy to re-organise and expand its nationwide air monitoring system. The information is offered to scientists and the media for air quality reports. The job of improving the system demands knowledge of the subject, experience with the technology and an ability to translate raw scientific data into a form which people can understand. Roger Bagnall, environment products manager at International Business Machines, says most of a company's initial needs could be satisfied with existing software tools. 'There is an obvious need for databases, document storage and retrieval systems, electronic mail and presentation software,' he believes. Suppliers of information technology see the environmental market divided in two. The most easily defined area is the fast-growing demand for specific software tools designed for the environment-services sector, such as air-flow models. The other area, which is more general but still embryonic, will demand the expansion of existing information systems within companies. But because environmental pressures have an impact on nearly every part of a business, the initial demand will be on providing better systems planning to prevent information bottlenecks from developing. Many companies in the environmental services sector - including water and power utilities, waste managers, makers of pollution-prevention equipment, environment consultancies and government regulatory agencies  - are rather behind in the development of computer systems. There are obvious opportunities here for IT suppliers to sell office systems and other well-established technologies. Water companies are already providing a considerable market for IT suppliers. Severn Trent Water, for example, is building an automated monitoring and remote control system for its plants. The National Rivers Authority, the UK govting up an automatic monitoring scheme in eastern England. The system has 12 monitoring stations covering 14 different stretches of river. The stations send information via telephone lines to a central computer system. Electronic data interchange (EDI) systems, which also rely on telecommunications, should eventually find buyers among companies trying to reduce their environmental impact. These data communication systems, which are used to send electronic documents such as order forms between two or more companies, would improve the communications between waste managers, pollution inspectorates, local governments and water utilities. Some manufacturing companies have already seen the potential to improve efficiency and reduce paper consumption by expanding their EDI systems. Start-rite shoes, a maker of children's shoes based in Norfolk, has expanded its EDI system to achieve more efficient delivery (less fumes and transport hazards) and to reduce the use of paper. Most of the information which businesses require in order to take the first steps towards better environmental management will probably be found within the organisation. There are many ways in which the IT industry could develop tools to make this task easier. An obvious parallel is with executive information systems (EIS) which tap into a number of sources, re-arrange the data and then present it in a digestible form to managers. The IT industry is starting to identify this need but it will be some time before it designs something comparable to an EIS for the environment. Environmental software products now available are mostly technical tools designed for environmental consultants and manufacturers. These consist mainly of remote sensing devices, such as a sensor bolted to a chimney stack to measure emissions, feeding into data capture devices. They are all stand-alone devices so the IT manager's immediate task is to feed the information into the main system. Environmental pressures are beginning to create opportunities for IT suppliers to sell existing products to companies, such as water utilities which have been traditionally light users of IT. This is an expansion of existing markets and requires little more effort on behalf of the supplier other than to identify a need. Far more complex is the consultancy-based help that suppliers could offer IT managers in companies which have to consolidate information held in diffuse sources. The demand will be for information specialists who not only have a grasp of the technology but who can understand the nature of the environmental demands on the client's business. There are also opportunities for IT companies to develop software tools to do specific and complex jobs, such as modeling and the visual presentation of complicated environmental data. These business areas already have been identified by companies such as Digital Equipment and IBM. The primary demand on companies is to identify their needs for environmental information early enough to design the appropriate systems. One of the biggest threats is the development of independent systems which will be difficult to integrate into the mainstream. Another potential difficulty lies in the human problem of ignoring early warnings signs, or hoping that the information needs will not be as heavy as predicted.</p>

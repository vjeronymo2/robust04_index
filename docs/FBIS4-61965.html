			<p>BFN     [Text] Even on days off the upcoming elections of the first  Belarusian president remain a popular topic among Vitebsk  residents. The Vitebsk independent sociological agency Istina  decided to make some preliminary conclusions regarding the  results of its nonofficial poll. It conducted a selective phone  poll of 364 Vitebsk residents. Already at the start the  sociologists discovered an interesting detail: In Vitebsk  primarily women hold control over home phones. Therefore, the  prevailing majority of respondents is represented by the best  half of mankind of various age and professions. They gave their  sympathies to three leading politicians: Alyaksandr Lukashenka,  Vyachaslaw Kebich, and Stanislaw Shushkevich. The remaining  candidates for this prestigious post were much behind the  leaders. Almost half of the respondents link their hopes for  improving the situation in society and the economy with the  president. However, one fourth of the respondents did not  express any positive emotions regarding this issue.</p>

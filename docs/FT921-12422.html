			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Syndicated Loans: Borrowing costs set to rise at Rosehaugh THE RESTRUCTURING of loans to Rosehaugh, the heavily-indebted UK property company, and its property joint ventures, looks likely to result in higher borrowing costs for these companies. The restructuring of all of Rosehaugh's debts is due to be completed within a few weeks. As a result, Rosehaugh is expected to have to pay higher margins on its loans, and to have the maturity of these loans extended. Bankers may insist on improving the security on those loans currently unsecured or partly secured. Rosehaugh and Stanhope, joint owners of the Broadgate office complex in the City of London, called a halt to their merger talks last week after several months of discussions. According to data supplied by Euromoney, Rosehaugh and its associated companies have the following debts: A four-year Pounds 350m term loan for Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments (phase 8) and Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments (phase 11) which matures in 1992 and has a margin of 100 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). A three-and-a-half year Pounds 36m term loan for Rosehaugh SC, a 50-50 joint venture between Rosehaugh and Shimizu Corp. The loan matures in 1992. The funds are secured on the property with the margin set according to whether the property is pre-let or pre-sold. A five-year Pounds 100m multiple facility revolving credit for Rosehaugh which matures in 1993 and has a margin of 15 basis points over Libor. A four-year Pounds 65m term loan for Rosehaugh Stanhope (Broadgate phase 14) maturing in 1993. This carries a margin of 125 basis points over Libor during development, 75 during the let stage and 50 during the pre-sold stage with the funds secured. A four-year Pounds 280m term loan maturing 1994 for Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments (Holborn Viaduct) with a margin of 125 basis points falling to 100 basis points over Libor if the property is let. In addition, Rosehaugh and its joint venture companies have some bilateral loans. Rosehaugh warned its bankers in November 1991 that it was in danger of breaching the net worth covenants on its loans, due to the fall in property prices and the decline in its net asset value. Since then, Barclays and NatWest, joint co-ordinators for the various loans, have held discussions with the 27 banks involved on how to restructure all the company's facilities. So far it looks as though the pricing will have to be increased given that when the loans were originally launched, pricing was considerably lower than at present. The maturity of the loans may be extended, since at present the loans fall due in 1992, 1993 and 1994. Citibank has arranged a Pounds 50m five-year revolving credit facility for Laura Ashley with a core group of seven relationship banks. This replaces an existing three-year Pounds 60m facility signed in November 1990. Laura Ashley wanted to replace it with longer-term funding. The margin is linked to the company's financial performance. It ranges from 75 basis points over Libor to 125 depending on the interest cover ratio.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROMARKET TURNOVER (Dollars m)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                        Primary Market           Secondary Market                   US Dollars  Non-Dollars     US Dollars    Non-Dollars Fixed income bonds Euros straight     2,721.3     1,383.1     26,073.7      58,249.4 Other straight         9.0       838.1        794.1     122,130.5 Convertible            0.0         0.0      1,219.4       1,633.1 Money market instr FRN                  100.0        16.2      5,724.6       5,030.8 CD's                 193.4       167.5        948.2         465.1 Short Dollars MT Notes          16,848.3     4,534.4     7,811.7       13,637.0 Warrants               0.0         0.0       831.4          324.4 Equities              24.7         0.0       393.7        1,442.5 Total             19,896.7     6,939.3    43,796.8      202,912.8  --------------------------------------------------------------------                      Cedel   Euroclear        Total  -------------------------------------------------------------------- US Dollars        21,353.2    42,340.3     63,693.5 Other             66,546.8   143,305.3     209,852.1  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Week to January 23, 1992  -------------------------------------------------------------------- The Warrants and Equities figures are from Euroclear only Source ISMA  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

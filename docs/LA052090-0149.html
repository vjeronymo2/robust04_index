			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LANE VIOLATION  </P> <P> In the editorial (May 14), there was another blurb about the efficacy of  car-pool lanes, and as usual, you follow the other do-gooders who think they  know best how to make people lead their lives.  </P> <P> If you really want to see what an added lane does to reduce traffic, then open  the car-pool lanes to all traffic during rush hour to see some real reduction  in traffic.  </P> <P> All pool lanes, no matter what name they go by, infringe on my constitutional  rights by using my taxes discriminately. I have been, for the last 40 years, in  the construction equipment business. I drive, on an average, 40,000-plus miles  per year. I doubt that 1% of the time there is more than one person in my car.  I am one of several hundred thousand people in business whose car is the means  to a living.  </P> <P> I pay exactly the same amount of gas tax as the car-pool lane automobiles.  Because of the large number of miles per year that I drive, I pay far more than  the average car using the pool lanes.  </P> <P> Yet my taxes are used in a manner that restricts my use of the gasoline tax  that is designed to provide better and more roads and freeways for me to use.  </P> <P> Unless my logic is totally incorrect, that places me, and the previously  mentioned hundreds of thousands of salespeople whose automobiles are their  means for a livelihood, in the position of being taxed in a discriminatory  manner.  </P> <P> JOHN A. CLOES  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

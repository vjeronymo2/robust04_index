			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zuhayr Qusaybati: "Barzani Has Resumed </F> Negotiations With Baghdad"]    [Excerpts] London -- AL-HAYAH has learned from informed  Iraqi Kurdish sources that Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the  Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP], has resumed negotiations with  Baghdad.    The sources said that the party sent one of Barzani's senior  aides to Baghdad, where he held talks 11 and 12 June. They  confirmed that a KDP delegation including KDP Central Committee  Member Yunis Ruzbayani and 'Izzat Sulayman Bik, a prominent  party figure, visited Baghdad 10 June and met with President  Saddam Husayn's son Qusayy. The results of the talks are not  known.    The sources said that the three figures [as published] went  to the Iraqi capital via the Fa'idah point on the dividing lines  between the areas under the Iraqi Army's control and the areas  under the control of the Kurdistan Front [KF]. They added that  Falak al-Din Kaka'i, a prominent member of Barzani's party,  confirmed in an interview broadcast by the Voice of America's  Kurdish service Sunday night that the Turkish Government had  asked the party seven months earlier to start a dialogue with  the Iraqi Government. [passage omitted]    The same sources added that the KDP "perhaps interpreted the  Turkish request as being a reflection of the Western and  particulary the U.S. position." They did not rule out the  possibility that the negotiations between Barzani and Baghdad  might cause "more tension between the Kurdish leaders and,  generally, in the ranks of the Iraqi opposition."

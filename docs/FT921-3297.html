			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Lewis's pension trustees may take legal action LAW Debenture Corporation, trustees of the pension fund of the Lewis's stores group which went into receivership last year, is considering legal action against the former trustees claiming they may not have acted in the best interests of beneficiaries. While there are no allegations of fraud or that the trustees benefited personally, Law Debenture is questioning two transactions which appear to have benefited the company at the expense of beneficiaries. The former trustees were all executives or directors of Lewis's, which was formed in 1988 as part of a management buyout from Sears. When the buyout occurred Sears transferred pension assets to Lewis's intended to cover its former employees' pension liabilities and to provide a surplus. Lewis's crashed early last year with debts of Pounds 50m after its bankers refused to extend overdraft facilities. Law Debenture said that although the investments deprived pension fund members of about Pounds 3m out of a Pounds 14m fund, it had enough funds to meet all obligations to pensioners and was likely to be able to meet the cost of likely new laws requiring equal pensions for men and women. It is examining the pension fund's decision to purchase from Lewis's a derelict building in February 1990 for Pounds 2.4m. This represented about a quarter of the fund's assets at the time. The building had been purchased by Lewis's for the same amount the year before, just as UK property prices were beginning to soften. Law Debenture said there was no evidence that a full independent valuation of the property was made at the time of the sale to the pension fund. Solicitors for the former trustees, Ellison Westhorp, said the trustees viewed the property as an excellent development site which was likely to appreciate sharply over the next few years. They believed its eventual sale would cover any future contributions Lewis's would have to make to the fund. Negotiations for the sale of the property are set to be completed shortly with the pension fund expected to lose about Pounds 1.6m on the transaction. Law Debenture is also questioning the extension of an unsecured Pounds 1.25m loan in August 1990, six months before the company went into receivership and when it was already experiencing financial difficulties. Although interest was to be paid at a rate close to current bank base rates, Law Debenture believes the terms were more generous than a commercial lender would have extended on an unsecured loan to Lewis's given its financial difficulties.</p>

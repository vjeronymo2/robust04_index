			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Nadir was offered chance to control RHM: An acquisition plan just come to light that would have made Polly Peck 'the bakers to Europe' SOME OF the best-known brands on Britain's supermarket shelves might have passed to Mr Asil Nadir if an audacious plan for control of one of the country's largest food producers had not foundered three years ago. It emerged yesterday that Mr Nadir, the fugitive businessman who earlier this year illegally fled bail for northern Cyprus facing charges of theft and false accounting, was offered the chance to take a substantial stake in Ranks Hovis McDougall (RHM), the milling and baking group, in spring 1990. RHM, which was bought by the conglomerate Tomkins last December, produces goods such as Mr Kipling cakes, Mother's Pride bread, Bisto gravy and Rombouts coffee. Sir James Goldsmith, the international financier, offered his 29.9 per cent stake in the group to Mr Nadir on behalf of Polly Peck International, which entered administration in October 1990. Polly Peck's acquisitive growth in the 1980s brought it brands such as Del Monte, the fresh fruit business, and Sansui, the Tokyo-quoted electronics company. Sir James visited Mr Nadir with Mr Jim Slater, the one-time stock market guru and entrepreneur. The two men offered Mr Nadir the stake in RHM which was then owned by Sunningdale Holdings, a vehicle controlled by Sir James, Lord Rothschild and Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian media entrepreneur. The RHM shares were originally bought for 400p each in May 1989 after a takeover bid launched by Goodman Fielder Wattie, the Australian food group, lapsed the previous year following a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The stake was offered to Lord Hanson, but ultimately sold at a loss at the end of January 1991 at just 300p a share. The shares would have offered the chance for a takeover bid and given considerable influence with the board to Mr Nadir. It would have directly given him the power to block extraordinary resolutions, which require the support of 75 per cent of shareholders. Senior executives of Polly Peck at the time say that Mr Nadir was very excited by the RHM offer and particularly the prospect of acquiring the company's brands. According to one, he said: 'We will be the bakers to Europe.' He said Sir James and Mr Slater had told him he was the 'only person in England' who could take over RHM. Credit Suisse First Boston was commissioned to consider the acquisition. If it had gone ahead, the plan was to sell off the branded businesses and retain the baking operations. But the offer was ultimately rejected because of difficulties in raising the finance, the complexity of RHM, insufficient management capacity at Polly Peck and Mr Nadir's realisation that he would have had to make a hostile bid. During summer 1990, Polly Peck also came close to offering Pounds 250m for International Leisure Group, the owner of Air Europe and Intasun which collapsed in March 1991. Polly Peck was approached by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, which had been asked by ILG to find a partner as its financial position worsened. It also approached Lonrho, the international trading group. According to former directors, Polly Peck rejected the ILG offer because of substantial potential liabilities on leased aircraft and difficulties in raising the money. Mr Nadir was interested in the airline for flying tourists to his hotels in the near East and to combine with Noble Air, the airline then controlled by his sister.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / US carmakers see off foreign competitors General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, the big three US carmakers, increased their sales of cars and light trucks in the US by 10.5 per cent last year, gaining market share at the expense of both Japanese and European vehicle producers. Helped by strong performances by Chrysler and Ford, the big three captured 73.9 per cent of the US light vehicle market, up from 72.2 per cent a year earlier. The total light vehicle market rose 8 per cent to 13.92m from 12.89m a year earlier, the highest level since 1989. Sales of new cars rose 3.7 per cent to 8.52m, but the strongest growth came from the light truck sector - pick-ups, four-wheel drive sport/utility vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles  -where sales climbed 15.5 per cent to 5.4m and accounted for 39 per cent of the total light vehicle market. The share of imported cars and light trucks fell to 16 per cent from 18.6 per cent. Japanese vehicle makers have lost market share for the last two years, falling to 23.1 per cent from 24.3 per cent in 1992 and 25.7 per cent in 1991. Honda sales fell by 6.8 per cent but Nissan, the second largest Japanese carmaker, succeeded in reversing several years of US decline by lifting sales 17.2 per cent. The fortunes of European carmakers in the US market have been in decline for several years and their light vehicle market share fell again to only 2.3 per cent. Several European carmakers have abandoned the US market in recent years, most recently Peugeot and the Rover group's Sterling cars operation. Of the survivors Alfa Romeo, part of the Fiat group of Italy, suffered a 53.1 per cent fall in sales to only 1,325. The Volkswagen group, the only European volume carmaker remaining in the US market, has also suffered a drastic fall with total light vehicle sales dropping by 31.5 per cent to 62,064. Sales by the VW brand fell 34.7 per cent to 49,536, while sales by its Audi executive car division dropped 15.1 per cent to 12,528. BMW of Germany has gained ground, however, with an aggressive pricing policy and was the leading European importer in the US after boosting sales last year by 18.8 per cent to 78,010. Jaguar, the UK luxury car subsidiary of Ford of the US, has also halted its decline, increasing US sales by 46.7 per cent to 12,734. Forced by rising losses to abandon the US car market a couple of years ago, the Rover group has been enjoying increasing success with its Land Rover utility vehicles, which increased sales last year by 15.9 per cent to 4,907. The company is aiming to quadruple US sales in the next couple of years with the launch later this year of the Discovery range. Although Japanese vehicle makers lost market share last year, they continue to increase North American production. The output of cars and light trucks in North America in Japanese plants and at Japanese/US joint ventures managed by Japanese producers rose last year by 6.6 per cent 2.15m.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- US AUTO INDUSTRY January-December 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Volume     Volume    Share (%)   Share (%)                            (Units)   Change(%)  Jan-Dec 93  Jan-Dec 92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- US CAR SALES              8,518,000      +3.7      100.0       100.0 Imports                   1,844,000      -7.5       21.7        24.3 Japanese makes            2,481,000      +0.4       29.1        30.1  of which NthAm-built     1,265,000      +9.0       14.9        14.1 Japanese derived*         2,889,000      +0.2       34.0        35.2 European makes              308,000      -6.9        3.6         4.0 US CAR SALES BY MANUFACTURER: General Motors**          2,909,000      +2.3       34.2        34.6 Ford**                    1,878,000      +5.7       22.1        21.6 Chrysler                    834,000     +22.7        9.8         8.3 Toyota/Lexus                742,000      -2.4        8.7         9.3 Honda/Acura                 716,000      -6.8        8.4         9.4 Nissan/Infiniti             482,000     +16.5        5.6         5.0 Mazda                       260,000      +4.7        3.1         3.0 Mitsubishi                  168,000      +7.8        2.0         1.9 Hyundai                     109,000      +0.2        1.3         1.3 BMW                          78,000     +18.8        0.9         0.8 Volvo                        73,000      +7.4        0.9         0.8 Mercedes-Benz                62,000      -2.2        0.7         0.8 Volkswagen/Audi              56,000     -35.8        0.7         1.1 Saab (GM)                    19,000     -29.0        0.2         0.3 Jaguar (Ford)                13,000     +46.7        0.1         0.1 Porsche                       3,700      -9.4        0.0         0.0 Alfa Romeo (Fiat)             1,300     -53.1        0.0         0.0 US LIGHT TRUCK SALES      5,398,000     +15.5      100.0       100.0 Imports                     389,000      -2.9        7.2         8.6 US CAR &amp; LIGHT TRUCK   SALES                  13,917,000      +8.0      100.0       100.0 General Motors**          4,667,000      +6.1       33.5        34.1 Ford**                    3,562,000     +11.6       25.6        24.8 Chrysler                  2,048,000     +19.5       14.7        13.3 Japanese makes            3,212,000      +2.4       23.1        24.3 Toyota/Lexus              1,033,000      +0.9        7.4         7.9 Nissan/Infiniti             688,000     +17.2        4.9         4.5 CANADA CAR &amp; LT TRUCK SALES            1,171,000      -3.3      100.0       100.0 NORTH AMERICAN CAR PRODUCTION            7,314,000      +9.3      100.0       100.0  of which Japanese built***         1,798,000      +6.7       24.6        25.2 NORTH AMERICAN CAR &amp; TRUCK PRODUCTION****           13,095,000     +11.5      100.0       100.0  of which US             10,854,000     +11.1       82.9        83.1  of which Canada          2,241,000     +13.2       17.1        16.9  of which Japanese Nth.

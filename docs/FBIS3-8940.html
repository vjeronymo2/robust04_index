Adrian  Nastase said that the difficult economic and political problems  of 1994 could be solved only by applying the arithmetic resulted  from the 1992 polls. In his opinion it is not a certain  composition of the executive that is essential at present, but a  governing programme based on the provisions of the memorandum  with the IMF, and the speeding of the reform. According to the  ruling party that can be achieved, added Nastase, by the  creation of a group of experts made up of representatives of all  parliamentary parties, apt to attract the interest of all  political parties.    Referring to snap elections, Adrian Nastase said that they  would be "disastrous" for the country.</p>

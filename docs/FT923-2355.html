			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: The true cost to Britain THE true cost to Britain of its vain battle this week to defend the pound emerged yesterday at about Pounds 750m, Peter Marsh writes. That is the estimate of the amount by which the pounds that the Bank of England bought for D-Marks in its intervention operations on Wednesday dropped in value between the start of trading on that day and the close in London last night. In a few hectic hours on Wednesday, the Bank bought sterling worth an estimated Pounds 15bn for D-Marks from its foreign currency reserves. The operations consumed a large chunk of Britain's Dollars 44bn fund of reserves, as well as perhaps a third of the special Pounds 7bn foreign currency loan which the Treasury arranged earlier this month as a 'war chest' to defend sterling. Yesterday's estimate of about Pounds 15bn in intervention by the Bank - the Bundesbank and the Bank of France also bought sterling worth perhaps a further Pounds 5bn - is an increase on the earlier estimate of Pounds 9bn. The huge intervention effort on Wednesday is thought to be the biggest action of this kind by a central bank to defend a currency.</p>

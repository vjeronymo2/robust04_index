The 100 or so military enterprises were set up within the  mountainous areas of Guizhou chiefly during the 1960s when China  strengthened national defense. They are strong in technology,  equipment and quality products.    Nowadays, these plants, which are turning out more and more  civilian products, have to break through their high walls to  meet with new demands in China's developing market economy.  They need more land and labor and part of their civilian  products have to get necessary spares locally.    Meanwhile, local rural people need technology and talented  personnel to help them shake off poverty.    Seeing that local counties and military plants are  complementary, officials helped to bridge the two by inviting  leaders of the military plants to visit township and village  enterprises.    As a result, 38 local counties have introduced funds,  equipment and technology from the military plants. Some 130  integrated complexes have been set up to deal with the  production of coal, phosphorus, lead, antimony, marble and  tobacco with the help of military plants.    The complexes mainly produce necessary parts for  refrigerators, motor vehicles, tractors and satellite ground  receivers.    Last year, rural industries of the province turned out 10  billion yuan worth of products, a 30 percent increase over the  previous year.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Water dips 42% - Pounds 8.9m provision for Amtec and dividend lower than expected NORTHUMBRIAN Water, the smallest of the privatised water companies, has paid the price of unsuccessful diversification with a 42 per cent drop in interim profits and a lower than expected dividend. Sir Frederick Holliday, the chairman, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 22.6m for the six months to September 30, while sales were 20 per cent ahead at Pounds 148.2m. The shares, which had fallen from 690p last week on rumours of heavy provisions, closed 9p down at 658p. The sharp profits fall was largely due to an Pounds 8.9m provision for Amtec, the underground pipe maintenance business which was one of Northumbrian's earliest diversifications post-privatisation. Amtec, purchased for a total of Pounds 5.8m, incurred a further Pounds 2.2m in operating losses. Northumbrian's failure on Amtec follows a Pounds 25m provision at Thames Water last month and is likely to fuel further the debate over diversification. 'It will reinforce investor nervousness about the quality of the unregulated earnings in the water industry,' says Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell of NatWest Securities. Mr Michael Taylor, finance director, admitted Northumbrian had made mistakes with Amtec. 'We did not successfully integrate the businesses we bought,' he said. A lack of experience had also left Northumbrian ill-equipped to deal with competition in a declining market, he said. Profits were also depressed by an Pounds 8m fall in investment income to Pounds 600,000. The group expected this to recover by at least Pounds 7m in the second half because of bond investments. Mr Taylor said the company had achieved a 'very strong performance' from the core water and sewage businesses. Operating costs had been cut by about Pounds 3m to Pounds 72m, with pre-tax profits up from Pounds 30.8m to Pounds 39.2m. The non-regulated businesses, including Amtec, returned a Pounds 400,000 loss against profits of Pounds 3.4m last time. The dividend was increased by 8 per cent to 8.1p (7.5p) and Northumbrian expected to pay a final of 16.2p. Earnings per share fell from 56.7p to 30.3p. COMMENT Although the provisions include goodwill adjustments of Pounds 6m, the losses and remaining charges are proportionately as significant for Northumbrian as those unveiled recently by Thames. Add to that questions over the unreliability of earnings from its investments and Northumbrian does not seem to have come far since privatisation. The regulated business, like others in the sector, appears solid. This will help it achieve forecast profits of Pounds 63m after exceptionals, against Pounds 69m last year. On a prospective p/e of 7.2, it would appear the jury is still out.</p>

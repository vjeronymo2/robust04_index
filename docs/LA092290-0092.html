			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVY SAYS TWO COPTERS DIDN'T COLLIDE  </P> <P> Strong winds forced two U.S. Navy helicopters to make rough landings on a  forested slope in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, slightly injuring all nine people  on board, officials said Friday.  </P> <P> A Navy spokesman disputed initial reports that the two CH-46 Sea Knight  helicopters had collided when they landed near Lobdell Lake in the Sweetwater  Mountains about 6:30 p.m. Thursday.  </P> <P> "It was not a collision, but a hard landing," said Navy spokesman Bob Howard.  "They were flying in line, one forward and one aft, and a severe downdraft  forced the one in back down first, and then the one in front was forced down."  </P> <P> The incident remained under investigation by the Navy to determine the exact  cause of the incident, Howard said.  </P></p>

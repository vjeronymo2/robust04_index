			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Index shows US prospects rosy in March Prospects for US manufacturing industry remained rosy in March, according to a monthly survey of purchasing managers, published yesterday. The National Association of Purchasing Managers' index rose to 56.7 per cent in March, compared with 56.6 per cent in February. The index has now remained above 50 per cent since last summer. Helping to ease inflation fears in the bond market yesterday, the NAPM's prices index, which is not included in its overall index, dropped to 64.2 from 67.0 in February. But the association's assessment of new orders rose last month, while output rebounded strongly after a weather-related decline in February. The production index reached 64.0 per cent, the highest level in more than six years. 'This continuing strong growth of orders, coupled with exceptionally low inventory levels, should sustain solid economic growth for the immediate future,' said Mr Robert Bretz, director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes and head of the NAPM's business survey committee. Financial market economists also said the index pointed to continuing growth. 'The March NAPM performance gives some sign that the sharp surge in manufacturing activity since last summer, spurred on by strength in the automotive sector, is starting to plateau - but plateau at a very solid level of expansion,' said Mr Joseph Liro, an economist at SG Warburg in New York.</p>

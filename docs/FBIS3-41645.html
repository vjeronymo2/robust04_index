			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M.C.: ``Renault Creates First European `Green </F> Network'''; introductory paragraph in boldface as published]    [Text] Like several European--particularly Swedish  and German--manufacturers, Renault and Peugeot are developing  their systems for collecting and recycling automobile scrap.  Renault is completing installation of the first European ``green  network,'' while Peugeot is starting a pilot operation in the  Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region.    Renault is completing the installation in 10 West European  countries of its ``green network,'' a system for collecting and  recycling automobile scrap. From Swindon in Great Britain to  Vienna in Austria and from Amsterdam to Lisbon by way of Paris,  Brussels, or Milan, beginning in 1994, 1 million bumpers,  700,000 batteries, 3 million liters of solvents, 3 million  tires, and 120,000 cubic meters of used packaging will be  collected every year and then ``reworked'' (that is, transformed  into new raw materials) by recycling professionals.    The network, which got its start in the Tours area and in  Germany in the summer of 1991, has already made it possible, for  example, to use some 120,000 used bumpers to manufacture new  parts (fenders and side bumpers) for the latest Safrane, Clio,  and Twingo models. The system will involve the 13,500 dealers  and agents in Renault's European sales network. From every sales  outlet and repair point, the same trucks that deliver new  replacement parts will carry away automobile scrap to regional  or national collection centers (for example, Zurich for  Switzerland and Valladolid for Spain). There the scrap will be  sorted and the resulting inventories in each category sent to  certified recycling firms.    In cooperation with the French Scrap Iron Company, Renault  also set up the first industrial center for processing junked  automobiles in Athis-Mons (Essonne) in September 1992. In one  year, that plant has recycled some 10,000 vehicles with what the  firm reports is ``a salvage rate exceeding 90 percent'' and good  economic profitability. In less than 10 years, ``no more than 10  percent'' of the weight of a vehicle will wind up in dumps,  compared to 25 percent today. In addition to its existing  centers (in Athis-Mons, Madrid, and Wuerzburg, Germany), Renault  intends to establish new ones--notably in Toulouse. Some of them  will be operated in cooperation with other manufacturers, as is  already the case with BMW in Wuerzburg.  <H5>  Peugeot's `Clean Garages' </H5>   On a smaller scale, Peugeot is also concerning itself with  the collection of automobile scrap (oil, batteries, and tires).  In cooperation with the National Council of Automobile  Professionals (CNPA), the firm in Sochaux has just launched a  pilot experiment in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region: car owners  who maintain their own vehicles are being encouraged to bring  their used materials to facilities equipped for the purpose  (there will be 40 such establishments by the end of the year,  plus another 200 in 1994). The used materials will then be sent  to recycling centers. If the experiment is successful, the  system will be extended to all of France.    Parallel with that, Peugeot is engaged in a ``clean garage''  operation following what the manufacturer calls ``successful''  testing since December 1992 by its dealer in Douai (Nord). This  operation consists of sorting shop scrap at the source for  subsequent recycling.    Will the consumer find his garage bill increasing to serve  the ``green cause?'' Renault rules out that possibility, at  least ``in the short term.'' Peugeot is reportedly considering  the possibility of an ``environment fee'' in the name of  ``modern-day public-spiritedness.'' The reason, according to  Peugeot and the CNPA, is that every year in France, 100,000  metric tons of used motor oil, 2 million batteries, and 15  million tires are thrown away, all too often in unauthorized  dumps. Compare those figures to the current effort.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> U.S. PRISONS TO STRESS LITERACY PROGRAMS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: INMATES WILL BE REQUIRED TO READ AT 12TH-GRADE LEVEL. THOSE WHO  REJECT TRAINING WILL BE DISCIPLINED OR LOSE BENEFITS.  </P> <P> The federal prison system, moving to reduce illiteracy in its swelling  population, is launching an aggressive effort to raise inmates' required  reading ability from eighth to 12th grade.  </P> <P> Prisoners who refuse to take reading classes when they test below the high  school graduate level will lose benefits inside the institutions or face  discipline under the program announced Wednesday by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh.  </P> <P> But Thornburgh and federal Bureau of Prisons officials stressed positive  aspects of the effort, contending that prison literacy programs have been well  received by both staff and prisoners.  </P> <P> Inmates "have readily accepted our new approach," Thornburgh said in a speech  to an international conference on literacy and corrections in Ottawa, Canada.  "For most who cannot read, competing in the legitimate work world is  impossible."  </P> <P> He added, "We believe there is a straight-line relationship between literacy  levels and an individual's likelihood of involvement in substance abuse." Basic  literacy "not only helps the prisoner after release but, equally important,  contributes to a better life while in prison and to a safer environment for  both staff and inmates."  </P> <P> Raising the literacy standard for the nation's 58,000 federal prisoners drew a  mixed reaction from organizations active in the literacy field.  </P> <P> "One does not mandate education and literacy for adults," said Mike Fox,  director of Push Literacy Action Now, a Washington-based group that works in  literacy training and advocacy.  </P> <P> "I would hope the program is incentive-based and not punitive," said Rene  Woodward, an associate at Southport Institute, a Connecticut-based research  organization that sponsors the Project on Adult Literacy. "I don't know if you  can force even children to learn."  </P> <P> About 20% of all federal inmates are illiterate, Thornburgh said, using the  standard of eighth grade as a benchmark.  </P> <P> Although this rate "mirrors closely the illiteracy level of the general  population in the United States, we in the Justice Department are not content  to allow men and women in our custody to leave prison only meeting the general  norm," he said. "We are committed to giving prisoners the opportunity to better  equip themselves for positive change, if they so desire."  </P> <P> The attorney general said that professionals in the corrections field no longer  subscribe to the so-called "medical model," under which prison staff members  prescribe programs expected to cure an inmate of criminality.  </P> <P> But this does not remove the need for "effective motivational components . . .  that induce inmates to participate in what we see are critically interconnected  life-skill programs, such as literacy and work."  </P> <P> Work assignments and literacy are the only two mandatory programs in the  federal prison system, Thornburgh said.  </P> <P> The literacy program in the Bureau of Prisons began in the early 1980s with a  sixth-grade literacy standard, which was later raised to eighth grade. The  standard will be raised again "very shortly."  </P> <P> Failure to work toward attaining literacy could be a negative factor in  deciding a prisoner's eligibility for moving outside prison to a half-way house  during the last six months of his term, Gregory Bogdan, a prison bureau  spokesman, said.  </P> <P> Similarly, it could result in an inmate's drawing the lowest rate of pay -- 44  cents an hour, instead of $1.05, the top hourly rate -- for work inside the  institution, according to Bogdan.  </P> <P> The number of teachers and educational administrators in the nation's 72  federal institutions has increased from 286 in 1986 to 559 in fiscal 1990,  Bogdan said.  </P> <P> Thornburgh noted that last year 10,546 inmates completed eighth-grade literacy  requirements; 3,100 earned high school equivalency diplomas, 7,356 completed  post-secondary education courses and more than 11,000 finished occupational  training programs.  </P> <P> "We are awarding (high school equivalency) diplomas to individuals who never  before succeeded at anything they tried," Thornburgh said. "We are graduating  some prisoners as college-level scholars who couldn't read or write when they  came into the institution."  </P></p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Major's joke starts a row Mr John Major, the prime minister, threw a bone to his Eurosceptic rebels yesterday, and promptly found himself embroiled in a dogfight. Answering questions in the Commons after a statement on the European Union summit in Essen, Mr Major joked that few other heads of government were subject to the rigorous questioning faced by UK prime ministers in the Commons. As Tories cheered, he added: 'Indeed I have to say that some of my fellow heads of government could scarcely find their way to their parliament with a guide dog.' Mr Major's joke backfired as Labour MPs demanded he withdraw his 'gratuitously insulting' comment. Mr Tony Banks (Newham NW) warned that his remarks were likely to develop into 'a story throughout Europe'. He added: 'Perhaps they have got their parliaments rather under greater control than you have your own.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, wrote to Mr Major, saying his remarks risked undermining Britain's standing in the Union.</p>

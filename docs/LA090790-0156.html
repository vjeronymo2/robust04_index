Males are dull orange-brown on breast, collar and rump with black head, and  bold black and white wings; female plumage is buffier with sparrow-like streaks  on wings.  </P> <P> In flight, both sexes show yellow wing linings.  </P> <P> Habitat: Commonly found in open woodland, thickets and near edges of ponds.  </P> <P> Diet: Seeds, nuts, some fruits and occasionally spiders.  </P> <P> Voice: Song consists of rising and falling passages; resembles a robin's call  but is more melodious and mellow. The sound is a sharp ik or eek.  </P> <P> Displays: Courting male performs song flights above female with his tail and  wings spread while singing almost continuously, then returns to original perch.  Song flights often occur during incubation of eggs.  </P> <P> Nest: Loosely built of twigs, stems and rootlets, then lined with finer stems  and soft, green rootlets; nest is built in three to four days.  </P> <P> Eggs: One inch and pale blue, green or a bluish-green, marked with browns or  purples, especially at larger end.  </P> <P> Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or  to get information on the breeding bird atlas, call Sea and Sage Audubon  Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714) 962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714)  786-3160.  </P> <P> Note: Map is divided into 5-kilometer squares so that Audubon Society  volunteers can more easily survey areas on a regular basis.  </P> <P> Sources: Sea and Sage Audubon Society; "The Birder's Handbook," Ehrlich, Dobkin  and Wheye, Fireside Books (1988); "Field Guide to the Birds of North America,"  National Geographic Society (1987); "Birds of Southern California: Status and  Distribution," Garrett and Dunn, Los Angeles Audubon Society (1981).  </P></p>

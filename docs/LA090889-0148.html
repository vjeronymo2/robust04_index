			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'THE FATAL WEAKNESS' IN STANTON ACTUALLY HAS MANY  </P> <P> At his best, as with the small classic "The Show-Off" (1924), George Kelly was  a pungent satirist who knew how to wrap plots all around human foibles and  folly.  </P> <P> But his strongest work, such as "Craig's Wife" and "Daisy Mayme," came during  the early part of his career.  </P> <P> Later on, Kelly's comedies often took on a harsh humor, even betraying a  certain misanthropy that often divorced his audience from the business at hand.  </P> <P> "The Fatal Weakness," now at the Stanton Community Theatre under John Craig's  direction, first was produced at the end of Kelly's career, in 1946.  </P> <P> While it is not as abrasive as some of his plays, it's still a weak comedy --  talky, predictable and generally too silly for its own good.  </P> <P> Instead of "The Show-Off's" seltzerish spontaneity and characterizations,  "Fatal Weakness" offers an overworked story line based on infidelity among the  upper class and a handful of boobish folks that can't keep us interested for  long.  </P> <P> The balmiest has to be Mrs. Paul Espenshade (Bettie Muellenberg), a woman so  obsessed with romance that she scans the newspapers for wedding announcements,  then makes an appearance, weeping all the while. Her "weakness" is so  pronounced that she even gets dewy when thinking about her husband's (Bob  Ijames) affair with an attractive orthopedic surgeon. That isn't romantic, it's  stupid.  </P> <P> Well, she does get angry every once in a while, but most of the indignation is  left to her bitchy pal, Mabel (Lorraine MacWilliams), a society shrew who has  nothing better to do than chart the dissolution of relationships.  </P> <P> Mabel really enjoys all the heartache.  </P> <P> Kelly uses her for laughs -- Mabel has most of the tart lines -- but she is not  a very likable character.  </P> <P> The acting at Stanton tends toward a curt, high-society tone that is meant to  pass for authentic but too often registers as contrived. Just about everybody  has a vocal edge that apparently is supposed to evoke a self-interested,  out-of-the-mainstream air that comes from being wealthy.  </P> <P> Still, MacWilliams does generate a few sparks as Mabel as she exploits the  situation for her own amusement.  </P> <P> And Muellenberg, in the thankless role as Mrs. Espenshade, is occasionally  funny when she drifts into her foolish reveries.  </P> <P> 'FATAL WEAKNESS'  </P> <P> A Stanton Community Theatre production of George Kelly's comedy. Directed by  John Craig. With Bettie Muellenberg, Donna Turner, Lorraine MacWilliams,  Christine Swain, Bob Ijames and Paul Walker. Set by Peg Richardson. Plays  Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. through Sept. 16 at the Stanton Cultural Arts  Building, 11801 Cedar St., Stanton. Tickets: $4, $5. (714) 828-0843.  </P></p>

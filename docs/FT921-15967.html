			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Row over British Coal move to oust commercial director BRITISH COAL plans to oust Mr Malcolm Edwards, its commercial director, on the grounds that it has no confidence in his commitment to the company or his ability to negotiate contracts with the electricity industry, it emerged yesterday. The decision by Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman since January last year, has prompted speculation that, through the removal of one of British Coal's staunchest defenders, the government is preparing to reduce the organisation's size. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, said yesterday: 'Malcolm Edwards is the only person in British Coal who really cares about a British coal industry.' Coal industry commentators suggest that Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, is worried that Mr Edwards' assertive marketing style could threaten the smooth settlement of new contracts to sell coal to National Power and PowerGen, the two electricity generators of England and Wales. One commentator said there was 'no doubt' that Mr Clarke and Mr Wakeham wanted Mr Edwards to go. Existing contracts expire in March next year, and the new contracts will be critical in determining the future size of British Coal. Mr Edwards has long argued for maintaining a sizeable coal industry. The news of a plan to remove Mr Edwards leaked after he failed to appear at a Commons energy committee meeting last month. His absence prompted Labour MPs to ask Mr Clarke if Mr Edwards had been sacked. This was followed by the announcement in a British Coal house bulletin that Mr Andrew Horsler, number three in Mr Edwards' department, was being appointed director-general of marketing, responsible for negotiating contracts with the generators. This function was previously part of Mr Edwards' responsibilities in the organisation. Mr Horsler will report directly to Mr Clarke who, it is understood, intends to be involved in negotiations with the generators - an unprecedented step for a British Coal chairman. Mr Edwards was offered a redundancy package about two months ago, it emerged yesterday, but had hoped to stay. According to a senior British Coal executive his removal after 36 years in the organisation sprang from a fundamental conflict between him and Mr Clarke over negotiations with the generators. Mr Edwards believed in actively promoting British Coal while Mr Clarke preferred a more low-key approach. Mr Edwards was also unwilling to rely on Mr Wakeham to ensure British Coal's future, the executive said. British Coal is understood to have questioned Mr Edwards' commitment to its future. Mr Edwards is being backed, however, by the unions and by electricity industry executives such as Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, who has written Mr Edwards a letter of support. The National Union of Mineworkers and Union of Democratic were also concerned about Mr Edwards' potential departure. Mr Edwards' solicitor, Mrs Denise Kingsmill of DG Freeman, said criticisms of Mr Edwards were unsupported. 'Both Mr MacGregor and Mr Haslam (former British Coal chairmen) have confirmed there is no one in Europe better at selling coal than Malcolm Edwards,' she added. British Coal said yesterday: 'Mr Edwards' proposed departure from the corporation has been under discussion for some time, and the matter is being dealt with by our respective lawyers.' THE ELECTRICITY industry is wasting money in gas-fired power stations, according to a report by Mr Stephen Fothergill, reader in economics at Reading University, and energy specialist Mr Stephen Witt. The report, commissioned by the Coalfields Communities Campaign, a local-authority pressure group, was published yesterday. The authors argue that National Power and PowerGen have replaced nine serviceable coal-fired stations with gas-fired stations at great expense. The 30-plus gas-fired stations planned are superfluous because there is already a surplus of generating plant, the report argues. If they do come on stream, it adds, there will not be enough gas to supply them long-term.  It estimates that if nearly all the planned stations materialised, the UK's North Sea gas reserves would be exhausted in 25 years rather than the 40 expected. Gas demand from the new stations would also force up gas prices in the long run, Mr Fothergill said yesterday. The Case Against Gas.

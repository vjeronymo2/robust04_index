			<p>BFN     [Text] The need for balancing the budget and the tasks  regarding the mustering of capital for development-oriented  investment, monetary stabilization, and the containment of  inflation are important and pressing issues that should be  resolved by the country in the last six months of the year.    Comrade Phan Van Khai, member of the party Central Committee  Political Bureau, deputy prime minister, and chairman of the  Central Financial and Monetary Council, was speaking on this  subject in an interview with the Vietnamese New Agency.    Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai gave some insights into  the progress made in the financial and monetary field during the  first few months of the year.    Speaking on attracting sources of foreign capital, the  difficulties to be encountered in the financial and monetary  field in the last six months of the year, and the approaches to  be taken to balance the budget and muster capital for  development requirements, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai  said: The most effective approach will remain increased revenue  collection along with economizing on spending.    The national conference of the tax sector held in the middle  of last May evaluated the potential for increasing various items  of domestic tax and levies by 10 percent as compared with the  plan for the first half of the year. If the potential for the  Customs Sector to increase its revenue collection is taken into  account, we will be able to exceed the target by 15 percent.  The feasibility for achieving this relies on efforts to exploit  the latent potential for increased production and expanded  circulation, and for the enforcement of tax laws and the code of  discipline for budgetary contributions. An important source for  increased revenue collection is export tax which, accounting for  nearly one-fourth of the total budget revenue, is a measure  aimed at ensuring adequate domestic production.    Along with readjusting the export-import tax chart in  accordance with a resolution adopted by the National Assembly  Standing Committee in late March, it is necessary to step up  antismuggling activities more intensively. Not only will we  have to fight smuggling at entry-exit points but we will also  have to conduct inspections to obtain back taxes from goods  which have been illicitly imported without payment of taxes. We  must carry out our activities resolutely with appropriate and  open steps so the people can supervise the leasing of land or  the transfer of land-use rights as well as the shifting of the  state-administered housing fund to business. By doing so, not  only will we be able to generate a huge source of revenue for  the budget, but we will be also able to ensure that these assets  are managed and used more satisfactorily, thus overcoming a  situation in which assets are gnawed off or abused.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Korean fears help drive N Sea oil price above Dollars 17 Oil prices continued to rally yesterday with the benchmark Brent blend rising above Dollars 17 a barrel for the first time since the end of September last year. It is now about Dollars 4 higher than its low of just under Dollars 13 reached last February. Analysts say concern about a possible military confrontation on the Korean peninsula triggered off the latest rally, although publication of US statistics confirming continuing domestic supply bottlenecks added to the upward momentum. Another factor underpinning the bullish sentiment included the decision on Wednesday by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cancel its September meeting. The move was seen as confirmation that Opec is determined to stick to its present production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day until the end of the year. Opec yesterday ended its conference in Vienna, with delegates continuing to express optimism about prices. One Gulf Arab official thought that by the end of the year prices for Brent could move towards the top of the Dollars 14 - Dollars 21 range of recent years. But Opec officials also conceded that rising prices could tempt some members to cheat on their quotas, even though all but three - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates - are producing close to their sustainable capacity. One official said a few Opec members might be able to exceed their sustainable capacity for 'a few weeks'. But he predicted that the impact on the market would not be that big. 'They would only damage the fields as well as the price,' he added. Opec is also considering additional ways to enforce production discipline. Members are reviewing a scheme under which persistent over-producers could have their quotas reduced until their average production over a period was brought back into line. Officials say the unused portion of the original quota would not be reallocated among other members. Opec yesterday failed to select a permanent successor to Dr Subroto of Indonesia, the outgoing secretary general. Mr Abdalla Salem El-Badri, Libyan oil minister and the new Opec president, will assume the secretary-general's duties until November, when members will again try to select a permanent successor.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Letter: Conservation dependent on right economic focus Sir, Sustainable development is not conservation for its own sake, as you suggest, ('Clarifying the green agenda' July 21). It is, as the Bruntland Commission says, 'development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' - surely a goal we all share. To achieve it, we must use all our resources - finite or not - more efficiently, and less wastefully. To encourage this means costing those resources realistically - including environmental costs - paying those costs and including them in both national and corporate accounts. Economic reforms are therefore the key to more efficient use of resources. As you say, 'it is a time for priorities'. But you overlook a main priority: the urgency for governments to step up their efforts to internalise environmental costs - specifically through applying economic instruments on a wider scale, and at a faster pace. They undertook to do this at Rio. Internalising environmental costs will benefit: a) business, by encouraging firms to become 'eco-efficient' - adding value to products, while using raw materials and energy more efficiently, and minimising pollution. This in turn will create competitive advantage, improve corporate returns and reduce risk. b) government, as a more cost-effective, flexible and successful alternative to command-and-control c) environment - including addressing many of the issues you question as really important. Indeed, because few other, if any, single public policy actions would achieve so many benefits, this should be an item marked 'high priority for action' on everyone's agenda - government, business and environmentalists.

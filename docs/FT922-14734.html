			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week - Pieris Wakehurst This is one of the most beautiful of the Chinese lily-of- the-valley shrubs, so called because of the resemblance of their white flowers to the herbaceous lily-of-the-valley. This fine evergreen shrub is usually listed as a variety of Pieris formosa forestii but there is some difference of opinion about this and Pieris Wakehurst is sufficient to identify it accurately. The flowers are not quite so regularly produced as those of some other forms of this species but the brilliant red young leaves in spring are outstanding in beauty. With age they fade to pink, then nearly white and finally yellowish green before becoming their permanent rich green colour. The bush can reach 15ft high in time but will take many years to do so and can be kept to half that height by light pruning in late May or early June. It needs lime-free soil.</p>

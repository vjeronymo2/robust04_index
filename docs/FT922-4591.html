			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Observer: Banking it US style Perhaps the Archbishop of Canterbury should take a preaching trip to the US. A new survey shows that the average cash pay of the 10 best rewarded American bank executives jumped by 46 per cent in 1991, when the corresponding rise in their banks' earnings was less than 7 per cent. The study, by Virginia research company SNL Securities, brought a swift homily from Professor Graef Crystal, the pay expert and scourge of corporate America well known for highlighting the enormous rewards of Time Warner's Steve Ross. If pay was really related to performance in the banks, Crystal said, 'then we wouldn't be seeing salaries like this during a recession.' More likely than some to have merited his rise was JP Morgan chairman Sir Dennis Weatherstone, whose 30.1 per cent rise took him to the top of the US bank chiefs' league with total pay of Dollars 2.06m. Two others who had more than Dollars 2m were Chemical Banking's chairman John McGillicuddy, and Hugh McColl, who heads NationsBank, which ensued from the merger of NCNB and C &amp; S/Sovran. Alas for Citicorp's John Reed, he didn't even make the top 10. He slipped to 22nd in the 1991 league with a rise of 1.5 per cent to a mere Dollars 1.22m.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Uni Storebrand to recapitalise after NKr1.36bn loss UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's biggest insurance group which was taken over by public administrators in August, yesterday disclosed losses of NKr1.36bn (Dollars 216m) for the first eight months of this year and announced plans for a recapitalisation. The loss was reported by Uni Storebrand New, established after the collapse of the old Uni holding company. Uni blamed the loss on a NKr2.8bn write-down of its NKr4.7bn stake in Skandia Forsakring. Uni acquired the Skandia shareholding last year, in the process running up borrowings of NKr4.5bn which led to it being ruled technically insolvent. Uni Storebrand New charged NKr1.45bn of the total Skandia write-down against eight-month accounts. Mr Erik Keiserud, the chairman of Uni's state-appointed administration board, said plans for the recapitalisation of the group called for NKr3.4bn of fresh equity. The plan is based on a valuation of the group estimated at between NKr700m and NKr1.65bn by Credit Suisse First Boston and Oslo-based Elcon Securities. The valuation is linked to the group remaining intact. Mr Keiserud said the plan, discussed yesterday with UNI's creditors, called for about 70 per cent of group debt, or an estimated NKr2.4bn, to be converted into equity or some other form of core capital. To meet capital adequacy requirements, Uni needs about NKr2.9bn but the administration board is seeking to raise NKr500m as a safety buffer which would give a capital ratio in excess of 5 per cent by the end of the year. Uni's recapitalisation plan also calls for NKr1bn to be raised through a share offering and for the remainder of the debt to be restructured with new maturity and interest rates.</p>

Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Ferhat Ataman  told a press conference that the massacre of 63 Palestinians in  Hebron's Ibrahim Mosque by a fanatic Jewish settler should not  hinder the peace process. Ataman said such "regrettable"  incidents showed that the peace process was still in a sensitive  and critical point.    Ataman recalled that Israel proposed several measures to  prevent such incidents from happening again, however the  Palestinian people found them inadequate.    After the incident President Suleyman Demirel called  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat [title as received] and  expressed his condolences over the massacre saying, "I am  shocked to hear the news regarding the brutal attack perpetrated  against innocent Palestinians praying in the Mosque." Demirel  also said Turkey was ready to do its utmost if help is demanded  to further the Middle East peace process.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit down 42% as tyre sales fall THE RECESSION has finally caught up with Kwik-Fit Holdings, the tyres and exhausts fitter, which yesterday reported a 42 per cent decline in interim profits blaming a fall in new tyre sales and a shift by motorists towards remould and cheaper tyres. Pre-tax profits in the six months to August 31 fell to Pounds 9.74m, including a Pounds 1.72m gain on the sale and leaseback of properties, from Pounds 16.8m a year ago when a Pounds 23,000 gain was included. Turnover dropped 8.5 per cent to Pounds 119.2m (Pounds 130.3m) while operating profits halved to Pounds 9.08m (Pounds 18m). The shares shed 13p to close at 96p, as analysts again slashed their profit forecasts. This summer, current-year forecasts were cut from more than Pounds 36m to Pounds 24m. After yesterday's announcement, the consensus was about Pounds 16.5m, with some as low as Pounds 14m. Tougher UK tyre tread depth legislation, introduced at the start of January, boosted sales in the final quarter of last year. But despite hopes that the new legislation will eventually boost the overall size of the market, the sales boom fizzled out early this year and tyre sales dropped in May and June 'as the continuing recession and the decline in consumer spending took effect.' In addition the company said large vehicle fleet operators had imposed more stringent cost controls and, like private motorists, were deferring tyre replacements for as long as possible. There was no improvement in the market in July or August. The decrease in total tyre demand, combined with an increase in the sale of remould and cheaper new tyres, has resulted in reduced tyre margins. Exhaust sales, however, had been maintained at last year's levels because 'replacement cannot be deferred for too long.' Mr Tom Farmer, chairman and chief executive, said Kwik-Fit had continued to control operating costs as tightly as possible, and borrowings had been restricted. Capital expenditure in the period was Pounds 9m. Seven new centres were opened during the first half and 30 new sites were under development. The group ended August with net borrowings of Pounds 6m, but is in the midst of a stock reduction programme and expects to end the year with no net borrowings compared with net cash of Pounds 3m at the end of February. Earnings per share dropped by 46 per cent to 3.82p (7.01p) from which an unchanged 1.35p interim dividend will be paid. Mr Farmer added: 'The group will benefit from any uplift in sales as motorists reach the point where they cannot defer car maintenance requirements any longer.' COMMENT Kwik-Fit appears to have been surprised by the severity of downturn in tyre sales, and the drop in pre-tax profits was much sharper than the market was expecting. The pressure on margins shows just how volume-sensitive the business is - rather like a national retail chain with the associated high fixed costs. The first-half included some non-recurring costs such as sales sponsorship, higher advertising, expansion costs and some reorganisation. It will also be remembered for the unfortunate way in which the market learnt that this was certainly not a recession-proof stock. Aside from trimming costs and inventory, Kwik-Fit is now pinning its hopes for a sales recovery on the imposition of tougher fines for bald tyres in October - police checks have shown that up to a quarter of cars have at least one bald tyre - and the usual seasonal sales bounce. With earnings per share as low as 6.5p, Kwik-Fit is trading on a prospective p/e of 14.8 and still looks expensive.</p>

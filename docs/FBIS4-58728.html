			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh Mahfoud Nahnah, leader of the </F> Algerian Islamic Society Movement, by Kamil al-Tawil in London  "the day before yesterday"]    [Excerpts] [Al-Tawil] What is your opinion of the Mokdad  Sifi government?    [Nahnah] We had hoped the Algerian authorities would not  form a government until national accord had been achieved among  men of the political class. We had also hoped that this  government would be a coalition government that contributed  effectively to resolving the crisis. But Mokdad Sifi's  government came after it had become clear that the former  government (led by Redha Malek) had resorted to escalation  through the anti-terrorism law, whose implementation involved  numerous excesses. Besides, the former government considered  itself the heir of the authorities or the real partner of the  existing authorities in the country. This is why the state's  rhetoric was two-faced and aroused despair among those wishing  to conduct a dialogue.    The Sifi government's arrival has given an impetus to the  process of national accord, dialogue, and reconciliation which  the former government opposed, whereas the head of state was  working for it. We are awaiting the government's economic and  social program so that we can define our position on it.  [passage omitted]    [Al-Tawil] Are you making contacts to coordinate with the  parties which believe in dialogue in Algeria?    [Nahnah] We always try to make contacts with sincere people  who are alarmed by the terrorism practiced against citizens, the  killing of innocent people, and the stealing of public money.  These incidents should prompt everyone to work to break down the  psychological barriers and establish common denominators in  order to agree on a minimum program.    [Al-Tawil] Has Boukhamkham had any contacts with you?    [Nahnah] All I know about the release of brothers Djeddi and  Boukhamkham is that they were released under an agreement with  the authorities and with the top leadership of the Islamic  Salvation Front [FIS] inside prison. They have authorization so  that their actions will at least be legal. In releasing them  the authorities have offered part of a down payment. It had  been hoped that they would make contacts in several spheres,  including the armed groups level, the political class level, and  the authorities level. The aim was for the two officials to  contain the hotbeds of violence to the best of their ability.  But it seems that since their release in mid-Ramadan [last week  in February] they have been unable to expand the circle of their  contacts to include all influential figures. Some armed groups  accuse them sometimes of being agents and of treason. We  condemn these accusations leveled at two people who have  struggled for a long time for the sake of the [Islamic] call and  political action. [passage omitted]    [Al-Tawil] Have you made contacts with the FIS?    [Nahnah] The people who have not been implicated in violence  -- including those in prison, shura council members, or those  who won the (canceled) elections -- contact us from time to  time. There are contacts between us and them. Some ask our  opinion; others do not. We are advocates of dialogue and  understanding. We are opposed to excluding some people because  of their political ideology and principles.    [Al-Tawil] Is Algeria actually moving toward civil war?    [Nahnah] The problem is that there are some people who  exaggerate Algeria's problem, and others who play down the  problem. Algeria is suffering a crisis. But it is an  exaggeration to say that it has entered a civil war. The  country is suffering what can be termed sedition. [passage  omitted]    [Al-Tawil] How do you justify your agreement to join the  transitional assembly when you said that the dialogue should be  held with those who won the canceled elections?    [Nahnah] Algeria is experiencing a fire, and to avoid  shouldering responsibility it to avoid performing a duty. We  cannot see a sick person dying and then say we cannot give him  medicine until a specialist doctor arrives. We set several  conditions for the transitional phase, including shortening it  as much as possible. And we believe that the way out of the  crisis is to hold elections and announce a schedule for them in  order to assure everyone that the country is following a  pluralist road.    We also call on the FIS to contribute to extinguishing this  fire. When we talk about the FIS, we are talking about  citizens. Not all FIS supporters carry weapons or are reckless  or foolish. In the FIS there are wise people and people of  politics. So we hope that the people of politics will play a  role. We also call on the authorities to accept these people in  the transitional institutions in order to guarantee curbing the  violence which has continued for long. [passage omitted]    The FIS should announce that it is not behind the operations  aimed against citizens in general, including policemen, traders,  journalists, professors, intellectuals, politicians, and Foreign  Ministry employees. Because what is happening is going to  generate grudges that will continue for many years.    [Al-Tawil] What is your opinion of the dialogue method  pursued by President Zeroual?    [Nahnah] It is serious but not useful    [Al-Tawil] You always focus on dialogue and the need for it.  Have tried to make contacts or meet with Abassi Madani?    [Nahnah] I submitted a request (to meet with Madani), but  the authorities have not responded. My request still stands.  With a group of influential politicians in the country, I also  offered to form a delegation to meet with those held in prison  (FIS leaders) or those under house arrest, or after their  release, in order to agree on a minimum program that contributes  to reviving hope. The request still stands and we hope it will  be met.    [Al-Tawil] Why do you believe the request has been turned  down?    [Nahnah] The authorities have begun their dialogue at the  defense minister (Zeroual) level with FIS leaders inside prison.  They heve also conducted a dialogue with the parties.</p>

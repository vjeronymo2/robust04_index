			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Lotus axes loss-making Elan with 350 job cuts: Production of sports car to end after just 2 1/2 years GROUP LOTUS, the UK sports car maker, is to cease production of its main product, the Lotus Elan, in the face of heavy losses less than 2 1/2 years after the car was launched. The withdrawal from the small two-seater sports car market is expected to lead to about 350 redundancies at the 507-strong Lotus Cars division assembly plant at Hethel, Norfolk. The company, which was acquired for Pounds 22.7m in 1986 by General Motors of the US, blamed the failure of the Elan on 'the extraordinary combination of adverse economic factors hitting our segment in key markets'. However, the car's launch was delayed; it was priced well above its main rivals, such as the Mazda MX-5; and the company never succeeded in producing it at an acceptable cost. It has also been hit hard by disappointing sales in the US, which accounted for only 21 per cent of the 2,200 sales last year, compared with Lotus' hopes for sales of more than 1,000. Mr Adrian Palmer, managing director of Lotus Cars, said the Elan, which sells in the UK for Pounds 20,135 to Pounds 22,720, was losing 'a great deal of money' for each unit sold. Group Lotus has reported mounting losses in recent years - from Pounds 2.1m in 1988 to Pounds 12.7m in 1990. The early demise of the Elan, which was supposed to repeat the success of the first Elan of the 1960s designed by Lotus founder Colin Chapman, will make it one of the most short-lived new cars launched on the world market in recent years. Development of the car, which won a prestigious British Design Award last year, was the cornerstone of the company's Pounds 54m five-year capital spending programme to 1992 which included Pounds 32m to Pounds 34m for the car operations with a new production plant for the Elan. The company said it would seek a buyer for the Elan production line. The car was supposed to help to quintuple Lotus car production to around 5,000 next year from a modest 788 in 1987, with Elan output rising to 3,000 annaully. Output peaked last year at 2,238 (including 2,060 Elans) but will now fall back to a few hundred. Mr Palmer said the company intended to concentrate its efforts on the much more expensive Esprit, launched in 1976, which sells for Pounds 36,030 to Pounds 47,790 and which Lotus intends to develop as 'a showcase technology car'. 'The vast sums this car (the Elan) is losing mean I cannot invest in the Esprit, which is a profitable car for us,' he said. Lotus still had a successful engineering consultancy and the company would have 'a satellite operation building a number of cars a year', he said. The worldwide dealer network would have to shrink, but Mr Palmer said the company would seek to continue to sell cars in all its markets. GM was forced to pump Pounds 13m of new capital into the company last year to bolster its subsidiary's sagging balance sheet, and the Group Lotus finances have since deteriorated further. Group Lotus expanded over-ambitiously for the launch of the new Elan in 1990 and then had to contract sharply in the face of recession and the car's failure to meet sales targets. Group Lotus said its engineering consultancy and its Millbrook, Bedfordshire, proving-ground operations - with a combined workforce of 790 - would not be affected. There is no formal connection between Group Lotus and Team Lotus, the Formula One Grand Prix racing team.</p>

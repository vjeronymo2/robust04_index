The definition of an automatic sprinkler system is unique to the Act. In addition to describing the physical characteristics of an automatic sprinkler system, the definition sets a performance objective for the system. Automatic sprinkler systems installed in compliance with the Act must protect human lives. Sprinkler systems are generally not designed with this specific objective in mind. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The General Services Administration must issue regulations to further define the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> equivalent level of safety.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act specifies that, to the extent practicable, these regulations be based upon nationally recognized codes. This document provides the further definition required by the Act. A general level of safety provided by sprinklers is established, and a framework for evaluating alternative methodologies for achieving this level is presented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Objectives of the Legislation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Despite the widespread availability of affordable means of preventing fire losses, the United States continues to have one of the highest per capita fire death rates in the industrialized world. Fire is the fourth largest accidental killer in the United States, claiming at least 5,500 lives annually and injuring an additional 30,000 individuals. The fire vulnerability of office buildings and residential housing units can be reduced through strong fire safety measures. It is essential for the protection of life and property that effective technology be employed in detecting, containing and suppressing fires. When properly installed and maintained, automatic sprinklers and smoke detectors provide effective safeguards against loss of life and property from fire. According to the National Fire Protection Association, there is no record of a multiple death fire (involving the loss of three of more people) in a building with a fully operational sprinkler system. The Federal Government, in addition to increasing the protection provided its own employees and individuals living in federally subsidized housing, can set an example in the area of fire safety and, by its own actions, encourage the private sector to use technology that has been proven to save lives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal Fire Safety Act of 1992 was created to serve as a model for local jurisdictions where the Congress believed not enough was being done to promote and provide for the fire safety of citizens. The evidence for the Congressional concern is clear. According to National Fire Protection Association data, there are about 30,000 fire departments in the country, yet according to the National Fire Sprinkler Association, only 7 states and 34 local jurisdictions have sprinkler requirements that affect existing buildings. These ordinances have exclusions, applying to only specific occupancies. Most of them exclude residential occupancies, the occupancy where most fire deaths occur. The Federal government chose to lead by example without imposing requirements on the states and local communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Throughout hearings on the Act, many groups testified that sprinklers were not the only system component necessary for fire safety in buildings. In addition, Congress did not want the legislation to inhibit the development of new technology. They recognized the need to have legislation that proactively addressed protection of life from fire. Therefore, the law does not simply mandate the installation of sprinklers. Congress specified certain life safety objectives to be achieved by the sprinkler systems. In addition, an equivalency clause was provided to allow for the use of alternatives which satisfied the identified life safety objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Development of an Equivalent Level of Safety Concept  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. General Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Services Administration, in cooperation with the United States Fire Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Defense, is required to issue regulations further defining the term equivalent level of safety. In developing the regulations, GSA has held meetings with a working group composed of representatives from the agencies named in the legislation and other affected Federal agencies. The Department of Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the U.S. Coast Guard were invited to participate because the Act's potential impact on their office space or housing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Citizens of Grand Bassa County have been meeting  with the leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia  [NPFL], Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, in Gbarnga, Bong County. At  the meeting, the citizens expressed heartfelt thanks and  congratulations to Mr. Taylor for defending the cause for which  the people's popular uprising was launched. They expressed  their commitment and loyalty to the leadership of the NPFL, and  stressed that they will do everything possible to fully support  the goals and principles of the Revolution.    In a petition to the former president of the NPRA [National  Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly] Government, Mr. Charles  Gankay Taylor, the citizens said the infiltration and taking  over of compound numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 by the Liberian Peace  Council in Grand Bassa County was masterminded by ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group].    According to the petition, under the disarmament process  ECOMOG disarmed and encamped over 200 NPFL soldiers, without  deploying troops of the expanded ECOMOG in those areas, thereby  giving grounds to the self-styled Liberian Peace Council [LPC]  to commit mayhem and atrocities in Grand Bassa County. The  petition says towns and villages are being burned down to ashes,  including [words indistinct], by forces loyal to the LPC, which  is being aided and armed by the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG.  At the same time, the citizens have appealed to local and  nongovernmental organizations operating in the country to  speedily deliver medical and relief supplies to the starving  population in that part of the country.    Meanwhile, Mr. Taylor has set up a committee comprising of  top military brass of the NPFL to work closely with chiefs,  elders, and superintendents in the area to restore law and  order.

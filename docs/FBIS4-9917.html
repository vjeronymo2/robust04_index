			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 3 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Cesar  Gaviria, recently elected OAS secretary general, has said he  advocates a dialogue with the Cuban Government, but he rejected  the possibility that Cuba could rejoin this hemispheric  organization.    He added that the OAS "has always thought" that the  reintegration of Cuba to the organization "is desirable."    "However, most countries believe that given the current  circumstances, it is impossible," he pointed out.    In an interview published today by EL ESPECTADOR newspaper,  the Colombian president said, "it is not up to me to determine  the scope of the changes," but "I hope that within a few years,  this change will be possible."    Gaviria recalled that the so-called Group of Three --  Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela -- has always favored holding  talks with Cuba to seek ways to implement reforms in Cuba.  However, Gaviria underscored, "there are countries that are  very skeptical about conducting such talks; nevertheless, we  have always advocated them."</p>

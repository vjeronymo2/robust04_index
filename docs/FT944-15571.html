			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Estate moves from carbon to silicon The choice of Wynyard Park for Samsung's electronics complex is not without symbolic significance. This agricultural land was part of the Londonderry family estate, a property assembled by Victorian coal barons. This century the family fell on harder times and its ancestral home, Wynyard Hall, and grounds were bought in 1987 by Sir John Hall, a self-made millionaire pitman's son. Sir John, the developer of the Gateshead MetroCentre and chairman of Newcastle United Football Club, saw Wynyard as a potential growth point for the north-east's economic transformation. In 1991 he said that development in the coming decade would provide up to 10,000 jobs. Yesterday he said that Wynyard, with Samsung now signed up, would attract Pounds 1bn of investment. Planning permission - unlikely to be a problem - is needed for Samsung's 400-acre site but Cameron Hall Developments, Sir John's company, already has permission for business development on another 500 acres of the estate. Intensive marketing of this site will now start. Executive housebuilding is already under way elsewhere on the estate.</p>

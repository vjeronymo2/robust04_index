			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME;  </P> <P> POLITICS: NEWCOMERS TO CONGRESS ARE CUSTOMARILY ADVISED, 'TO GET ALONG, YOU  HAVE TO GO ALONG.' THAT'S NEVER BEEN THE STYLE OF MAXINE WATERS.  </P> <P> Next year is likely a period of considerable adjustment both for the state  Legislature and Congress. California's state lawmakers will have to learn to  get along without Maxine Waters. The House of Representatives will have to  learn to get along with her.  </P> <P> Washington faces the bigger challenge. newcomers to Congress are customarily  advised, "To get along, you have to go along." Going along with something she  doesn't like has never been the style of Maxine Waters.  </P> <P> During her 14 years in the Assembly, she has made a name for herself as one of  the Legislature's most acerbic and outspoken members. She has become legendary  for her tough advocacy of her causes -- women's issues, programs for the poor  and minorities and divestiture of investments in South Africa, among others --  and her willingness to upbraid her opponents. Despite all the enemies that she  has created, the force of her personality has made her an important power  within the lower house, where she serves as Democratic Caucus chairwoman.  </P> <P> For more than a decade, she's had her eye on the House and has been waiting for  Rep. Augustus Hawkins, 82, to retire. He announced this week that he will not  run again, having served in Congress since 1962. She wasted no time in saying  that she would not seek re-election but would run for Hawkins' seat instead.  She's a shoo-in.  </P> <P> This all comes as bad news to a number of Californians already serving in  Congress. Some prize collegiality, and dislike the combative style she brings  to lawmaking. Others have previously engaged in disputes with her. There's even  been some speculation in the state Capitol that Reps. Howard Berman and Henry  Waxman may privately encourage someone within the district to oppose her in the  primary.  </P> <P> Delegation insiders say, however, that a stop-Waters enterprise is unlikely,  especially one initiated by West Los Angeles Democrats Berman and Waxman. It  would be greeted with such disfavor by the Watts voters Waters seeks to  represent that it would be counterproductive.  </P> <P> She'll have her own major adjustment problems after the election. Some  observers, both in Sacramento and Washington, privately say that she's making a  mistake in moving to Congress, where she will be only one of 435 House members.  In the Assembly, she is one of 80 members. Moreover, she'll be a newcomer in a  House where seniority continues to count for much and where advancement is less  rapid than in the state Capitol.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, she is likely to have an early impact in Washington, especially  within the House Black Caucus, where the "get-along, go-along" spirit remains  strong with some important members. She's sure to challenge it.  </P> <P> Her absence in Sacramento will be felt by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, whom  she has served as a top lieutenant -- and sometimes as his liberal conscience.  As a tough advocate, she has been known to push Brown to move more resolutely  on programs than he might otherwise have been willing to do.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, her departure offers pluses as well as minuses for Brown. One  admiring Capitol Democrat said that Brown will miss Waters' presence but  acknowledges many others won't. Brown may have made a mistake in naming her  caucus chairwoman, a post that calls for someone more skilled at reconciling  various forces.  </P> <P> That's an understatement. At various times, she's taken on governors,  presidential candidates and legislators of both parties. She has threatened to  hold up budgets unless she gets answers to her questions, and she can show a  particular scorn for Democrats whom she regards as limousine liberals lacking  any understanding of the problems of the poor.  </P> <P> Not even Brown has been spared her tongue. But at least he was chewed-out in  private.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO-SPORT ALL-STAR: BO MAKES PRO BOWL;  </P> <P> RAIDERS: TOWNSEND, WISNIEWSKI AND MOSEBAR JOIN JACKSON ON AFC TEAM.  </P> <P> Bo Jackson, the AFC's 13th-leading rusher and still the second-leading rusher  on his own team behind Marcus Allen, was one of four Raiders named to the AFC  Pro Bowl team Wednesday.  </P> <P> Jackson became the first athlete to be named to the All-Star team in baseball  and the Pro Bowl in football. Jackson was named to the 1989 All-Star game as a  member of the Kansas City Royals.  </P> <P> Other Raiders named were defensive end Greg Townsend, guard Steve Wisniewski  and center Don Mosebar. It will be the second Pro Bowl trip for Mosebar, the  first for Townsend, Wisniewski and Jackson.  </P> <P> Obviously, Jackson's flair for the spectacular influenced his peers. In eight  games this season, Jackson has recorded touchdown runs of 55 and 62 yards. He  added an 88-yard run last Sunday that received some attention.  </P> <P> Jackson has gained 605 yards in 97 carries this season, an average of 6.2 yards  per carry.  </P> <P> Jackson initially refused comment on his Pro Bowl selection -- he speaks with  the print media only after games -- but later relented.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't consider myself unique," Jackson said of his selection. "I'm just  Bo. I've been competing in sports all my life. It's nothing new to me."  </P> <P> Jackson said he is thrilled at his selection to the Pro Bowl because the voting  is conducted by NFL players.  </P> <P> "The only people that understand athletes are athletes," he said. "You guys  (sportswriters) think you know us, but you don't. So I do take that as a  compliment."  </P> <P> Raider Coach Art Shell made the Pro Bowl announcements at Wednesday's morning  meeting.  </P> <P> "He called out Wiz's (Wisniewski's) name first," Jackson said. "We were  cheering for him. And then he said my name, and it was like somebody slapped me  in the face with a dumbbell. I didn't know what to think. I thought it was a  joke. Fortunately, it was true."  </P> <P> Noting that the Pro Bowl game, held Feb. 3 in Hawaii, might cut into his  vacation time between football and the opening of baseball spring training in  March, Jackson said: "I'm too young to think about resting. I'll think about  that when I get your guys' ages."  </P> <P> Shell said he thought Jackson was deserving of Pro Bowl consideration last  season, when he gained 950 yards in 11 games.  </P> <P> Jackson, who shares the team's tailback position with Allen, is also believed  to be the first non-starting player to make the Pro Bowl.  </P> <P> "He's a backup in your mind, not mine," Shell responded.  </P> <P> Some thought Townsend's selection was also long overdue, but this season his  statistics were difficult to ignore. Townsend, completing his eighth season, is  tied for third in the AFC in sacks with 12 1/2.  </P> <P> "I've been thinking about it all the time," Townsend said of the days leading  up to his selection. "I really, really wanted it to happen this year."  </P> <P> Wisniewski made his first Pro Bowl in his second season, a surprise in that the  Raiders switched him from right guard to left this season to make room for Plan  B acquisition Max Montoya.  </P> <P> "To have it so soon in my career is a blessing," Wisniewski said. "I don't  think I'm the best guard in the league right now, but I'm working at it. I  still believe I'm more comfortable at right guard, but I guess the coaches knew  what they were doing when they moved me to the left side."  </P> <P> Mosebar, the team's center, also made the Pro Bowl after the 1986 season.  </P></p>

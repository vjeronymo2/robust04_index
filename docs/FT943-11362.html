			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull reduces loss to FFr843m in first half Groupe Bull, the state-controlled French computer company, yesterday said it had brought its net current loss for the first half of this year down to FFr843m (Dollars 152m), or less than half its FFr1.98bn loss for the same period of 1993. Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, president, claimed his goal for the group to break even on its operational results for the whole of 1994 'now appears achieveable', and Bull was 'now positioned for privatisation'. The European Commission has still to rule on whether the French government can go ahead with a FFr2.5bn capital increase for Bull, and whether a similar FFr7bn allocation last year to Bull was permissible. Bull has said it needs this aid to counter the effect of chronic past losses. The latest sharp reduction in Bull's losses will not necessarily weaken French arguments in Brussels for the state aid, which can perhaps now more plausibly be represented as a rational investment rather than money disappearing into a bottomless pit. Bull reduced its operating loss to FFr433m in the first six months of this year, compared with FFr1.2bn in the same period a year earlier. Turnover rose 11 per cent to FFr13.85bn, with the strongest growth recorded in the personal computer division of Zenith Data System whose sales rose 55 per cent on a year earlier. Bull said stringent cost and salary restraints accounted for the improvement. Last month, the French government invited tenders for banks to act as advisers on Bull's privatisation. At the same time Mr Descarpentries has tried to reinforce the group's links with NEC of Japan which holds a 4.4 per cent stake in Bull.</p>

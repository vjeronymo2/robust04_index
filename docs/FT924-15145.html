			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Open-end Latin American fund to be launched LATIN American Securities is to launch an open-end fund that will invest only in Latin American US dollar-denominated debt instruments. The Latin American Income Company Sicav (Latinco), listed in Luxembourg, will provide a gross dividend of between 8 and 9 per cent on an annualised basis, paid every six months. Mr Marc Wenhammer, Latinco's adviser, said the fund would have high liquidity, since its net asset value would be calculated daily, allowing daily dealing. The fund will be diversified, with less than 5 per cent in any single instrument and less than 35 per cent in a single country. About 70 per cent of the fund will be invested in instruments which mature in less than two years in order to minimise capital risk.</p>

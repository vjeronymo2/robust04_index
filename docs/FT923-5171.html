			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (23): A case of too many companies - Italians prepare for a shift from military to civilian work THE ITALIAN aerospace industry will be dominated by two issues in the coming months: the changing nature of defence needs in Europe, and the reorganisation of domestic defence production. The former has been highlighted by the plight of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project, in which Italy has a 21 per cent stake. Not only are jobs at risk in any cut to the project, but there is also a risk of companies ceasing to be involved in state of the art technology - principally Alenia, the aerospace subsidiary of Finmeccanica, the state industrial/financial holding. Irrespective of developments over the EFA, the aerospace industry is set for a much needed process of rationalisation as international competition increases and the emphasis shifts from military to civilian aircraft. At present, 60 per cent of the industry's annual L7,800bn (Pounds 3.6bn) turnover is military; while 35 per cent of the total is accounted for by export orders. Declining order books have forced employment down - the workforce fell by nearly 5,000 to 47,000 last year and is set to contract further. A financial squeeze has held investment back to 1990 levels at L1,300bn, 62 per cent of which goes to research and development. The industry is also too fragmented, with the private sector dominated by Fiat and the public sector split essentially between the companies belonging to Finmeccanica, in turn part of IRI, the state holding, and those under the wing of Efim, the state industrial holding. Change is inevitable, at least in the public sector whose current structure has no logic. Furthermore, the new Amato government this month turned IRI into a joint stock company, with a view to privatising part of its holdings. At the same time, the debt-burdened loss-making Efim is set to be wound up, its activities hived off. In the case of aerospace, this would proably go to Finmeccanica. The first step in this direction was taken in March, when Finmeccanica and Efim agreed to pool their resources in defence avionics and aircraft protection systems. They also agreed to work on a plan of joint industrial development through Efim's stake (via Agusta) in the jet trainer manufacturer, Sai Marchetti, and through Finmeccanica's minority holding in Macchi, which also specialises in jet trainers. However, these moves have yet to be implemented; and they ignored the financial plight of Efim's main aerospace activity, helicopter manufacture, concentrated in Agusta, which now has to be faced. Agusta produces the A109, which won 5 per cent of the international military and 7 per cent of the civil market for light helicopters in the period 1985-90. It is also a partner with Westland of the UK in the EH 101 anti-submarine and transport helicopter. But the company is weighed down by over L2,000bn of debt, lost L178bn last year and carries a high inventory. It suffers from high production costs and too many production centres( 11 dotted round Italy). Plans are in hand for a 20 per cent cut in the 8,150 workforce, but new capital is urgently needed and it also has to find a long-term overseas partner. As far as the EFA is concerned, Fiat is involved in developing the engine, but its diversified activities make it less vulnerable than Alenia which has the bulk of the 14,000 jobs at risk in the venture. Whatever happens, Alenia is likely to focus more on the civil side of its business, in particular commuter aircraft. The EC Commission recently ruled against its bid, with French partners Aerospatiale, for de Havilland of Canada, because it would have given their ATR consortium a dominant position in the European 45-66 seater commuter market. Nevertheless, Alenia has sought to expand its international links, which could now see it joining the new European regional aircraft partnership being set up by Deutsche Aerospace with Fokker of the Netherlands. But its bread-and-butter remains sub-contracting work with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, and latterly with Airbus - a consortium that Alenia would like to participate in directly.</p>

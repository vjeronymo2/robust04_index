			<p>CSO     [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The  Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar  Nateq-Nuri and the deputies from the cities of Bandar-e  Mahshahr, Dorud and Azna, Miyaneh, and Rudbar spoke as preagenda  speakers. Then the speaker of the Majles gave a short speech in  which he offered condolences to all Shiites on the martyrdom of  Mohammad Taqi (peace be upon him). Then the Majles took up its  agenda, and we direct the attention of our respected readers to  the detailed proceedings.  <H5>  Kemal Daneshyar, Deputy From Bandar-e Mahshahr </H5>   The roots of inflation and high prices include the failure  to  control the prices of goods and the failure to deal decisively  with violators.    The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Daneshyar, deputy from Bandar-e Mahshahr. During his  speech he said: The most important economic problem is inflation  and high prices. Most of that was unavoidable and inevitable,  but unfortunately, contradictory and extremist economic policies  and extremism and excesses have had their effects in this  matter. An example worth mentioning is the previous government's  severe and extreme approach to the imposition of price controls,  compared to the policy of deregulation and releasing prices to  float in the current government.    Continuing, he said: Supervision, monitoring, price setting,  and dealing with violators, people selling at high prices, and  hoarders must be done as soon as possible in a decisive and  calculated way.    The speaker then discussed uprooting inflation and high  prices. He said: The failure to control the prices of goods; the  failure to deal decisively with violators; people selling at  high prices and godless hoarders; ostentation; useless  expenditures by officials; working too little; promoting the  culture of too much consumption; weak management on the part of  some executive officials, especially the failure to supervise  quality control of the goods produced by domestic industries;  the enormous expenses from the imposed war; military  reconstruction and preparation in view of the malicious, Satanic  qualities of the enemies of Islam; the rapid population increase  to double the size of the last decade, along with the rapid  increase in the consumer market; the failure to increase the  gross national [product] to match the population increase and  demand; the destructive effects of the wrong policies of the  wretched monarchy's one-product economy; continued economic,  military, and political plots by the enemy, especially the  reduction in the price of oil and the economic embargo against  Iran; are among the factors and roots of inflation and high  prices. In this same regard Daneshyar said: It is a very  difficult task to determine the percentages of the above  factors, inflation and high prices.    Continuing, the deputy from Mahshahr said: In view of the  destructive and corrupting effects of using Western television  programming and using satellite antennas, since in practice no  technical or practical procedure has yet been recognized to  intercept it, solutions proposed, including prohibiting the use  of satellite antennas or strengthening and promoting the spirit  of faith among the individuals in society to keep them from  watching these destructive programs, definitely will not serve  as the final solution.    In this same regard, the speaker then added: The Foreign  Ministry has proposed via the United Nations and with the help  of friendly countries, as a means of protecting the innocence  and morality of human beings to prevent the destructive and  corrupting effects of television programs broadcast from Western  transmitters, to provide and implement restrictions,  prohibitions and penalties against those who broadcast this type  of vulgar programming.    Daneshyar also called upon the Shiite and Sunni clergy and  the clergy of other religions of the book, especially the  Christian clergy, to act jointly to confront this destructive  cultural invasion.    The deputy from Mahshahr then discussed the consolidation of  the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade and the Ministry of  Agriculture. He said: In view of the fact that this proposal has  weakened the performance of these two ministries, I propose,  since most of the deputies are opposed to the motion to  consolidate the two ministries, that this matter be taken off  the agendas of the commissions and the Majles as soon as  possible and that these debates be put to an end.    Continuing, the speaker discussed the problems in his  electoral district. He said: In view of the reduced  precipitation and the drought in the region, I ask the officials  and especially the minister of agriculture and the chief of the  Agriculture Bank to help the farmers and to allocate banking  resources. Likewise, the important roads in the municipality of  Mahshahr, including the freeway from Bandar-e Emam to Ahvaz, the  freeway from Bandar-e Emam to Mahshahr, and the road from  Omidiyeh to Ahvaz are causing problems because of their poor  quality, and I ask the minister of roads and transportation to  deal with the matter.    In conclusion, the deputy from Mahshahr asked Mr. Karbasian,  chief of the Social Security Organization, to expedite  construction of the Omidiyeh Hospital, which was planned under  the First Five-Year Plan and is proceeding slowly.  <H5>  Jahanshah Sadiq, Deputy From Dorud And Azna </H5>   In designing the Second Five-Year Plan the Majles must keep  society's low-income classes in mind.    The next speaker was Sadiq, deputy from Dorud and Azna. He  offered condolences on the occasion of the martyrdom anniversary  of His Holiness Emam Javad (peace be upon him) and discussed the  Second Five-Year Plan. He said: In this regard, friend and foe  are watching the Majles and are waiting for the results of the  Majles studies.    Fortunately, in this regard the Majles has lighting its way  the guidance from the exalted leader as an important element of  support. Naturally, it must keep the affairs of the oppressed  and low-income classes of society in mind at every stage. In  addition to that it must strive in every way possible to reduce  dependence on oil revenues in the Second Five-Year Plan, which  has become an implement in the hands of the enemies of the  Islamic Republic of Iran as a destructive political item. This  cannot be done without increasing nonoil exports, and  comprehensive government and Majles support must be given to  domestic products, especially the production of crops and  products that can definitely be produced in the country but that  are imported with excessive foreign exchange expenditures.    He added: A fundamental question today is, are we going to  repeat the same mistake that was made under the First Five-Year  Plan, which is giving excessive support to industry while  remaining indifferent to investment in the agricultural sector?    There is no doubt that investment to a reasonable extent in  the industrial sector is both necessary and inevitable, but  which industry?    He added: Isn't it true that nonoil exports from the  agricultural sector were 123 percent of the target set in the  First Five-Year Plan, and yet exports in the other industries,  especially in the industrial sector, did not even reach 50  percent of expectations? If, despite all the unkindness towards  the agricultural sector, this sector was able to achieve all the  goals set for it in the First Five-Year Plan, it is because  today we have the message from the agricultural sector that  investment in this sector is the most reasonable step to which  we must give attention.    Continuing his remarks, Sadiq said: Unlike industry,  agriculture is instantly obedient to the nation's executive  system. The production line can be changed any instant. It can  be planned in accordance with the nation's needs, while to  change the production line in industrial factories requires  changing many of the systems prevailing in the factory and the  expenditure of huge sums.    To give attention to the agricultural sector is to apply the  guidance from the late Imam about making efforts to achieve the  nation's self-sufficiency and obeying the guidance from the  leader of the revolution about giving attention to agriculture,  and nothing other than this is expected from the Majles.    He then discussed the decisions made concerning this  province  by the president of the republic and the exalted leader during  their recent trip. He said: The people of Lorestan are joyous  about the attention from the exalted leader and the president of  the republic in the framework of the success implementing the  projects and programs to save the province from deprivation.  However, making the successes, which have been achieved,  requires effort, persistence, and expeditious measures by the  respected ministers and the relevant executive organizations,  and the people continue to watch them expectantly. We have said  repeatedly that the petrochemical and refinery complexes were to  have been built in Lorestan, but unfortunately the justification  is not clear for moving this project to Arak, when it could have  solved many of the problems of the province of Lorestan.    The deputy from Dorud and Azna asked officials to provide  gas  service to Lorestan, and he discussed the efforts by the  minister of the interior to elevate Azna to a municipality and  the president of the republic's agreement. He said: The lands  given to staff employees and educators have remained in their  hands due to the preparation project. They have sold much of  their furniture and resources to pay the fees to prepare the  land, yet they are still unable to do the preparation work.  <H5>  Seyyed Hoseyn Hashemi, Deputy From Miyaneh </H5>   The Second Five-Year Plan must clearly specify the goals of  privatization.    The third preagenda speaker was Hashemi, deputy from  Miyaneh.  In his speech he discussed the aggression against Muslims in the  world. He said: The imperialist world has made a serious  decision in different ways to weaken the Muslim world, and to  prevent in any way possible the expansion of the ideas of  revolutionary Islam and the Islam of Muhammad (peace be upon  him). On the other hand, despite all the imperialistic effort,  every day we see more harmony in the Islamic nation and the  expansion of this great Islamic thinking everywhere in the world.    He condemned the PLO treaty with Israel and discussed the  Second Five-Year Plan. He said: Although we had good successes  implementing the First Five-Year Plan in the agricultural,  industrial and mining sectors, these successes reduced our need  for imports in many areas. A more desirable process must be  implemented in studying these experiences and careful expert  work in the Second Five-Year Plan.    He added: An example is the policies in the system for  alleviating deprivation in the nation's deprived and  underdeveloped areas, which is being done to implement social  justice. It is appropriate to give special attention to this in  the Second Five-Year Plan, taking inspiration from the views of  the exalted leader. We can guide capital into these areas by  making appropriate policies such as special tax and insurance  exemptions and special allocations for service lines, water  prices, consumer electrical power, and providing banking  facilities on easier terms and at lower fees.    Concerning the matter of privatization, he noted: The  transfer of government units in the current way, mostly by  organizations, bodies, banks and other entities, each of which  is a part of the nation's public system, will not bring us to  our goal in this regard. Therefore, the Second Five-Year Plan  must clearly specify the goal of privatization. Is it to  eliminate private sector currency in circulation, or to start up  new units and transfer existing government units? He discussed  the use of existing capacities, completing half-complete units  and rebuilding government and private units and building them  anew. He said: These units must have a specific policy  throughout the Second Five-Year Plan, one of which must be  regarding exports as the main key to solving the production  problem, and that needs a special policy to support exports in  the Second Five-Year Plan. Especially with the unification of  the foreign exchange rate, a good process has been set in  motion, but it is not enough. We have had little success in the  area of manufactured industrial goods such as capital and  intermediate goods.    Continuing, the deputy from Miyaneh discussed the  consolidation of the industrial ministries. He said: I do not  consider the current effort to consolidate as being appropriate.  I recommend that in the first phase the Ministry of Industries  and the Ministry of Heavy Industries be consolidated and that  the Ministry of Mines and Metals operate independently for a  time so it can find its place in the nation's economy,  especially in the area of nonoil exports.  <H5>  Jamshid Qanbarian, Deputy From Miyaneh </H5>   It is hoped that with the activation of the Azerbaijan Steel  Complex Project the problem of employment in the area will be  solved.    Another preagenda speaker was Qanbarian, deputy from  Miyaneh.  He expressed thanks for the appointment of Mr. Hamedi as Friday  Imam of Miyaneh and offered congratulations on the arrival of  Teacher Day. He said: One of the region's main problems is  absolute unemployment and intense emigration. Unfortunately  every year several villages are emptied of their residents  because of this same emigration, in such a way that this region  now has negative population growth.    He added: The only solution is to create employment in the  area, and it is hoped that with the activation of the Azarbaijan  Steel Complex project this social problem will be solved in the  area. In the same regard I give the utmost thanks to the exalted  leader for his comprehensive support for solving the executive  problems in this project.    He thanked the Ministry of Petroleum for its success  implementing the project to deliver gas service to Miyaneh, he  thanked the minister of post, telegraph and telephone concerning  the unstinting activities of the ministry's officials in the  region to meet telephone communications needs and the president  of the republic's Deprived Regions Office for granting  recognition as deprived regions to the villages in the warm  southern region.    He then said: Due to the lack of an active police presence  throughout the roads and freeways, the drivers of  tractor-trailer rigs and heavy trucks have destroyed driving  security without police monitoring. Every day tens of innocent  people lose their lives on these roads, and the minister of the  interior is expected to pay special attention to this matter.  <H5>  Faramarz Golshani, Deputy From Rudbar </H5>   What makes the earthquake victims happy is having officials  in their midst.    The final preagenda speaker was Golshani, deputy from  Rudbar.  He discussed the passage of four years since the Rudbar  earthquake and the approaching anniversary for this disaster. He  said: The only thing that makes the people happy is having  national officials in their midst. Last year the speaker of the  Majles and deputies and officials came, and this year we are  also to have the honor of their presence. They will see the  great reconstruction that has begun at the government's capable  hands and to help alleviate the shortages.    The speaker discussed the president of the republic's  impending trip to Rudbar. Continuing, he discussed the shortages  in this earthquake-stricken municipality.    1. There are still 65 schools that were destroyed by the  earthquake and have not yet been rebuilt, and the students from  these schools are studying in Suleh and in inappropriate places.    2. Sixtyy-six of the municipality's rural areas lack  electrical power, 96 rural areas lack sanitary drinking water,  and 200 kilometers of rural roads are also in need of asphalt.    3. Fifty percent of the credits to build 84 mosques, 31 of  which are under construction, is needed.    4. The financial situation of the people is such that there  is no possibility of meeting the expenses of municipal  government through normal revenues. Therefore, urban development  needs reinforcement of the tax base.    5. Continuing, he added: Inadequate allocations of loans and  materials for home construction and other problems have caused  most housing units for earthquake victims to be abandoned after  70 to 80 percent completion. Therefore, loans of at least 200  million rials for each urban and rural family would complete  half-complete homes.    6. The people of the municipality are from the low-income  classes, and in view of the extensive losses the earthquake has  brought to them, they are unable to repay pre-earthquake housing  and business loans.    Mr. Golshani asked for loan forgiveness and also for the  extension of repayment periods on postearthquake loans until the  end of the year 1373 [20 March 1975].    Continuing, the speaker added: The 100-bed Rudbar hospital  was destroyed by the earthquake, and the current hospital has  been created in Suleh. It does not have the appropriate quality  and is in need of credit procurement. The cities of Rudbar,  Rostamabad, Manjil, and Lushan lack a suitable drinking water  network, and the cities within the municipality's boundaries do  not have a sewage system. Credits need to be obtained to fight  pestilence, irrigate date trees and plant rice in the area and  to rebuild the cities.    The speaker continued: Before the earthquake about 1 million  loans existed in the municipality, and this number has decreased  to one-quarter of that figure. Livestock keepers are in need of  serious support. Despite the fact that the minister of petroleum  has broken ground for the project, construction work on  providing gas service to the cities of Rudbar, Rostamabad and  Tut-e Kabon has yet to begin.    At the end of his speech he said: I ask that when the  president of the republic comes to the area these projects be  supported and receive financial assistance.  <H5>  Legislation </H5>   The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the first consultation of the  Agriculture Commission on the motion to create the Supreme  Agriculture and Rural Development Council, the general form of  which was not approved and was rejected.    It is worth mentioning that in the aforementioned motion,  the  duties of the Supreme Agriculture Council were described as  follows: "Dealing with executive problems in the programs  pertaining to the agricultural sector, supervision of the  performance of programs in the agricultural sector, supervision  of the procurement and organization of statistics and  information having to do with the agricultural sector's needs  and supervision of their precise implementation, policy making  to create conversion industries and installations to store  agricultural crops, supervision of the timely procurement of  credits and facilities for the agricultural sector, and other  things."    One of the reasons used by those opposing this proposal is  that there is no reason to put the various sectors in the hands  of a council. What good have the existing councils done for the  people? Therefore, the councils do not solve any problems, they  create problems.    Likewise, the supporters claim that it is necessary to have  a  council led by the president of the republic to support  agriculture, in order to solve these problems that exist.    The second item on the agenda was the report from the  Supreme  Education Council concerning the Bill To Amend Article 2 of the  Law on Procedures for Procuring Faculty Needed at the Nation's  Universities and Institutions of Higher Learning, enacted in  1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987], the general form of which  was put to a vote and approved.    Article 1 of the bill states: "The phrase `and animal  husbandry' is added after the phrase `medical group fields' in  the text of Article 2 of the Law on Procedures for Procuring  Faculty Needed at the Nation's Universities and Institutions of  Higher Learning, enacted 3/1/1365 [22 May 1986]."    It is also worth mentioning that professors in the animal  husbandry fields may, as in the medical group fields, make use  of the facilities and benefits in this law, and this will have a  striking effect in raising the level of quality in this field.    The next item on the agenda was the report from the Commerce  Commission concerning the Bill To Amend Note 1, Article 5, of  the Law Amending the Guild System Law Enacted 2/31/1368 [21 May  1989].    The amendment to this bill says: "Within one year of the  date  this law's enforcement becomes obligatory, all the companies  subject to the Guild System Law are required to obtain business  licenses from the relevant union. Newly established companies  are required within one year of their registration to obtain a  business from the relevant union in order to begin operations."    The fourth item on the agenda was the report from the First  Consultation of the Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission  Concerning the Motion To Suspend the Period of Obligatory  Service for Graduates from the Judicial Affairs Colleges in the  Nation's Public Prosecutor's Offices and Judicial Courts,  continued consideration of which was postponed to the next  session.    The aforementioned motion states: "Under this law, graduates  from the judicial affairs colleges affiliated with the Ministry  of Justice of the Islamic Republic of Iran who have not  performed their service as soldiers, upon the recommendation of  the judicial power and with the agreement of the General Armed  Forces Staff, provided they commit to at least five years of  service in the judicial power, are exempt from service under the  flag in peacetime after the completion of the commitment."  <H5>  Arrival Announced of Question From a Number of Deputies </H5> Concerning the Reason for Increasing Telephone Rates    Arrival was announced of the question from a number of  deputies, including Sharifi, deputy from Arak; Tavakoli, deputy  from Khomeyn; Yusefpur, deputy from Ardel and Fars; Majidi,  deputy from Fasa; and Noruzi, deputy from Molayer; to the  minister of post, telegraph and telephone concerning the reason  for the collection from telephone service subscribers of  telephone tariffs in excess of the amount approved by the Majles.  <H5>  Weekly Programs of Majles Commissions </H5>   Introduction: Printed below for your consideration are the  weekly programs of the Majles commissions this week.  <H5>  Education and Training Commission </H5>   Study of the Motion To Supervise Foreign Trips by  Government Workers  <H5>  Islamic Guidance and Art and Media Communications Commission </H5>   Invitation to the insiders in the Sacred Defense Cinema  Society  <H5>  Plan and Budget Commission </H5>   Study of the nonoil exports sector in the Second Five-Year  Plan    Motion To Control the Prices of Goods and Services  <H5>  Labor and Social Affairs Commission </H5>   Motion To Prohibit the Use of Western Terms, Names, and  Expressions  <H5>  National Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission </H5>   Continued study of the articles from the Bill on  Employment Regulations for the Police Forces of the Islamic  Republic of Iran  <H5>  Post, Telegraph and Power Affairs Commission </H5>   Invitation to Engineer Gharazi to answer the question from  a number of deputies concerning communications and postal tariffs  <H5>  Majles Notes </H5> <H5>  Presentation of the Question to the Minister of Mines and </H5> Metals Concerning the Performance of the Mobarakeh Steel Complex    Next week the question from the deputy from Hamadan to the  minister of mines and metals concerning the Mobarakeh Steel  Complex and its affiliated complexes will be on the open Majles  agenda.    In this regard Mr. Habibian told our parliamentary  correspondent: I submitted three questions for the Majles to the  minister of mines and metals. The first question asks about the  level of steel production and to what extent it conforms to the  goals in the First Five-Year Plan. In this regard there are  indications that performance was not in accordance with the  First Five-Year Plan. In the commission the respected minister  of mines and metals was also asked to provide information about  this sector, but so far, about a month later, the necessary  information has not been made available to us.    The second question is about the procedure for selling  steel,  and the question is, have the domestic markets been saturated,  that steel is now being exported?    The third question, which is more important and worries us  more, is the question of steel shipments. In recent months these  shipments have gone to parts of the world such as China to be  sold and have then returned to the country after a time, and in  this regard large sums have been paid for demurrage (reparations  paid for losses caused by shipping delays).  <H5>  Majles Oversight of Nonessential Foreign Trips </H5>   Concerning Majles oversight of nonessential foreign trips,  which will be done based on Note 13 of the 1373 [21 March  1994-20 March 1995] National Budget Law, Mr. Beytollah Ja'fari,  deputy from Urmia, told our correspondent: The motivation for  Majles oversight is that we want to be able to study and make  decisions concerning the number of people going and whether or  not the trip will have positive effects for the country in terms  of its essential purpose.    According to the general evaluation that was made, the  number  of delegations sent abroad was in excess of the number necessary  and in most cases ancillary tasks were undertaken beyond the  main goals of the trip, and this has caused the imposition of  millions of dollars in nonessential expenditures on the nation's  budget.</p>

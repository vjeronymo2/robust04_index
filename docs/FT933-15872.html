			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UN report calls for new policies on migration NEW policies are needed to cope with a rising tide of migration, both from the country to the city and across national borders, according to a new report from the United Nations Population Fund*. The report warns that millions of migrants will create economic and social strains in countries of immigration and emigration. Governments will have to take new measures to reduce the pressure to migrate, such as improving education, health care and family planning in rural areas, but must also improve the capacity of urban areas to absorb new migrants. 'The only effective means of reducing migration pressure over the long term are to slow population growth, stimulate economic growth and job creation at home, and to promote the development of the individual and the family as the basic economic and social unit,' the report says. But government policies aimed specifically at limiting rural-urban migration have generally been unsuccessful, the report says, because they have not been linked to the country's overall trade, industrial and agricultural policies, which exert a much stronger pressure on population movement than regional strategies. The report says that around 100m people, mostly in the developing world, are now international migrants. The number of asylum seekers and refugees is rising most rapidly, and may account for 20 per cent of the total. Money sent back by migrant workers to their home countries may now total Dollars 70bn a year, the report suggests - second in value only to the international oil trade. The global population, estimated at 5.57bn in 1993, is projected to rise to 6.25bn in the year 2000 and 10bn in 2050. While annual population growth is estimated at 1.7 per cent worldwide, this conceals a wide disparity, with Africa's growth rate at 3 per cent and Europe's at only 0.3 per cent. Age structures are also diverging. In Africa, the number of people under 15 has tripled over the last 40 years, and the proportion has remained around 40 per cent; in Latin America the proportion of under 15s peaked in 1965-70 and has been falling rapidly ever since, while in east Asia the proportion has dropped to 26 per cent. *The State of the World Population: UNFPA, 220 East 42nd St, New York NY 10017.</p>

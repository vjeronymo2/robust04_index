			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Observer: Black's turn A two way trade in senior managers seems to be developing between newspaper tycoons Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch. Black, who was most upset when Murdoch pinched Andrew Knight from the Daily Telegraph, has now got his own back by poaching one of Murdoch's rising stars to help lead his invasion of Murdoch's home market. Australian Michael Hoy, who won his spurs in the Murdoch empire as a tough managing editor of The Times, is joining the Conrad Black consortium which recently took over Fairfax, owners of the Sydney Morning Herald, the (Melbourne) Age and the Australian Financial Review. The 42-year-old Hoy, has been lured away from Murdoch's South China Morning Post after just seven months as general manager, to be editorial director and deputy chief-executive of Fairfax. Meanwhile, it sounds as if Black is close to finding a chief executive for the rudderless Fairfax. The word is that Phil Scanlan, chairman of the Sydney Institute, a free market think tank, is the frontrunner. A right-wing radical, Scanlan's views are likely to appeal to Black, if not to the journalists who dominate the Fairfax publications.</p>

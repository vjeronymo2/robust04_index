			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OPEC URGED TO IMPOSE QUOTAS  </P> <P> Iraq wants no further increases in OPEC oil output or any increases in members'  production quotas until prices climb to $25 per barrel, the Middle East  Economic Survey said Monday.  </P> <P> The authoritative newsletter said the idea was likely to meet considerable  resistance among key producers when they meet in Geneva Thursday. But it said  there was a consensus within OPEC to restore oil prices to more than $18 per  barrel. World prices are now just below OPEC's $18 benchmark.  </P> <P> An Iranian plan to raise the minimum price to $20 per barrel and then cut  OPEC's output ceiling and quotas if this is not reached by October stood a good  chance of being accepted, it added.  </P> <P> The Geneva talks will probably maintain existing quotas for 12 of the 13  members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, while allocating  a formal quota of 1.5 million barrels per day for the United Arab Emirates,  making a total ceiling of 22.491 million barrels per day, MEES said.  </P> <P> This is the formula agreed by five Gulf Arab producers, including Iraq, in  Jeddah two weeks ago.  </P> <P> The quotas would be maintained until prices rise above $18 per barrel or  possibly higher if the Geneva conference agreed to raise the minimum reference  target. But this was as far as the consensus went, MEES said.  </P> <P> "The question of where the price would have to reach and for how long in order  to justify consideration of an increase in the ceiling and quotas, has been  left open and there are evidently considerable differences of opinion on this  score," the newsletter said.  </P> <P> Iraq last Tuesday launched a stinging attack on Kuwait and the UAE for  overproducing and forcing down oil prices, saying they were part of the  U.S.-instigated conspiracy that drove down oil prices by 30% in the first half  of this year.  </P> <P> The newsletter said Iraq's role in pressuring the UAE and Kuwait to cut  production was welcomed by most OPEC members, but that there was some dismay  over its hard-line tactics.  </P> <P> The Iraqi accusations in the wake of the July 10 Jeddah agreement in which  Kuwait and the UAE agreed to drastically cut output stunned conservative Gulf  Arab producers.  </P> <P> Iraq -- which desperately needs higher oil revenues to fund its post-war  reconstruction program -- also threatened to take unspecified action against  both countries if they produced above their quotas, as they have in the past.  </P></p>

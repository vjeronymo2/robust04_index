			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, Chris Moncrieff, and Teilo Colley, PRESS </F> ASSOCIATION]    [Excerpt] Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin  McGuinness both called on the government today to respond to the  "potential" offered by this week's IRA ceasefire.    Mr Adams said the three-day ceasefire from Tuesday [29  March]  created the opportunity to remove the stalemate that had  developed around clarification of the Downing Street  declaration. Its significance lay "in the potential it  creates," he told a rally in Belfast. The British Government  had brought about a stand-off in the peace process and "erected  a roadblock around the issue of clarification." Now, the  ceasefire initiative provided the chance "for Sinn Fein and the  London government to remove the clarification roadblock so that  the peace process can move forward."    "We are not concerned to force a public climbdown by John  Major," said Mr Adams. "We will be flexible. But we will not  accept anything less after 25 years of hard, relentless  struggle, than the right of our supporters to be treated like  all other citizens. We ask for no more or no less."    Mr McGuinness, speaking in Dublin, told supporters "the  potential of the IRA's initiative must not be underestimated."  It was a "significant and unprecedented initiative" which had  created a substantial opportunity to move the situation "out of  the current stalemate and on to the next phase of the peace  process."    Mr McGuinness said: "This is the beginning, not the end of  the process. We in Sinn Fein have asked for meaningful  discussions with the British Government. Discussion and  dialogue are essential elements in any peace process." [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC urged to delay cut in milk quotas THE EUROPEAN Commission has recommended delaying the introduction of a 1 per cent reduction in milk quotas because of falling butter consumption inside the European Community. The success of butter substitutes in grabbing market share has persuaded the commission to support instead a 5 per cent cut in the intervention price for butter from July 1 1993, Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, said yesterday. The 1 per cent quota cut was agreed in principle last year as part of a wide-ranging reform of the common agriculture policy which attempted to reduce production. The idea was to cut milk quotas by 2 per cent over two years starting April 1 1993. Now the commission will review the position next year, with the possibility of a 2 per cent cut to compensate for this year's delay. Separately, the commission has recommended granting Spain a provisional increase of 500,000 tonnes in its present milk quota of 4.55m tonnes, starting April 1 1993. But Greece and Italy will have to wait because the commission is not satisfied with progress toward setting up a national agency to ensure the quotas are respected by local producers. Italy's excess milk production amounts to 2.47m tonnes, while its proposed increase in the wholesale quota is 0.9m tonnes, the commission said. Greece is due to benefit from a quota increase of 100,000 tonnes. Greece and Italy have until May 15 to show they can meet the conditions set out in CAP reform. By the end of July, both Mediterranean countries may be allowed to increase guaranteed quantities of delivery for the 1993-4 marketing year, subject to review by the commission and approval by the council of ministers. Mr Steichen said the commission and council must be 100 per cent convinced that the milk quota regime would be respected by all 12 member states. 'This is all the more important when the EC's agricultural policy is moving further in the direction of production control,' he said. The commission has approved the provision of DM4.45bn (Pounds 1.85bn) national aid to German farmers to compensate for the revaluation of the D-Mark in the 1980s. The Bonn government's aid scheme will continue until the end of 1995, with payments ranging between DM1,00 and DM16,000 per farm. The commission said the aid was temporary, and was necessary to avoid serious harm to farmers' incomes in Germany.</p>

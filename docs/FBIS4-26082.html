			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 17 (CNA) -- The Investment Commission  approved 49 Taiwan investment projects in Mainland China worth  NT$1.6 [new Taiwan dollars] billion (U.S.$59 million) during its  screening meeting Thursday [16 June], indicating that Taiwan's  investment fever on Mainland China has not cooled.    The approval brought the total number of investment projects  approved since the Qiandao incident to 233, worth more than NT$5  billion (U.S.$185 million), a commission official said.    The Thursday meeting followed a May 27 meeting that approved  93 investment projects worth NT$1.9 billion (U.S.$70 million).    Meanwhile, United Microelectronics Corp. also gained  approval  to introduce industrial technical personnel from Mainland China  to the island. This is the first time a local enterprise is  being allowed to import mainland expertise to Taiwan, the  official noted.</p>

Turnover for the company, which makes non-ferrous metal ingots and is involved in the reclamation and trading of recyclable material, declined to Pounds 78.4m (Pounds 83.7m). The company blamed recession in all its markets for the result and the large imbalance between demand for and supply of aluminium. The deficit after tax was Pounds 512,000 (Pounds 343,000), equivalent to losses per share of 31.68p (21.2p). The proposed final dividend is maintained, however, at 3.4p, giving a reduced total of 6.8p (10p).</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / All Change - Your guide to the new British Rail: Is this any way to run a railway? Q. Will I notice any difference under the new regime which came into force on April 1? A. Not at first. Railway managers are determined that passengers do not notice any immediate changes. Timetables will be the same, train liveries will not be altered and level of service - good, bad or indifferent - should be unchanged. Q. So what is the point of privatisation? A. The aim is that over the next two to three years the old British Rail divisions are transformed into limited companies, still owned by BR, and finally franchised out to private bidders or management buy-out teams. As this process builds up, you will start to see new company logos and changes to timetables. If more enterprising management teams have their way, you should start to receive an improved service and new marketing initiatives to encourage more people to travel by rail. Q. Won't this push up ticket prices? A. Critics believe so, but railway managers say competition from the private car, coaches and airlines means they have very little leeway to raise fares. It would also make good economic sense for train operators to fill empty seats outside the rush hour, so expect new discount fares for off-peak leisure travel. One company, South West Rail, is even thinking of free travel to reintroduce people to the pleasures of rail. The regulator is there to see that companies with effective monopolies do not misuse their power. But the system is untested, so the honest answer is that nobody knows. Q. How will the railway be able to operate efficiently in future with so many different parties involved? It all sounds very complicated. A. It is, but no more so than the system you are accustomed to when travelling by air. Airlines do not own airports, frequently lease their aircraft and often contract out maintenance. The government believes benefits of introducing competition will outweigh the 'transaction' costs. Critics don't agree. Once the system beds down, it probably will be accepted as quite normal. Q. Does the new system mean the government will no longer need to subsidise the railway? A. Far from it. Subsidies will continue to most of the 25 train operating companies. In fact, the government's desire for 'transparency', identifying which parts of the rail network need which level of subsidy, has doubled the sums involved. The train-operating companies are now being charged the full rate for use of track, signalling and rolling stock. Under BR, some of these costs were not fully accounted for. Q. What is the purpose of this? A. It allows the government to identify the most costly lines and question whether further subsidy can be justified. Q. So it can close them down and nobody will complain? A. Ultimately, yes. But do not underestimate public support for particular lines. The government has said it does not envisage shutting down parts of the network in the foreseeable future. In the early stages at least, train operators will be required to maintain existing service levels. Q. Will the railway be safe with all those newcomers trying to run trains? A. All the train operating companies as well as Railtrack must prove to the safety authority, the Railways Inspectorate which is part of the Health and Safety Executive, that their systems are safe. Many of the new companies will be run by people with a railway background while operating staff will be drawn from the old BR and will have to meet established training and safety standards. Q. Who draws up the timetables under the new regime? A. Operating companies will make their own timetable proposals with the aim of devising schedules which attract the most travellers. Overall responsibility for knitting them together lies with Railtrack. Q. If competing companies all run trains through my local station who do I go to for timetable information and to buy my tickets? A. The main company operating on any particular route will lease the stations from Railtrack. It will then be obliged to provide all the normal services for travellers, including providing unbiased information on timetables and tickets. The first practical example of this is the Gatwick Express, which is already running as a trial or 'shadow' franchise between Gatwick airport and London Victoria. It says it will be scaling down its own promotional material at Gatwick and selling its own tickets and those of its two rivals, Thameslink and Network South Central, from the same ticket office. Just how unbiased a service the operators provide is still open to question, but competing companies will be watching each other closely and the rail regulator is there to intervene if necessary. Q. If Grandma wants to come for the weekend she will cross the territory of three operating companies. Can she buy a through ticket or must she buy three separate ones? A. This point is still undecided. The government has said train operators must accept each other's full-fare and season tickets but this takes no account of discounted Saver, Supersaver and Apex tickets which represent 80 per cent of all tickets. The franchising director and the operating companies are still trying to devise a solution. If multiple tickets are needed this would almost certainly push up fares. Q. The clock on the platform at my station has been broken for several months. Who is now responsible for fixing it? A. The train operator who has the lease on your local station would be responsible for minor repairs. Structural works, such as a new roof or rebuilding a platform, are the job of Railtrack. Q. Will the new train companies be any better at collecting fares than BR and at putting staff on lonely stations? My local station is often unstaffed and I never seem to see a ticket collector. A. BR claims to have cut back on fares avoidance by using mobile teams of inspectors and targeting particular lines at particular times of the day or week rather than staffing every ticket barrier. They claim their losses are less than the 'shrinkage' suffered by retailers. BR also claims that staffing stations has no direct link to levels of crime. It is unlikely that the private train operators will put staff back on stations. Q. What happens if I have a complaint? A. You can complain to your local train operating company. If the problem is not its fault but results from, say, track or signalling, it will be able to put pressure on Railtrack or any other supplier. If you are not satisfied, you can also go to your regional Rail Users' Consultative Committee. The committees can investigate complaints and bring them to the attention of the rail regulator.</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IACOCCA TO QUIT JOB AS CHRYSLER CEO IN 1991  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Lee A. Iacocca, who brought the  nation's third-leading car maker from near bankruptcy to financial health, has  decided to step down when his contract expires in 1991, the New York Times  reported.  </P> <P> Iacocca, in an interview last week, told the Times that he plans to devote more  time to improving the nation's education system and teaching.  </P> <P> He said he might stay on in some role but would give up his chief executive job  when his four-year contract runs out.  </P> <P> "I don't have to be the guy who pushes the buttons and runs things," he told  the newspaper, adding that he "might stay behind to help, but in a lower  profile, on the board."  </P> <P> Chrysler said the comments did not constitute a formal retirement announcement,  which would first be made to company directors and employees.  </P> <P> After joining the company in 1978, Iacocca, 64, became one of America's most  recognizable business executives, appearing on Chrysler television commercials  and writing two best-selling books.  </P> <P> His pay of nearly $18 million in 1988 and $20 million in 1987 made him the  highest-paid executive in the nation.  </P></p>

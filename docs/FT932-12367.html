			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: RWE hopes to maintain dividend RWE, the German energy-based industrial combine, increased turnover by 2.5 per cent to almost DM40bn (Dollars 25bn) in the first nine months of its financial year, and hopes to maintain both profits and dividend for the full year. Mr Friedhelm Gieske, chief executive, said that poor results in chemicals and oil refining, and in its printing machinery subsidiaries, had been offset by good results from construction, and stable figures from energy, mining and raw materials. RWE, a former electrical utility and coal-mining operation, had an annual turnover of DM52bn last year and is the fifth largest industrial group in Germany. The company last year paid a dividend of DM12 per share, with group earnings of DM1.04bn. Mr Gieske said Consol, the US mining company jointly owned with Du Pont, was negotiating to buy Island Creek, a coking coal producer owned by Occidental Petroleum. He revealed that the rights issue launched by RWE last month - the second largest in German financial history - raised DM1.64bn, contributing DM1.62bn to the group cash balances after deducting costs. Mr Gieske said the money would be used to replenish group liquidity after a string of acquisitions in recent years, and to help finance an investment programme in east Germany. It would also help to repay bank debts of Vista, its US chemicals subsidiary, and provide DM450m for Hochtief, the construction subsidiary. The RWE chief used the occasion to restate his company's commitment to nuclear energy as a component in Germany's power generation, saying it was essential to ensuring competitive energy costs for the German economy. He rejected any suggestion that Germany should buy cheaper electricity supplies from France or eastern Europe - generated from nuclear power stations - while refusing to build any more such facilities itself. He confirmed that RWE would ask the European Commission for exemption from EC competition regulations in its monopoly power-supply contracts with local authorities in Germany.</p>

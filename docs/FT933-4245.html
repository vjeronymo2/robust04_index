			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US likely to lower grain and soya estimates COMMODITY TRADERS are expecting the US Department of Agriculture to reduce its estimates for the wheat, soyabean, and maize harvests when it releases the results of its September crop survey this afternoon. However, the figures are unlikely to boost grain prices, as futures fund managers, who control huge commodity investments, have already allowed for the reductions. Although respected private crop forecasters like Memphis-based Sparks Commodities lowered their own crop estimates last Friday, soyabean prices tumbled to their lowest levels since June 30 after Monday's Labour Day holiday. The slide came as weather forecasts predicted fair harvesting weather for the week, and fund managers, made nervous by losses in gold, sold off holdings of other commodities. Tumbling oil prices and interest rates have eased inflation concerns, making investments in physical commodities less attractive. Commodities are often held in portfolios as inflation hedges. Based on its August 1 survey, the USDA estimated maize production at 7.423bn bushels and soyabean production at 1.902bn bushels. Sparks lowered its estimates to 7.316bn bushels for maize and 1.869bn bushels for soyabeans in advance of today's report. Another prominent consulting group broadcast harvest estimates as low as 7.294bn bushels for maize and 1.848bn bushels for soyabeans. While analysts expect the government to reduce its production estimates today, they say the October crop survey, conducted later in the harvest, is likely to restore some of the lost bushels. 'History dictates that October estimates are higher than September's, at least in non-drought years,' says Mr Richard Lowey, president of the market consulting firm, AgResources.</p>

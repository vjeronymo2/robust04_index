			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Take-up of mortgages falls sharply REPORTS from estate agents of increasing activity in the housing market were undermined yesterday by figures from building societies showing a fall in the number of people committing themselves to new mortgages last month. The value of net new commitments to society mortgages last month fell to Pounds 1.55bn from Pounds 1.89bn in December. The December figure was revised downwards from an earlier estimate of Pounds 1.99bn which had been taken as a sign of modest recovery. The value of net new commitments last month was lower than in any month last year, when the lowest monthly figure was Pounds 1.8bn in September. The value last month was also heavily down on the Pounds 2.27bn of net new commitments made in January last year. The Building Societies Association said increased interest among housebuyers had not yet emerged. 'There is no evidence of recovery in the housing market on these figures,' said Mr Adrian Coles, the association's head of external relations. Mr Coles said the fall in new commitments was 'not un-expected' because buying was traditionally subdued in January. The activity reported by housebuilders and estate agents would probably be reflected in future figures. He said the fall might also reflect a decline in the share of mortgage lending done by societies. The cut in base rates has enabled lenders such as banks taking funds from wholesale markets to undercut retail-funded mortgages. Gross mortgage lending for January fell to Pounds 1.8bn from Pounds 2.14bn in December. But net advances - gross advances minus the repayment of mortgage principal - increased slightly to Pounds 528m from a revised figure of Pounds 474m in December. Societies' deposits were more encouraging. They achieved a net inflow of retail funds of Pounds 363m in January after an inflow of Pounds 117m in December. The January figure alone was above the total annual inflow of Pounds 295m last year. The retail inflow was the highest in a single month since October 1991. Mr Coles said the inflow was 'particularly welcome' given renewed competition from National Savings because of government efforts to attract retail funds. Societies did not pass on the whole of the 1 percentage point cut in base rates to savers last month in order to protect themselves against customers transferring money to National Savings and equity-based investments. Mr Coles said this would probably have a stronger effect in future months. National Savings funds were also increasing, indicating a broader willingness to save.</p>

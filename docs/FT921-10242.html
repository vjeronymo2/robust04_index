			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Depressed demand and lower margins behind tumble at P&amp;P P&amp;P, one of the largest distributors of personal computers in the UK, saw profits nosedive last year as the recession depressed customer demand and intense price-cutting in the industry affected margins. Despite an increase in turnover to Pounds 228.3m (Pounds 223.8m) pre-tax profits in the year to November 30 1991 fell from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 711,000. Mr David Southworth, managing director, said the group had been caught by a larger than expected fall in revenue from product sales at a time while it was still investing to build up higher margin computer services business. The decline was signposted by a profits warning last October. The shares yesterday rose 5p to 44p. An unchanged final dividend of 3p is declared; after the increased interim this raises the total to 4.33p (4.25p). Earnings fell to 0.9p (18.5p). UK corporate sales dropped substantially during the year. Customers cut back investment in computers because of the recession and intense price competition between manufacturers, which led to the average price of PCs falling 40 to 50 per cent. Cuts of that magnitude led customers to put off investment decisions in expectation of further reductions. Against this backdrop, P&amp;P found itself with continuing high overheads as it built up its services side. Net operating expenses surged to Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 27.9m), of which personnel costs, including redundancies, accounted for Pounds 6.8m and bad debt and stock provisions Pounds 3.1m. The group was comfortable with its decision to invest in the computer services business from a strategic point of view. Faced with a wide variety of choices in complicated and costly information technology systems, consumers were increasingly dependent on advice from third parties such as P&amp;P. Its ability to provide that service had won it loyal customers. But from a profits point of view, customers seeking advice were still unwilling to pay for that advice. Mr Southworth expected the trend to increase and while P&amp;P had to offer many services free in the past, 'we're now in a scenario where nothing is free.' COMMENT The PC market will continue to be difficult and product margins are not likely to return to their former levels. The question is how long P&amp;P will have to wait before generating the kind of returns it is looking for and whether it can keep from falling seriously into loss before that happens. The timing of a UK recovery is anyone's guess. That said, however, a recovery will come, if not this year then the next, and P&amp;P is probably better placed than others to withstand prolonged turbulence thanks to the proceeds of its rights issue. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.5m give a prospective multiple of 10, which is perhaps undemanding given the comfort of nearly Pounds 10m net cash and the group's reputation in the sector which strengthens its recovery potential.</p>

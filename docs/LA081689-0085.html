			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CALL-BOX DISPATCHERS FACE TANGLE OF TONGUES  </P> <P> Orange County's year-old system of freeway telephones has a problem -- the  dispatchers at California Highway Patrol headquarters in Santa Ana can't  understand many of the callers.  </P> <P> The 1,134 call boxes spaced every quarter of a mile along all the county's  freeways received a record 13,500 calls last month. About 10% of the callers,  as many as 100 on some days, spoke only foreign languages, mostly Spanish and  Vietnamese.  </P> <P> The dispatchers, however, speak only English.  </P> <P> "From the start, the number of people calling in foreign languages has  surprised us," said Todd Murphy, chairman of California SAFE (Service Authority  for Freeway Emergencies), which handles wireless call boxes in California.  </P> <P> Murphy said that when the telephone service was launched last September,  officials expected to receive some calls in Spanish but never anticipated the  volume and diversity of foreign language calls.  </P> <P> A translation center was retained to deal with non-English-speaking callers.  When foreign language calls come into Santa Ana, the caller is patched into the  translation facility -- Communications and Language Line, based in Monterey,  Calif. -- and a three-way conversation takes place.  </P> <P> Company officials say they receive more demands for translation from Orange  County than anywhere else freeway phones are used.  </P> <P> "From the very start we found that Orange County runs 30 to 40 different  languages every month, about the same as in New York City," said Mike McFerrin,  information manager for Communications and Language Line, which can translate  in 143 languages. "We get more calls from call boxes in Orange County than we  do from anywhere in the country."  </P> <P> Although the center has had to deal with Orange County callers who speak only  such languages as Romanian and Farsi, about half the foreign language calls are  in Spanish. While they can still hook up by telephone with the translation  service, Highway Patrol officials say they need Spanish speakers on staff to  handle the  </P> <P> heavy volume.  </P> <P> "The translation service is great, but it's costly and slower than having  somebody on hand," said Lt. Rick Criner, manager of the Santa Ana  communications center. "We need somebody on staff.  </P> <P> "It's much better to have bilingual people on hand rather than to try and sort  things out over three telephone lines. They are faster and they can save lives  if they know CHP policies and procedures."  </P> <P> Criner said the telephone center has had difficulty attracting Spanish-speaking  applicants and that CHP regulations have hampered the hiring of Spanish  speakers. Under department rules, bilingual dispatchers can be paid more after  they are hired but can only be given preference in hiring if they are among the  top three candidates, he said.  </P> <P> Last January, the CHP allocated extra money to be paid to two Spanish-speaking  dispatchers in the Santa Ana office, but so far none has been hired. In June,  the department held its first ever bilingual test for dispatchers. Of 20  applicants, four qualified and have been listed for hire, said CHP spokesman  Keith Thornhill.  </P> <P> Orange County began to install the call-box system in 1987 after the area's 26  municipalities approved a $1 surcharge on motor vehicle registration to pay for  it. About $5.4 million was spent just to install the telephones that went on  line in June, 1988, and were completed last September.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, other counties in California will be watching to see how Orange  County deals with the problem. Although only Orange, San Diego and Los Angeles  counties now have call boxes, more than a dozen other counties, including  Riverside, expect to start the service in the next few years.  </P> <P> By 1991, though, there should be 15,000 call boxes in the state, Murphy said.  </P> <P> "This system is the best we can do for now," said Murphy. "It helps drivers  help themselves."  </P> <P> </P> <P> COUNTY CALL BOXES  </P> <P> The Orange County call box system was the first in the state to begin operation  under the California SAFE (Service Authority for Freeway Emergencies) program  last June. Since then, California Highway Patrol authorities in Santa Ana have  found that about 10% of the 8,000 to 13,000 calls each month are in languages  operators can't understand without a translator.  </P> <P> Total call boxes in O.C.: 1,124  </P> <P> Calls per week: about 2,000  </P> <P> Cost to build: $5.2 million  </P> <P> Total calls requiring a translator in June: 828  </P> <P> Average number of languages other than English each month: 30-40  </P> <P> Full-time positions for answering call-box calls: 6  </P> <P> Source: California Highway Patrol and SAFE  </P></p>

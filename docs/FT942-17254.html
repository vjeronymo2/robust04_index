			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Last deep coal pit in S Wales faces axe Miners at Tower colliery, the last British Coal deep mine in south Wales, expect to be told of the pit's proposed closure today after the corporation yesterday expressed 'serious concern' about its future. The corporation also warned industrial employees throughout the country that existing redundancy terms expire at the end of this month and that new arrangements are likely to be less generous. Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal employee relations director, said it would seek to give a measure of protection against redundancy, but it would have to assess what is 'sustainable and affordable taking into account the likely reduced need for redundancy and the government's privatisation plans'. British Coal's pre-privatisation programme is close to completion. Of the 18 remaining pits, including Asfordby in Leicestershire which is due to open next year, only two to four are likely to close. The corporation said at a review meeting yesterday that recent plans for viable production at Tower, near Aberdare, were high-risk because of poor geology and falling demand for coal of the pit's quality. Unsold stocks of coal at the pit have almost doubled in the past year to more than 400,000 tonnes. The 200 miners at Tower will learn today whether the corporation wants their colliery to be among the closures. Mr Tyrone O'Sullivan, NUM mining union branch secretary, said he expected the corporation to announce the pit's closure at a meeting with the union this afternoon. He expected miners would vote to fight the closure by taking their case for it remaining open through the industry's review procedure. Yet miners throughout the country have voted to accept closures in recent months. The ending of the enhanced redundancy scheme increases the pressure on Tower's workers to accept closure. The redundancy terms, which will end on April 30, were introduced in 1990 and have since been extended and improved several times. Miners with a maximum of 30 years' service have been eligible for payments of up to Pounds 44,000. These arrangements are funded largely by the government, which has been keen to minimise criticism resulting from the sharp contraction of the industry. More than 30 pits have closed in the past 18 months. South Wales was for much of this century one of the main UK centres for coalmining. At the end of the 1984-85 miners' strike there were 28 collieries in the region. Earlier this year the north-east of England, another former heartland of the industry, also lost its last deep mine when Ellington colliery in Northumberland closed.</p>

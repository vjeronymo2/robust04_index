			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (8): Innovation on all fronts - Miniaturisation is allowing designers to pack more and more power into notebook computers / Computing on the move FOR most of the 1980s the business computer user who left the office faced two unenviable choices - either to abandon access to computing power and the data it generates, or to lug a heavy weight 'laptop' computer and all its accessories. That is no longer the case. The advent of the notebook computer in particular has put real mobile computing power in the hands of users and in turn led to the proliferation of mobile computing devices. Today's portable computers range from high power colour note books boasting state-of-the-art features to small hand held devices and the new generation of Personal Digital Assistants epitomised by the Apple's Newton MessagePad, pictured above. Indeed, the portable segment of the personal computer market has been the star performer over the past couple of years. According to Dataquest, the market research organisation, worldwide notebook computer shipment, led by manufacturers such as Toshiba, Apple, NEC and Compaq more than doubled last year to 4.35m units. Dataquest estimates that almost one in every five PCs sold last year was a portable and the trend is accelerating. By 1997 Dataquest expects portables and PDA's to account for more than 45 per cent of unit sales. The notebook computer revolution has been made possible by greater silicon integration and the overall trend towards miniaturisation which have allowed designers to pack more and more computing power into lighter packages. At the same time, low-power chips, new lightweight components like PCMIA-card drives have enabled manufacturers to deliver most if not all the functionality of desktop systems in much smaller boxes. Notebook computers are used in addition to desktop machines, and increasing as replacements. Mr Jeff Goldberg, European industry analyst with Dataquest in London, says most corporate users want machines which offer similar facilities to desktops and are able to run the same software. Increasingly that means fast Intel 486 processors and colour screens. For a growing number of business users, notebook computers form one part of the 'mobile office.' Equipped with a fax-modem and a mobile telephone they can be used to send and retrieve data, electronic mail and facsimiles while on the move. One Swindon based company, Vocom, has taken this process to its logical conclusion building an integrated mobile office, comprising removable mobile telephone, letter quality printer, fax and data modem and notebook computer, into a briefcase. A single in-built power supply and battery charger meets the power re quirements for all the equipment. Other innovative machines to appear on the market recently have included modular designed systems like the latest notebook computer range from Elonex, the North London-based computer group. The Elonex NB400 notebook allows the user to change almost every facet of its operation. Aside from the ability to upgrade the CPU, expand removable hard disk storage capacity and batter ies the user can simply and easily switch screens. Elonex claims this will enable customers to keep up with future display technologies while the removable hard disk also allows a group of users to 'share' a machine but each retain their own hard disk data. A handful of other manufacturers including Japan's NEC and Italy's Olivetti with the recently launched Philos have adopted similar modular design approaches. OTHER innovations have included pen-based 'notepad' systems from a growing number of notebook manufacturers and the Grid Convert ible, now supplied by AST alongside its new ranges of high and budget-priced notebook systems. The Convertible boasts both keyboard and penpad. Pen-based systems, including smaller handheld devices like ACS Data's robust TouchPC, are mainly being used for niche applications, for example by insurance assessors, engineers completing customised forms on site or warehousemen checking stock. Apple has also achieved considerable success with its PowerBook systems which were among the first notebooks with an integrated trackerball - a feature which is increasingly common. Last year, Apple sold over 500,000 PowerBooks, worth more than Dollars 1bn. More recently Apple's Duo System has begun to exploit the grow ing demand for 'docking' systems. The Duo, like machines from other manufactures including Compaq, combines a lightweight note book computer for use on the road with a docking station which turns the machine into a sophisticated desktop hooked up to the office network. At 4.2 lbs, the Duo comes close to entering the sub-notebook category of devices pioneered by Olivetti with the Quaderno, now in its second generation, and Hewlett Packard with the recently launched Omnibook. But despite high expectations the sub-notebook market has so far failed to live up to expectations. Dataquest's Mr Goldberg believes this is because they have been too expensive and are generally viewed as 'add-ons' similar too, but more costly than, electronic organisers. They also require the user to make more compromises in terms of screen and keyboard sizes than full size notebooks. However, he concedes that they could be successful 'if people get the price and the market right.' Mr Goldberg is equally doubtfull about the short-term market for PDAs, arguing that the first machines from manufacturers like Apple, Casio, Sharp and others including Amstrad in the UK are generally too expensive and so far offer few clear advantages over cheaper handheld computers and pen-operated electronic organisers. Even when prices fall he doubts whether PDA's will initially sell in sufficient volumes to generate significant revenues for their manufacturers. But not everyone agrees. Despite its relatively hefty price tag (Pounds 649 in the UK), the innovative Apple Newton MessagePad, which was officially launched in Britain this month, has already found some ardent supporters. MR Richard Woodington, director of Rothwell group which claims to sell more Apple computers into the corporate sector than any other UK-based supplier, says: 'Newton is breaking ground for the PDA market much the same way as the Macintosh did for personal computing. 'Much of the same approach is evident in Newton - easy and intuitive use, integrated software design and built - in communications.' He claims that large businesses are allready showing tremendous interest in Newton mainly because of its ability to log on to office electronic mail systems, send and receive faxes and talk to PCs - all in a package which fits on the palm of the hand and can also recognise handwriting. 'We see Newton as a potential mobile extension for client/server technology, whereby an authorised user could have transparent access to a corporate database from wherever they are,' he says. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the initial reaction to Newton from some quarters has been mixed because of disappointment that it cannot immediately provide cordless communications. But he says that the introduction of new digital mobile services, like Mercury's One-2-One in the UK and GSM services throughout Europe will 'bring Newton into a new dimension, making it truly a mobile communications system.' What does seem certain is that the worlds of digital processing and telecommunications are continuing to converge and that in the future business computer users will be offered a wide range of mobile computer and communications systems aimed at specific market niches. Mobile computing has, after all, not even reached its teenage years.</p>

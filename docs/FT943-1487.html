			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Anglovaal pays more as profits rise 13% South Africa's Anglovaal group, the mining and industrial conglomerate, has announced a 13 per cent rise in operating profit to R813.9m (Dollars 229.9m) for the year to June from R719.5m last time. Turnover rose 17 per cent to R9.97bn from R8.51bn, while attributable earnings rose 17 per cent to R342.2m from R293.1m a year ago. The dividend was also raised 17 per cent to 123 cents from 105 cents. Once again Anglovaal's industrial interests provided the greatest part of the group's earnings. At R241.2m, up from R203.1m last year, they contributed 71 per cent to the total. The improved results were due largely to higher relative earnings from cement group Anglo-Alpha and electronics and construction arm Grinaker Holdings, as well as a satisfactory performance from food processor Irvin and Johnson. Income from the group's direct mining interests in gold, copper and manganese benefited from the weaker rand and rose to R45.8m from R37.9m, with their share of total earnings static at 13 per cent. The increase in mining earnings was also helped by higher royalties accruing to subsidiary group subsidiary Saturn Mining, Prospecting and Development from the Venetia diamond mine. However, earnings from indirect mining holdings, held through Middle Witwatersrand, rose only slightly to R35.8m from R34.2m, and their overall contribution to group earnings dipped from 13 per cent to 12 per cent. The group expressed optimism about the South African outlook for the coming year, citing the continuing international recovery and rising domestic fixed investment. It expected to increase earnings further over the current year.</p>

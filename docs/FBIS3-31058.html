			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Defense Minister Becomes Hazard for </F> National Security"]    [Text] March 1992 -- The Yugoslav Army officially  withdraws from Macedonia.    September 1992 -- Defense Minister Staliyski meets  Macedonian  Defense Minister Professor Vlado Popovski in Skopje. The talks  are fruitful, the Macedonian side proposes intensification of  contacts.    October 1992 -- The Macedonian defense minister visits  Bulgaria at Staliyski's invitation and has talks with Prime  Minister Filip Dimitrov, President Zhelev, and the military  leadership of the Defense Ministry. An agreement is reached on  signing a framework accord on exchanging groups of experts and  training Macedonian officers at the Georgi Rakovski Military  Academy.    Minister Popovski announces that the Macedonian Army is  armed  only with weapons of the former Yugoslav territorial defense  troops. In connection with certain concocted accusations by the  leadership of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] regarding a  deal with Bulgarian weapons for Macedonia, he says that not a  single Bulgarian rifle sling has been imported to Macedonia.    November 1992 -- Bulgarian-Macedonian relations deteriorate  after General Brigo Asparukhov's absurd statement about an "arms  deal," and about the "pro-Serbian" attitude of the Macedonian  Government. The Macedonian side notes that the accusations and  violations of the embargo have hurt Bulgaria's image.  Nevertheless, the Macedonian military proposes the formation of  an expert commission on cooperation in the training of cadres,  rear services, and communications equipment.    December 1992 -- The Macedonian military proposes an  exchange  of information.    Already in its first days the new cabinet supported by the  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] imposes an embargo on contacts  with Macedonia's military representatives. In an absurd  interview, Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov proposes the  insane idea of a so-called Alliance of the Danubian States,  while Bulgaria's policy toward Macedonia is reduced to the  definition "sentiments."    The defense minister's idea on the "Danubian Alliance" has  been implemented to the extent that today the  Sofia-Ankara-Athens isosceles triangle has become an equilateral  triangle.... On the other hand, the systematic betrayal of  national interests through totally ignoring Macedonia as a  partner in military contacts, continues.    An absurd situation is reached when the Macedonian deputy  minister of defense is received by the deputy chairman of a  department in our Defense Ministry, and the meeting takes place  in the Defense Ministry's cafeteria!? Despite the humiliation,  the Macedonian deputy minister accepts the meeting and proposes  cooperation, to which the Bulgarian side reacts with silence....    The attempts of highranking Macedonian military figures to  establish contacts with Bulgarian colleagues are met with  obvious slights. At the same time the Defense Ministry  establishes official contacts with Albanian Defense Minister  Safet Zhulali, Greek General Staff Chief Dhimitrios Skarvelis,  and his Turkish counterpart, Gures. The Bulgarian military  signs agreements with Greece and Turkey on additional measures  on strengthening confidence and security.    Macedonia becomes a UN member in April 1993. The Macedonian  minister officially declares that his Bulgarian colleague  Aleksandrov has refused already on two occasions to meet with  him, but despite this he is prepared to visit Bulgaria.  Minister Popovski again declares that Bulgaria is an  exceptionally important factor in Macedonia's national security.    Encountering the iron wall of Bulgarian military silence, a  Macedonian delegation makes an official visit to Turkey in  November 1993 and signs a cooperation agreement. In a joint  declaration with the Turkish defense minister it is pointed out  that in the case of a Serbian military aggression Turkey will  interfere and guarantee Macedonia's national security. The  Bulgarian side reacts with dead silence.    Two dark figures stand behind the Defense Ministry civilian  and military leadership's unconstructive policy -- Lieutenant  General Stoyan Andreev, until recently adviser to the president  on national security issues, and intelligence chief Brigo  Asparukhov. The two puppets' strings are again pulled by a  distant northeastern capital, states a well-informed source.  Someone is again selling our national interests and ideals  elsewhere.</p>

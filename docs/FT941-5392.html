			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Out to grass, but still grazing Sir, The debate about who regulates the regulators will be enlivened by reports that the recently retired director-general of Gas Supply is to advise a gas supply company in competition with British Gas. This development, presumably approved by DTI officials, conflicts with the UK energy minister's commitment to 'unwind the tilt' against British Gas. Former regulators will, of course, comply with restrictions on disclosure of information, such as those embodied in Section 42 of the Gas Act 1986. But there is nevertheless a feeling among consumer groups that, once put out to grass, regulators should not graze in fields where public service has made them privy to information denied to others.

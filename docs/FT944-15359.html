			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Daewoo unveils big expansion plan The Daewoo group, South Korea's third largest car maker, is planning to quadruple its worldwide production capacity to around 2m cars a year by 2000, Mr Woo-Choong Kim, Daewoo chairman, said yesterday. Daewoo would produce around 500,000 cars this year, and was planning to raise output to 700,000 in 1995. The group has embarked on a five-year, Dollars 5bn investment programme from 1995 to 1999, said Mr Kim, which would raise capacity in South Korea to around 1m cars a year with a further 1m units of capacity being created overseas, most importantly in Romania, India, China and Uzbekistan. The Daewoo expansion is one of the most ambitious projects launched by any of the world's leading car makers in recent years, as it seeks to break into the ranks of the world's top ten vehicle manufacturers. Mr Kim said that the group had completed this month the acquisition of a 51 per cent stake in Automobile Craiova, the small Romanian carmaker, formerly known as Oltcit. 'We think we are going to produce about 100,000 cars a year in Romania starting at the end of 1996,' said Mr Kim. Daewoo could begin with the local assembly in Romania of kits supplied from Korea, but it planned to start production in 1996 of a new small car currently under development as the group's first world car. This would be a 1.3 and 1.5 litre supermini, the size of the Ford Fiesta or Renault Clio. Daewoo also planned production of this car in India, and China as well as in Romania and in Korea. 'We are going to produce engines and transmissions in Romania,' Mr Kim said. Total investment planned for the project was around Dollars 500m, he said, and cars would also be exported to other east European markets. Production would begin in Uzbekistan next year with plans to raise output to 200,000 a year by 2000. Daewoo was investing Dollars 600m in this project in a 50/50 joint venture with the Uzbekistan government, said Mr Kim. The group was planning production of its Cielo small family car as well as the Tico range of mini cars and light commercial vehicles with sales in the markets of central Asia and Russia. In India Daewoo had just purchased a 51 per cent stake in DCM Toyota, an ailing truck maker, which it planned to transform into a car maker with a capacity for 200,000 cars a year by 2000. It planned a investment of around Dollars 500m in India. Production of the Daewoo Cielo (to be called the Nexia in the UK, where it goes on sale next year) would be followed later by the introduction of the group's new world car. Mr Kim said that Daewoo had received preliminary approval from the Chinese government last year to establish co-operative projects with the First Automotive Works for the manufacturing of both components and a passenger car which would be a joint development project with China with production possibly beginning in 1997. Investment in the China project could total Dollars 2bn, shared equally by Daewoo and its Chinese partner. Daewoo launched its cars in Europe for the first time at the Birmingham motor show yesterday with sales in the UK planned to begin in 1995. It has scheduled a launch in the North American market in 1996. Mr Kim said that the group's main growth would come in the developing markets of Asia, east Europe and possibly Latin America, rather than in west Europe and the US. 'The newly created markets we are going into are growing much faster than the main world markets,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-AGENT GETS TERM IN LUXEMBOURG  </P> <P> Fugitive former narcotics agent Darnell Garcia, indicted in Los Angeles on  drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges, has been sentenced to six months  in prison in Luxembourg for traveling on a false passport, it was learned  Friday.  </P> <P> One of Garcia's attorneys, Mark A. Borenstein of Los Angeles, said the  sentencing by a three-judge tribunal Thursday means that the U.S. government's  attempt to extradite Garcia to stand trial in Los Angeles cannot take place  until next year.  </P> <P> "It could take a year or more before extradition proceedings are completed,"  Borenstein said in a telephone interview from Luxembourg.  </P> <P> The indictment, most recently expanded last week, alleges that Garcia and two  other former Drug Enforcement Administration agents, all of whom worked in the  agency's Los Angeles office, conspired to traffic in cocaine and heroin and  laundered their profits through banks in Switzerland and Luxembourg.  </P> <P> Separately Friday, an alleged cocaine kingpin whose brother had alleged links  to Garcia was arrested in the San Bernardino County community of Rialto.  </P> <P> Rodney P. Browning, 29, was arrested without incident in a pickup truck by a  task force of eight deputy U.S. marshals and local and county law enforcement  officers, said David Stanton, the chief deputy U.S. marshal for Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "A considerable amount of cash, drugs and weapons was in Browning's (Rialto)  residence," Stanton said.  </P> <P> "Rodney Browning is a known member of the street gang known as the Black  Guerrilla Family and is reported to be a major supplier of cocaine and crack to  the Bloods and Crips street gangs in Los Angeles," the marshal's office said in  a statement.  </P> <P> Browning, one of the U.S. Marshals Service's 15 most wanted fugitives, along  with his older brother, Elrader Browning Jr., headed a network that supplied  cocaine to cities in Southern California and other parts of the country,  according to the statement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Life Sentences  </P> <P> Elrader Browning was charged in 1987 with netting an estimated $2.5 million a  month from drug trafficking. He was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive  life prison terms without the possibility of parole and fined $2 million.  </P> <P> One of the charges contained in the 42-count Garcia indictment alleges that  Garcia leaked intelligence information through another alleged drug trafficker,  Ron Waddy, to Elrader Browning in June, 1987, when Browning was about to be  arrested by federal agents in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Waddy and his brother, Conway Willie Waddy Jr., are facing trial in Detroit.  Ron Waddy was arrested in July in Paris where he was on the lam with Garcia,  federal authorities allege. His scheduled extradition hearing is set for Sept.  27 in Paris.  </P> <P> Garcia's extradition proceedings, to transport him for trial from Luxembourg to  Los Angeles, is being handled by the State and Justice departments.  </P> <P> A State Department spokesman, David Denny, said the agency's lawyers "would  have to consult the (extradition) treaty" between Washington and Luxembourg to  determine whether Garcia's six-month sentence on the passport violation could  snag the extradition process.  </P> <P> Expected to stand trial with Garcia, 42, of Rancho Palos Verdes, are two other  former Drug Enforcement Administration agents, John Jackson, 40, of Claremont,  and Wayne Countryman, 46, of Walnut; Jackson's wife, Barbara, 41, and Jackson's  former business partner, Sherman Lair, 39, of Alta Loma.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heroin Worth $7.5 Million  </P> <P> The DEA corruption investigation being conducted by the U.S. attorney's office  in Los Angeles turns partly on the suspected theft in the 1980s of more than  five pounds of Asian heroin with a street value of $7.5 million from the  custody of the DEA here.  </P> <P> Garcia had been a fugitive for seven months, apparently traveling on a bogus  Mexican passport until his arrest in early July by Luxembourg police, who got a  tip from DEA agents.  </P> <P> The trial had been scheduled Nov. 7 before U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter in  Los Angeles. But that date was recently canceled, and no new one has been set.  </P> <P> The chief prosecutor in the Garcia case, Assistant U.S. Atty. Joyce Karlin,  said she did not know whether Garcia's six-month sentence in Luxembourg would  substantially delay the extradition proceedings.  </P> <P> But, in any case, Karlin said Friday that she will oppose Garcia's trial being  handled separately from the other defendants.  </P></p>

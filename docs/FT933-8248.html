			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: The heavy burdens of competition law Sir, The need for competition law reform is undeniable as the points in 'Competition on the back burner' (August 10) make clear. However, there are two further points that should be added. First, the Court of Appeal has added to the burden of the Office of Fair Trading. As a result of a decision in 1991 it is now incumbent on the OFT to establish not only that individual employees have participated in a registrable agreement - which can be difficult - but also that in participating in such an agreement they were acting within the scope of their authority. This is even more difficult to show. Second, the opportunity exists for someone who is affected by the unlawful operation of a registerable agreement to sue for damages any party which gives effect to it. One example of this occurred some years ago when four companies paid to the Post Office approximately Pounds 9m in an out-of-court settlement. The money was paid by way of an adjustment to prices charged under a registerable, but unregistered, agreement. However, this remedy is rarely used by the victims of market-sharing and price-fixing cartels. Perhaps if more businesses made use of this remedy the government might consider it desirable to accelerate the introduction of legislation reforms. For the present the government is being mealy-mouthed. It retains competition legislation that is not up to the job and which imposes unnecessary burdens on many small- and medium-sized companies. But at the same time it heralds its devotion to competition and to freeing businesses from the burden of red tape. Without government action, competition will be more in the refrigerator than on the back burner. S L Sidkin, Fox Williams Solicitors, City Gate House, 39-45 Finsbury Square, London EC2A 1UU</p>

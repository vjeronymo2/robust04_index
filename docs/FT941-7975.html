			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / People: Goldman Sachs Michael Sherwood, the larger-than-life syndicate manager who surprised the Eurobond market last month when he left Goldman Sachs for a quieter life as a fund manager at a private Swiss bank, has missed the buzz of the City so much that he has asked for his old job back. And Goldman's top brass, eternally grateful to 'Woody' for taking the bank to the top of the Eurobond league table last year, have welcomed him back with open arms. No doubt they will look favourably on him when they award partnerships in November. Sherwood will be back at his old haunt today and will be joined on the syndicate desk by Noel Dunn, an executive director of the firm. Sion Kearsey, who valiantly held the fort during Sherwood's absence, has also been rewarded. He has been named joint head of Eurobond trading with Chris Pigden.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Saudi Arabian minister warns on carbon tax MR Hisham Nazer, the Saudi Arabian oil minister, warned yesterday against the introduction of a carbon tax, arguing that 'it could lead to a state of disturbance in the world oil market'. Addressing a plenary session at the summit, he said oil was already heavily taxed and a further charge would affect investment and energy production. His speech came after Dr Subroto, head of Opec, had criticised the focusing of international attention on fossil fuels and CO emissions. He complained that the EC's proposed carbon tax would lead to a transfer of resources from developing to developed countries. Mr Nazer also called for increasing research on global warming 'to remove scientific doubts which still surround the question of climate change', adding it was 'unacceptable to propagate the use of certain means of energy, such as nuclear energy, under cover of dealing with an environmental question' which is still in doubt.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tiit Tambi: "A Look Behind the Parting Pains of </F> the Russian Military"]    [Text]    In yesterday's paper, we published a short listing of  objects that have been taken over from the Russian military  during the month of December last year, and came to the  conclusion that troop removal is progressing too slowly.  However, this could only be said speculatively since, to the  knowledge of the undersigned, there is no accurate way of  determining how many foreign troops we actually have here?  <H5>  What is an object? </H5>   We talk about military objects, but what are they? Let me  bring a few examples. The air defense division located in  Estonia had 14 radio-technology batallions and 39 missile  divisions. If one batallion served several divisions, then how  many objects should we be talking about?    There were also three border guard units in Estonia. They  were in charge of more than 40 check points and 52 technical  observation posts. Another picture puzzle: How many objects were  there?    The staff headquarters of Kaitseliit [Protection League] has  17 objects within a certain system registered in Tallinn, and 11  in the Harjumaa district. These include staff headquarters,  ports, storage facilities for ammunition, food, chemicals and  fuel, radio technology centers and detached communications  batallions, naval divisions, the amari airport, a medical  batallion, a tank regiment, an artillery regiment, and also some  anti-artillery and anti-tank divisions.    The foreign ministry, however, has a listing of over 500  objects, based on the information received from the staff  headquarters of Defense Forces. What accounts for such  divergence of data, by a whole order of magnitude? It turns out  that the latter method is based on the number of land tracts.  The number of land tracts is also the number of objects.    The data used for evaluations differ depending on the  objectives. When talking about taking over objects, the  condition of land and structures is of primary importance, and  will be evaluated, to the extent possible. Determining, however,  the possible danger of attack, other things would have to be  considered, like combat technology and the number of troops.  <H5>  Playing With Numbers </H5>   Russia has been playing with numbers from the very  beginning.  When the Estonian-Russian negotiations started in the Spring of  1992, the Estonian delegation was told that there are roughly  20,000 military personnel here. According to our data, there  must have been close to 40,000. And there were. After looking  into it, it turned out that the Russian delegation had  conveniently left out the border guard and the naval personnel,  thus politely attempting to conceal their presence. For some  reason it was to their benefit to show these numbers smaller  than they actually were. Maybe because Estonian independence was  viewed at the time as a passing phenomenon?    Then a sudden about-face occurred. The word from Moscow was,  for example, that there were 4,170 men in the air defense  division. Local commanders of the division, however, spoke  openly of 1,500. There was also a time at which five or six  different Russian agencies all came out with numbers that, on  occasion, differed from each other by up to 5,000 men. Our  experts explained this with the realization on the part of  Russians that they really must leave. But, to get more aid out  of the Western countries, they tried to inflate the actual  figures at the outset, only to show afterwards how vigorously  they are leaving!  <H5>  Everything Hinges on Political Will </H5>   One small example. Last spring Vassili Svirin, head of the  Russian delegation for negotiations, said that they still had  7,600 men here. This number decreased rapidly throughout the  summer, but that decrease came to a sudden halt in October. Why?  A little later president Yeltsin issued an ukaz about  stopping the removal of troops...    By now, we have heard that talk about stopping removal in so  many versions, and on so many different occasions. At the same  time new arguments emerge. When, at first, it was said that the  troops have no place to go that fast, then now it is spelled out  clearly: The troops are here to defend the Russian minority.  However, it seems that even that is not the ultimate truth. More  and more factors indicate that this minority being `defended' is  another pretext. The actual reason is part of the need to  preserve Russia's avant guarde positions, territories conquered  at some point in history and now in danger of slipping away. Our  eastern neighbors are programmed for imperialism, and there is  little we can do about it.  <H5>  Behind the Broad Back of Veterans </H5>   Now, a new pretext has been found. Those retired officers  numbering 10,000 to 11,000 who, according to the foreign laws  and government regulations should be leaving the country, have  supposedly no place to go. This is nothing more than a military  version of protecting the national minority. That, too, has been  programmed into our lives a long time ago.    During the 70's, Moscow came up with an ingenious plan to  ease the pressure of seniors on the city. It was decided to  scatter them to the warmer parts of the huge homeland. The  Baltic countries received their share, especially in the form of  retired or reserve officers. This had its reasons. A good  network of roads and relatively decent communications would make  it possible for them to be recruited, in case of a general  draft. Back then, this was necessary against external enemies.  But now?    Construction units put up the houses, after which some of  them were turned over to be administered by local authorities.  But it was military personnel who took up residence there. The  officer may have served in the Northern Arctic region but, after  entering reserves, chose to live in Tallinn. The `creative  construction' of the Estonian SSR was obviously none of his  business. There are many like him. Others stayed on living in  housing space assigned to the military. Yet others were given  apartments bought from the city's housing authority by the  Soviet ministry of defense.    Just try to get rid of them now. It could not be done  without  setting off loud complaints about human rights violations. To  make things worse, the officer did not come alone, there is  usually a family in tow. At Tapa, for example, there are roughly  1,000 people living on the military base, only 600 of them  military personnel.    So, we get to the next step. Russia does not have to take  its  officers out, it can demobilize them here. The number of troops  decreased? Decreased. If and when men are needed, the same  people can be recruited, but now under contract, as civilians.  <H5>  Other Hocus Pocus Tactics </H5>   For some time now, I have been wondering if diplomat Svirin  really knows, for example, the number of military personnel  staying here. He gets his information from the foreign ministry  who, in turn, gets it from the defense ministry. And the latter  could be easily fooled. One air defense unit only had five men  left, plus a commander, who was already a board member of some  corporation or other. You may recall the incident behind the  Marja store in Tallinn, a few years ago. That object, too, had  been pawned off to some corporation. One of its board members,  however, was an officer of the unit stationed there. When  members of Estonia's Defense Forces came to take over the  object, marines were summoned promptly, who trampled our boys in  the mud, face down.    By now, such transformations into businessmen have become  part of Russia's national policy. Let us in every way support  military and other kinds of businessmen! Could one really  believe that the marines who had for a while stayed at the  Laidoner estate have left by now? According to some sources,  about a third of them are in Tallinn. They live in the city and  wear civilian clothes.    So much for the military security of the state of Estonia.  And, should these pseudo-military corporations get state funds  or some other capital to back them up, it could well be the end  of our economic independence. But that is another topic.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEMMING STUDENT LOAN DEFAULTS  </P> <P> American taxpayers will pay off $2 billion in loan guarantees next fiscal year  because many college and trade school students cannot or will not do it  themselves. The federal government must reduce that high default rate and, with  William J. Bennett no longer trying to dictate terms as education secretary,  President Bush and Congress have a chance to do just that.  </P> <P> The current education secretary, Lauro F. Cavazos, has rejected a Bennett  approach that would have canceled all federal student aid at colleges where  default rates were extraordinarily high. Bennett's proposal, which was no  solution at all, would have punished all needy students at those schools  because some of their fellow students were deadbeats -- without trying to find  out if there were some way they could pay back the loan. Bennett's proposals so  worried some lawmakers that last year they considered preempting the field with  legislation. The attempt foundered on the question of how stringent the rules  should be.  </P> <P> Last month the Senate returned to the problem, unanimously passing a bill that  would require colleges and trade schools with 25% default rates to get more  involved in trying to cut the losses. Those schools would have to work more  intensively with students to produce more precise plans for repayment. If the  default rate remained high, a state loan guarantee agency would decide whether  students were willfully withholding payments or were in economic distress  before a final decision to cut off federal aid could be made.  </P> <P> The Senate bill incorporates an important principle by giving colleges a bigger  role in policing their own students' loans. Schools have had a better record of  holding down defaults in another federal program in which the loans go through  the colleges rather than directly to students as in the guaranteed loan  program. In 1987, for example, the Education Department declared that students  at Pasadena City College had a 28% default rate on the guaranteed federal loan  program. At the same time, students at Pasadena had only a 6.6% default rate on  loans processed through the college.  </P> <P> There is another way that the Bush Administration and Secretary Cavazos could  help. In addition to student loans, there is a program of direct grants, named  Pell Grants after their sponsor, Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.). Over the eight  years of the Reagan Administration, Congress stood firm against attempts to cut  these Pell Grant funds, but it never was able to increase them, either, at a  time when college costs were soaring. Ten years ago, Pell grants covered  three-fourths of the aid a student required to attend college and student loans  accounted for the rest. Today, those figures are reversed. The Bush  Administration might save more money than it now spends on bad loans if it  invested more in grants.  </P> <P> By passing its bill, the Senate has signaled the direction in which it would  like to see the government go toward curbing the loss from loans. The next step  is up to Cavazos. A realistic plan would give colleges a chance to help their  students understand their obligations and the economic realities they face  before the federal ax comes down.  </P></p>

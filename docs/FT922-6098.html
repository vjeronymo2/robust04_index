			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Disposal of Mountleigh UK property may take years THE DISPOSAL of Mountleigh's Pounds 400m UK property portfolio could take years, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the receiver appointed on Monday. Mr Stephen James of KPMG said he had already received interest from potential purchasers. But he stressed that there would be no immediate 'fire sales'. 'It may take years to unravel,' he said. Receivers were also appointed yesterday to 21 UK subsidiaries. As the complexity of repaying Mountleigh's creditors became clear, bankers warned that other property companies were likely to collapse in coming months. 'The worst may be yet to come in the UK property market', said a senior banker with loans outstanding to Mountleigh. Mountleigh has two main borrowing facilities. A syndicate of nine banks, whose agent is Barclays, has provided Pounds 329m. Also in the syndicate are Credit Suisse of Switzerland, Citibank and Bankers Trust of the US, Unibank of Denmark, Credit Lyonnais of France and three UK banks, Royal Bank of Scotland, National Westminster and Lloyds. There is a much smaller Pounds 38m syndicated loan, whose agent is Citibank. There are also two overdraft facilities, taking Mountleigh's total bank borrowings to more than Pounds 400m. In addition, it owes bondholders Pounds 144m. Mr James said it would take several days to decide what should be done with the UK property portfolio. Although the property is generally well-let, it includes several development sites. The largest properties in Mountleigh's UK portfolio are the Merry Hill shopping centre at Dudley in the West Midlands, the Camberley shopping centre in Surrey and a half share in the Criterion centre in London's Piccadilly Circus. The Richardson brothers, who developed Merry Hill and sold a controlling interest in it to Mountleigh, said they might be interested in repurchasing the shopping centre. Mr Don Richardson said: 'If we could get some arrangement on price we couldn't let a good deal pass by.' London office glut, Page 7 Lex, Page 20 Interest in Merry Hill, Page 23</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UAW DEFEAT SEEN AS SIGN OF DISINTEGRATION OF ORGANIZED LABOR  </P> <P> The crushing defeat suffered by the United Auto Workers at Nissan's Smyrna,  Tenn., plant shows that traditional industrial unionism remains in decline in  the United States, and labor organizations must look beyond the factory if they  are to remain a force in American life, labor relations experts said Thursday.  </P> <P> Although pro-union observers emphasized the steep odds the UAW had faced in  trying to organize at Smyrna and portrayed the election as an isolated case,  others said that the defeat was just the latest in a long string of events --  including the ongoing Eastern Airlines strike -- that could ultimately lead to  the disintegration of organized labor.  </P> <P> "It contributes to the increasing spiral of anger and mistrust," said Charles  Heckscher, a professor of human resource management at Harvard Business School,  "and one possible outcome is the vanishing of organized labor from the national  scene. Another possible result is major conflict."  </P> <P> Heckscher said that those outcomes might occur simultaneously, with increasing  militancy among local activists combining with eroding union power at the  national level. "It's a discouraging sign in terms of working out a positive  outcome to the current decline of the labor-relations system," he added.  </P> <P> Daniel J. B. Mitchell, director of the Institute for Industrial Relations at  UCLA, observed that "traditional union organizing, in terms of the number of  elections held, plummeted in the early 1980s, and it never revived again."  </P> <P> Stepped-up efforts to organize workers in the service sector as well as  attempts to develop a new, more collaborative style of labor-management  relations in the factory have failed to stem the decline in union power. The  only growth in recent years, Mitchell said, has been among government workers,  and he is not optimistic that unions can further capitalize on that success in  the white-collar area.  </P> <P> Audrey Freedman, an economist with the Conference Board in New York, said that  organized labor must recognize that wage-oriented demands will not be met in an  era of global competition, and unions therefore must meet the needs of other  workers in other ways.  </P> <P> "If I were a labor leader -- which I never would be because I'm a woman -- I  would be figuring out what it is that unorganized service workers and clerical  workers really need," she said.  </P> <P> She advocated a union philosophy that draws on the collective self-help  traditions of unionism, one which would be far more concerned with health,  child and personal security issues and would provide working people with a  "communal group."  </P> <P> Freedman said the Eastern strike showed how unions have failed to adjust.  Eastern workers were "striking against the economic realities of a deregulated  industry," she said.  </P> <P> Jerome Rosow, president of the Work in America Institute, agreed that unions  have "not caught up with the needs of women and white-collar workers."  </P> <P> "The most important thing for (the UAW) is to broaden (its) base," he said, and  he contended that the UAW was doing it.  </P> <P> But Rosow said that the Smyrna vote was always an "uphill fight" and that it  would be "making a mountain out of a molehill to read into it broader meanings  about the UAW or the union movement." He pointed to the recent victories by the  steelworkers' union as evidence that, in industries that are organized, unions  remain a dynamic force.  </P></p>

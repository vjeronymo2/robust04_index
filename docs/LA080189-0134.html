			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> LO-TEC VIOLENCE, ANGST AND DARK, BROODING WORKS  </P> <P> While the Bolshoi Ballet Academy danced fanciful, fairy-tale ballets last  weekend, two modern dance makers and a small band of dancers addressed darker  themes in Three's Company's no-frills Hillcrest studio.  </P> <P> The Lo-Tec concert featured works by Margaret Wingrove and Shawn Womack.  Neither Wingrove nor Womack is an unknown quantity in modern dance. Wingrove  (with a success at Jacob's Pillow to her credit) has had her own company in San  Jose since 1981. And Womack (a recent NEA fellow in choreography) has a company  that bears her name in Cincinnati. But both choreographers had low profiles in  San Diego before debuting here last Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> Wingrove's work and three dancers from her seven-member company dominated the  performance. They executed five of the six pieces on the program, including  "Shatterings," the emotionally-draining dance drama that had its world premiere  at Saturday night's performance.  </P> <P> AIDS-inspired dance works are becoming sadly commonplace as the deadly disease  spreads. But Wingrove's perspective -- as the mother of a victim -- may be  unique. In any case, her five-part dance drama was a moving tribute to friends  and family of AIDS sufferers, not just the people afflicted with the vicious  killer. And Wingrove got her message across without any heavy-handed imagery or  sappy sentimentality.  </P> <P> Michael Howerton, a lithe, lanky dancer with cat-like lunges and strong  technique, gave a shattering performance in the powerful "Why Me?" section.  Juxtaposed against the mournful pluckings of a guitar, the deformed gestures of  this tortured solo sent Howerton writhing. But he danced it with dignity and  determination.  </P> <P> The bleeding patterns of their tie-dyed costumes (credited to dancer Annette  Williams) aided and abetted the spirit of the piece. Too bad the bare-bones  studio setting could not provide the level of lighting the piece deserved.  </P> <P> Violence and angst were pretty much the order of the day at this concert. A  little balance would have served the choreographers and the audience a lot  better.  </P> <P> The performance opened on a downer with "Mind Trap," a trio for Howerton,  Williams and Kerry Rapp. Flimsy vertical frames and a crudely executed fence  were used as metaphors for the psychological walls that stifle the human  spirit.  </P> <P> In this case, Wingrove was too literal in her imagery and too preachy in her  program notes. "Mind Trap" might have made a bigger impact without them.  </P> <P> "Two Into One" sounded more hopeful than it was, but at least it fared much  better as a dance work. As the electronic score pounded its dissonant  accompaniment, Howerton and Rapp played with a destructive relationship -- yet  another kind of entrapment.  </P> <P> This could have been just another angst-filled twosome, but Wingrove made  inventive use of props (a wooden chair and an open frame), then ended it all  with a climax that completely caught the audience off balance.  </P> <P> "Reflection" was another dance for a couple, this time for Howerton and  Williams. The choreography was interesting and well danced by this well-matched  pair, but Philip Glass' throbbing rhythms seemed out of step with the lyrical  designs.  </P> <P> "Early Sorrow," a solo for Rapp, never stooped to the maudlin in its "young  girl's lament over the untimely death of her mother." Instead, it trusted the  movement -- deep lunging leg lifts and rapid shifts in direction -- to tell the  tale. And Rapp, with flowing hair and a beautifully supple spine, was a  mesmerizing presence in this brief lament.  </P> <P> Womack has been in residence here for weeks, teaching at workshops for local  dancers. The piece she unveiled at this concert was a direct result of that  residency and served as a vehicle for five Three's Company interns. It was the  third such opportunity to come their way this summer, and the  "work-in-progress" was an effective showcase for the emerging dancers. However,  the program didn't need another dark, brooding work. Hopefully, things will  lighten up a little, at least in the emotional sense, when Three's Company's  Lo-Tec series resumes Aug. 12-13.  </P></p>

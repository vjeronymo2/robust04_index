			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 26 (CNS) -- From March 25 this year,  prices for purchasing raw silk in China are controlled at RMB  [Renminbi] 180,000 per tonne with only 10 percent floating  prices being permitted and no purchasing at prices of over RMB  200,000 for each tonne will be permitted, a top official of the  China Silk Import and Export Corporation (CSIEC) recently  announced here.    Since the beginning of this year, a soaring rise in prices  for silk and silk cloth materials have been seen with prices of  raw silk, rising by 25 percent between January and March. The  skyrocketing prices for raw silk, besides the reduction of the  silkworm cocoon production last year and the drop in storage of  such materials, were mainly caused by artificial factors with  speculation by middlemen being very rampant in the country as  they took advantage of the situation to hold back supplies and  so raise prices, posing a heavy burden on silk-related textile  and printing and dyeing mills and threatening the silk industry  in the country and the preeminent place China has had in the  international silk market for a long time.    The CSIEC, the state authorized company in charge of  administration and management in this sector, will consequently  coordinate its branches at provincial levels in practising  management with price limitations over the raw silk market.    According to a leader of the CSIEC, if the country fails to  put the sharply rising prices of raw silk under control, the  outcome will be very serious and another "silkworm cocoon war"  will break out.</p>

(OANA-ANTARA) --  Indonesia in its capacity as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement  wants to ask Myanmar [Burma] to play an active role in regional  and international activities, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said  here Sunday.    Alatas who arrived here Sunday evening for a three-day  official visit said in the current world changing situation,  Indonesia hoped that Myanmar would be ready to to take part in  the development of various cooperation programs either in term  of the North-South or the South-South cooperation.    The minister is on a visit in Myanmar to hold talks with his  Myanmarese counterpart U Ohn Gyaw on international, regional,  and bilateral issues after a three-day tour of Laos.    Indonesia also hoped that Jakarta and Yangoon ties would  further be enhanced and stepped up by increasing concrete  economic cooperation, Alatas said.    He said that after Myanmar succeeded in overcomcng its  internal problems, Indonesia wanted to ask Yangon to play an  active role in various regional activities which would  eventually lead it to return to its Southeast Asian membership.  "For this purpose, we want to see what we can do as Indonesia  has good traditional relations with Myanmar," Alatas said. He  said that the latest developments in Myanmar indicated that this  country had begun to approach its neighbouring Southeast Asian  countries. "These developments are positive and need to be  hailed," the minister said.    On bilateral ties, the minister said that both nations  needed  to fill in their ties with more concrete things. So far, the two  nations have filled in their relations with cooperation far  below their common potentials, particularly economic and trade  potentials, Alatas said. [passage omitted]</p>

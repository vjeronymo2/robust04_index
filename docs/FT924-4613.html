			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (18): Jobs for the boys - for life WOMEN AND JAPANESE MANAGEMENT: DISCRIMINATION AND REFORM by Alice Lam Routledge, Pounds 35, 240 pages IT WOULD NOT be difficult for a stranger to Japan to discern that there is widespread discrimination against women in the Japanese working environment. It is not so much that women employees in Japanese companies are ill-treated in such an obvious way that might attract widespread criticism. The discrimination is so subtle and so ingrained in the Japanese way of life that those who are guilty of discriminating against women are quite likely to be unaware of the crime. Alice Lam does well to identify the socio-cultural roots of this discrimination in Japanese management practices in her study. Dr Lam, who spent several years in Japan studying the role of women in Japanese corporations, points out that women have long provided a convenient and flexible workforce in a country where the rigid demands of lifetime employment practices place considerable pressures on corporations when changes in the economic climate call for expansion or reduction of the labour force. She also rightly pronounces that despite the introduction of the Equal Employment Opportunity Law in 1985, and recurring prophesies of the eventual collapse of the traditional employment system in Japan, things have not really changed that much. Women are still mainly employed in specialised areas or for specific purposes, such as to identify and develop products likely to appeal to housewives. They are still employed in such a way that the male-dominated management system of lifetime male employment can be perpetuated. The introduction at some Japanese companies of a career conversion system, whereby women in clerical positions are given an opportunity to apply to the managerial career route, itself 'formally legitimises total segregation of men and women.' Even for the most ambitious and dedicated women employees, the importance of informal clique networks and patronage by senior staff, who will invariably be male, create strong barriers to advancement. Dr Lam concludes that in order to further improve women's position in the Japanese labour market and bring equal the country's opportunity standards to the level commonly accepted in the west, 'major legal reforms and stronger policy interventions are necessary.' The book is a rich source of information not only on the conditions for women in Japanese corporations but also on Japanese management practices in general. Unfortunately, the dry, academic style Dr Lam employs is likely to discourage many prospective readers. Although it may not have been appropriate for the academic study which Dr Lam has written, a few anecdotes would have helped to enliven the narrative. It is also a disappointment that Dr Lam has not really discussed the issue of sexual harassment which is a real, though difficult to identify, phenomenon in a male-dominated environment. However, for the student not only of Japanese management but of women's studies generally, the book offers some helpful insights. Dr Lam concludes that: 'If Japanese women are to achieve full and real equality, it cannot be on men's terms. The male work norm will have to be changed and the Japanese management system will need to be challenged.' The same could be said for women in even the most liberal societies.</p>

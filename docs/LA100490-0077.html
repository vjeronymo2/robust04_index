			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT / TARGET OR TREASURE?;  </P> <P> HAWAIIANS FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF ISLAND;  </P> <P> MILITARY CLAIMED KAHOOLAWE FOR BOMBING PRACTICE. NATIVES CALL IT A 'SPIRITUAL  CENTER.'  </P> <P> When Noa Emmett Aluli looks at the dusty, windblown island of Kahoolawe, he  sees a cultural treasure. Ancient petroglyphs etched on its flanks tell of his  people's past.  </P> <P> When the U.S. military trains its sights on Kahoolawe, it sees a target. To the  soldiers and sailors who bomb and assault its shores, the uninhabited island  offers a chance to practice war as it is really fought.  </P> <P> For more than a decade, Aluli has clung to the dream of stopping the bombing  and returning Kahoolawe (pronounced Kah-ho-oh-lah-vey) to Hawaii's people. In  1976, he and a band of friends took matters in their own hands, sailing across  the choppy channel from Maui to land on a rocky beach. The Navy promptly  arrested them for trespassing. But the protesters kept coming, even after two  were lost at sea.  </P> <P> Today Aluli's dream is closer than ever to reality. The National Security  Council, at the behest of President Bush, is assessing the feasibility of  ending use of Kahoolawe as a target. The Navy took over the island during World  War II.  </P> <P> "The fact that we have the attention of the White House for the first time in  our efforts to stop the bombing is really a breakthrough," said Davianna  McGregor, a spokesman for Protect Kahoolawe Ohana, a nonprofit group. "Ohana"  means "family" in Hawaiian.  </P> <P> At first blush, the 45-square-mile island seems unlikely to provoke such an  emotional tug of war. Kahoolawe's battered red dirt swells and cracks in the  sun. Scrubby mesquite trees provide scant shade. Goats have stripped its  once-productive ranch land, and erosion has slashed steep ravines in its sides.  </P> <P> But the smallest of the state's eight major islands has become a powerful  symbol for Hawaiians. What it lacks in foliage, Kahoolawe makes up for in  history. Ancient fishing shrines stud the coastline. At its summit, early  Hawaiians studied astronomy and navigation. The entire island is listed on the  National Register of Historic Places, so rich is it in archeological features.  </P> <P> "It is a spiritual center that takes us back to our kupuna (elders)," said  McGregor. "It has helped the Hawaiian movement find its soul."  </P> <P> Once dismissed as a radical cause, the push to reclaim Kahoolawe has gradually  moved into Hawaii's mainstream. When the early occupations proved fruitless,  Aluli sued the secretary of the Navy on environmental, historic and religious  grounds. The court decision was a milestone for the Ohana.  </P> <P> A 1980 consent decree gives Hawaiians access to the island 10 times a year for  religious and educational purposes. It limits the shelling to the central third  of the island, and requires the Navy to preserve historic sites, stem soil  erosion and help revegetate the island.  </P> <P> Over time, one political leader after another has joined the cause, some with  dramatic flourish. A few years ago, Maui Mayor Hannibal Tavares planted a flag  on the island to claim it for his jurisdiction, while a helicopter overhead  scattered thousands of carnations.  </P> <P> Under its visitation rights, the group has brought about 4,000 people to the  island. They arrive by boat and wade ashore through the surf, carrying  supplies.  </P> <P> While on the island, the group reverts to traditional ways. Ohana members have  built a house of wood and thatch that was brought to the island piece by piece.  They dive for fish and conduct religious ceremonies, offering leaf-wrapped  gifts of food to Hawaiian gods.  </P> <P> Navy personnel always hover nearby, keeping an eye out for unexploded shells  that often protrude from the ground. Troops conduct regular ordnance sweeps,  but more keeps turning up.  </P> <P> While the bombing has been a public relations disaster for the military, the  Navy is proud of its record in reforestation and protecting archeological  sites. Officials say they can't give the island up, however, because it offers  a combination of rough terrain and ocean for which there is no alternative.  </P> <P> "There just aren't other places in Hawaii we can do this type of training,"  said Capt. Gerald Mittendorff, Kahoolawe project officer for the Navy. All four  branches of the military use the island, operating out of a base camp  overlooking its best sandy beach. Every other year, they invite Pacific allies  to join them for exercises. Aware of the controversy, Japan and Australia have  declined to participate recently, but Canada and South Korea still do.  </P></p>

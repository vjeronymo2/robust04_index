			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Airline pilots defend safety record of A320 AIRLINE PILOTS and industry observers yesterday defended the safety record of the Airbus A320, the type of aircraft which crashed into a French hillside on Monday night, killing 87 people. Pilots' organisations said that computerised controls, which have been at the heart of speculation over the safety of the A320, had been in service in other aircraft for 20 years and added to aircraft safety. Concern has arisen because the A320 is regarded as the most technically advanced passenger aircraft flying, but there have been two other A320 crashes since the model was launched four years ago. Subsequent investigations blamed pilot error for both accidents. The Airline Users Committee (AUC), established by the US Civil Aviation Authority, said it was 'concerned but not worried' about the record of the A320. 'The three Airbus crashes are so dissimilar that it would be wrong to jump to the conclusion that there is anything wrong with the technology,' said Mr John Parr of the AUC. International airline organisations were more reluctant to comment on the A320 so soon after a crash. A senior executive at one of them said: 'the aircraft's technology was the last thing that came to mind when I heard the news'. Statistics seem to support such a view. There were 10 air crashes into hillsides in 1991, according to unpublished figures from Flight International, the trade magazine. None of them was an A320. Some of the most vocal criticisms of the A320 have come from pilots' unions, especially in France, where the Airbus is assembled. The unions have criticised the aircraft for using a small crew, two instead of the traditional three, and its computers, which can prevent extreme manoeuvres unless the pilot first switches them off. The British Airline Pilots Association acknowledged that some pilots fear that controlling the aircraft in a crisis 'could be complicated'. It argued, however, that the technology used 'has been accepted worldwide by pilots. It is very safe because computers are faster on the uptake than people'.</p>

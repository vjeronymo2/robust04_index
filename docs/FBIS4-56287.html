			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 1 May, (EFE) -- The 15,870 polling stations  throughout Ecuador opened to voters today at 0700 (1200 GMT) for  legislative, provincial, and municipal elections, which promise  few surprises.    For several months now, the unanimous prediction has been  that the opposition Social Christian Party will win. All that  remains to be seen is the proportion of their victory over Sixto  Duran-Ballen's conservative government.    According to local radio and television stations, election  day, which concludes at 1700 (2200 GMT), began with no major  incidents.    More than 20,000 candidates from 17 political parties are  competing for the votes of 6.2 million voters. The people must  renew 65 of the 77 seats at the single-chamber Congress for a  two-year term. Also during today's vote, Ecuadoreans will elect  54 provincial council members and 607 municipal council members  to a four-year term.</p>

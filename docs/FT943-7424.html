			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: BHP secures ninth Chinese exploration deal Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian steel and resources group, said yesterday it had signed an agreement with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, to explore for oil and gas in the Pearl River Basin. This is the ninth agreement which the company has signed with CNOOC, in recent times, to search for oil and gas in the Bohai, South China and Yellow Seas. BHP Petroleum will hold a 100 per cent interest in the contract area, which covers about 3,640 sq km and is located about 180km south of Shantou, and will act as operator. Exploration is expected to start in the fourth quarter of 1994. Niugini Mining, which is controlled by Canada's Battle Mountain, said yesterday it had signed an agreement with Indian government-owned Hindustan Zinc, to explore and develop gold projects in India. Gold production in India has dwindled to minimal levels, but the two companies said they believed there could be potential for bulk low-grade discoveries around old mining centres, and noted that some of the geology was fairly similar to that of Western Australia. Directors of Bougainville Copper, which is controlled by Australia's CRA group but quoted on the Australian stock exchange, said the reopening of the controversial Panguna mine on Papua New Guinea was unlikely in the near future, in spite of reports that PNG security forces had recaptured the area.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The shift to a market  economy has helped speed up the growth of the private sector in  south China's Guangdong Province, according to the provincial  administration for industry and commerce.    An administration official said that during the first  quarter  of 1994, 4,484 private companies were set up throughout  Guangdong, a national pace-setter in reforms and opening to the  outside world.    That figure brought the number of private companies in  Guangdong to 50,000, 10.5 percent more than at the end of 1993,  the official said.    He said that Guangdong had 25,000 private companies at the  end of 1991, adding that 7,070 more such companies sprang up in  the following year.    Last year saw the establishment of 13,000 such companies, he  said.    Private companies have a total registered capital of 21.3  billion yuan. "These companies have become a main force behind  Guangdong's economic growth," he said.    Guangdong has some 4,000 private companies with a registered  capital exceeding one million yuan each, he said.    To date, 40 private enterprise groups have been formed  throughout Guangdong, he added.    According to the official, many government employees have  abandoned their iron rice bowls, or lifelong jobs, to launch  their own companies to provide services in advertising, real  estate development, computers and consultancy.</p>

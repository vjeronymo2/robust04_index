This may be used for good or evil. It may lead to  democracy, but it may create totalitarianism, institutionalized racism,  theocracy -- you name it.  </P> <P> As Gandhi demonstrated, when people are ready for freedom, their moral force is  more effective than guns. He was, obviously, the man of the century.  </P> <P> JUDITH L. BARNEY  </P> <P> Solana Beach  </P></p>

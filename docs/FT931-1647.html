			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK index futures traded in a tight 20 point range as uncertainty over political developments in Russia continued to cast a shadow over the derivatives sector, Joel Kibazo writes. The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,870, in line with the equity market at the time. It moved forward in a flurry of buying to reach 2,879 by 9am. It then started drifting lower after the early momentum ran out of steam as worries about Russia's future once again became a focus of concern. Sporadic selling saw the June contract continue to fall , trading at 2,854 by lunch time, before bargain hunting ahead of the opening on Wall Street resulted in it bouncing back to stand level with the day's opening. The early weakness in New York saw independent traders once again turn sellers of the June contract but this was countered towards the close by a bout of short covering. The June contract closed at 2,870, up 18 on Monday's close and in line with its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 9 points. Turnover was a reasonable 9,629 lots. A big trade by James Capel dominated the session in traded options. It was reported to have accounted for the majority of the day's business in the Euro FT-SE 100 option which totalled 8,911 lots. It traded 5,694. Glaxo was the busiest stock option at 1,517 lots.</p>

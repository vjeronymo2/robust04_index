			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On his Cape road show today, National Party [NP]  leader F.W. de Klerk said that he hoped last-gasp efforts to get  the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] into the election process would  succeed even at this late hour. Mr. de Klerk wound up his road  show in the Strand this afternoon. Conrad Burke reports.    [Begin recording] [Burke] Mr. de Klerk, looking confident,  took his road show to Kraaifontein, one of a belt of suburbs  which edge onto the farmlands north of the Cape Flats. One of  the themes he pressed home today was that the National Party  needed every vote, and that a stayaway vote would benefit the  ANC [African National Congress].    [De Klerk] We need every vote because the Western Cape,  where  we will win, must also help us to win throughout South Africa.    [Burke] Today's campaign followed the same pattern as  yesterday's. At most venues there was a small ANC presence. We  heard reports that ANC structures here have worked hard these  past few days restraining ANC members to ensure a degree of  fairness in the campaign, particularly after the ugly incidents  in the northern Cape this week.    Covering the De Klerk road show in the Cape heat wave with  its frequent stops in long distances can take it out of even the  most resilient of journalists. But the organizers have  organized a luxury air conditioned bus fitted with one of the  journalist's most favorite companion, a cooler box.    It was at one of the retirement meccas, the Strand, that Mr.  de Klerk referred to ongoing initiatives to win the Inkatha  Freedom Party's [IFP) participation in the April elections,  particularly in Natal. He said the absence of the IFP at the  polls would play into the hands of the ANC.    [De Klerk] I, therefore, still have some hope that  discussions which is [as heard] taking place between for in  stance some of our spokesmen and spokesmen on behalf of the Zulu  king, and discussions which is to take place as we read in the  news on Tuesday between Mr. Mandela and Chief Minister  Buthelezi, that those discussions will be fruitful so that also  the Inkatha Freedom Party can become involved in this new  dispensation.    [Burke] One of the features of the De Klerk road show in the  western Cape was the absence of violent confrontation. Wherever  we went there was an ANC presence, but the active ingredient was  one of friendly competition, and the ANC here has put a lot of  effort into ensuring that this campaign went freely and fairly,  and this augers well for the elections in the Western Cape.    Later this evening Mr. de Klerk had a one and a quarter hour  meeting at Tuynhuys with the Organization of African Unity's  [OAU] secretary general, Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim.    [De Klerk] I had confidence after our discussion that the  OAU  is supportive of what is happening in South Africa, that it is  approaching our problems very correctly in a sense of not trying  to interfere in any way.    [Salim] We have a vested interest in ensuring a peaceful  process. We have a vested interest in ensuring the emergence of  a new South Africa, a South Africa which will continue to play  an important role within the African family. [end recording]</p>

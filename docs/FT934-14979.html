			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Greenspan warns against cutting Fed autonomy ATTEMPTS by Congress to reduce the independence of the US Federal Reserve would be a 'major mistake,' Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, warned yesterday. He was reacting to proposals by a congressional committee to make regional Fed presidents political appointees. Mr Greenspan said the Fed's structure reflected a fine balance between federal and regional, public and private interests. More political control over interest rates would 'impart an inflationary bias to the economy and could lead to instability, recession, and economic stagnation'. He argued that most countries were taking steps, or considering action, to increase the independence of their central banks. Mr Greenspan did, however, concede that greater efforts were needed to lift the pace at which women and minorities were promoted to senior posts within the Fed system. The Fed chairman was giving testimony at a congressional hearing called by Mr Henry Gonzalez, the Democratic chairman of the house banking committee. Mr Gonzalez has proposed legislation that would give President Bill Clinton power to appoint the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, subject to confirmation by the Senate. The regional presidents play an important role in US monetary policy because, in rotation, they hold five of the 12 seats on the Federal Open Market Committee, the body that sets US short-term interest rates. The rest are held by the seven Washington-based Fed governors. Under current rules, regional presidents are elected by the boards of the regional Fed banks. A majority of directors of these boards are elected by local private-sector banks. Mr Gonzalez and many other legislators say this makes the Fed an undemocratic and unaccountable institution. It is the only branch of government where private citizens are allowed to play an important role in determining public policy. Mr Greenspan has been careful to maintain cordial relations with the Clinton administration, which shows no sign of supporting congressional initiatives to reduce the Fed's independence. However, Republicans are also uneasy about the Fed's anomalous structure. At yesterday's hearing, Mr Jim Leach, the ranking Republican member of the banking committee, said the present system was 'indefensible'. He drew attention to the Fed's regulatory responsibilities, and said it was unseemly that private-sector bankers were effectively regulating themselves. He opposed Mr Gonzalez's proposed reform, arguing that public accountability could be assured by the less drastic step of making the Fed governors (who are appointed by the White House) responsible for appointing the regional presidents. Mr Greenspan rejected Mr Leach's proposal, arguing that it was unwise to tamper with a system working well. Under present rules, Fed governors confirmed the appointment of regional Fed presidents and, if necessary, could demand their resignation.</p>

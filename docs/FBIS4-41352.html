			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; Edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] According to Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, a  threat to democracy in Ukraine stems from some increasingly  aggressive left-wing forces.    In a televised address Wednesday [29 June] night, he  denounced what he described as madness in Ukraine and called for  efforts in support of democracy in the Republic.    He also warned that the struggle for power in Ukraine could  lead to disaster and called for an end to extremism.    He emphasized that Ukraine was pursuing the course, chosen  at  the referendum of 1 December 1991, when more than 90 pct of  Ukraine's citizens favored independence.    Kravchuk said he believes there is nothing more important  than to create an incentive for production and development.    At the same time, he regretted that no effort was currently  being spared to set the top bodies of power at loggerheads and  find contradictions between the president, the premier, and the  parliament's speaker.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / The European Market: Leading players weigh up costs of an EC base - Michiyo Nakamoto assesses the complex forces affecting semiconductor manufacturers in Europe IN THE Saxon town of Braunschweig, near Hanover, the ritual sake barrel was hammered open and toasts were exchanged in proper Japanese style, as Toshiba Semiconductor GmbH last month celebrated its tenth anniversary in Europe. Several hundred yards away LSI Logic, the US semiconductor manufacturer, is preparing to move out of its state-of-the-art semiconductor plant and transfer production to Japan. LSI's plant, like that of its neighbour, is an assembly and testing facility, although it specialises in customised microchips rather than memories which are Toshiba's main product. The markedly different fate of the two plants reflects the complex forces affecting semiconductor manufacturers in Europe. On the one hand, high labour costs, lack of supporting infrastructure and a weak customer base are seen by some manufacturers, including Philips and Siemens, as big obstacles to manufacturing in the European Community. But companies such as Toshiba, Motorola and NEC claim that the strategic advantage of being located in Europe outweighs the costs. The foreign companies have not necessarily been reaping the profits from their European operations. However, NEC and Toshiba, the world's largest and second largest semiconductor manufacturers respectively, which have both been in Europe for 10 years, and Motorola, the world's fourth largest semiconductor company with a 25-year history in the region, are all expanding their facilities. Intel, the US group, and Mitsubishi and Hitachi of Japan, are also building production facilities within the EC. Philips, however, the largest European semiconductor manufacturer, has moved assembly work to Asia for cost reasons, as has Siemens. They have left behind only high-end fabrication operations which require close contact with European R&amp;D facilities. Despite these differences, there are some common difficulties that face any semiconductor manufacturer in the EC. For example, manufacturing costs are higher than in the US, Japan or elsewhere in Asia. Mr Heinz Hagmeister, head of the semiconductor division at Philips, says: 'The same (semiconductor) plant, of the same size, making the same product in the same production volumes will have 10 to 20 per cent higher costs in Europe than its identical sisters in the US and Japan, and more than 30 per cent higher costs than an identical plant in a newly industrialised country.' European plant operators work fewer hours than their counterparts elsewhere, so companies in the region need to employ more operators to produce the same volume. Even semiconductor plants in Scotland, where labour costs are level with the US and Japan and labour regulations are more flexible than on the Continent, have higher costs because of the lack of a European equipment base and of high quality materials. Most semiconductor manufacturing equipment must be imported from the US and Japan and attract an import duty of 4 to 11 per cent. The lack of Europe-based equipment manufacturers also means that semiconductor companies must keep a costly inventory of spare parts. Maintenance is another problem. 'If you get into trouble with machinery it takes time to get expert help. In the US you get overnight assistance,' says Mr Laurent Bousson, corporate vice president of manufacturing at SGS-Thomson. Europe also lacks suppliers of the extremely pure chemicals needed by manufacturers. Shipping these from Japan can double or triple the cost of a unit produced. Another worry is that there are few opportunities for manufacturers to innovate or develop leading edge technologies in Europe. While many US and Japanese computer and electronics manufacturers locate in the EC, new products using the latest technology, such as notebook PCs, laptops and hand-held TVs, are generally not introduced there first. Mr Hagmeister says: 'This handicap for European semiconductor manufacturers will obviously increase as more of their customers emigrate either because they themselves suffer from the higher European costs of manufacture or because they themselves experience a lack of market pull from their customers.' Mr Tsuyoshi Kawanishi, of Toshiba predicts that 'our customers will increasingly move their manufacturing to South-east Asia.' However, views are divided over whether the benefits of being in Europe outweigh the costs. Local manufacturers can respond more quickly to market trends and customer requirements. Demand for locally produced components by customers who themselves need to meet EC local content rules is another incentive. European-based manufacturers also need to be close to their R&amp;D facilities. SGS-Thomson, for example, makes advanced products in Europe, but 'when the product matures we move it to the Asia-Pacific region', says Mr Bousson Many foreign companies believe productivity gains and automation can offset the disadvantages of manufacturing in Europe. Both NEC and Motorola say productivity at their UK fabrication plants is competitive with other regions. For companies which have a base in the US or Japan that serves as their main profits source and as a driving force for innovation, the difficulties encountered in Europe are perhaps surmountable. But without the necessary infrastructure, competitive costs for supplies and market influence, the manufacturing environment in Europe may be most cruel to indigenous semiconductor companies, which wonder whether the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- REGIONAL LABOUR COSTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- As % of US costs                       Direct labour costs      Indirect labour costs*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Europe                                 88                        115 Asia/Pacific                           18                         35 Japan                                  88                         77 Mexico                                 11                         45  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: US semiconductor manufacturers        *Includes pay and benefits  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Trial of French mercenary starts Veteran French mercenary leader Bob Denard went on trial in Paris yesterday for leading an ill-fated invasion of the then-Marxist African state of Benin in 1977, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Denard, 63, who returned from exile in South Africa last month to give himself up to French authorities, was sentenced in his absence in 1991 to five years' jail for the failed invasion in which three Benin soldiers and two mercenaries were killed.</p>

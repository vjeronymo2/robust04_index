			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev believes  that this summer the G-7 summit in Naples will discuss the  gradual transformation of the G-7 into a G-8, because Russia  will join full-scale discussions of the political problems. He  made the statement Monday following the talks with Japanese  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata.    Kozyrev said he had discussed the problem with Hata. The  Japanese side reacted positively, he said.    Kozyrev said that in Moscow, on the initiative of the  Japanese side, the issue was discussed on signing a peace treaty  which would include the territorial problem. "We do not give up  on the problem. It will be discussed in detail on the basis of  the Tokyo Declaration at the talks to be held by deputy foreign  ministers, he said.    Kozyrev said that the territorial problem is not the sole  issue in the Russian-Japanese talks. We have discussed  bilateral and international problems and agreed to raise the  level of economic cooperation; to work on, before the visit to  Moscow by Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the draft  agreement on supporting small and medium business; and to  continue the talks on strategic stability, he said. We also  discussed the cases of violations along the Russian border by  Japanese fishermen and agreed to cooperate in solving the  problem.    For his part, Hata said that Kozyrev had handed over to him  a  personal message from Russian President Yeltsin, who invited  Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa to visit Moscow. The date of  the visit will be set following the consultations with the  Russian side, said Hata.    Hata spoke in support of the earliest signing of a peace  treaty. But first we need to settle the territorial problem  which is impossible without the support of the Russian and  Japanese peoples, he said.    He said that Japan gives its backing to the course of  reforms  in Russia.</p>

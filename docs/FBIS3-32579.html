During his short visit to Caracas  following an official six-day visit to Brazil and en route to  Colombia, Lage met with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel  Burelli Rivas and other authorities.    In statements to the media in Caracas, Carlos Lage said the  accusations of human rights abuse in Cuba are unjustified and  just a part of Washington's harassment policy against Cuba.    Upon commenting on the changes taking place on the island,  the Cuban vice president said that his country does not intend  to become capitalist but to adapt itself to world conditions and  perfect its socialist model.    On 9 February Vice President Lage will begin an official  two-day visit to Colombia on the invitation of President Cesar  Gaviria, with whom he will meet in Santa Fe de Bogota, as well  as with several ministers of Gaviria's administration and with  representatives of the National Industrialists Association of  Colombia.</p>

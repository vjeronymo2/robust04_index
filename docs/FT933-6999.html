			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone deals Much of the activity in Vodafone, the second best performer in the FT-SE 100 Index over the past fortnight, came from two exceptionally large trades carried out in mid-afternoon. The first a block of 6.3m shares dealt at 553 1/2 p, and the second a block of 3m at the same price. Yesterday the stock lost 9 to 553p. Vodafone shares have risen by more than 14 per cent in the two weeks, as cellular stocks benefited from a rerating after the AT&amp;T bid for McCaw, the US cellular group. The big US institutions were seen as keen buyers of Vodafone, while some of the UK market's leading analysts have been busy promoting the shares in the past few sessions. Activity in Vodafone yesterday was believed to be US-sourced. MB-Caradon was steady at 314p amid talk that the company will soon announce a one-for-four rights issue at 280p a share, to fund its acquistion of RTZ's Pillar division. RTZ firmed 2 to 698p. Among transport stocks, the departure of the chairman of Union Railways, the British Rail subsidiary responsible for the Channel tunnel rail link, hit Eurotunnel shares, sending them down 17 to 444p. A decline on the Hong Kong market and renewed worries about the recent poor results from the Hang Seng Bank subsidiary saw HSBC dip 18 more to 707p on good turnover of 4.5m. The concern about profitability in the Far East also took its toll of Standard Chartered shares, which dropped 18 to 943p. Lloyds Bank, affected last week by switching operations, staged a minor rally to close 5 up at 533p. National Westminster rose a similar amount to 486p. Royal Bank of Scotland eased a penny to 289p after Scottish Equitable confirmed it was the big seller of the shares last Friday. National Express was in demand ahead of next month's interim figures, appreciating 4 to 261p. The oil sector was boosted by another session of above-average turnover in stocks such as Lasmo and Calor. The latter was up 7 at 256p, after 258p, following a buy recommendation issued by Hoare Govett, whose oil team described the shares as a 'cheap income play with improving fundamentals'. Lasmo continued to attract strong speculative support as last week's takeover stories and talk of a general restructuring in the UK exploration and production sub-sector continued to circulate in the marketplace. The stock settled 2 1/2 higher at 139p on turnover of 4.6m, well above usual levels of activity. Volume last Friday reached a very substantial 14m, after a week of unusually high activity, leading many oil sector specialists to the view that something may be up in the sector. Enterprise Oil, in spite of a push from one of the market's leading broking firms yesterday morning, suffered later in the day, eventually settling a net 3 off at 428p. News from Aran Energy's drilling operations in the Celtic Sea came as a disappointment to the market, the shares sliding 4 1/2 to 31 1/2 p. Shares in French theme park Euro Disney came under pressure, losing 3 per cent of their value after the chairman warned of high levels of debt and current difficult trading. The stock ended 20 down at 620p. Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas Capital Markets believes the company will 'need an injection of finance to keep it going'. Talk that the chairman of Ladbroke may be thinking of retiring, following weekend press reports that were denied by the company, along with the appointment of a chief executive for Ladbroke's Texas Homecare subsidiary, put the shares under pressure. They fell 9 to 209p in active trading of 6m. Market watchers pointed out that the appointment of a new CEO at Texas, who is to be on Ladbroke's main board, suggested that the company planned to continue its involvement in the Do-It-Yourself market, which is currently suffering difficult market conditions. Continued fears that Rank Organisation's holiday business will lose out to increasingly cheaper overseas holidays once again dogged the shares, leaving them 12 cheaper at 770p. On the other hand, the current price war in overseas holidays for next year is expected to boost earnings at Airtours, which put on 5 at 379p. Confirmation that the Hoar family had sold a 22.57 per cent stake in USM-quoted Hoskins, the Leicester-based brewing, public houses and hotels group, boosted trading in the stock, sending the shares ahead. A majority of the holding was bought by a team led by entrepreneur Mr Howard Hodgson, and the rest placed with institutions. The shares jumped 20 to 76p. Radio shares continued to benefit from a Smith New Court review on the sector. Capital Radio added 10 at 225p, while Chiltern Radio advanced 8 to 78p and USM-quoted Metro firmed 5 to 190p. Nervous trading in Weir Group, ahead of Thursday's interim figures, left the shares 14 off at 351p. Continued worries about the future of its proposed Pounds 250m regional jets joint venture with Taiwan continued to overhang British Aerospace, weakening the shares by 21p at one stage. They subsequently picked up to finish 14 down on the day at 435p on talk of 'some progress' being made in talks in Taiwan. BAe shares were hit last week by reports of outstanding differences between the two sides in the financing of the project. Profit-taking in Smiths Industries left the stock 10 lighter at 375p.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Letter: Transport tax that makes sense Sir, Re your survey of the aerospace industry (September 2) there is a point regarding the future of European transport that needs to be clarified. Your article points out that 'the Commission is planning to introduce Value Added Tax on intra-Community airline tickets . . . at around 9 or 10 per cent'. This may, out of context, seem excessive. However, in the context of the wider European transport sector and its future harmonisation, it makes good sense. Moreover a number of the Community railways have for some time been subjected to this form of community taxation. Similarly, the airlines have been exempted for excise duties that most European railways have not. Community-wide harmonisation is also being negotiated in this area. While we sympathise with the European airlines, in the wider context we can only commend and welcome the Commission's initiative in attempting to create an environment that encourages rather than distorts competition among all modes of intra-Community transport. Erik Vandenbroele, secretary-general, Community of European Railways, Brussels, Belgium</p>

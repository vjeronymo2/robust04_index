			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Improved margins lift US toy retailer TOYS 'R' Us, the rapidly expanding US toy retailer, yesterday reported a 25 per cent improvement in net earnings for the first quarter of 1993, to Dollars 35.4m, or 12 cents a share, reflecting stronger margins for products sold. A year earlier, the company posted net profits of Dollars 28.3m, or 10 cents a share. Sales advanced to Dollars 1.29bn in the latest quarter, from Dollars 1.17bn a year earlier. Mr Charles Lazarus, chairman and chief executive, said comparable toy store sales in the US rose 2 per cent in the quarter, with strong increases in basic toys and video games. Same-store sales also improved in Spain, Canada and the UK. In Germany and France, however, local economic conditions put pressure on sales and comparable store sales fell. The company's Kids 'R' Us clothing stores had flat store sales in the quarter, but operating earnings rose significantly, reflecting 'continued improvement in inventory management and expense control,' Mr Lazarus said. The company plans to open 40 toy stores in the US and 60 stores internationally, including its first stores in Belgium, The Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland and Australia. It already operates 540 toy stores in the US, as well as 167 international toy stores and 215 clothing stores. Tiffany, the New York-based jewellery group, posted a sharp drop in first-quarter net income on modestly-improved sales, reflecting higher operating expenses and consumer caution in the face of weak economies around the world. Net income for the first three months of 1993 fell to Dollars 1m, or 7 cents a share, from Dollars 3.1m, or 20 cents a year earlier. Sales rose to Dollars 109.5m from Dollars 107.2m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sevastopol, 9 May -- Several thousand people  gathered in the center of the town on the occasion of Victory  Day. A Rukh activist in the crowd raised a Ukrainian flag, but  a group of unknown persons tore it away from him.    Activists from the Russian Movement of Crimea [RDK] and the  Russian Movement of Sevastopol threw eggs at Ukrainian sailors  and students of the military institute who were marching  triumphantly along the town's central avenue on the occasion of  the holiday.    In an interview on French television and with local  journalists, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov said in part: "A  normal situation will be preserved in Crimea because this  completely corresponds to the interests of the people of the  Republic of Crimea. Everything will be calm here. Economic  reforms have been put in motion and are progressing. Nobody  will be able to provoke us from the outside".    Asked which status he is requesting for Crimea, he said: "We  are not requesting. This timescale is not used in relation to a  people. We are defending our inalienable right to resolve our  economic problems and to fully serve our own economic interests."</p>

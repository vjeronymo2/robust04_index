			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Lift in growth fails to lighten Swedish gloom On the face of it, Sweden's economy, profoundly shaken by a three-year recession, is firmly back on a growth path. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development yesterday forecast a 2.7 per cent rise in gross national product this year, and almost 3 per cent in 1995. Yet last week, Svenska Dagbladet, the respected daily newspaper, saw fit to hoist the headline 'Dance of death' over a leading article on the economic policy debate dominating the campaign for the September general election. 'The Swedish economy is heading for a crash,' the article warned. 'Perhaps not through a dramatic fall that overnight reduces Sweden to a third class nation, but through a hasty negative spiral driven by the catastrophic state finances.' It added: 'An economic boom is not going to save Sweden.' This dramatic message has been echoed in recent weeks by senior Swedish businessmen, by the financial markets, and by foreign analyses of the economy. All have in common the politically unpalatable conclusion that the painful upheavals and reforms of the past three years have not sufficiently come to grips with the structural problems blamed on the famously large state sector. The focus of their concern is the long-term threat posed by a budget deficit which in the current budget year is set to total about 14 per cent of GDP, and the associated phenomenon of the fastest-growing debt among OECD countries. Foreign debt has shot up from the equivalent of just under 56 per cent of GDP in 1989 to a forecast 82 per cent next year. Despite three years of market reform policies under the right-centre government of Mr Carl Bildt, state spending still accounts for 70 per cent of GNP. This figure is bloated by the cost of financing record unemployment totalling 14 per cent of the workforce through some of Europe's most generous jobless benefits. The budget deficit is set to decline significantly - but almost half is structural and will not be cured by economic growth. Worries about the public finances have already had their effects in the markets. Swedish interest rates, although much lower than a year ago, remain at a significant premium over German rates, reflecting concern both about the public finances and lingering fears that inflation may rear its head again. This, in turn, has continued to damp much needed investment. But the outlook may not necessarily so bleak as Svenska Dagbladet suggested. Mr Bildt's government, though less inclined to advocate austerity in an election period, is fully committed to furthering the process of structural reform if it returns to power. The opposition Social Democrats - who hold a comfortable lead in opinion polls - are meanwhile making an election issue out of the dire state of the public finances and promising tough action on the deficit. Sweden's competitive position has already improved greatly over the past two years. Its powerful phalanx of multinational companies are well placed to take advantage of falling trade barriers and a resurgence of world growth. However, those raising the warning cry are concerned that the Social Democratic emphasis on selective tax rises, coupled with the party's commitment to its huge natural constituency in the public sector, could stymie progress towards further trimming the welfare state and encouraging private sector growth. 'Dismantling the public sector is likely to prove very difficult politically,' cautioned Moody's Investor Service in its latest appraisal of Sweden. 'Without the flexibility needed to compete in international markets, however, the economy may not be capable of sustaining current living standards over the long term.'</p>

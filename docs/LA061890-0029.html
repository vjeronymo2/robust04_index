			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET RADICALS THREATEN WALKOUT AT PARTY CONGRESS  </P> <P> Radicals belonging to the Soviet Communist Party's Democratic Platform warned  Sunday that they will walk out of a crucial party congress if it does not adopt  fundamental reforms, including the abandonment of communism as a party goal.  </P> <P> A national conference of the Democratic Platform, which wants a real end to the  party's monopoly of political power and pluralism in party ideology, said that  if its demands are not met, it will break with the Communist Party and form  another, the first such split since the time of V. I. Lenin, the Bolshevik  leader.  </P> <P> "The Communist Party will be denounced by the masses in the nearest future, and  if the Democratic Platform remains in it, then it will certainly join the party  in its collapse," Vladimir N. Lysenko, one of the faction's leaders, said in  explaining the group's decision.  </P> <P> A resolution adopted at the weekend conference calls on the party to "renounce  communism as the objective of the Soviet Communist Party and proclaim as its  goal the building of a democratic society on the principles of freedom, justice  and solidarity."  </P> <P> It blames the country's multiple political and economic crises on the  "inconsistency, indecisiveness and either incompetence or unwillingness of the  leading (party) structures to carry out radical reforms."  </P> <P> The Democratic Platform will also call for the party's withdrawal from the  military, the police and other security forces, including the KGB, an end to  the official status that party committees have at Soviet enterprises and  organizations and a free press.  </P> <P> It wants the party to become a parliamentary party, seeking power only in  elections and exercising it only through legislative and executive bodies.  Anticipating its own break, the Democratic Platform calls for the distribution  of Communist Party property among the country's emerging political movements.  </P> <P> But Lysenko, a delegate to the congress, predicted that the party, after a  72-year monopoly of power, will still prove unable to undertake such a  fundamental renewal.  </P> <P> "As a result, the Democratic Platform will split from the Communist Party to  form a new party," he said. "Still, it is very important for us to come to the  congress because of those millions of Communists who still do not understand  the essence of the Soviet Communist Party."  </P> <P> As a matter of tactics, the 100 members of the Democratic Platform who won  election as delegates will remain at the congress, starting July 2, until the  end to use it as a forum to argue their positions and then try to take  delegations from several of the Soviet Union's constituent republics --  including Estonia, Georgia and Moldavia -- with them as they leave.  </P> <P> "The time has come to quit the party, proclaim it immoral and set up another  organization, an alternative," Igor Chubais, another leader, said as the  majority of delegates to the conference voted to quit if the Democratic  Platform's proposals are not adopted.  </P> <P> The group believes it might draw as many as 600,000 members -- a fraction of  the 18 million members of the Communist Party but enough, organizers say, to  compete in most urban elections. Under a constitutional amendment sponsored by  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, multi-party politics has been allowed in the  Soviet Union since March.  </P> <P> According to its own polls, the "political theses" put forward by the  Democratic Platform are more widely supported than the party's official draft  platform, and the faction's leaders believe that they have the sympathy, if not  the active support, of 40% of party members and a majority outside the party.  </P> <P> But whether the Democratic Platform's best known supporters -- Boris N.  Yeltsin, the populist president of the Russian Republic, and Mayors Gavriil  Popov of Moscow and Anatoly Sobchak of Leningrad -- will quit the Communist  Party and join the new group remains uncertain.  </P> <P> An analysis of poll results by political scientists at the Moscow Higher Party  School, the effective headquarters of the Democratic Platform, said that its  support is far from solid, even among sympathizers.  </P> <P> "A significant number of party members, regarding the Democratic Platform with  approval, do not share many of its ideas," the analysis warned, "but only  support the fact that an alternative movement has sprung up within the Soviet  Communist Party."  </P> <P> The character and shape of the new party is also unresolved, and organizers  said they will probably not hold a founding congress before October.  </P> <P> Although many supporters of the Democratic Platform would like it to become a  social democratic party in the West European tradition, Vyachelsav  Shostakovsky, the group's chairman and rector of the Moscow Higher Party  School, which trains Communist Party officials, said he thinks that another  philosophy and form will have to be developed.  </P> <P> "We do not have the roots or the traditions here in Russia for a social  democratic party," Shostakovsky said. "It is difficult to predict, with so many  uncertainties, how things will turn out."  </P> <P> Formation of the Democratic Platform early this year brought demands from  conservatives within the Communist Party leadership for the expulsion of its  members, and the party's ruling Politburo set in motion a purge two months ago  to "cleanse" the party ranks before the congress.  </P> <P> After a few well-publicized dismissals and forced resignations, however, little  seems to have come of the effort, though the Democratic Platform managed to  capture only 2% of the 4,700 seats in the election of delegates to the party  congress.  </P> <P> The mainstream Moscow party organization, whose million members make it the  largest party group in the country, meanwhile published a pre-congress platform  of its own on Sunday, sharply criticizing the national leadership for drifting  into "an ideological and organizational crisis."  </P></p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Timeshare group cuts jobs: Controversial holiday company halts high-pressure sales promotions and closes main office HOLIDAY Ownership Exchange, a UK-based timeshare holiday operator is shedding 150 jobs and has closed its main office in London because of the impact of the recession on sales. The office has been operating since 1985, and the hard-sell tactics of its staff have helped make the company one of Europe's most successful timeshare operators. The lease on the large Leicester Square premises was due to expire at the end of this month. The operation has had a chequered history following complaints from customers about hard-sell tactics, but the reasons for the closure were economic according to Mr Ray Rantell, managing director. He said: 'It is a matter of mortgages and jobs. People are just not willing to make a financial commitment.' People had still come forward for the presentations at Leicester Square, but had been unwilling to sign up. 'The high cost of running such a big operation in the West End is no longer economic. That era, sadly, has come to an end.' The company will continue to run its 600-apartment Clube Praia da Oura holiday complex near Albufeira on Portugal's Algarve coast, which has 14,000 timeshare members, and timeshare holidays will still be marketed on the Continent and through alternative outlets in Britain. The loss of about 150 full-time jobs include 140 staff at the company's marketing office at Ilford, Essex and 12 sales administration staff at Leicester Square. In addition, a further 70 self-employed sales consultants will lose their posts. Other staff from Leicester Square who handled member support services are being moved to Ilford. Mr Rantell's regret at the closure may not be shared by many of his customers who faced a two-hour sales pitch at the Leicester Square office. Hundreds of complaints were made by people who had received unsolicited mailshots saying they had won valuable prizes provided they attended the presentation. They were then subjected to a high-pressure sales promotion before discovering that their 'prize' was not always what they had been led to believe. The Office of Fair Trading issued a statement in 1990 threatening to take legal action against the company because of misleading advertisements, and the organisation agreed to change its marketing practices. More recently, the company has been the subject of investigation concerning a 'win-a-car' promotion at London mainline rail stations which required detailed personal information. Mr John Lamidey, assistant data protection registrar, said he had launched an investigation into the campaign following complaints from the public. He added: 'When data to be stored on a computer is gathered, the subject has to be made aware exactly who is gathering the data, for what purpose it is to be used and whether it will be disclosed to a third person. On the face of it this promotion meets none of those criteria.' Complaints were also received by the Advertising Standards Authority. Mr Rantell said the promotion had been stopped, together with all other promotion campaigns in Britain. However, Holiday Ownership Exchange would continue its travel club, newsletter and exchange scheme.</p>

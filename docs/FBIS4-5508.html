			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- A joint meeting of the  Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,  political parties and public organisations for accelerating the  independent and peaceful reunification of the country by  thoroughly implementing "10-point programme of the great unity  of the whole nation for the reunification of the country" put  forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song took place at  the People's Palace of Culture on Monday.    Attending the meeting were Kang Song-san, Politburo member  of  the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and premier  of the Administration Council, Kim Pyong-sik, vice-president of  the DPRK and chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean  Social Democratic Party, and other representatives of political  parties and public organisations and officials concerned.    Yang Hyong-sop, alternate Politburo member of the WPK  Central  Committee and chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly,  delivered a report at the meeting.    The reporter said the 10-point programme of the great unity  of the whole nation which was authored by the great leader and  adopted as a joint action programme of the nation for peaceful  reunification, for the unshakable independent and patriotic  stand and fair and aboveboard stand running through all its  points, serves as the most reasonable and feasible grand  political programme of national unity and a grand charter of  national reunification, which is acceptable to all who truly  love the country and the nation and want the reunification of  the country.    All Koreans should, above all, get united as one nation,  irrespective of differences in ideology, idea and social system  and occupation, in order to accomplish the historic cause of  national reunification, the reporter said.    Stressing the need to arrange an arena of nationwide  dialogue  where the will and demand of the 70 million fellow countrymen  could be brought together to closely unite all the Korean  nationals in the North, the South and overseas in hearty  response to the 10-point programme of the great unity of the  whole nation, the reporter said:    All the Koreans, conscious of their heavy national  responsibility and obligation to shape the destiny of the nation  by themselves, must confirm through open-hearted dialogue that  they are fellow countrymen who cannot live separated from each  other and seek a detailed way of achieving national unity,  transcending the ideology and system as the same nation.    Out of this desire, we courteously propose to the South  Korean authorities, political parties, organizations and  individual figures and overseas compatriots to have a national  conference for seeking a way for great unity of the whole nation  in Pyongyang or Seoul on the occasion of August 15 this year, a  year before the 50th anniversary of national liberation.    It may be a round-table conference to be participated in by  the authorities and representatives of political parties and  social organizations and individuals of the North and the South  and representatives of overseas compatriots on an equal footing.    The participants may have an open-hearted discussion of  practical measures for achieving a great unity of the whole  nation, common tasks of the nation arising as prerequisites to  realising national reunification in the '90s and other matters  of concern for the whole nation.    I consider it necessary for the successful convocation of  the  national conference to form a preparatory committee of the  national conference with five representatives each from the  North, South and overseas.    We think that it is desirable to have the first meeting of  the preparatory committee in Pyongyang or Seoul in mid- May.    We, availing ourselves of this opportunity, hold that the  South Korean authorities must discontinue the nuclear war  exercises and stop seeking an "international cooperation system"  for the great unity of the whole nation, proceeding from the  independent stand of the nation, to create a climate favourable  to the convocation of the national conference.    Speeches were made at the joint meeting by Director Chong  Mun-san of the Secretariat of the Administration Council;  Vice-Chairman of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Korean Social  Democratic Party Kim Yong-ho; Director of the Secretariat of the  C.C., the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the  Fatherland Yu Ho-chun; and Chairman of the C.C., the League of  Socialist Working Youth of Korea Choe Yong-hae.    They urged the South Korean authorities to give up their  foolish intention to solve something by relying on outside  forces and respond to the proposal for the convocation of the  historical national conference, accepting the 10-point programme  of the great unity of the whole nation.    A letter to the South Korean authorities, political parties,  organizations and individual figures and compatriots overseas  was adopted at the meeting.</p>

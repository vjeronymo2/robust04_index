			<p>BFN     [Text] Crude oil is now being produced at Changcheng Oil  Field at the south end of Horqin Grasslands. This indicates  that Liaohe Oil Field has made a new breakthrough in prospecting  oil and gas deposits in Horqin Region and also indicates that  the oil-deposit region of Horqin as a whole will become an  important area of Liaohe Oil Field in developing its oil  resources. Throughout the year of prospecting, five wells were  drilled in Changcheng Oil Field and gushed with varying degrees  of oil and gas. Of these wells, the daily output of two exceeds  30 tonnes.</p>

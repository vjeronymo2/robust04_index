			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Arts: Death of a Faun - Theatre His jump could hang in the air and/or cover the stage. Able to seem both androgynous and animal, he was a vital symbol of the newness of the 20th century. A shy iconoclast, his liaison with Diaghilev was openly homosexual. His ballets, L'Apres-midi d'un faune, Jeux, and Le sacre du printemps were all ground-breaking works of early modernism, and presented aspects of sex that were new to the stage. Lady Ottoline Morrell told him (possibly her brightest remark) that when he danced he was not a man - he was an idea. Maybe no one who saw Nijinsky dance is left alive today, but the legend is as large as ever. All the above happened before he was 25, and before the First World War. So did his surprise marriage, which earned him instant dismissal from the ballet company that had brought him world fame, and permanent exile from Diaghilev's inner circle. The last part of his legend - madness - followed. In 1919, he was diagnosed as a schizophrenic, in which condition he remained until his death in 1950. Even the mad Nijinsky remains an idea. On the one hand, he identified with God; on the other, he was often both obscene and violent. Both sides connect to his creative career. Had his psychological abnormality been responsible for his creative originality? Or had he been Trilby to Diaghilev's Svengali? Death of a Faun, by David Pownall, is set in 1929, after Nijinsky has received news of Diaghilev's death. A one-man show for the ex-dancer Nicholas Johnson, it is conceived as a 90-minute mad scene. No violence or obscenities here - but bags of martyrdom. The real Nijinsky did on one occasion identify with the crucified Christ, but the God who he wants to be in his diaries is the Creator. And, when he spoke of dancing, he suggested that it was an exalting experience. But Johnson-Nijinsky, harping on the pain of dancing, identifies only with Christ on the cross. And, of course, he makes the connection to Petrushka (who is first seen hanging in a crucified position). The ex-dancer whom Johnson and Pownall put on stage is less like Nijinsky than like the more recent Gelsey Kirkland. Kirkland, another great dancer whose career ended early, then took to a much more vengeful and self-lacerating career - celebrity autobiography. But why bother to point out how wilfully this play misunderstands Nijinsky? It even mistakes the 'faun' of Nijinsky's ballet (a half-goat rural deity) for a 'fawn' (a young deer); and Johnson performs the steps with the kind of intense facial expression that Nijinsky took pains to delete from his choreography. The real Nijinsky was both more original and more pathetic than this trite diddums, and his legend will survive Death of a Faun. Nicholas Johnson, however, may be doing irreversible damage to his own career. Strain and pain are not what he himself communicated as a dancer. I remember his lyricism and sweet pleasure in dancing for an audience; and I am sad to find him defacing that image. It is better to recall the Mercutio he created in Rudolf Nureyev's 1977 Romeo and Juliet; and he dedicates these performances to Nureyev's memory. At the Orange Tree, Richmond</p>

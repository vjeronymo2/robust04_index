			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Lothar Ruehl: "Field by Field"] </F>   [Text] The combat plane missions of NATO in UN service  draw the line of change in Western policy toward armed mediation  between the parties to the Bosnian war one field further. The  field is still not occupied, even on the battlefield of the six  declared "UN protected areas." However, the situation of the  war has been changed in its quality by the second military  initiative of the alliance after the Sarajevo ultimatum: Even  the air strikes of Gorazde, which are most narrowly limited in  purpose, goals, and means, are a leap ahead by the allies across  the hurdle that has been in place for two years.    It is possible that this second leap will again be too short  in the end, but the air strikes can be continued and expanded to  other situations. A step-by-step expansion of military  interventions, as President Clinton suggested, can reduce the  fan of Serbian opposition and shift the operational risks,  including the psychological pressure of military action, which  is linked with that, to the Serbian troops. This is the only  way to break the dynamism of the Serbian attacks and to  stabilize the situation by military means. This is the  precondition for a solid basis for negotiations. Even though  military force cannot solve political problems if the enemy is  not defeated and the country is not occupied, but it can force a  peace by negotiations, at least for a durable cease-fire.    Whether this effect will come about depends primarily on the  persistence and the effect of the NATO air raids. The military  criterion of the effect in fighting against heavy weapons and  preventing major attacks is also the political criterion of  readiness for an appropriate, limited, if necessary also  continued air war against selected military targets.    Thus, the three problems that the allies have tried to evade  for two years are now confronting NATO head on under more  difficult conditions and pressure of time: The problem of  intervention, the problem of escalation, and the problem of  acceptance in case of protracted fighting by allied forces  beyond their own alliance area. In this respect, the political  quality of NATO will continue to change toward an active  security alliance for crisis management and ending conflicts  beyond its borders.    In Bosnia, the shock of the first attacks from the air is  affecting the Serbs in NATO's favor and in particular also  Belgrade, where one is in reality not counting on an "escalation  of war," because it might undermine Serbian rule over Kosovo and  Vojvodina, destroy the cohesion with Montenegro, bring NATO  combat troops to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia, FYROM] and even to Albania -- which has offered its  ports and airports to NATO -- just as to Bosnia itself and might  thus annul the conquests of territory that the Serbs have made  so far. Military escalation is the last thing that Serbia could  bear. For the nationalist communist Milosevic regime in  Belgrade, this risk is linked with the imminent risk of  survival. In particular, therefore, Belgrade has tried from the  very beginning to use Russia as a power to limit the conflict  for Serbia's security within the borders of the territories  conquered since 1991.    Above all, Russian influence is to protect the endangered  unity of Serbia and Montenegro as the Yugoslav rump state and  the expansion of the borders as much as possible. This has been  recognized in time by Moscow, while the Western governments seem  to have taken the alleged threat of escalation seriously, while  the government and the army command in Pale and in Belgrade have  always shied way for good reason from any military confrontation  with NATO and its main power, the United States.    It was the capital political and strategic mistake of the  Western allies to avoid this experiment with the Serb's  political steadfastness. This renunciation of action was also  of great disadvantage for a pragmatic realpolitik, which was  proved again during the latest NATO air raid: What one could  have achieved alone two years ago now depends on Moscow.  Approval for the mission had to be gained by diplomatic means  from Russia, and an extension of the UN mandate for the  effective protection of the "refuges" is not in sight for the  time being because of Russia's resistance.    NATO and the United States on their own will neither be able  to determine the situation in the Balkans nor to control the  mediation of a compromise. They will have to share their  influence with Russia, with all the consequences resulting for  the treatment of Serbia and Bosnia. A privileged "partnership"  with NATO, as Yeltsin demands it for the military big power  Russia, need not be further considered or criticized in Brussels  -- it is developing on its own from NATO's two-year absence and  from the resulting situation in the Balkans. NATO needs a  strategy of crisis management that is oriented toward action, if  it wants to preserve its interests together with and toward  Russia and to remain effective as an alliance.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Coats Viyella Managers looking for an easy life do not, on the whole, go into textiles. Yet if Coats Viyella is right, textiles companies are enviable in one respect - their ability to pass on raw materials price rises to their customers. It seems that by adding a few cheap frills to a blouse Coats can convince shoppers it is a new product and increase the price to cover higher cotton costs. Coats expresses confidence that it will continue to recover cost increases fully as they work through over the next few months. Given the current negligible inflation in clothing, that would be quite an achievement. The odds are that Coats' UK markets will remain tough, and particularly those related to housing moves, which will make it all the more important to avoid self-inflicted wounds. It was not the only one to be caught off-guard by the changes in women's knitwear fashions but the botched attempt to attract younger women into Jaeger was a dangerous gamble. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the interim figures, for which Coats bears little blame, was the fall in profit from less developed countries. Coats' exposure to fast-growing markets in Latin America and Asia has been one of its main attractions for investors. Yet the nature of Coats' business makes it vulnerable to these economies' fluctuations and even if more stable growth were achieved they would still account for a relatively small proportion of group sales. Investors may have to come to terms with the fact that Coats, like Jaeger, is a mature business.</p>

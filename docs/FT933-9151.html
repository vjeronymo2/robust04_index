			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Letter: Vocational training debate needs answers Sir, Your leader item, 'Leaving school' (August 10), reiterates the never-ending debate without resolution on vocational training. The plethora of reviews and reports has failed miserably in identifying a basic requirement. There is a fundamental need to make business and education interface directly, perhaps statutorily, and with consistent joint funding. The current fragmented and piecemeal initiatives, hyped by lip service and inadequately funded, will leave vocational training as it has been regarded for a hundred years - an activity for the underprivileged. Educationalists and industrialists should stop debating where responsibility lies and jointly commit substantial resources to a long-term strategy for educating and training our future workforce.

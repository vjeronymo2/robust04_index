			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the proposed and direct final approval set forth in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA believes that it is more likely than not that the State has corrected the original disapproval deficiency. Therefore, EPA is taking this final rulemaking action, effective on publication, finding that the State has corrected the deficiency. However, EPA is also providing the public with an opportunity to comment on this final action. If, based on any comments on this action and any comments on EPA's proposed full approval of the State's submittal, EPA determines that the State's submittal is not fully approvable and this final action was inappropriate, EPA will either propose or take final action finding that the State has not corrected the original disapproval deficiency. As appropriate, EPA will also issue an interim final determination or a final determination that the deficiency has not been corrected. Until EPA takes such an action, the application of sanctions will continue to be deferred and or stayed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action does not stop the sanctions clock that started for this area on March 17, 1993. However, this action will defer the application of the offsets sanction and will defer the application of the highway sanction. See 59 FR 39832 (Aug. 4, 1994). If EPA's direct final action fully approving the State's submittal becomes effective, such action will permanently stop the sanctions clock and will permanently lift any applied, stayed or deferred sanctions. If EPA must withdraw the direct final action based on adverse comments and EPA subsequently determines that the State, in fact, did not correct the disapproval deficiency, EPA will also determine that the State did not correct the deficiency and the sanctions consequences described in the sanctions rule will apply. See 59 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 39832, to be codified at 40 CFR 52.31.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. EPA Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is taking interim final action finding that the State has corrected the disapproval deficiency that started the sanctions clock. Based on this action, application of the offset sanction will be deferred and application of the highway sanction will be deferred until EPA's direct final action fully approving the State's submittal becomes effective or until EPA takes action proposing or finally disapproving in whole or part the State submittal. If EPA's direct final action fully approving the State submittal becomes effective, at that time any sanctions clocks will be permanently stopped and any applied, stayed or deferred sanctions will be permanently lifted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because EPA has preliminarily determined that the State has an approvable plan, relief from sanctions should be provided as quickly as possible. Therefore, EPA is invoking the good cause exception under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in not providing an opportunity for comment before this action takes effect. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). EPA believes that notice-and-comment rulemaking before the effective date of this action is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. EPA has reviewed the State's submittal and, through its proposed and direct final action is indicating that it is more likely than not that the State has corrected the deficiency that started the sanctions clock. Therefore, it is not in the public interest to initially impose sanctions or to keep applied sanctions in place when the State has most likely done all that it can to correct the deficiency that triggered the sanctions clock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As previously noted, however, by this action EPA is providing the public with a chance to comment on EPA's determination after the effective date and EPA will consider any comments received in determining whether to reverse such action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, it would be impracticable to go through notice-and comment rulemaking on a finding that the State has corrected the deficiency prior to the rulemaking approving the State's submittal. Therefore, EPA believes that it is necessary to use the interim final rulemaking process to temporarily stay or defer sanctions while EPA completes its rulemaking process on the approvability of the State's submittal. Moreover, with respect to the effective date of this action, EPA is invoking the good cause exception to the 30-day notice requirement of the APA because the purpose of this notice is to relieve a restriction. See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this action from review under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. sections 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action temporarily relieves sources of an additional burden potentially placed on them by the sanctions provisions of the Act. Therefore, I certify that it does not have an impact on any small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental regulations, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Ozone, Volatile organic compounds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Date Signed: August 27, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Felicia Marcus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Regional Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23082 Filed 9&hyph;14&hyph;94; 10:27 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

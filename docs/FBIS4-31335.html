			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 3/6/1994 -- "Mass privatization  will begin by 1 September 1994," said Mircea Cosea, head of the  Governmental Council for Economic Coordination, Strategy, and  Reform.    "We have reached a phase when some successes in the  macro-economic stabilization have been obtained through monetary  instruments," said Reform Minister Mircea Cosea, cited by the  daily ADEVARUL.    The reform minister said that these "fragile" successes must  be consolidated through "substantial measures in the real  economy" with privatization as the most important one.    Privatization will lead "not only to the change of the  ownership structure, but also of the economic structure, of the  industrial structure in the first place," said Minister Cosea.    Beginning 1 September, the ownership certificates previously  granted to the people may be exchanged for shares in commercial  companies.    According to the privatization law, the aggregate value of  the ownership certificates represent 30 percent of the aggregate  nominal capital of all Romanian commercial companies, so far  owned by the state.    The public will have the alternative of keeping these  certificates with the Private Property Fund (FPP) that are going  to act as fund manager, caring for dividend payments.    The public can also chose to sell these certificates on the  market.    The mechanisms of this economic-financial process will be  actuated as soon as the summer with an advertising campaign  meant to introduce to the public the 3,000 companies whose  shares will be offered to the public in exchange for ownership  certificates.    "The most delicate problem is the setting of a value to  these  certificates," said Minister Cosea. At the time being, the  "value" of the certificates is understated on the black market  as well as by the Private Property Fund, opined the minister. A  value closer to reality can be obtained through an accurate  evaluation of the nominal capital of the companies as done by  the end of 1993.</p>

Mrs Ogata told the prime minister that she regarded the refugee problem in Yugoslavia as the worst in Europe since the second world war. The UK has sent medical staff to Yugoslavia at a cost of Pounds 25m. Mr Major promised he would use Britain's EC presidency to persuade other member states to attend a conference on refugees and other humanitarian issues, called by Mrs Ogata in Geneva for July 29. The conference is also likely to be used to press for international action to stop breaches of the Geneva Conventions. Baroness Chalker said reports from Mrs Ogata and from UK officials in the region told of 'the purposeful pinpointing' of Moslems in Bosnia-Hercegovina.

'I don't believe people know how bad it is.'</p>

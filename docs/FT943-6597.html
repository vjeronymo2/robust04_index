			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Books: Dance story for adults AN UNCONVENTIONAL LIFE by Joan Brady Andre Deutsch Pounds 14.99, 213 pages For the performer, dance is the most punishing of all the arts: years of rigorous physical and mental training for, at best, a short-lived, overworked career, or, more likely, failure. But perhaps because of the mix of asceticism, pure aesthetics and absolutist devotion it demands, dancers have always been highly romantic figures. Moira Shearer in The Red Shoes, Noel Streatfield's Ballet Shoes, quicken the pulses of generations of schoolgirls. Now, in Prologue, here is a dance story for adults as evocative and thrilling. Joan Brady is a harrowingly honest writer who won last year's Whitbread prize for her novel about dysfunctional American family life, Theory of War. Her first career, however, was as a dancer: she trained at the San Francisco Ballet School and under Balanchine in the heyday of the New York City Ballet in the 1950s. At 19, she was poised to enter Balanchine's company, and given four days to rehearse his ballet Stars and Stripes. For 72 hours, she searched vainly for a record of the piece, and trembled over the jetes elances and Balanchine's famous perfectionism. On day four, she found the record and was about to begin hours of practice when the door burst open and her mother screamed 'you're nothing but a snivelling little tart . . . you don't even know that silly little part. You'll never know it. You haven't the wit to learn it . . . You look like death on stage. Who wants to watch death? One performance, and that'll be the end of you. You'll never dance. Not ever.' She flunked the performance and a week later walked out of ballet school. She married, had a child, and left America. Did she make a comeback? Could she retrain and get back into shape? Who were the generous dancers who helped her and the jealous ones who hindered her? This superb memoir recaptures the brittle, vengeful milieu of family life which Brady distilled in Theory of War and interlaces it with the powerfully-tense and competitive world of ballet school. Plies and frappes, leotards and legs, the nervous titters and the too-bright looks, teachers like Balanchine and the great ballerina Alexandra Danilova (dressed in old age 'like a Woolworths Christmas tree ornament'): all are scrutinised under Brady's quick, passionate, amused eye. Threading through the book is her relationship with the writer Dexter Masters, with whom she fell in love in 1942 when she was three years old. When he visited her family home, she used to sneak a look at him sleeping in the guest room and vowed that she would marry him. Just before they began an affair in the late 1950s, it had emerged that he had been her mother's lover for years, and that she had destined him to be 'the husband of my old age'. In a deadly serious version of The Graduate, mother and daughter fought out a battle which ran in parallel to the elations and exhaustions of ballet training. This is one of the most fluent and colourful autobiographies of recent years: a contribution to both dance literature and the literature of adolescence. It contains not a shred of self pity, and confirms Joan Brady as a striking and unconventional voice.</p>

Their  idea is to create transgenic plants incorporating 2'-5'  oligoadenylate synthetase, a protein produced by mammals in  response to viral infections.    When activated by double-stranded RNA [ribonucleic acid] --  the most frequently found replicative form of viral RNA, this  enzyme acts as a catalyst in the polymerization of ATP  [adenosine triphosphate] into 2'-5' oligo-adenylates. In turn,  these oligonucleotides go on to activate the endoribonuclease,  RNase L.    Mart Saarma (Biotechnology Institute of Helsinki) and his  colleagues have transformed potato plants, via Agrobacterium  tumefaciens, with the c-DNA [complementary deoxyribonucleic  acid] of the rat's 2-5' oligo-adenylate synthetase gene. These  plants, planted on small parcels of farmland, were innoculated  with potato virus X (PVX). In three of the clones tested, no  viral particles were detected. The virus was detected in the  tubercules and leaves of the other clones, but in two cases, in  concentrations below those found in non-transformed control  plants and in transgenic plants expressing the capside protein  of PVX. These results would suggest that a mammal protein can  protect potato plants from infection by PVX. Is this protection  equally effective against other RNA viruses? And is it, as in  the case of mammals, general and non-specific? These are  questions currently being addressed by the researchers.

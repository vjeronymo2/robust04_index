			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Ferry company to take Crown to court THE CROWN Estate, which manages property owned by the sovereign, is being sued by the operators of one of the oldest ferry services in Europe over moves to close the route. White Horse Ferries is seeking damages after the Crown Estate ordered the company to halt services between Tilbury and Gravesend, the Thameside towns linked by a river crossing uninterrupted since 1086. The estate commissioners say White Horse is breaching the sovereign's 'ancient rights to run a ferry' on the river. The company bought the service last year from Sealink Stena, but lawyers acting for the Crown say the route franchise was non-transferable. Franchises from Tilbury are issued at the discretion of the sovereign. The Crown says White Horse has the right to operate in one direction only, from Gravesend to Tilbury. White Horse says moves to close the route have depressed passenger numbers and increased operating losses. The Crown Estate is seeking talks in an attempt to avoid legal action and negotiate a franchise. It said it had taken legal advice and decided it had no obligation to keep the service running. 'We hope it won't come to that,' it added. A high-speed cross-Channel passenger-only ferry service will link Brighton with Dieppe from July 18. It will be run by Advanced Channel Express, a subsidiary of Constructions Mechaniques de Normandie, the military shipbuilder.</p>

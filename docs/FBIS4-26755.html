			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Special article by reporter Hung Wen (3126 2429)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 24 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The  detailed regulation for China's land gain tax, which has  attracted the attention of foreign investors, is expected to be  officially promulgated this summer. To adapt themselves to this  new change, all localities have taken positive measures, based  on ensuring the implementation of the new regulations, and tried  to mitigate the impact on developers through screening the  imposition of irrational real estate taxes and applying to the  central authorities for exemption of certain special projects.  They have continued to step up measures to attract foreign  investment in real estate.    According to analyses by economic experts, as the central  government is determined to levy land gain taxes and the  provisional regulations promulgated earlier in the year will be  considered new regulations, there should be no doubt as to the  seriousness of this basic principle. For this reason, it is  imperative that the regulations be put into effect this year.  As for detailed issues that do not involve the principle,  consideration will be given -- to the extent possible -- to the  views and proposals of foreign investors so that the problem can  be handled flexibly.    As for local governments, on the one hand, they gradually  have come to realize the authority of the new regulations. They  know that legislation and explanation of the land gain tax lies  with the central government. Hence, it is unlikely there will  be any change without authorization. On the other hand, all  localities had to face squarely the problem of the slow-down in  real estate investment by foreign firms, which were taking a  look-and-see attitude toward the new regulations, and make  limited adaptions in taxation.    Indications over the past few months show that while getting  ready to implement the detailed regulations for land gain taxes,  all localities have planned countermeasures and adopted rational  moves to ensure the enthusiasm of foreign investors. The  general practice is: Abolishing or merging the irrational  portion of the local taxes previously levied on real estate  developers in a bid to alleviate their burden. In addition, the  domestic housing projects built on land obtained through  auction, as well as projects encouraged by the central  government, should be exempted from taxes if the return is under  20 percent.    Take Fujian, for example: Real estate developers had to pay  more than 50 kinds of taxes, which now have been reduced to some  30 after screening. Fuzhou abolished six kinds of taxes in  April and lowered the rates of eight kinds of taxes, which  relevantly lowered the investment cost of real estate developers  by around 5 percent. Other cities like Jinan, Zhuhai, and  Shanghai recently promulgated new measures to attract foreign  capital and encourage foreign investors to increase their  investment.    As for the real estate developers, experts say that  readjustment is necessary to adapt to the changes, but  over-nervousness is unnecessary, as it may result in loss of new  investment opportunities.</p>

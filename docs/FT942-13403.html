			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Budding Greek sector needs controls - International Inspired by the sparkling debut of the drachma foreign bond market, Greece plans to issue fixed-rate domestic bonds with maturities of more than one year. However, many bankers feel that if the Greek authorities want government issuance to be a success, they should take further steps in regulating the embryonic market. 'We hope to come to the market as soon as we can', initially in maturities of up to three years, Mr Nicos Kyriazides, Greece's deputy finance minister, said on Friday. He said the maturity spectrum would be extended as interest rates declined, though this was contingent on a continuing fall in inflation, which is at 10.2 per cent, down from the 1993 average of 14.1 per cent. Mr Kyriazides was in London to promote the Hellenic Republic's forthcoming DM1bn floating-rate note issue, which is expected to be launched this week via CS First Boston and Deutsche Bank. Greece also plans to tap other markets this year, including the Yankee, and is considering a global bond issue. Success of supranational drachma deals earlier this year has spurred high hopes for Greek government issuance, which could boost the country's underdeveloped secondary bond market and shift some of Greece's short-term debt into longer maturities. The European Investment Bank opened up the foreign drachma bond market - dubbed 'Marathon' market - in February with an issue of 17 1/2 per cent five-year bonds. With a double-digit coupons attracting huge investor demand, the bonds put on a stellar performance. Such was the success of the EIB deal, that other supranationals - the World Bank, the International Financing Corporation and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - came rushing into the sector. Issuance was not only spurred by strong investor demand for high-yielding paper, but also by 'incredible swap opportunities', allowing borrowers to achieve funding at a wider sub-Libor cost than in other currencies, says Mr George Papamarkakis, head of domestic capital markets at Bayerische Vereinsbank in Athens. According to syndicate sources, the World Bank achieved funding at 90 basis points below dollar Libor, the IFC got 75 basis points below Libor, and the EBRD achieved Libor less 60. However, the drachma fever cooled when two non-supranationals, Bayerische Vereinsbank and Abbey National, tapped the sector, effectively opening a Eurodrachma market outside Greece. While Marathon bonds are listed in Athens and require approval from several regulatory bodies, Eurodrachma bonds are listed outside Greece and are effectively unregulated. Due to credit considerations, and because they are not exempt from withholding tax for Greek investors, these bonds pay a significant yield premium over the tax-free supranational issues. Bankers fear a burgeoning Eurodrachma market could suck in the existing demand for drachma bonds and crowd the government out of the market when it chooses to issue longer-dated bonds. Moreover, the creation of an offshore drachma market means 'the authorities could lose control of their money supply and currency', warned a dealer. 'If they limited the number of issuers they let in the market, they would have more control over its development'. He points to the Spanish Matador foreign bond market, which developed gradually under the tight grip of the Bank of Spain, and whose success spurred the development of a liquid domestic bond market. 'The Greek authorities should restrict the market initially to supranationals, then allow sovereigns, then agencies and finally everyone who wants to tap the market.' Indeed, the Greek authorities are considering a system where issuers must notify the monetary authorities of their borrowing plans. Despite the market's initial growing pains, many observers welcome the issuance of longer-dated fixed-rate Greek government bonds. 'If the government issues longer-dated fixed-rate bonds in the domestic market, it should be a huge success: coupled with a decent fiscal policy, it should brighten up the picture,' said Mr Papamarkakis. In the domestic market, the Greek government issues bonds with maturities of up to seven years, but all bonds over one year pay floating interest rates pegged to 12-month Treasury bills. . One-year Treasury bills currently yield 18 1/2 per cent, and seven-year notes pay 200 basis points above that, yielding 20 1/2 per cent. Traders are divided over the yield pick-up Greek government debt should pay over supranational Marathons, with estimates ranging between 50 and 150 basis points. While some argue that the Greek government will always be able to repay drachma debt, and should not have to pay a risk premium over supranational borrowers, others point out that Spain has set a different precedent. 'The average spread of new (government bonds) over Matadors was about 100-150 basis points,' says one banker. Mr Kyriazides says: 'The pick-up should not be more than around one point.' But while drachma bonds offer hefty returns, investors should also be aware of their risks. For one, there is the drachma's creeping devaluation, which reflects the inflation differential between Greece and the European Union average. However, after weakening about 8 per cent against the D-Mark in 1993 and 10.2 per cent in 1992, the drachma is expected to decline less sharply this year as the inflation differential narrows further. There is also some political risk as the presidential elections in May 1995 approach. If no two-thirds majority is found for any one candidate, new general elections must be held.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / People: Shute recruits at Scottish Heritable Roger Shute, former chairman of BM Group, has strengthened his hold on Scottish Heritable Trust, the struggling York-based mini-conglomerate in which he holds a 10 per cent stake. He is handing over the chief executive's job to Brian Craig, 47, a property expert, and has also recruited Malcolm Mastin, 50, an old BM colleague, to be an executive director. Scottish Heritable Trust is in talks with its bankers on the refinancing of its Pounds 24m debt; it has been selling off its industrial interests. The appointment of Craig, a consultant to Styles, Whitlock, chartered surveyors, is a further sign of transformation into a property company. Craig was a founder of Brookmount and is managing director of Craig European, a private property company. Roger Shute, who took over from Edward Denison as chairman earlier this month, will remain executive chairman. The company's shares were suspended at 5p last November.</p>

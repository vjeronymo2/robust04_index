			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe plans to form a new parliamentary group in the  House of Representatives in a bid to form a coalition government  with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito [Clean Government  Party] and the Japan New Party [JNP], a senior official of the  Watanabe faction said Monday [11 April].    However, Watanabe and his faction's members will not  renounce  their membership of the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], the No.  1 opposition party, even after the lower chamber secretariat  approves the new group, they said.    In parallel with this move, executives kicked off a campaign  to solicit the signatures of LDP legislators ready to support  Watanabe's bid for the premiership following the imminent  official resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    As the combined parliamentary strength of his 46-member  faction, Shinseito, Komeito and the JNP stands at 161, Watanabe  will need to win support from more than 95 LDP legislators who  belong to other LDP factions.    The LDP was stripped of its 38-year lock on power after  dozens of Shinseito and Sakigake [Harbinger] legislators bolted  the party last June.    Watanabe's bid for premiership is also contingent on whether  Shinseito will agree to link up with him in view of its earlier  demand that the Watanabe faction leave the LDP to form a new  party with it, political analysts said.    Watanabe hinted at his readiness to leave at a meeting of  his  faction earlier in the day, saying, "I want to take fresh action  together with people who have the same (political) opinions and  share my ideals."    However, he decided to form a new group without renouncing  his LDP membership, as it would alienate potential supporters  within the LDP if he demanded they quit the party, the faction  executives said.    Since last February, Watanabe has repeatedly held  clandestine  meetings with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is  the chief coalition strategist.    Shinseito and Komeito -- key forces within the ruling  coalition -- are widely deemed as willing to name Watanabe the  next leader of a new coalition government due to his political  influence and his position as head of the LDP's third-largest  faction.</p>

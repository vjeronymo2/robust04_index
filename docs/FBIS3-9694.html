			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, March 28 (TANJUG) -- Some 10,000  demonstrators rallied outside the Slovenia's parliament building  to express support to the Defense Minister Janez Jansa. Police  were trying to prevent the demonstrators, from the rightist and  nationalist parties, from forcing their way into the building  and interrupting the discussion on the proposal of Prime  Minister Janez Drnovsek to relieve Jansa because of abuses of  power and violations of the constitution and of human rights.  Jansa's followers were demanding also the state's President  Milan Kucan and Prime Minister Drnovsek be relieved.    The immediate cause for removing Jansa from his ministerial  post was his involvement in the recent brutal assault of  military police on civilian Milan Smolnikar near Ljubljana. The  military police at Jansa's orders beat up Smolnikar, accusing  him of spying on the Defense Ministry for Slovenian President  Milan Kucan. The removal of Jansa was Monday opposed by Foreign  Minister Lojze Peterle, president of the Christian Democrat  Party, the third strongest party in the ruling coalition, who  proposed to the prime minister to withdraw the demand. After  Drnovsek refused to compromise, even if the Christian Democrats  left the ruling coalition, Peterle requested a parliamentary  debate on confidence the government.    In the biggest crisis in Slovenia since it seceded from the  former Yugoslavia, the Army and police were also at odds as a  reflection of, as set out in Ljubljana, the intransigent  interests of the political currents in the state leadership.  Police was prepared for possible resistance from some sections  of the Slovene Army which opposed Jansa's removal.    The Slovenian parliament was expected Monday night to come  forth with a stand on the prime minister's proposal for Jelko  Kacin, former information minister, to become defense minister.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 16 TASS -- The Russian Defence  Ministry will pay this year debts to suppliers of weapons and  combat materiel, totalling 2,200 billion roubles.    It has already paid out 46 per cent of debts,  Colonel-General  Vassiliy Vorobyev, head of the chief administration of the  military budget and financing, said at a news conference at the  Defence Ministry on Wednesday.    Asked by ITAR-TASS about reasons for payment delays,  Vorobyev  said that the military budget for the last year was approved at  8,300 billion roubles. However, the Finance Ministry  transferred only 6,500 billion to the Defence Ministry.    The ministry's minimum needs are over 10,000 billion. The  Finance Ministry satisfied only 65 per cent of the needs. This  is the explanation for debts and delays with payment of money  allowances and wages.    The colonel-general did not say anything about the  ministry's  solvency this year. Vorobyev noted that everything would depend  on the federal budget which will be examined by parliament in  the near future.    Provision is made for some increase in appropriations for  purchasing weapons and combat materiel as well as for research  and development.    According to Vorovyev's forecast, the practice of saving on  all the spheres of army and naval activities will be continued  this year.</p>

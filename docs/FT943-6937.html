			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Kohl issues his election manifesto: Chancellor launches campaign for a fourth term in office Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday launched his campaign to be re-elected for a fourth term, presenting himself as the defender of unity, peace and stability against an emerging left-wing front led by the Social Democrats. Speaking at the unveiling of the election manifesto for the senior coalition parties - his own Christian Democratic Union and finance minister Mr Theo Waigel's Christian Social Union - Mr Kohl declared that Germany had found its place among 'the winners for the first time this century'. He told a press conference: 'For the first time in the history of our country, we have good relations with Washington, Paris and London.' The representation of Mr Kohl as broker and defender of international harmony is to be hammered home in a personalised advertising campaign featuring him and world leaders with Tina Turner's song 'Simply the best' pounding in the background. One commercial includes President Bill Clinton's quote from his recent visit: 'I agree with Helmut.' One poster shows only Mr Kohl's bulky figure in a crowd, and is embellished neither with the CDU's black red and gold party logo, nor a slogan. According to the manifesto, it is up to the electorate to decide if Germany should stay in the political centre or should 'drift away far to the left'. It describes the SPD and their Green allies as a 'security risk' at a time when dependability and security are needed more than ever. Mr Kohl pressed home the charges against the SPD, claiming Saxony-Anhalt's new regional government, in which a minority SPD/Green government is supported by the Party of Democratic Socialism, represented a 'basic qualitative change' in SPD policy. The PDS was communist and communists were 'fascists painted red', Mr Kohl said. 'We want enough votes to ensure that what happened in Saxony-Anhalt is unthinkable in Bonn,' added Mr Waigel, urging a strong turnout at the poll on October 16. The manifesto document itself dwelt heavily on domestic concerns. There were promises to be hard on crime and generous with housing programmes and family taxation. There were assurances on maintaining the economic recovery, and long passages on plans to complete the process of unification with the former East Germany. As Mr Waigel pointed out, it contained 'no promises which are unrealistic or which we cannot keep'. Accordingly, the manifesto offered no eye-catching tax reliefs for an electorate which will next year feel the pinch from the reinstatement of a 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge. This so-called 'solidarity' levy was introduced shortly after unification, following repeated reassurances from Mr Kohl that taxes would not need to be increased to support the east German economy. When the vote had been won he would give the fair distribution of the tax burden 'great priority', the chancellor said. Referring to a proposal from Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the Free Democrat economics minister, that federal borrowing should be increased to fund tax cuts, Mr Kohl said bluntly: 'It is not feasible.' Despite emerging differences with the junior government partner, Mr Kohl said he wanted to resume control with the present coalition.</p>

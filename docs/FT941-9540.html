			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Growth and jobs dominate finance talks Rising unemployment and poor short-term prospects for economic growth in Europe will dominate the agenda when European Union finance ministers meet in Brussels today. Talks will focus on how to carry out prescriptions in the Delors White Paper on employment and growth, which were approved at the Brussels summit last December. Greece, which is to chair the talks today, has pledged to make the White Paper the centrepiece of its six-month EU presidency. But its efforts will be complicated by the ideological faultline within the EU over how best to generate growth and improve competitiveness. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, is expected to urge his partners to follow the British model and improve labour market flexibility. As he did in a recent speech in Paris, Mr Clarke will reject accusations that such steps have undermined the UK welfare state. But other member states remain wary of moves which could provoke labour unrest at home. France, which has seen violent protests by fishermen, farmers and airline workers in recent months, will point to its policy of encouraging public and consumer spending to spur its faltering recovery. The opening debate among ministers is to be televised. Diplomats are watching for coded calls to the Bundesbank to bring forward the interest rate cuts which market observers believe is the best hope for an early recovery. Ministers will also consider a revised Portuguese 'convergence' plan which includes commitments to curb budget deficits and attack inflation, so as to prepare for the planned creation of a single European currency by the end of the decade. The Portuguese plan will be the first of several revised programmes from other member states, following monetary turbulence last year. As a separate item, Mr Clarke will raise concerns that an earlier political commitment by heads of government, to protect farmers from the effects of currency turmoil, could open the door to a flood of fresh spending. The commitment to take 'appropriate steps' to compensate farmers for big swings in currencies was made at the December 1992 summit in Edinburgh, as part of the seven-year budget agreement. According to legal advisers in Brussels, the commitment could allow member states to use a qualified majority to trigger extra spending if that were incorporated in legal form, overriding the traditional need for unanimity on spending matters.</p>

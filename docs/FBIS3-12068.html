PRD spokesman Julio Ulloa said the  campaign of the late Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)  candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, was characterized by its  inclination to address social problems such as poverty. "This  new candidate totally changes the focus of the electoral  campaign. Colosio had focused on social issues as has the PRD  government program," he pointed out. The spokesman added that  because of the post he held in the government, Zedillo's  campaign will apparently focus on economic issues and their  social repercussions.    Since November 1993, Zedillo had been a coordinator for PRI  candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio's campaign, who was assassinated  on 23 March in Tijuana on the U.S. border. Colosio had realized  that addressing poverty was a priority of the times, but this  will most probably be placed in the middle level of importance  by the new candidate although he will continue the programs of  the current government. Ulloa added that the new candidate will  make the differences between the campaigns of the PRI and PRD,  the country's third electoral force, more evident.</p>

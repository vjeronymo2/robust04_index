			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Tensions rise in Haiti as police kill demonstrator: Aristide refuses to acknowledge Carter accord with junta The first signs of the difficulties facing US efforts to restore democracy in Haiti came yesterday as the republic's police clubbed to death a demonstrator welcoming the Americans. Riot police used clubs and rifle butts to break up a crowd of thousands of supporters of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide at the port, leaving several injured. According to US soldiers a Haitian policeman was shot and wounded by a civilian. US troops, who had been instructed not to intervene in domestic policing, looked on. The clash raised fears about the conduct of Haiti's militia just as the Clinton administration set out to win broader support for the deal it reached with the Haitian junta on Sunday. In Washington, General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said troops would not intervene unless 'this level of violence becomes so great that it threatens the overall stability and security of our multinational forces'. The incident apart, US deployment was greeted peacefully as troops spread through the country and marines took over the northern city of Cap Haitien. Gen Shalikashvili, who insisted Haitian troops were continuing to co-operate, defended Sunday's agreement, which provides for General Raoul Cedras and other military leaders to leave power, but not necessarily the country, by October 15. He said Pentagon officers would brief Mr Aristide on their plans for occupying Haiti. Mr Aristide reaffirmed his commitment to last year's broken Governor's Island Agreement - under which Gen Cedras had promised to leave power a year ago - but ignoring the latest deal, arranged by former president Jimmy Carter. The ousted Haitian president said he would 'remain vigilant to the declaration of democracy expressed by the people of Haiti, as together with the people of Haiti we move toward a new beginning'. But Mr Aristide's advisers said the omission of any endorsement of the new agreement was deliberate. Mr Aristide was also said to be uneasy that the US had not started to disarm the Haitian military. Briefing congressional leaders at the White House, Mr Clinton said: 'This is a very different and a much better day than it would have been had we not been able to successfully combine the credible threat of force with diplomacy.' He added that Washington 'must be prepared for the risks that remain for the troops, but we should recognise that we are in a much stronger and safer position to achieve our goals in Haiti today'. Members of Congress from both parties remained sceptical about the chances of restoring democracy to Haiti, and unhappy about the prospect that US troops would have to remain in large numbers, probably until at least February.

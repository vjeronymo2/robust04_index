			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Antofagasta at Pounds 20.8m after bank merger ANTOFAGASTA Holdings, which has mining, banking, rail and water interests in Chile, realised an Pounds 8.25m profit from the merger in June of its Banco O'Higgins associate with the Spanish-owned CentroHispano Banco and this boosted pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 20.8m. The group said falling copper prices since February had adversely affected results but operating profit rose by 39 per cent, from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds 11.6m, thanks to substantial increases in income from associated manufacturing and banking operations. Antofagasta warned that there was no indication yet of higher metal prices and that would affect results for the full year. Pre-tax profit from mining operations fell from Pounds 2.42m to Pounds 2.1m on turnover up from Pounds 24.7m to Pounds 33.2m. Total turnover rose to Pounds 40.7m (Pounds 31.9m). Earnings, excluding exceptionals, rose from 22.1p to 34.4p and an unchanged interim dividend of 6p is declared. The bank merger reduced Antofagasta's holding in the combined entity from 47.65 per cent to 24.12 per cent. In March the group also sold a 13.65 per cent interest in the Lince mining company for Dollars 12.3m (Pounds 7.9m). This reduced Antofagasta's effective interest from 91.4 per cent to 77.75 per cent and produced a profit on disposal of Pounds 889,000.</p>

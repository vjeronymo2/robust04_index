			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Georgia-Pacific warns on profits GEORGIA-PACIFIC, the US paper group, warned yesterday its second quarter results would be 'slightly better than break-even', with net income lower than the same period of 1991. The news hit the company's shares and the paper sector in general, with Georgia-Pacific stock down Dollars 4 3/8 at Dollars 55 by the close on Wall Street. The company made Dollars 33m, or 38 cents a share, in the second quarter of last year on revenue of Dollars 2.981bn. The period included an after-tax gain of Dollars 29m, or 34 cents a share, on the sale of property. The paper sector has been suffering from a cyclical downturn in profits, partly because of increased industry capacity, but analysts have been forecasting a gradual rise in net income during 1992, assuming the US economy sustains its slow upward momentum. A Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman noted US prices for timber used by the building industry had dipped somewhat from the record levels seen during the first quarter of this year, while paper markets were similar to the first quarter. During the first quarter, Georgia-Pacific reported record operating profits of Dollars 183m from its building products division, compared with pulp and paper profits of Dollars 46m.</p>

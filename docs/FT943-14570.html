			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Baggio books Italy's date with destiny - The Azzurri dash the dreams of Bulgaria to reach the final So history means something even in soccer. Italy, the three-time winners, yesterday beat Bulgaria, a side which before this tournament had never won a game in the World Cup finals. The score was 2-1, which was about right. For once, Italy scored early and twice, with Roberto Baggio now well into his role as the second coming of Paulo Rossi. Bulgaria, conquerors of two past champions in Argentina and Germany, kept the gap to one with a penalty just before half-time. But in spite of holding the balance of play through the second half the Bulgarians never looked likely to break through a massed Italian defence. It looked as though Bulgaria's original game plan was to play it long, keep it tight early, then attack the tiring Italians. But Roberto Baggio and Albertini made nonsense of this strategy in a purple patch beginning in the 21st minute. A throw-in from the left found Baggio running free. He cut across one defender, comprehensively beat a second, paused momentarily to assess what was left in front of him and placed the most careful of right footers beyond the diving Mikhailov's left hand. Now it was Albertini's turn. In less than two minutes the AC Milan defender rattled the Bulgarian post from the edge of the area, forced Mikhailov to back-pedal furiously to tip over a chip, and then, in the 26th minute, he set Baggio loose once more inside the area on the right. Again Baggio seemed to pause for a fraction of a second just to check his whereabouts before placing the most precise shot across Mikhailov and just inside his right-hand post. The Bulgarians were seriously unnerved now as Casiraghi and Donadoni both went close. Letchkov and Stoichkov, stars of the triumph over Germany, were to be found back in defence rather than picking the Italians apart. But to give them credit the Bulgarians did not break and began to respond. After 35 minutes Stoichkov was on target with a free kick from his favourite place, well out on the right, but it was too close to the goalkeeper. Balakov was then just wide from 20 yards. But, for Italy, Maldini went even closer with an unchallenged header from a corner. It was Sirakov who took matters into his own hands with a fine direct run into the area. If Costacurta tripped him, Pagliuca helped him on his way down and the award of a penalty brought no Italian complaints. Stoichkov disposed of it, giving him six goals for the tournament, tied for first with Salenko of Russia. Stoichkov, who was substituted with 10 minutes to go, also left another mark on the final. A second-half foul on him by Costacurta was adjudged bad enough for a yellow card, meaning no play in Pasadena for one of the central elements of the Italian defence. Baggio left the game 19 minutes before the end after an awkward turn left him with a slight thigh injury, but by then he had more than left his impression on a game played on a steamy, sticky day with temperatures in the mid-90s and humidity to match. Neither the stadium nor New York City itself was exactly a sea of Bulgariana yesterday. A group of intrepid nuns with press passes did manage to locate a Bulgarian journalist and introduced him round the sweaty media tent. Otherwise this was a day for one of New York's oldest and biggest minorities. They were knocking back the grappa in Little Italy well before noon, did not seem to mind the switch to cold beer in the stadium, and as the final whistle sparked noisy celebrations in the stands they were ready to celebrate all night long.</p>

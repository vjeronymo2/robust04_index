			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Agreement To Solve Problem of </F> Jordanian al-'Aqabah Blockade"]    [Excerpt] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Jordanian  Foreign Ministry yesterday announced that the proposal currently  raised to solve the problem of the blockade imposed on  al-'Aqabah port, which -- so it seems -- enjoys the Americans'  approval, is actually a Jordanian proposal.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Ahmad Mubayyidin,  spokesman for the ministry, said that the proposal says that an  international company -- namely the British company Lloyd's  Register, which is not a commercial company -- would inspect the  ships and cargo in port, not at sea as is happening now. He  denied that there is a specific date for implementing this  proposal. He added: Of course, legally, the blockade does not  concern the United States in particular, as it falls under the  powers of the UN Security Council sanctions committee. Thus  consultations must be held within the framework of this  committee in order to take a decision to begin implementing the  proposal, which stipulates that al-'Aqabah-bound ships should  not be subjected to obstacles or search measures by U.S. Navy  units or any other units, and that these ships should arrive in  the port very easily. Cargo should be examined inside the port  by the international company's representative in cooperation  with a competent Jordanian committee. [passage omitted]</p>

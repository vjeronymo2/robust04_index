			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BP sees continuing pressure on margins British Petroleum yesterday warned that refining margins were likely to remain under pressure for the rest of the year, in spite of a return to economic growth in much of Europe. Mr Rolf Stomberg, chief executive of BP Oil Europe, said that European refining margins were 'the lowest in five years.' The margin in the first half of 1994 fell to Dollars 2.03 a barrel, against Dollars 2.48 in 1993. Mr Stomberg told journalists visiting the company's Spanish refinery that the gap between European supply and demand for refined products, such as petrol, would 'narrow a bit next year.' But he was not optimistic about a big improvement, because growth in refinery capacity in Europe continued to outstrip demand. In addition low international freight rates had allowed refiners throughout the world to ship products to Europe. BP had been able to offset deteriorating margins by improved earnings from marketing activities, Mr Stomberg said. Cost cutting and improvements to BP's five European refineries resulted in fixed cost savings of Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) in the first half, with further improvements likely.</p>

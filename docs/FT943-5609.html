			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (2): Preparing for tomorrow today - The worst may be over for the beleaguered commercial aircraft industry Some signs have finally emerged that the worst is possibly over for the beleaguered commercial aircraft industry. Singapore Airlines this summer placed one of the world's biggest aircraft orders for 52 US Boeing and European Airbus widebody airliners worth Dollars 10.3bn. Dr Cheong Choong Kong, the airline's managing director, described it as 'an expression of faith in the long-term health of the aviation industry'. A few months earlier, Saudi Arabia also announced a jumbo order for about Dollars 6bn worth of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas airliners. Although these large deals, once commonplace in the late 1980s before the industry was plunged into its worst recession during the last four years, are still the exception rather than the rule, all three main commercial aircraft manufacturers - Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas - are beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel. 'Last year we all sufferred big order cancellations and deferrals from airlines. At least this year cancellations and deferrals have petered out,' says Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive. 'The airline industry has had a hell of a time but I expect the airline market to bottom out,' says John McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell Douglas, the most vulnerable of the three big manufacturers to the industry's difficulties. 'I do see signs that we are coming out of the depression. I've been through three cycles. People have speculated that we would go out of the commercial aircraft business. It hasn't happened yet and it won't happen in this cycle,' he adds. And Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets, is still forecasting demand for new airliners worth Dollars 980bn in the next 20 years to meet the growth in air travel and the need to replace older jets. In its latest civil aircraft market outlook, Boeing says that Dollars 731bn worth of new aircraft will be need to accommodate future air traffic growth and Dollars 249bn to replace older aircraft. But the four-year long recession has left deep scars and forced aircraft manufacturers to adapt rapidly to a fundamental structural change in the market. Air traffic, a traditional barometer of economic activity, is now recovering but the passenger yields of airlines continue to remain under pressure because of low fares. Many airlines as a result continue to be burdened by financial losses and debts significantly reducing their ability to acquire new aircraft. 'It is becoming more and more evident that revenue, rather than traffic, is becoming the key to airline profitability,' says Adam Brown, head of strategic planning at Airbus. Like other industry experts, Mr Brown believes low fares are here to stay and airlines will have to rely increasingly for their profits on cost reductions and operational efficiencies. In turn, they will seek to fill their fleets with aircraft with both lower operating and acquisition costs. These financial pressures coupled with the industry's increasing concentration has led to a further intensification of competition in the commercial aircraft market. As Boeing puts it: 'There are only 600 airlines in the world. Only 125 of these buy new airplanes. And the 20 largest airlines buy 60 per cent of all new commercial airplanes. In such a concentrated market, you can't afford to miss a single strategic sale.' To respond to these new challenges, aircraft manufacturing has been forced to evolve from a business driven purely by product, research and development to one where the manufacturing process will make the difference between one airframe builder and its rivals. 'It is no longer so much what you build but how you build that will give you the edge over the competition,' explains a senior Airbus executive. 'We are all having to adapt to this new competitive environment,' says Claude Terrazzoni, head of the commercial aircraft division of Aerospatiale, the French partner in the Airbus consortium. 'Boeing is now cutting its production costs by 25 per cent: either they want to kill us because they think Airbus can't match such cuts, or they are adapting to the structural change in the airline industry with low fares; or they are trying to do both,' he adds. At the roll-out this spring of its latest airliner - the 400-seat 777 twin-engine widebody - Ron Woodard, the head of the US company's commercial aircraft operations, said Boeing was committed to drive down costs and the time to build an aircraft 'to make sure we remain the world's most competitive manufacturer of commercial jets'. Boeing has already reduced the order-to-delivery time of its widebody aircraft such as the 747 and the 767 from as high as 18 months a few years ago to around 10.5 months and wants to bring it down even further to eight months. It eventually hopes to achieve the same target for the 777, the latest member of its aircraft family. Boeing has already reduced the production cycle time for its narrowbody aircraft, including the 737 and the 757, to nine months and is planning to bring it down to six months by 1996. The way Boeing has developed the 777 is another example of how manufacturers have adapted their operations to the changes that have taken place in the civil aircraft business. Boeing describes the 777 as a 'market-driven' airliner. In the past, the manufacturer felt it knew what was best for its airline customers. But with the 777, Boeing has encouraged airlines, suppliers and sub-contractors to participate actively in the design and planning of the new airliner. 'Not that we did not listen to our customers in the past, but the biggest lesson we learnt was that we often listened to them late in the programme,' explains a senior Boeing executive. At all cost, Boeing wanted to avoid the mistakes made five years ago on the development of the 747-400, the newest version of its 747 jumbo. After failing to listen properly to its customers, Boeing was forced to delay delivery for several months to initial customers because of teething problems and design changes demanded by airlines. This time, Boeing wanted to make sure it had what it calls a 'service ready' airliner from the first 777 delivery. The change in Boeing's manufacturing approach reflects two important evolutions in the market. The first was the need to adapt to the new circumstances facing airlines hit by the prolonged slump in civil aviation. The second, and perhaps even more important factor, was the emergence of Airbus as Boeing's principal long-term challenger. The European consortium, which has steadily built market share during the past 20 years by launching advanced new aircraft programmes and developing a broad family of airliners, has been making serious inroads into some of Boeing's traditional customers including in its domestic US market. With nearly 30 per cent of the world market, Airbus has now overtaken McDonnell Douglas in the industry's number two slot behind Boeing. The US company's Douglas commercial aircraft division has been given a big boost by Saudi Arabia's decision to award a large slice of its new Dollars 6bn order to the Long Beach, California, group. But Douglas continues to be handicapped by its limited product range focused on two niche markets with its MD11 three-engine widebody airliner and its MD-80, MD-90 and the planned MD-95 narrowbody twin-engine airliners all derived from the original DC-9. Douglas has not abandoned the idea of forging an international alliance with foreign partners acquiring up to 49 per cent of the Long Beach concern. A similar scheme with Taiwan collapsed two years ago. But in the absence of establishing a strong international alliance, many in the industry expect Douglas to find it increasingly hard to compete with just two product lines. 'This is simply not a niche business. You need a broad family of aircraft to compete,' explains one of Douglas's main rivals. In contrast, Airbus has embraced the 'family concept' with its A320, A319 and A321 narrowbody airliners, its A300 and A310 widebodies, and its latest widebodies including the A330 twin-engine airliner and its sister aircraft, the four-engine very long range A340. From the beginning, Airbus has sought to leap-frog Boeing with its products by introducing new technological concepts to commercial jets including fly-by-wire electronic controls. And with the A330 and A340 and plans to develop the A3XX, a 500 to 600-seater jumbo, Airbus has also increasingly challenged Boeing's dominance of the large aircraft market. The reaction at Boeing has been violent. As Mr Woodard put it in Boeing's staff magazine: 'We decided to prepare for the future today, while we're number one because number two is unthinkable.' Boeing's cost-cutting drive has involved 28,000 job reductions in 1993 and 1994. The US company has stepped up the widespread application of new computer and automated manufacturing techniques. It has introduced new organisational structures to improve internal working relations and practices. All this has now put pressure on Airbus to accelerate its own internal change to respond to the new competitive challenge from Boeing. Simply put, the commercial success of Airbus, whose sales topped Dollars 8bn last year and are expected to reach the same level this year, is in danger of being undermined by the group's own complex corporate structure and complex work-sharing production system based in its four partner countries - France, Germany, the UK and Spain. But all four Airbus partners now recognise that the challenge for Airbus is to transform what was initially conceived as a job and wealth creation consortium to compete against the dominance of the US manufacturers into an independent company, mature enough to rationalise and restructure, take hard political and social decisions, and stand on its own two corporate feet. Airbus says it is confident it can meet Boeing's challenge. It, too, has cut back on excessive staff with its four partners all launching extensive restructuring. It is attempting to maximise the big investments made during the past 20 years in automation and computer-aided manufacturing. It has also sought to simplify and streamline the consortium's complicated four-nation manufacturing and assembly processes. Mr Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, has set production targets for Airbus airliners similar to those set by its rival Boeing. 'For narrowbody aircraft we are also aiming at an order-to-delivery target of six months in 1996. Today it is 12 months, next year it will go down to nine,' he says. For widebody aircraft like the A300, A310, A330 and A340, Airbus has already reduced production cycle times from 15 months to 12.5 months and plans to go down to nine months by 1996. But the task remains a daunting one for Airbus. The European consortium has started transforming itself, but the process is a slow and politically difficult one. Unless it steps up the tempo, it will find it hard to keep up with the pace being set by Boeing. As Philip Condit, Boeing's president, has put it: 'The race will go to whoever is fastest.'</p>

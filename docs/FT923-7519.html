			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Rally extended in sluggish turnover THE RECOVERY in the UK stock market was extended yesterday as investors continued to hope that Friday's better news on inflation might open the way for lower interest rates and thus prompt recovery in European economies. Equities were helped at the close by reports of a successful outcome to the auction of government bonds. However, reports on the UK economy remained unconvincing and yesterday's buyers of shares appeared to be mostly professionals wanting stock to meet selling commitments taken on during the market's seven-day slide. The institutions played a cautious role, and trading volume was thin. The upturn came in the second half of the session, and was led from the stock index futures sector when the September future moved towards the 2,400 mark. In the stock market itself, there were further gains among building and construction shares, and hopes for recovery in the US dollar spurred rises in dollar-orientated issues. By the close, the FT-SE Index had put on 19.3 to register 2,376.1, the best level of the day. Seaq volume, in spite of the improvement in the latter half of the session, reached a mere 315.3m shares. Friday's total of 449.7m represented only Pounds 820.2m in retail or genuine investment business. These volume statistics tend to confirm that the recovery in share prices since Friday afternoon has been spurred by intra-market business, as marketmaking houses have competed with one another to buy stock ahead of the close on Friday of the equity trading account. Yesterday's session opened uncertainly, with mixed signals coming from the retail sector. The latest survey of distributive trades from the Confederation of British Industry reported the worst spending figures for a decade. However, this was offset by interim results from Argos, the discount retailer, which disclosed higher sales and some optimistic signs on the outlook for the rest of the year. The market lost its early gains but managed to rise again in lacklustre business. The absence of significant profit-taking after Friday's rally was encouraging and helped share prices to move forward. The rebound in building and construction shares came in spite of a report from the Bank of England that about 1m, or one tenth, of the householders in the UK now have mortgages greater than the market value of their houses. A leading UK estate agent reported that building land has lost 62 per cent of its value over the past three years. The uncertainty in the stock market was reflected by comments from equity strategists. Mr Nicholas Knight, the bearish analyst at Nomura Research, said: 'The knock-out punch is fast approaching in our opinion  - a rise in UK interest rates.' UBS Phillips &amp; Drew says its economic forecasts can no longer be described as sugg-esting modest recovery 'even on the most charitable interpretation'. Mr Peter Thorne at Nikko, however, believes equities are oversold and represent 'excellent fundamental value'.</p>

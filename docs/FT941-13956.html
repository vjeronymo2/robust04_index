			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Misplaced optimism lifts Nikkei 1.8% Optimism over the political reform bill's passage through the upper house pushed up share prices during the session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. However, worries over the economy emerged following the bill's defeat after the market had closed, and traders are bracing themselves for a rush of selling next week. This was reflected in trading in London where the ISE/Nikkei index fell 36.89 to 1,256.58. The Nikkei index closed up 123.51 at 19,307.43, a week's rise of 1.8 per cent, after moving within a tight range of 19,065.81 and 19,337.93. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 19.12 to 1,569.91. Domestic institutions were on the selling side while foreign investors continued to buy. Volume was 450m shares against 561m. Gainers led losers by 633 to 424 with 130 issues unchanged. While the rejection of the bill by the upper house was not ruled out most investors had remained hopeful. Towards the end of the session, buying led by arbitrageurs pushed up the index. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone posted its 17 straight rise, advancing Y25,000 to Y880,000. East Japan Railway, another benchmark issue for market sentiment, gained Y5,000 to Y496,000. Banks were higher on buying by foreign investors who are looking to increase their weightings in the sector ahead of next month's launch of the Nikkei 300 futures, which is heavily weighted in the sector. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 71.22 to 21,074.78 in volume of 43.7m shares. Roundup Variations were seen in performance among the region's markets yesterday. Bombay was closed after a strike in the city was called by a right wing political group. TAIWAN improved some 2.3 per cent up after a recovery in the financial sector encouraged late buying. The weighted index added 135.22 to 5,944.87, for a week's gain of 3.5 per cent. Turnover eased slightly to TDollars 64.8bn from Thursday's TDollars 65.1bn. Textile companies were among the day's best performers with analysts expecting a turnaround in the sector helped by the threefold rise in polyester fibre prices since last November. HONG KONG overcame a weak start to end sharply higher after selective buying pushed prices up in thin turnover. The Hang Seng index closed 194.53 or 1.7 per cent higher at 11,459.37, after dropping more than 135 points shortly after the opening. Turnover shrank to HKDollars 7.65bn from a heavy HKDollars 11.77bn on Thursday. Futures surged, with January Hang Seng index contracts erasing their steep discount with a 490-point jump to 11,500. SINGAPORE picked up on renewed buying by some institutional funds. The Straits Times Industrials index rose 22.45 or 1 per cent to 2,281.73, for a 0.9 per cent fall on the week. Malaysia's Promet, the most active share, ended unchanged at SDollars 1.85 after a day's high of SDollars 1.94. SEOUL closed a roller-coaster session lower after profit-taking in blue chips outweighed selective buying of low-priced shares. The composite index closed 8.09 lower at 870.20, comfortably off a day's high of 881.60, and 1 per cent lower on the week. Daiwoo, regarded as undervalued, saw the largest trading volume. The stock went limit up Won800 to Won16,700 in volume of 1.3m shares. Profits were taken in companies involved in the first and second mobile telecom bids ahead of Monday's auction of Korea Mobile Telecom shares. Both Sunkyong Industries and Kolon Industries went limit-down, losing Won1,300 each to Won35,600 and Won36,100 respectively. KUALA LUMPUR rebounded on bargain hunting and renewed foreign buying. The composite index recouped 13.74 of the 60 points lost in the previous two days to finish at 1,063.76, but was still 6.3 per cent lower over the week.

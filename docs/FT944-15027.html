			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Technology - Steel Takes on Aluminium: Back in the frame for building / Construction The great steel skeletons that thrust towards the New York sky epitomise the North American building site. Steel frames are a must for constructing office blocks, industrial units and residential flats in the US. But this is not so for much of western Europe where reinforced concrete is preferred for multi-storey buildings in many countries The exceptions are in the UK and Sweden where use of constructional steel has risen sharply over the past decade, supported by new building design techniques and developments in fire resistant paints and sprays for steel products. Now European steel producers are working hard to increase market share in countries such as France, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. They estimate that if steel frames were used as widely in other European countries as in Sweden and Britain, constructional steel demand would increase by 2.8m tonnes a year, a rise of 45 per cent. Some 57 per cent of multi-storey buildings in the UK and 90 per cent of single-storey factories and warehouses were estimated by British Steel in 1991-92 to have been constructed with steel frames. In Sweden the corresponding proportions were 50 per cent and 80 per cent. In Germany they were 11 per cent and 20-25 per cent and in Italy 11 per cent and 20 per cent. Marketing campaigns have been launched in these countries by the large European steel producers and fabricators. These emphasise the speed and simplicity of using steel as a building material, the relative fall in the price of the metal and the introduction of new European building codes on fire protection that they hope will overcome some of the prejudices of developers against steel frames. Concern that steel loses strength when heated and therefore responds less well in big fires than reinforced concrete has held back development of steel in Europe. EU building codes developed by CEN, the European standards institute, will provide developers with guidance on the most efficient and economic fire prevention regimes for steel-framed buildings. Also, much work has gone into developing fire-resistant paints and sprays that can be applied to steel beams. Derek Tordoff, director of the British Constructional Steelwork Association, says: 'European developers traditionally have thought that steel needed to be covered by concrete to be protected properly.' Retardants now include intumescent paints that expand when heated into a thick coating that insulates the steel from heat and flames. Beams and pillars can also be covered by a mineral-based vermiculite spray that expands when heated and is widely used for insulation. Improvements in construction design aided by computers have made it much easier for architects to solve problems by design rather than by changing one material for another. At its best steel construction should be as simple as building in Lego. Ready to assemble prefabricated parts, cut perfectly to fit, need to arrive on site in the right order and with the appropriate fastenings. Builders in North America have become accustomed to constructing with a standard range of components, which can be assembled in various imaginative designs, but can be supplied by any one of a large number of manufacturers. Delivery problems are overcome quickly by switching suppliers while sub-contractors are content to handle products they are accustomed to without having to develop special techniques and procedures. However, concrete has supporters too, and has also benefited from increasingly sophisticated design and prefabrication techniques. Steel is used alongside concrete for floors and cladding, and new design techniques have enabled developers to reduce the thickness, and therefore the cost, of the concrete flooring that sits on steel beams. Europe is a big prize. British Steel and the British Constructional Steelwork Association have combined with other large European steel producers and fabricators to develop common solutions and data on technical issues. Advisory teams of structural engineers have been established in countries such as France and Germany, with financial support from the Eurofer Steel Producers, to make design and technical support available to smaller countries. Production of constructional steelwork in western Europe is expected to be about 5.7m tonnes this year - about the same level as last year but 8 per cent below 1992 levels and 19 per cent lower than during 1990.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> WESTSIDE PROVING TOUGH FOR GOP TO CRACK;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE NEW DECADE WILL BRING REAPPORTIONMENT. BUT EXPERTS SAY IT'S  UNLIKELY THAT EVEN A REDRAWING OF POLITICAL BOUNDARIES WILL TOPPLE THE  DEMOCRATS.  </P> <P> Welcome to 1990, the year of the incumbent.  </P> <P> The calendar shows an election this year for state and federal offices, but on  the Westside this has not set pulses racing.  </P> <P> The area's representatives in Congress and the Legislature, Democrats all, are  assured of reelection in their carefully crafted, politically safe districts.  About all each one needs to do is keep breathing and avoid a major scandal.  </P> <P> It's a one-party system.  </P> <P> But the coming of a new decade will also bring reapportionment, the  constitutionally mandated, slightly unseemly process of redrawing political  boundaries to adjust for population changes.  </P> <P> Reapportionment can strike terror in a politician's heart. Job security is at  stake. Power can be won or lost by a simple shift in a district boundary.  </P> <P> Might the redistricting of the 1990s resurrect the two-party system in at least  parts of the Westside? Not very likely, say the experts.  </P> <P> "The Westside is to the Democratic Party what Orange County is to the  Republican Party," says Allan Hoffenblum, a veteran GOP political consultant.  The area, he says, "will always be heavily Democratic, barring some  extraordinary circumstance."  </P> <P> Much of the Westside is heavily white, Democratic and liberal, with the largest  concentration of Jewish voters outside of New York. In many neighborhoods,  Democrats outnumber Republicans by 2 to 1.  </P> <P> UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain, who has written extensively about  redistricting, says the Westside is all but impossible for Republicans to  crack, no matter how the lines are drawn. There just aren't enough Republicans.  </P> <P> "There is no way you are going to take the area south of the Ventura Freeway,  the really Jewish areas of the Westside -- take Santa Monica, Venice, areas  around Beverly Hills -- no way you're going to transform these into competitive  areas," he said.  </P> <P> Michael Berman, a top Democratic political strategist, reapportionment expert  and brother of Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), says simply: "West Los  Angeles is solidly Democratic turf."  </P> <P> The Westside serves as the political base for the powerful Democratic campaign  organization headed by Reps. Berman and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles).  Altogether, five Democratic congressman share a piece of this choice political  real estate.  </P> <P> But adjoining areas have a different political makeup.  </P> <P> Los Angeles is sharply divided politically, socially and economically. There is  Democratic territory, Republican territory and occasional patches of  competitive ground where the loyalty of voters is up for grabs.  </P> <P> Republicans dominate the upper-income communities that hug the coast from  Pacific Palisades to Malibu and Manhattan Beach to Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> The northwestern and northeastern reaches of the San Fernando Valley also are  increasingly GOP territory.  </P> <P> Mix together Westside Democratic strongholds and suburban Republican precincts  in the same district and the chance for political competition increases,  particularly if there is an open seat.  </P> <P> One potentially competitive district is that of Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa  Monica). His 27th Congressional District stretches from the edge of Topanga  Canyon through Santa Monica, West Los Angeles, Mar Vista, Venice, Marina del  Rey and Playa del Rey before jutting inland to reach black Democratic voters in  Inglewood. The district line then heads south into the more Republican and  conservative South Bay beach cities and Torrance. A finger reaches all the way  down to Terminal Island. The district is 54% Democratic in registration.  </P> <P> Another district that might someday be a battleground lies to the north and  east of Levine's territory. The 23rd Congressional District of Rep. Anthony C.  Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) includes Westwood, Beverly Hills, Century City,  Brentwood, Bel-Air and Malibu, as well as the San Fernando Valley communities  of Reseda, Tarzana, Woodland Hills, Canoga Park and Encino. Democrats make up  53% of the registered voters.  </P> <P> Rapid population growth in outlying areas of the state during the 1980s may  force the boundary lines of the Levine and Beilenson districts to stretch  farther from the solidly Democratic precincts of the Westside into more risky  Republican territory.  </P> <P> "It's possible a redistricting could make one or possibly two of these people  uncomfortable," Cain said.  </P> <P> If Levine, who is regarded as a potential challenger to U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston  in 1992, vacates his seat, the district would be competitive, Cain said.  </P> <P> Beilenson's district, likewise, "under the right circumstances, could be won by  a Republican," adds Hoffenblum.  </P> <P> But as long as Beilenson and Levine stay put, change is unlikely because of the  built-in advantages they have over challengers in fund raising, staffing and  the ability to attract media attention and to communicate with voters.  "Incumbency is the most powerful force in America right now," Cain said.  </P> <P> Nothing stirs an incumbent politician's instinct for self-preservation more  than reapportionment. Once every 10 years, after the new census is completed,  the boundary lines for every Assembly, Senate and congressional district must  be redrawn by the state Legislature.  </P> <P> The process offers a unique twist to the political adage: "To the victor goes  the spoils" because lawmakers effectively determine their own political  destinies by the lines that are drawn.  </P> <P> In 1812, when Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry approved a blatantly partisan  redistricting plan complete with a salamander-shaped district, critics dubbed  it a gerrymander. The label stuck.  </P> <P> "There has always been gerrymandering and always will be gerrymandering as long  as the people who run are drawing the lines," Hoffenblum said.  </P> <P> In an effort to change that equation, half a dozen initiatives are being  circulated to overhaul the way legislative and congressional districts are  drawn in California.  </P> <P> Two of those initiatives may qualify for the June ballot. One, sponsored by San  Mateo County Supervisor Tom Huening, a Republican, and backed by the League of  Women Voters, would create a 12-member reapportionment commission composed of  five Democrats, five Republicans and two independents.  </P> <P> Another proposal, by Marin County businessman Gary Flynn, would require a  two-thirds vote by the Legislature and majority approval by the voters before  reapportionment plans could be adopted.  </P> <P> The initiatives are a wild card in the redistricting process. So is the  governor's race.  </P> <P> To the dismay of Republicans, in the early 1980s Democrats controlled the  reapportionment process in California. With majorities in both houses of the  Legislature and with Edmund G. Brown Jr. in the governor's office, Democrats  drew lines that enhanced their own political power, particularly in Congress.  Although Democrats statewide account for barely half of the registered voters,  they hold 60% of the state's congressional seats -- 27 out of 45.  </P> <P> In the 1990s, the stakes are high once again.  </P> <P> California's population grew by at least 5.4 million people in the 1980s -- a  number greater than the overall population of most states. Much of the huge  22.8% population growth occurred in outlying areas of Los Angeles, Riverside,  San Bernardino, Orange and San Diego counties, and in the Central Valley.  </P> <P> The surge in population is expected to bring six or seven additional  congressional seats for California, boosting the state's delegation to 51 or 52  members. It will be the largest House contingent of any state in the nation's  history.  </P> <P> The increase in congressional seats will mean an identical growth in electoral  votes, potentially giving California one-fifth of the total electoral votes  needed to capture the presidency.  </P> <P> Tony Quinn, a Republican reapportionment expert now working for a public  relations firm in Sacramento, said there could be a deadlock on new district  boundaries if the Republicans hold on to the governor's office. In that case,  the state Supreme Court could be called upon to draw the lines as they did in  the 1970s.  </P> <P> But Quinn said it is possible there is going to be "a bipartisan deal that  protects virtually all incumbents in the Legislature and the congressional  delegation" no matter who is governor. He said the inclination in the state  Capitol is "to try to settle it without a whole lot of blood."  </P> <P> Given the nature of recent population growth, Quinn expects little change in  Assembly and Senate districts in Los Angeles County. "That delegation hasn't  changed much in many years," he noted.  </P> <P> Cain offered a similar sentiment. The reality of incumbents drawing the lines  should discourage creation of competitive seats, he said. "I don't look for any  radical shake-up of representation."  </P> <P> Here is a list of incumbent Westside lawmakers up for reelection this year:  </P> <P> </P> <P> CONGRESS  </P> <P> Rep. Anthony C.

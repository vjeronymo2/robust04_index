			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANDYE KANE LIKES HER COUNTRY OLD-TIME, TWANGY;  </P> <P> TRADITIONAL: PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY HATE COUNTRY REALLY HATE THE NEW STUFF, THE  SINGER SAYS, NOT THOSE OLD RAW, EMOTIONAL ORIGINALS.  </P> <P> Candye Kane firmly believes that country music -- traditional country music,  that is -- has universal appeal.  </P> <P> "The problem with country is that everyone lumps it all together, the modern  with the traditional," said the 28-year-old singer-songwriter, who, since  moving to Encinitas four years ago, has been perpetuating old-time twang in  nightclubs all over San Diego County, either on her own or with her backup  trio, the Jolly Ranchers.  </P> <P> "That's why you have people saying they hate country, but they really don't  know. What they really hate is the modern stuff, which is just all so polished  up," Kane said.  </P> <P> "The old twangy stuff, on the other hand, has integrity. It's raw and  emotional, and it's something everyone can relate to."  </P> <P> Judging from the audience last Sunday night at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana  Beach, where Kane and her band played their customary set of traditional  country classics -- including Patsy Cline's "Crazy," Ray Price's "Heartaches by  the Number" and Ernest Tubbs' "Walking the Floor Over You" -- she's right.  </P> <P> Out on the dance floor, a white-haired couple in matching cowboy boots did the  two-step alongside a pair of kids in T-shirts and surfer shorts.  </P> <P> In the stands, a John Wayne type wearing a straw Stetson, his eyes glued to the  stage, was tapping his feet. So was a long-haired guy in a baseball cap who  before the show had been scanning the rock-concert ads in the Sunday paper.  </P> <P> "I think traditional country music is like the white man's form of the blues,"  Kane said. "I have this image of hillbillies sitting on their back porches,  writing real songs from their hearts -- just like black blues artists, but from  a different perspective.  </P> <P> "And again, just like the blues, once you hear it, you're hooked."  </P> <P> There's a music industry adage that says it's not the singer, it's the song.  But, in Kane's case, it's both. Her audiences might be swayed by her  repertoire, but they're ultimately seduced by her voice, as sweet and pure and  crystal-clear as that of Kitty Wells, the late Cline, Loretta Lynn and other  past queens of country music.  </P> <P> Kane, who was born and raised in a rough-and-tumble neighborhood in East Los  Angeles, said she discovered the seductive power of her voice at an early age.  </P> <P> "I was one of the only white kids in my school, and I was always getting beat  up because I was a minority," she recalled. "So I started learning how to sing  oldies because that's what all the gangs and cholos listened to, and by singing  songs like 'Earth Angel' and 'Angel Baby' to these kids," and that's when she  stopped getting beaten up."  </P> <P> When she was 14, Kane said, she appeared on the nationally televised "The  Original Amateur Hour"; a year later, she encored on "The Gong Show," placing  second to "some clown jugglers."  </P> <P> By the time she dropped out of high school in 1979, Kane said, she had switched  from singing oldies a cappella to singing traditional country with an acoustic  "hillbilly" band.  </P> <P> "That's the music I grew up with," Kane said. "I listened to my mom's records,  mostly sound tracks, and the one I liked best was 'Oklahoma!' She also had a  lot of Patsy Cline records, and Patsy quickly became one of my biggest idols."  </P> <P> For the next seven years, Kane plied the L.A. club circuit, singing covers as  well as originals.  </P> <P> "I've been writing poetry since I was 12," she said. "And, when I formed my  first band, I started using some of the poems I had written to write songs."  </P> <P> It wasn't until she moved south to San Diego in 1986 -- at the behest of  Paladins bassist Thomas Yearsley, whom she later married -- that Kane began  getting some breaks.  </P> <P> In 1987, she cut a demonstration tape for CBS Records. The sessions were  financed by the label and produced by Val Garay, who has also produced albums  by Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor, the Motels and Dwight Twilley.  </P> <P> A year later, "Please Tell Me a Lie," one of her originals, wound up on "A Town  South of Bakersfield, Part II," a compilation album of songs by up-and-coming  Los Angeles-area country artists. ("Part I" contributors included Dwight  Yoakam.)  </P> <P> Next month, Kane is off to Nashville for a songwriters showcase at the Bluebird  Cafe, along with fellow locals Robert Savery and Jack Tempchin, who wrote many  hits for the Eagles and Glenn Frey.  </P> <P> "The Bluebird is where all the songwriters and music publishers and people  looking for songs congregate and find each other," Kane said. "Robert and Jack  and I have a night all to ourselves, and we're just going to swap songs and  hope something happens."  </P> <P> Kane also recently began moonlighting as a jazz singer. Starting this Friday,  she'll be at the Marie Callendar's restaurant in Encinitas every Friday evening  from 4 to 7, singing torch songs such as "Stormy Weather" and "I'm Confessin' "  in an acoustic jazz trio.  </P> <P> "It's something I've always wanted to do," Kane said. "Kay Starr, she's my  other big idol, her and Patsy Cline, and every once in a while I'll go into  some piano bar, anonymously, and just sit in and sing.  </P> <P> "After all, the old jazz is another pure form of American music, just like  traditional country."  </P> <P>  Candye Kane will be debuting her jazz trio Friday at Marie Callendar's  restaurant in Encinitas and singing traditional country with the Jolly Ranchers  on June 8 at the Del Mar Horse Show and June 13 and 23 at the Casbah in  Middletown.  </P> <P> </P></p>

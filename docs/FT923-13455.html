			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Keating's popularity sags MR Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, is losing popularity, with fewer voters seeing him as intelligent and capable as recession maintains its grip, Reuter reports from Canberra. Mr Keating's waning image was reflected yesterday in a Morgan Gallup poll, which showed that his Labor government would probably be beaten easily by the conservative coalition in an election, which must be held by May next year. Liberal leader John Hewson, long seen by voters as dull and unimaginative, is reaping the benefits of Mr Keating's decline in popularity since becoming prime minister in December after ousting Mr Bob Hawke in a party coup. Mr Keating is seen as capable and intelligent by 30 per cent of voters, compared with 37 per cent in June last year when he was treasurer, the pollsters said. Mr Hewson's 'capable and intelligent' rating was 33 per cent, down two percentage points. The government is likely to wait for the last moment, hoping for an economic turnaround, before calling an election, Labor sources said. The nationwide poll of 3,170 voters indicated 57 per cent approved of Mr Hewson as a leader, while 33 per cent approved of Mr Keating, with 10 per cent undecided. Mr Keating's approval rating in mid-March, soon after he stimulated the economy with a ADollars 2.3bn (Pounds 890m) job creation plan, was 40 per cent, against 47 per cent for Mr Hewson. But much of the money, most to improve infrastructure such as railways, has not yet been spent and the jobless toll is growing. The Morgan poll, taken in the week to July 4, indicated 36 per cent support for Labor in an election against 44 per cent for the coalition.</p>

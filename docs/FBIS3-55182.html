			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Yermolin: "Factions in State Duma in </F> Search of Accord"]    [Text] On 4 January, immediately after the new year  holiday, the leaders of the four factions in the State Duma --  "Russia's Choice," the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, the  Communists, and the Agrarian Party -- held a routine meeting on  determining who the speaker in the lower chamber and his  deputies should be. I might hazard a guess that whatever the  outcome of the meeting, it will for the moment be impossible to  talk of some stable long-term compromise between the leading  factions in the new parliament.    On the contrary, an enduring struggle is emerging between  the  newly formed parliamentary forces in the run-up to the first  session (which, I must remind you, opens on Tuesday, 11  January), with many instances of disagreement, and not just  between those whose orientations run absolutely counter to one  another. There are today no grounds for talking about any kind  of democratic bloc. The nature of the sporadic statements made  by Shakhray's and Yavlinskiy's camps bear witness to their  intention primarily to do their own thing. "Russia's Choice" is  looking very much alone at the moment.    Maybe the situation will change after "Russia's Choice"  makes  it plain that it is not claiming the role of "big brother" in  relation to its potential less numerous allies. But for the  moment it is easy to detect notes of hurt pride in the tone of  Sergey Shakhray himself and his closest associate, Konstantin  Zatulin. For example, commenting specifically on the intention  of the four aforementioned factions to "add" their own deputy  speakers to the speaker, Zatulin says that he sees in this a  threat of the next in the series of presidium dictatorships.  But Shakhray, as far as we know, absolutely avoided  participation in a negotiation process according to the formula  "four plus the others."    Strictly speaking nothing unpredictable is happening. It  would be strange if the factions, which have just emerged from  the furnace of the elections, suddenly began to fraternize  according to principles of equality and nonresistance. And if  they only took as their basis for reconciliation proposals  prepared somewhere off in a presidential commission. No, what  should have happened has happened -- that is, a power struggle.  For every former Soviet person knows: However much you talk  about the titular nature of the speaker's position, it is  nevertheless the position of the chief. Everything comes down  to the degree to which this chief will adhere to decorum and  regulations, and to how much of a professional he will be.    The only thing which is alarming is that the faction members  are clearly striving for relations based on seniority. The  number of votes received at the elections, it seems, is  beginning to fulfill the role of a distinguishing mark.  Naturally such a table of ranks produces a corresponding mood  in relations.    Nonetheless there are no grounds for absolute pessimism. I  repeat that there is in train a normal process of, let us say,  the sharing out of strategically advantageous seats in the State  Duma. In such circumstances nervousness and overwrought emotions  are unavoidable. Let us try to hope that participation in the  lawmaking process itself will settle the "Brownian motion" of  the political struggles within parliament and turn the  parliamentarians' attention to Russia's and Russians' urgent  problems.</p>

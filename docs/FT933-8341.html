			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / AT&amp;T plans merger with McCaw: Proposed Dollars 12.3bn telecommunications deal is one of biggest takeovers in US AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph announced plans yesterday for a full-scale merger with McCaw Cellular Communications in one of the US's biggest takeover deals valued at Dollars 12.3bn (Pounds 8.2bn). The all-share merger will bind the largest long-distance telecommunications company in the US to the nation's biggest operator in the cellular telephone market. The deal replaces an earlier scheme, announced in November, for AT&amp;T to acquire a one-third interest in McCaw, based in Kirkland, Washington. The proposed merger would be the largest in a series of multi-billion dollar transactions within the telecommunications sector recently - including a Dollars 5.3bn tie-up between British Telecom and MCI, and US West's Dollars 2.5bn investment in Time Warner Entertainment. BT, which had previously agreed to sell its 35.8m shares in McCaw - a 17 per cent stake - to AT&amp;T for Dollars 1.75bn, will now receive an equivalent number of shares in AT&amp;T instead, valued yesterday at Dollars 2.2bn. BT said it still intended to sell its stake when the deal was completed. In New York, AT&amp;T and McCaw said the merger agreement was an 'outgrowth of discussions' held in the wake of the proposed share stake arrangement. Mr Robert Allen, chairman of AT&amp;T, said the full merger would be 'a better financial deal for AT&amp;T. If we were right strategically and added value to McCaw (under the share stake arrangement), we'd have to pay for it later'. Nevertheless, McCaw - an entrepreneurial company which has grown quickly in the past decade from humble beginnings under its founder, Mr Craig McCaw - is currently loss-making, and carries long-term debt of Dollars 4.9bn. AT&amp;T expects to see earnings dilution of about 10 per cent in 1994, when the merger is likely to be completed, but says there will be substantial enhancement in the long term. When the proposed share stake arrangement was announced, the partnership was seen as putting AT&amp;T in direct competition with the regional Bell telephone companies for the first time since the Bell system was broken up by court order in 1984. Aside from McCaw, the wireless communications market is dominated by large local telephone companies and GTE. Mr Allen said: 'AT&amp;T is not interested in re-entering the local telephone business and today's announcement doesn't change that. More than 99 per cent of all cellular calls go through the local telephone companies.' The deal is conditional on a go-ahead from various regulatory agencies - including the Justice Department, which will look at anti-trust considerations, and both the Federal Communications Commission and certain state regulatory bodies, which must approve licence transfers. Last night, Mr James Young, general counsel for Bell Atlantic, one of the 'Baby Bells', said the proposed merger raised 'serious competitive issues'. The court agreement which broke up the old AT&amp;T, 'is being used by AT&amp;T as a competitive weapon to keep their potentially strongest competitors out of the market', he claimed. 'We and the other regional companies must be allowed to compete equally with AT&amp;T or any other company anywhere in the nation.' The FCC said the proposed merger had 'great future potential' but it would be 'open-minded on any valid opposition'. Assuming the deal goes ahead, holders of both McCaw's 'A' and 'B' shares will receive one AT&amp;T share for each McCaw share held. McCaw shareholders will end up owning around 14 per cent of AT&amp;T. On Wall Street, AT&amp;T shares slipped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 60 3/4 at the close of trading while McCaw gained Dollars 5 to Dollars 56 1/4 . Later in the day, Standard &amp; Poor's, one of the large US rating agencies, said it was retaining AT&amp;T's long-term debt and commercial paper on 'creditwatch' for a possible downgrade. But it noted that the key regulatory issues would not be resolved for at least six months.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                      BIGGEST US TAKEOVER DEALS*  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Bidder                         Target                Value     Year                                                    (Dollars)  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts     RJR Nabisco          24.6bn     1988 2  Beecham Group            ***SmithKline Beckman   16.1bn     1989 3  Chevron                     Gulf                 13.2bn     1984 4  Philip Morris               Kraft                13.1bn     1988 5  AT&amp;T McCaw                  Cellular             12.3bn     1993 6  Bristol-Myers               Squibb               12.0bn     1989 7  Time Warner                 Communications       11.7bn     1989 8  Texaco                      Getty Oil            10.1bn     1984 9  Du Pont                     Conoco                8.0bn     1981 10 British Petroleum         **Standard Oil          7.8bn     1987  -------------------------------------------------------------------- *   Nominal values, not adjusted for inflation. *** Merger **  45% minority  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Mergerstat Review  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Editorial Comment Page 15 Lex Page 16 AT&amp;T mobilises with record telecoms deal Page 17 US stocks Page 31</p>

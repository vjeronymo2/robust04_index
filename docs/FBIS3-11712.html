Precisely for this reason -- even  though we performed all the protocol formalities -- one cannot  fail to note that his stay in Brasilia was not consistent with  Brazil's importance in the hemisphere. The five hours that Gore  allocated to the last leg of his tour were enough to meet the  ends established for his trip, namely, to sign a new science and  technology cooperation treaty, to hold talks with President  Itamar Franco on the summit of the Americas (to be held in  December), and to say some things to the U.S. and Brazilian  communities. It was a working stopover, and as such, served its  purpose. From the wider viewpoint under which relations between  Brazil and the United States should be analyzed, this five-hour  stopover was enough to clearly spell out the place Brazil  occupies on the Clinton Administration's list of political  priorities: For the White House, Argentina and Chile take  precedence over Brazil.    The brevity of his stay prevented Gore from explaining to  President Franco the objectives of President Clinton's Latin  American policy. Undoubtedly, the hemispheric summit -- at  which the heads of state and government of the Americas will  discuss common economic and political problems -- is one of  these objectives, and it was discussed with the Brazilian head  of state.    The Clinton administration bases its Latin American policy  on  what is known at the U.S. Department of State as substantive  symmetry [preceding words in English]. This expression -- with  a geometrical flavor -- means, for example, that the United  States is seeking to recover a sense of belonging to society and  the community while Latin America is pursuing reconciliation  between democracy and politics; that the United States is  reforming its health care, education, and security systems while  Latin America is beginning to turn to the "social agenda." It  is from this substantive symmetry that the United States is  trying to establish a new relationship with Latin America. One  should not forget that this new approach includes problems that  have yet to be overcome, such as the fight against drug  trafficking -- which Washington deems a matter of national  security -- and the new role of the Armed Forces.    Al Gore pays more attention to environmental and  technological questions. Even though he did not directly raise  the issue of telecommunications, he must have surely left a  message -- at a time when the leading U.S. companies are  devising schemes for a worldwide telephone network, it is  unthinkable that Brazil should continue to maintain a whimsical  monopoly; but this fact merely prevents Brazil from really  entering the high-speed high-tech era.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television If you prefer factual programmes tonight's the night. Horizon (8.10 BBC2) investigates the increasing use of natural predators and parasites in pest control in preference to the chemicals which have been so heavily used in the past 50 years. Not only do pests develop resistence to chemical controls, but the poisons often reach human consumers. However, as Australia's plague of cane toads demonstrates, not all man's attempts at exploiting predators are successful. In Britain feral mink, the subject of Wildlife On One (8.30), are loathed almost as much as cane toads in Australia. Originally imported from the US to be farmed for the fur trade, they have returned to the wild, colonised most of the country, and are now reputed to be our most ferocious mammal. In a postponed programme World In Action (8.30 ITV) reports how the Japanese are logging all the hardwood out of Borneo while protecting their own timber. Channel 4 begins what is claimed to be the definitive series on The Falklands War in four parts (9.00). Panorama (9.30 BBC1) looks at death in the workplace in Britain and the way that managements almost invariably emerge unscathed.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / US funds job plan for nuclear experts in Russia THE US is to provide Dollars 25m (Pounds 14m) for an internationally sponsored 'job centre' in Russia for nuclear scientists from the former Soviet Union. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, said yesterday, after talks with President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, that Washington would contribute the money to discourage top scientists from selling their skills abroad. The scientists earn about Rbs1,200 a month. A statement issued with Russia and Germany said the centre would be 'a clearing house for developing, selecting, funding and monitoring projects that would be carried out . . . at facilities located in the Russian Federation and other interested Commonwealth states.' The scientists would 'redirect their talents to non-military endeavours'. The US also offered to supply 25 special rail containers to transport nuclear warheads to Russia from other republics. The European Community immediately gave its backing to the International Science and Technology Centre. Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC external affairs commissioner, told foreign ministers of the Twelve in Lisbon that the Community had earmarked Ecu50m (Pounds 35.6m) of 1991 technical aid for nuclear safety in the Commonwealth of Independent States, and some of this could be used to fund the nuclear job centre. Professor V. Mikhailov, head of the former Soviet Union's military nuclear programme, said last month that 100,000 people were employed making atomic weapons. Between 2,000 and 3,000 possessed key nuclear secrets. Such experts are banned from leaving the country, but the west still fears that military spending cuts will turn them into atomic mercenaries. Prof Mikhailov said skilled Russians were needed to dismantle the redundant nuclear weapons; without them, the country could be turned into 'one big Chernobyl'. The US and Russia agreed to keep working on further cuts in strategic nuclear weapons. Mr Yeltsin said he expected the matters being discussed would be ready for a formal agreement at a summit with President Bush in July. Ukraine currency talks, Page 2 Goldman Sachs hired, Page 22</p>

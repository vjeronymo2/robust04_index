			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Skandia losses deepen four-fold SKANDIA, the leading Swedish insurance group, plunged to a SKr2.45bn (Dollars 314m) operating loss in 1992, more than four times the 1991 SKr580m deficit. This followed heavy credit insurance losses, a big decline in property values and large claims from Hurricane Andrew. The group indicated last month that it would not pay a dividend after its net asset value fell 20 per cent in 1992 to SKr11.5bn. In 1991, it paid a SKr4-per-share dividend. Premiums rose 26 per cent to SKr36.5bn from SKr29.0bn, mainly because of currency changes. However, its management operating loss deepened to SKr3.64bn from SKr1.13bn, while its insurance loss rose to SKr479m from SKr441m. The company said its insurance result was hit by a small number of very large claims and, in particular, Hurricane Andrew, which caused SKr550m in losses. It reported a mixed development for its non-life insurance operations, with Sweden, Norway and Britain showing a positive trend, while Danish and Italian subsidiaries incurred losses. Falling property values, both at home and abroad, cost the group SKr1.41bn, while losses within the credit insurance sector amounted to SKr890m. The group was heavily exposed to two credit insurance companies, Svenska Kredit and International Credit, both of which collapsed last year. The management operating result also included SKr1.09bn in costs to cover discontinued business. This included a SKr200m charge for restructuring the group's reinsurance operations and costs to run off business in its Pan Financial credit insurance company. The company is aiming to cut its non-life reinsurance premium volume by 70 per cent within two years.</p>

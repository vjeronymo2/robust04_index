			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 18 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The Central  Jakarta District Court on Wednesday sentenced 21 students each  to six months minus detention time after they were proven guilty  of insulting the head of state.    Although they would only have to stay in jail for a month,  the students immediately made it known they would appeal the  verdict.    In passing the sentences, the presiding judge of each group  trial said the students together had been guilty of deliberately  damaging the dignity, honor, and the good reputation of the  president in a demonstration at the Parliament building on  December 14.    During the demonstration the students had put up banners,  posters, shouted yells, and sung songs containing insults to the  president, the judges said.    The court, however, acquitted them from the prosecutor's  accusation that they had also insulted the authorities and  official bodies.    Scores of students attending the trial shouted everytime the  judges read out the verdicts.    Nine students were held by the police for putting up posters  Wednesday morning before the trial session began.    During the session, some students held a "mock" trial  accentuated by yells and patriotic songs. The action was joined  by hundreds of students and proceeded peacefully and orderly.    According to one of the students' lawyers, Frans Hendra  Winata, the verdict was the lightest ever handed down in  political cases of the category during the new order era.    "Bonar Tigor and Nuku Suleiman were sentenced to years of  imprisonment," Winata said referring to political cases settled  in court just weeks before the students'.</p>

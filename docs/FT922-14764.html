			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): Tax the heir, not the estate - Cedric Sandford on the alternatives to IHT THE NATION arguably faces an even clearer choice over inheritance tax in the election than it does over income tax. The future form, level and even existence of death duties could depend on the result. As Norman Lamont, the chancellor, confirmed in the Budget, the Conservatives want to diminish death duties - and possibly even abolish them. This may seem odd measured against the Conservative philosophy of rewarding people according to their contribution. The entrepreneur who makes Pounds 1m because the gadget he sells delights millions of people, deserves his reward. But what does the person who inherits Pounds 1m contribute? Since 1979 the Tories have whittled away at the Capital Transfer Tax (CTT) they inherited and in the process introduced inequities so manifest that they made the abolition of the tax all the easier. CTT was a death and gift tax, levied on the donor with progressive rates up to a maximum of 75 per cent. Sir Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson, previous Tory chancellors, cut rates, raised thresholds, reduced the period in which gifts and estates were aggregated for tax purposes and increased business and agricultural concessions. In 1986, Lawson allowed gifts between individuals to be completely untaxed if made within seven years before death, and renamed what was left of CTT 'Inheritance Tax'. In doing so he flouted established terminology by which 'inheritance tax' is used for a tax on the donee and 'estate duty' for a tax on the donor. Presumably he did not wish to acknowledge that, essentially, he was bringing back the former estate duty, which had lost all credibility as a 'voluntary tax'. In 1988 he abolished the higher rates of IHT, reducing it to a single rate of 40 per cent. Formally this is progressive, because the threshold takes up a higher proportion of a small estate, so the average rate of tax is higher for the larger than the smaller estate. But it is doubtful if IHT is effectively progressive. If the very rich own private businesses or farms, they benefit from reliefs. If they do not, much of their wealth is likely to be in a form enabling them to make tax-avoiding gifts, while more modest wealth-owners will have most of their wealth tied up in houses and be much less well-placed to make gifts. The seven-year gifts provision is a state-created lottery with life, with perverse consequences. Suppose two men of the same age and wealth make similar gifts at the same time. One falls under a bus the next day while the other survives. The family more likely to need relief is that of the man who died soonest, not that of the survivor. Yet it is on the former's gift that duty is paid. Reliefs on private businesses and agricultural assets are inequitable, and of dubious economic value. If the Tories win, interests in unincorporated businesses, holdings above 25 per cent in unquoted and USM companies, owner-occupied farm lands and farm tenancies will be 100 per cent relieved of IHT while other business assets, including let farm land, will be 50 per cent relieved. But there is no reason, from economics or eugenics, to believe that the children of a successful entrepreneur or farmer are persons best equipped to succeed them. The reliefs will tend to be capitalised in the asset prices to the benefit of existing holders: tax avoidance will be encouraged, bringing into industry or land ownership those more interested in tax relief than economic efficiency; and less businesses and farms will come on to the market, reducing the opportunities of enterprising aspirants. It may be argued that the reliefs offer incentives to existing owners, who are motivated by passing on their business or farm to the next generation. But this is far from obvious. Many successful entrepreneurs have no children, so this cannot motivate them, while research suggests that 'inheritors' are much less dynamic than founders. The prospect of a large inheritance may demotivate the potential inheritor. The UK is the only OECD country which fails to support a death duty with a regular gift tax, and which gives such big reliefs for agricultural and business assets. What is the alternative? The Liberal Democrats have long advocated a donee-based tax to be charged at cumulative rates on receipts from gifts and legacies from any donor - often called an accessions tax. Labour also recognises the merits of an accessions tax and a Labour government would probably substitute one for the IHT. An accessions tax, besides getting rid of the nonsense of the seven-year rule, has two advantages over the IHT. First, it is more equitable because it taxes directly in relation to benefit received. Secondly, it should be more effective in reducing concentrations of wealth. An accessions tax offers an incentive to the wealthy to spread their wealth; if it is given or left to those who have received little by gifts or legacies, the amount of tax is reduced. More significantly, a tax on receipts strikes at the heart of the problem, because large receipts, not large estates as such, perpetuate inequality. A change from IHT to an accessions tax would increase administrative costs, but that seems a small price to pay for the benefits. The Irish Government made the change from estate duty to accessions tax some years ago and have been well pleased with the outcome.

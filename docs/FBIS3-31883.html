			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 25 Feb (TANJUG) -- Yasushi Akashi, head of  the UN peace mission for the former Yugoslavia, said in Belgrade  today that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] is more optimistic  than ever before regarding further progress in reaching a  lasting peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Following one-hour talks with Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic, Akashi told journalists that he was encouraged by  President Milosevic's readiness to support the United Nations  and UNPROFOR in their mission, and added that the talks were  very useful.    The head of the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia  rejected the possibility that the United Nations could set an  ultimatum to the warring sides in Bosnia, stressing that the  word ultimatum does not exist in the United Nations' vocabulary.    Akashi said that he had informed President Milosevic about  an  agreement reached today with Milan Martic, president of the  republic of Serb Krajina, on the resolution of the problem that  has arisen between UNPROFOR and the Krajina police regarding the  bridge near Nova Gradiska.    We also discussed the latest developments in Sarajevo and  other important issues, such as Mostar and Tuzla, he said. The  UN envoy explained that they had discussed the opening of Tuzla  airport and said: We would like to resolve this issue in a  peaceful and diplomatic way. UNPROFOR is ready to provide  certain guarantees to those who think that the airport could be  used for other than humanitarian purposes. We are ready to  guarantee that Tuzla airport will be used for humanitarian  purposes only. If the presence of officers of both sides is  necessary we are ready to let it be so, Akashi said.    He did not rule out fresh ideas on the resolution of that  issue, which would offer greater guarantees. We think it  important to resolve that issue (Tuzla airport) through an  agreement between all sides, Akashi said.    Stating that he also discussed with Milosevic the  initiative to set up a Muslim-Croat confederation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Akashi said that he believed that the  initiative was good. That is a step toward a comprehensive  peace that should not, however, involve only two, but all sides,  Akashi said.    Concerning the massacre at Sarajevo's Markale market, Akashi  said that a special five-member UN commission reached a  conclusion that the shell could have been fired from Serb or  Muslim positions. We cannot ascribe the responsibility to any  of the two sides, but we are sure that a 120-mm mortar shell  could have caused such tragic consequences, Akashi stressed.    Asked about a secret UN report which says the Muslim side is  responsible for the massacre, he said that he had heard various  reports but that he had to stick to the conclusions of the five  experts.    Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic declared on  Akashi's departure that the talks with the head of UNPROFOR were  cordial and open and that they reiterated the desire of  Yugoslavia and Serbia to see peace in Bosnia as soon as possible.    President Milosevic, Jovanovic said, expressed deep  satisfaction at the success achieved today by Mr. Akashi and  [Serb Krajina] president Martic in normalizing the situation  surrounding the bridge across the Sava.    The president recalled the support we lent to the Vance plan  and its implementation and underlined that we were convinced all  issues that crop up could be and should be resolved through  dialogue, Jovanovic added.    The Yugoslav foreign minister stressed that the talks with  Akashi emphasized the problem of the sanctions as an obstacle to  peace, because the Muslim side is still relying on hopes that  the sanctions will help it achieve what it could not achieve on  the battlefield. He said that Akashi was told that the lifting  of the sanctions would shorten the road to peace and relieve the  Muslims of that last grand illusion.    Asked about the Yugoslav stand on the opening of Tuzla  airport, Jovanovic stressed that the Serb side in Bosnia should  negotiate and decide on that. We believe that this is basically  a marginal and artificial problem that arose when the Muslim  side had to be protected against their responsibility for the  failure of the peace plan on Bosnia. The issue of Tuzla airport  should not evolve into a problem that could threaten the peace  process, and give a fresh impetus to the advocates of the war  option to further aggravate the situation in Bosnia.    Jovanovic went on to say that this issue could be  effectively  solved by introducing control of the airport, which would  involve the Bosnian Serbs, and which would theoretically and in  practical terms rule out any possibility of the airport being  misused for other [than humanitarian] purposes.    Jovanovic stressed that the issue of opening the airport in  Banja Luka would probably be raised at the same time as that of  Tuzla airport, because that [Serb-held] area needs humanitarian  aid.</p>

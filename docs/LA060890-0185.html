			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-SEAHAWK EASLEY SERIOUS AFTER SURGERY  </P> <P> Former Seattle Seahawk Kenny Easley was in serious condition today after  undergoing a kidney transplant at the University of Washington Medical Center,  a spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Spokeswoman Inez Ahina said Easley's condition was normal for someone after the  2 1/2-hour operation, which took place Thursday night.  </P> <P> Easley, 31, a safety, had been in renal failure for two years and was  undergoing kidney dialysis three times a week, said Leslie Tidball, a  spokeswoman with Easley's sports agent business, Easley Osborne Sports  Management Group.  </P> <P> Tidball said Easley had been called to the hospital Thursday for the operation  that began at 11 p.m.  </P> <P> "The doctors say he's doing very well," Tidball said, adding that Easley was  expected to be released from the hospital in 10 to 14 days.  </P> <P> Easley's seven-year NFL career ended in the spring of 1988 when an irreversible  kidney ailment was discovered during a routine physical when the Seahawks  attempted to trade him to the Phoenix Cardinals.  </P> <P> Easley, Seattle's first-round draft pick in 1981, was a five-time Pro Bowl  selection and was chosen as NFL defensive player of the year in 1984. He was a  two-time All-America at UCLA.  </P> <P> In 1989, Easley sued the Seahawks, alleging that he was allowed to play through  the 1987 season without being told that he had the kidney problem.  </P></p>

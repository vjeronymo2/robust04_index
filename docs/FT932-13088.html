			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Books: Paris killed off by academia IMAGINING PARIS: EXILE, WRITING AND AMERICAN IDENTITY by J Gerald Kennedy Yale Pounds 25, 269 pages BERNARD Shaw's aphorism about England and America being separated by a common language certainly applies to literary criticism. J. Gerald Kennedy's Imagining Paris is a case in point. The idea is interesting enough: that the reason why Paris has attracted so many American writers has had more to do with what the city represented than what it actually was. Between Henry James' ecstatic account of reeling through the streets and Mary McCarthy's decision to settle there after the Second World War, a large number of American writers have testified to the impact of Paris on their lives and work. Professor Kennedy chooses three of them: Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, and Henry Miller. An additional chapter under the heading of 'Modernism as Exile' deals briefly with Scott Fitzgerald and Djuna Barnes. Fair enough. This, after all, is what every American graduate student is taught to do. First, choose your topic, then confine it to a limited number of authors. Too many details about too many writers would arouse the antagonism of the examiners. So ignore Edith Wharton and Ezra Pound; ignore John Dos Passos, HD, William Carlos Williams, and Thomas Wolfe; ignore Sylvia Beach. Point Two: never venture your own opinion; always quote authorities. The result is a dullness beyond belief. I should know. For many years it was my lot to review the hundreds of books about American literature which pour from the university presses every year. All of them followed the same pattern whether they were called Imagining Paris or The Fine Hammered Steel of Herman Melville. One would have thought that by the time American academics had reached Professor Kennedy's maturity they would have shaken off their shackles. But no. The habit is too ingrained. But there have naturally been exceptions. FO Matthiessen, Henry Nash Smith, Perry Miller, Lionel Trilling and Yvor Winters are examples of American academics who have been bold and talented enough to move from methodology to idiosyncrasy. But it is perhaps significant that the most brilliant of them all, RP Blackmur, never went to university at all, and Edmund Wilson kept well away. None of this would matter very much if the products of American scholarship were confined to the academy for in-group seminars, but sometimes they are unleashed on the general public. Not that one should be too hard on Professor Kennedy. He obviously hasn't a clue that he is doing anything out of the ordinary. And indeed he is not. In the time-honoured fashion he trundles out one opinion after another. A Joshua Meyrowitz proclaims that television, 'that most insidious instrument of post-modern culture,' has deeply undermined our sense of place. Leonard Lutwack has remarked that we lack a theory of the formal use of place in literature. Edward Relph speaks of places as focuses of intention. Yi-Fu Tuan believes that place is a concretion of value. And so on. Yet, beyond this nonsense, there is much to commend in Professor Kennedy's study. He succeeds best where he follows the text. The Stein material comes to life as he describes Stein and Picasso embracing when they discover that the Germans have not touched Picasso's precious canvases. Henry Miller's preoccupation with images of birth and the female genitalia is (naturally) referred back to his childhood. Hemingway's latent homosexuality is also traced back - in this case to the fact that his genteel mother in Oak Park dressed him in girls' clothes. Very little of the material is original, but it is neatly brought together. So, if the reader can gloss over Professor Kennedy's authorities, there is enough to reward him in this oddly schizophrenic book.</p>

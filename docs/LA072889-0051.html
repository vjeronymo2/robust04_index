			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUND ALL DC-10S, PASSENGER GROUP SUGGESTS  </P> <P> Citing "inherent design flaws," the International Airline Passengers Assn.  suggested Thursday that the DC-10 airliner may have to be grounded "to protect  and safeguard the lives of those exposed to the perils" of flying on the jumbo  jet.  </P> <P> Officials at the Long Beach headquarters of McDonnell Douglas, manufacturer of  the jetliner, responded that the plane is a reliable, well-designed aircraft  and called the demands of the 11,000-member airline passengers' group  "ridiculous." The plane has long been certified as safe by the Federal Aviation  Administration.  </P> <P> The association's petition to the FAA -- and McDonnell Douglas' response --  came a few hours after a Korean Air DC-10 crashed while attempting to land in  Tripoli, Libya, killing at least 71 of the 199 on board. Unconfirmed accounts  indicated that the pilot had reported engine trouble before the crash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Iowa Crash Recalled  </P> <P> Just eight days earlier, a United Airlines DC-10 crashed while attempting an  emergency landing in Sioux City, Iowa, killing 111 of the 276 aboard.  Preliminary reports indicate that one of the plane's three engines exploded  during that flight, knocking out the jetliner's hydraulic control systems.  </P> <P> Aviation sources were quick to point out that McDonnell Douglas does not build  the engines used in its planes -- the engines in various models are  manufactured by General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney.  </P> <P> In his letter to FAA Administrator James P. Busey, association chairman James  E. Dunne urged that the FAA take "immediate and aggressive action" to see that  any design flaws in the DC-10 are corrected.  </P> <P> Citing the crash at Sioux City, in which fragments from the exploding engine  caused the plane's three, redundant hydraulic systems to fail simultaneously,  Dunne recalled an earlier IAPA recommendation to the FAA, which read, in part:  </P> <P> "The various parallel hydraulic and electrical systems of the DC-10 should be  sufficiently separated from each other by structure or distance, so that in the  event of accidental damage to one system, it would be unlikely that the other  backup systems could be affected by the same source of damage."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Manufacturer Responds  </P> <P> Dale Warren, a McDonnell Douglas vice president, responded Thursday afternoon  that the problems at Sioux City did not result from a lack of system  separation.  </P> <P> Warren said the three systems were cut in three different places -- separated  by at least five feet -- in the tail section of the plane when shrapnel from  the exploding engine flew in all directions in what federal investigators have  said was an extremely unusual disintegration of virtually the entire engine  shaft assembly.  </P> <P> Investigators say the loss of hydraulic fluid from all three systems meant the  pilots could no longer use the plane's normal control surfaces -- rudder,  ailerons, horizontal stabilizers, flaps, slats and spoilers -- and had to rely  solely on the two remaining engines to control the plane.  </P> <P> Warren said McDonnell Douglas has ordered no changes as a result of the Sioux  City crash, but he said the company is studying possible ways to better protect  the hydraulic systems.  </P> <P> Warren noted that DC-10s have carried more than 745 million passengers more  than 7 billion miles since they went into service in July, 1971.  </P> <P> "McDonnell Douglas believes the overall safety record of the DC-10 is worthy of  public confidence," Warren said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji said here today that the central authorities will  continue to adopt practical measures to help state-owned  enterprises overcome their difficulties.    Discussing Premier Li Peng's government work report with  deputies from Henan Province, Zhu said major state-owned  enterprises' difficulties have resulted from complicated causes.    The reform to transform their operational system has played  a  role in solving their difficulties; establishment of a modern  enterprise system will also improve the competitive environment  and operational conditions for state-owned enterprises, he said.    "Don't link the long-existing difficulties of state-owned  enterprises with this year's reform measures. At the same time,  don't expect to completely do away with historical burdens of  state- owned enterprises overnight," he said.    "The party Central Committee and the State Council will  continue to adopt practical measures to help enterprises shed  their historical burdens," he said.    It is wrong, Zhu said, for some localities to encourage or  allow a writeoff of loans for enterprises.    "This is not allowed by either policy or law," he said. "And  it won't help those enterprises change their way of operation  for the better and behave in accordance with accepted norms."    Zhu attributed the current shortage of operating funds for  enterprises to excessive investment in fixed assets rather than  to short money supply.    First, capital construction projects beyond state plans have  squeezed part of enterprises' operating funds; second, newly  completed projects having no operational funds have soaked up  part of available funds; and third, unauthorized price hikes  have taken a bite, he said.    "Without control of the excessive investment in fixed  assets,  it is difficult to change the fund-shortage situation," he said.    Banks should and will surely guarantee fund supply for  enterprises with good economic returns if no fund  misappropriation occurs, he added.    In the final analysis, he said, excessive investment in  fixed  assets and unauthorized price hikes, especially price hikes by  monopoly industries, are the main causes for fund shortages and  a debt chain for enterprises, he said.</p>

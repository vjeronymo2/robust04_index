			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN REGISTRATION PROVISION CONCERNS GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian said Monday that he is concerned that a gun registration  provision in legislation to ban assault weapons could subject law-abiding  Californians to prosecution as felons.  </P> <P> "I certainly don't think that a law-abiding citizen who may neglect or choose  not to register the gun should be found guilty or subject to a felony  prosecution," Deukmejian said.  </P> <P> It was the first time he has spelled out why he asked last Wednesday that  expected final passage of the controversial bill be held up.  </P> <P> At a press conference after a speech to the San Diego Chamber of Commerce,  Deukmejian insisted that he has not contracted a case of cold feet and still  will sign such a bill provided that it is clear and separates military-style  semiautomatic assault weapons from traditional hunting and sporting firearms.  </P> <P> He asked Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), author of the measure,  to delay a Senate vote so he can study its contents. Roberti agreed. The Senate  leader says the proposal may come for the expected final vote next week.  </P> <P> In California, registration of firearms historically has been considered  tantamount to confiscation by many gun owners. Handguns, technically, have been  registered with the state for years.  </P> <P> The assault gun ban, basically, would outlaw the manufacture, sale and, for the  most part, civilian possession of about 60 semiautomatic rifles, pistols and  shotguns effective Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Deukmejian told reporters Monday that registration of assault weapons by owners  who obtain them legally by June 1 "is one of the problems."  </P> <P> Under the bill, illegal possession effective next Jan. 1 would be punishable  either as a misdemeanor with up to one year in jail or as a felony carrying a  longer sentence in state prison.  </P> <P> Failure to register the guns proposed to be outlawed would be considered  illegal possession. Owners of assault weapons could keep them if they  registered the firearms with the state Department of Justice by Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Deukmejian said that the legal owner of such a weapon, "someone who has never  done anything wrong," should not be faced with prosecution.  </P> <P> "The idea behind any legislation like this is to get at the criminal and not  the law-abiding citizen," Deukmejian said.  </P> <P> Deukmejian, who cleared the path for a ban on assault weapons in January two  days after the slayings of five Stockton schoolchildren by a demented drifter  armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, said he has other concerns about the two  nearly identical bills by Roberti and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> In less specific terms, the governor said he is troubled by provisions of the  legislation that would seek to outlaw the manufacture of guns that were  cosmetic imitations of those that would be outlawed. He said these features are  "subject to some different interpretations."  </P> <P> On a separate subject, Deukmejian told the Chamber of Commerce that if U.S.  Sen. Pete Wilson wins the 1990 race for governor, he has no plans to seek to  replace Wilson in the Senate.  </P> <P> If Wilson wins the governor's race, he would be empowered to appoint his  successor in Washington.  </P> <P> But Deukmejian, as he has before, said he has no interest in replacing Wilson  and added, "My intention now is I'm going to get away from public life and into  the private sector."  </P> <P> Later, Deukmejian said Armenian-Americans have a "special obligation" to inform  other Americans of the Armenian genocide that occurred in 1915 when about 1.5  million Armenians perished at the hands of the Ottoman Turks.  </P> <P> In remarks during a Martyrs Day commemorative ceremony, Deukmejian, the  nation's foremost officeholder of Armenian ancestry, charged that the continued  denial of the massacres and the "obliteration of Armenian cultural landmarks  demonstrates the lengths to which Turkey is willing to go to rid itself of  anything having to do with the Armenian people."  </P> <P> "As descendants of a people who suffered terrible injustice and also as  citizens of this great land of liberty, we have a special obligation to inform  our fellow countrymen of what can happen when freedom is abridged and tyranny  imposed," Deukmejian said.  </P></p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Republics jolted by backing for expansionist Former Soviet republics reacted with concern yesterday to the strong support given to the neo-fascist leader, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has said Russia should occupy all the territories of the former USSR. From Ukraine and the Baltic states on Russia's western flank to the Central Asia republics on the south-eastern rim of the Russian Federation, republican leaders expressed their worries about Mr Zhirinovsky's showing. However, all tempered their fears with hopes of a united, anti-fascist alliance of Russian democrats and a firm rejection of Russian expansionism by the western powers. The toughest response came from the Baltic states, whose large ethnic Russian minorities make them particularly vulnerable to Mr Zhirinovsky's pledge to defend Russians no matter where they live. Leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia plan to meet in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, tomorrow, to develop a common strategy on how to deal with Russia in the aftermath of the elections, a spokeswoman for the Latvian president said. Adopting strong language laced with references to inter-war Germany, Baltic leaders urged the west to take a firm stance in the face of the possible resurgence of Russian expansionism. In Kiev, Mr Viktor Stelmakh, a spokesman for the Ukrainian president, said: 'Zhirinovsky's success does not portend well for Ukraine. 'In his election campaign, he used demagogic slogans about recreating the Russian Empire and made direct territorial claims on Ukraine.' Foreign ministry officials in Kiev said Mr Zhirinovsky's electoral triumph would make the Ukrainian parliament less likely to give up the nuclear weapons stationed on its territory. Failure to surrender the weapons has become a source of mounting concern in the US and threatens to jeopardise the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). 'Parliamentarians have said there will be no ratification of Start while there's a threat (to Ukrainian independence),' the Ukrainian official said. 'Here's concrete proof of a threat from our neighbour. For them it is proof of why we should hold on to the weapons.' Officials from Kirghizia, which was caught up in a domestic political crisis that culminated yesterday with the ousting of the entire cabinet, said they were worried by the Russian election results but would wait to see how the parliament shaped up. Officials in Belarus, one of the most conservative of the former Soviet republics, also expressed concern, while Georgian leaders took comfort in Russia's approval of a new constitution. The Russian poll result coincided with Kazakhstan's formal accession to the NPT. The Kazakh parliament, which had already agreed to give up the portion of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal on its territory, joined the accord in a session attended by visiting US Vice-President Al Gore.</p>

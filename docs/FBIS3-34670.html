The seven-kilogram (15.4-pound) batch was loaded onto a  Russian Antonov-124 plane in al-Habbaniyah airport, 60  kilometers (36 miles) west of Baghdad. The plane went to  Russia, via Kiev, Ukraine, the source added.    The fuel's removal was supervised by a seven-member team  from  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) led by Briton Gary  Dillon. The team arrived in Iraq on February 4, the source said.    The experts arranged for the fuel's transport to  al-Habbaniyah by road convoy, the source said, adding that  preparatory work had begun on January 9 at a site near Baghdad.    On December 5 the IAEA oversaw the removal from Iraq to  Russia of a first shipment of 33 kilograms (72.6 pounds) of  irradiated fuel.    Baghdad agreed last April to turn over its supplies of  irradiated fuel under UN Gulf war ceasefire resolutions on the  disarmament of Iraq.    IAEA deputy chief Maurizio Zifferero said at that time the  removal would cost Iraq several million dollars.    The Vienna-based IAEA, a UN agency, began by removing Iraq's  non-enriched uranium. A dozen kilograms (some 30 pounds) of the  material was flown out to Russia in November 1993.    On February 4, Zifferero said the Iraqi nuclear program was  "practically neutralized."    Dillon said Friday his team had set up two surveillance  cameras during its week-long mission at a nuclear site that was  part of Iraq's enriched uranium production program.    He said the IAEA experts would return within two months to  install up to 20 surveillance cameras at two or three more  sites, under Security Council Resolution 715, which calls for  the long-term monitoring of Iraq's arms programs.</p>

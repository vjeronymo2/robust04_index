			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> MAKE HER DAY -- TODAY  </P> <P> Today in Orange County, a homeless person is as likely to be a single mother  with one or more children as to be a stereotypical bum. These families find  themselves on the street in an area where rents are sky high and child- care  costs can eat up a minimum-wage salary quicker than you can say "fast-food  burger."  </P> <P> The head of one of the county's biggest charities, Episcopal Service  Alliance/South County, estimates that 30% of the 2,000 people who seek help at  ESA are single mothers and their children. But there are very few shelters for  them.  </P> <P> No private agency -- and there are far too few of them, anyway -- can make a  meaningful dent in this societal problem. But at least some are trying. A new  one is Single Mothers in Partnership, a South County group that will attempt to  bring these women together to help each other, and perhaps even to share  housing. Also, some single mothers may be matched with senior citizens who have  large enough homes -- and hearts -- to accommodate homeless families. The  organization is holding its first event today in the basement of Mission San  Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> There are an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 homeless in Orange County, and for all  this has been a hard summer. That's partly because one of the largest  charities, Share Our Selves, has been shut down. SOS is renovating new quarters  in Costa Mesa after being evicted from its long-term home at Rea Community  Center. It will reopen in September.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, other poverty agencies are being inundated. Alarmed at the  situation, United Way and the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force this  week launched a summer emergency food and shelter campaign. The campaign's aims  are ambitious: Raise $1 million, collect 500,000 pounds of food and enlist  1,000 volunteers by mid-August.  </P> <P> Supporting this effort is one of those things like apple pie and motherhood. It  should be unquestioned.  </P></p>

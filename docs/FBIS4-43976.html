			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis departed this morning  for Corfu, where this evening he will have a private meeting  with Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. Following that  meeting, Kliridhis and Papandreou will meet EU Commission  President Jacques Delors.    Replying to questions prior to his departure from Larnaca  Airport regarding last night's meeting with Joe Clark, the UN  secretary general's special representative on Cyprus, President  Kliridhis said that Clark conveyed a series of messages from the  United Nations and received a series of answers. The president  said that the Greek Cypriot side's positions remain the same.  Our side, he stressed, insists on the 21 March document and we  do not accept anything other than that document. The UN's  desire, Kliridhis added, was to see whether it would be possible  for us to accept what was agreed upon in Vienna in the absence  of the Greek Cypriot side, and they got a very clear message  that something like that will not happen. President Kliridhis  also said that he discussed with Clark all options included in  the UN secretary general's report. However, he added that Clark  was not authorized to say which option would be preferred by the  Security Council members or which option the UN secretary  general would suggest.    Called on to comment on British Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd's statement, that the two sides in Cyprus have come close  to agreement, President Kliridhis said that he had not realized  that we were very near an agreement. The president added that  there is an attempt to cultivate such a climate. There is an  attempt, he said, to create the impression that the differences  regarding the 21 March document are so small, that somehow a  solution would be found. Our view, he said, is that the  differences between the two sides are substantial.    Asked whether he is more optimistic or pessimistic following  his meeting with Clark, President Kliridhis said that his  position remains firm, that he insists on the 21 March document  and if [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas finds a way to  accept it, then his optimism will be realized. If Denktas, he  concluded, does not find a way to accept the document, then his  pessimism will be realized.    In a laconic statement after his meeting with President  Kliridhis, Clark noted that during his meetings he examined the  situation following the submission of the UN secretary general's  report and there has been no discussion of anything new.</p>

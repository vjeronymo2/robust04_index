			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA'S ARMS ABYSS;  </P> <P> BLANK CHECK; THE PENTAGON'S BLACK BUDGET BY TIM WEINER (WARNER BOOKS: $21.95;  272 PP.; 0446-51507-8)  </P> <P> Like some journalistic sorcerer's apprentice, Tim Weiner turns a perfectly  sensible thesis -- that the Pentagon's secret spending has grown excessive --  into an excessive attack on the U.S. security apparatus, especially during the  Reagan years.  </P> <P> That's too bad. For Weiner's eminently readable book, based on his Pulitzer  Prize-winning series in the Philadelphia Inquirer, makes the sound point that  the Defense Department's $36-billion "black budget," the budget hidden from  normal public and Congressional view, has grown too big. Bigger than the  federal government's budget for transportation or agriculture. Twice as big as  that for the Department of Education. Bigger, in fact, than any country's  military budget, except that of the Soviet Union. Weiner claims that it is  growing faster than any section of the federal budget.  </P> <P> Especially apt is Weiner's criticism of the more than $5 billion in "previously  public Pentagon programs" that went black between 1986 and 1989. And especially  unsettling is his finding that in the current 1991 budget, "almost twenty-five  cents of every dollar for Pentagon research is black." He raises valid legal  questions in light of the Constitutional provision that "a regular Statement  and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be  published from time to time."  </P> <P> But do such revelations warrant such hyperventilating?  </P> <P> The book's shrill tone does not jibe with its serious thesis. Weiner forecasts  the breathlessness in his Introduction: "I saw a world of secrets sealed  beneath a steely cover. I wanted to pry the lid off the box, find a way inside  and see the panorama sprawling within." And the publicity blurb hypes the book  as "as riveting as any techno-thriller, but more frightening because it is  based on fact."  </P> <P> But is it?  </P> <P> Weiner fingers the B-2 Stealth bomber, which he says "went through its research  and development in complete secrecy" whereby "Congress couldn't debate it" and  it "was invulnerable to informed criticism." True, the Stealth technology was  shrouded and the bomber kept out of sight for years. But its existence was  known from the time President Jimmy Carter flaunted it. While debate on Capitol  Hill was muted, that was mainly because the Stealth bomber wasn't controversial  until the remarkable turnabout in U.S.-Soviet relations.  </P> <P> Few Congressional leaders, moreover, can feign surprise at its price, or its  nature, for more than 170 senators and representatives and committee staffs  were given access to the B-2 program after 1981.  </P> <P> Weiner huffs about the Reagan Administration seeking to tighten federal laws so  that anyone caught publishing information on black programs could be "convicted  of high treason. Upon conviction, such a traitor could be shot to death by a  firing squad."  </P> <P> Throughout Weiner's fast-paced book, I kept wondering just how "black," secret  and stealthy all these programs really are. After all, I sit there reading  about them on page after page. After all, Weiner won a Pulitzer Prize after  writing about them in his Inquirer series.  </P> <P> In a nutshell, Weiner's impressive investigative powers negate his intelligent  thesis; little is indeed kept secret.  </P> <P> That's why I support his call for greater openness. While he believes "The  practice of black budgetry is a relic of the Cold War and should now come to an  end," I believe that broad budget categories should be unblackened.  Technologies and specific covert operations, run according to Congressional  procedures, need to be hidden from public scrutiny -- but not big-ticket items  like the overall CIA budget.  </P> <P> Speaking of the CIA -- which Weiner does incessantly, despite the book's  billing on "the Pentagon's black budget" -- I find the book's castigations  antiquated and, again, excessive. Saying that the CIA "started out trying to  save small, weak European nations from communism, and fared poorly. It found  success overthrowing small, weak Third World governments in the name of  democracy" is just not fair as a general summary of what the Agency has been  doing for the last 40 years.  </P> <P> On a more positive note, Weiner's case studies of the CIA's weapons supplies to  Afghanistan, the U.S. Army's funding of a new paramilitary force, and the  Iran-Contra fiasco make for interesting reading.  </P> <P> And he makes a sound point when saying that "the conventional wisdom of nuclear  strategy was dead wrong." For too long, the focus had been on the number of  nuclear warheads, hardened silos and missiles. The procedures for possible use  of nuclear weapons have, as Weiner points out, always been more important than  their numbers, or even types.  </P> <P> Weiner's wild words aside, his thesis deserves more serious, objective  treatment. And I do subscribe to his thrust, quoted from Lord Acton, that  "every thing secret degenerates."  </P></p>

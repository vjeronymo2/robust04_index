			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / OECD joblessness study focuses on capital tax: Long-term unemployment linked to crime and drugs Higher taxation on capital to offset reductions in non-wage labour costs is one of several radical proposals for reducing unemployment suggested in a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The draft policy conclusion of the long-awaited report, which is likely to shape debate at President Bill Clinton's Group of Seven jobs summit in March, emphasises the need for greater flexibility in labour markets to increase employment, but falls short of advocating wide US-style wage differentials and labour market deregulation. The report, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times, has just been sent to the 24 member governments. It is not due to be published until June. It finds little evidence that trade with low-wage countries is a big cause of unemployment in the developed world. It does, however, explicitly link long-term unemployment to rising levels of crime and drug abuse and an 'unravelling of the social fabric'. Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD secretary-general who was commissioned by member states to produce the report in June 1992, rejected the accusation that he was being alarmist about the effects of unemployment. 'There is a link between unemployment and crime and drugs, and I would be happy to see a mandate from member countries to study that link,' he said in an interview. He said the US had much more employment flexibility than Europe but at the expense of social solidarity, and he warned that a policy emphasis on flexibility and deregulation alone could lead to social dislocation. The OECD's policy proposals have eight points at their core: nurture an entrepreneurial climate; improve labour force skills and competences; enhance the diffusion of technological knowhow; increase wage and labour cost flexibility; reform job security provisions; increase working-time flexibility; encourage a switch from passive to active labour market measures; and reform benefit systems to increase work incentives. On cutting non-wage labour costs, the report says: 'A significant revenue-neutral cut in payroll taxes could yield important increases in employment over the medium term.' With international co-ordination, the burden should be switched to consumption taxes, environmental taxes or higher effective taxation of capital income. On training, the report says that levy systems - where companies pay a proportion of the wage bill on training or pay an equivalent levy - have been a disappointment. But the OECD does suggest that countries should reform accounting standards for training expenditure and allow the costs of training to be written off over the lifetime of the asset and not just when the cost was incurred. It also argues that statutory minimum wages can have a negative effect on employment and that their redistributive goals can be achieved more effectively through income supplements.

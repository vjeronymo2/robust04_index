			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Yegorov, president of the Association </F> of Russian Banks, by Yelizaveta Volgina: "Competition in the  Banking Sphere Must be Sensible"]    [Text] A great deal has been said about foreign banks'  penetration of the Russian market. The arguments for and  against are well known. Only the circumstances and the mood  among state officials change. Despite the Russian Federation  president's edict restricting foreign banks' activities in  Russia until 1996, the Central Bank leadership is making its own  plans: To start issuing licences to foreigners this very June.  Russian bankers are protesting... Sergey Yegorov, president of  the Association of Russian Banks, gives his account.    [Volgina] Sergey Yefimovich, one of the most awkward  questions for Russian bankers at the moment is the penetration  of of our market by foreign banks with their potential. You  used to take a negative view of foreign capital coming into  Russia. What is your view of this problem today?    [Yegorov] In principle the Association of Russian Banks is  in favor of foreign investments and foreign banks in Russia. We  would not want foreign banks to be barred from the Russian  economy and banking system forever. But we believe that the  influence of foreign capital should be temporarily restricted,  so that we are not prevented from establishing our own banking  system. This is a very important point, because economic  reforms are simply impossible without a well organized national  banking system. This system is a key component of the market  reforms. The creation of it is a very painstaking task, which  no one is going to do for us, no foreign states, no foreign  banks. If we look at it from the viewpoint of the state, the  question now is as follows: Do we need a national banking  system and what does that entail?    [Volgina] And what is the answer to this question?    [Yegorov] It is necessary and it is being actively created.  But we must look at the question from the other angle: How  important is international banking practice to us and how active  should we be in encouraging the establishment of foreign banks  in the Russian economy. We must also bear in mind the fact that  since our banking system is just finding its feet at the moment  and is not yet ready for serious competition, what we have to  create first is favorable conditions for national banks. Even a  country like Spain, a country with a developed market economy,  let foreign banks into its economy only recently -- two years  ago. Hitherto it has been extremely difficult to open a foreign  bank in Japan. All countries try to protect national interests.  So we must use -- wisely, of course -- a system of  protectionism, bearing in mind that all sectors of the national  economy must be under state tutelage. In particular, such a  delicate instrument as the banking system.    [Volgina] In what way is foreign banks' active penetration  of the economy damngerous?    [Yegorov] Money is an instrument with which you can command  an entire economy. The entire capital of our young banks may be  smaller than the capital of some foreign bank... It is  perfectly clear that our banks will be taking up the rear and  will be unable to compete in equal terms with foreigners.    [Volgina] But it is competition that should be the basis of  all banking...    [Yegorov] Yes, but it must be sensible. Now is not the time  to give foreign banks extensive access to the Russian economy.  It is not a matter of fear. It is a real awareness of the  situation that prevails in the banking sphere. Therefore the  president issued an edict stating that the issuing of licences  to engage in banking activities in the Russian economy must be  delayed for a while -- until 1 January 1996. This edict is  absolutely correct. It enables us to grow stronger, to equip  ourselves, and to train staff. Then we will be ready to compete  with foreign banks. Remember Solzhenitsyn's "The Calf and the  Oak Tree"? Well, foreign banks are an oak tree we could break  our horns on.</p>

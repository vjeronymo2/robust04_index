			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, provincial CPC Secretary Zhang Boxing  addressed the closing ceremony of a theoretical study class for  leading cadres of the provincial democratic party branches, the  Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-party personages.  He pointed out: When we study theories, we should pay  attention to linking them with practice. We must make use of  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to  conscientiously sum up new experiences in strengthening the  building of democratic parties themselves, persisting in and  improving multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the  CPC, and promoting the political consultative system, so that  democratic parties can play their role in a still better way by  participating in and discussing government and political affairs  in China's political life and democratic supervision.    In his speech, Zhang Boxing also said: Now we are living in  an age of great transformation, and it is more urgent and  necessary for us to study theory. Establishing a socialist  market economic system is precisely a great and creative  undertaking. It is a strenuous and heavy task. In facing the  new situation and new task, there are a lot of things which we  are not familiar with or aware of. On the road of progress, we  will encounter many complicated things which we never  experienced in the past. Only by studying well the theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics can we fully  grasp the dialectical relations of reform, development and  stability, and can we properly handle various kinds of social  contradictions to ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening  up and modernization.    While dwelling on the issue of developing our province's  economy and taking the road of common prosperity, Zhang Boxing  stressed: The key to narrowing the gaps between our province and  the advanced areas and taking the road of common prosperity lies  in persisting in developing the productive forces. To develop  the productive forces, we must emancipate our minds, seek truth  from facts, and seize the favorable opportunity. We must work  with perseverance and overcome difficulties to resolutely push  reform forward.    He continued: To narrow the gaps, we must also continue to  carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-reliance. In the  course of developing the state-owned economy, we must make great  efforts to develop our new publicly-owned economy and township  and town enterprises and must firmly grasp the nongovernmental  economy. Only thus can we constantly enhance our province's  economic strength and have sufficient financial, material and  manpower resources to support the impoverished areas. Only thus  will our people boost their confidence in construction and  improve their livelihood. Zhang Boxing also expressed the hope  that participating comrades would work in close cooperation,  unite as one, and suggest ways and means to promote our  province's economy.</p>

Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Tian Jiyun made  the remark when delivering a work report of the NPC Standing  Committee here today.    He said, as China has instituted this year more reform  measures than before, it is necessary to guide, promote and  guarantee reforms with law. This calls for accelerating  legislation, especially economic legislation.    The five-year tenure of the eighth NPC is an important  period  for China to establish a socialist market economy and realize  the second-phase goal of the modernization program. The NPC  Standing Committee has worked out its work priorities in  accordance with the general situation and tasks of the state:  under the guidance of the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the basic line of the Communist  Party, to take the strengthening of a socialist democratic and  legal system as its fundamental task, further improve the  people's congress system, ensure enforcement of the Constitution  and law, and push forward the development of a socialist market  economy.    In the past year, the NPC Standing Committee formulated,  amended and adopted 21 laws and law-related decisions, including  13 relating to a socialist market economy, setting a record in  legislative work. In addition, it approved 17 treaties,  conventions and agreements signed with foreign countries or  acceded to by China.    During the year, the NPC Standing Committee and the special  committees assigned 37 inspection groups to examine the  enforcement of 18 laws. At the same time, the Standing  Committee heard and deliberated work reports on finance, foreign  trade, education, anti-corruption and civil aviation submitted  by the State Council, relevant departments, and the Supreme  People's Procuratorate.    Tian noted that raising motions and suggestions is an  important form for deputies to exercise their right to  administer state affairs and help state organs accept people's  supervision and improve their work.    At the first session of the eighth NPC last year, deputies  put forward 611 motions. Ninety-three of the motions have been  submitted to special committees for deliberation. Most of them  relate to legislation. The remaining 517 motions were handled  as suggestions and criticisms, and together with 2,325 pieces of  suggestions, have had responses from relevant departments.    Development of exchanges with foreign parliaments is a  component of state foreign affairs as well as an important task  for the Standing Committee. In the past year, delegations  headed by the chairman or vice chairmen of the NPC Standing  Committee visited 26 countries, while the Standing Committee  received visiting delegations of 37 parliaments or international  parliamentarian organizations.</p>

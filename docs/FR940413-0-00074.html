			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The January 7, 1994 proposed rule incorporated the statutory requirements for obtaining approval to designate public housing for occupancy by disabled families or by elderly families, and supplemented the statutory requirements with regulatory ones. By the expiration of the public comment period on March 8, 1994, 101 comments were received. Approximately another 200 comments were received within the two weeks following the expiration of the public comment period. All comments timely submitted were reviewed and considered. In order not to delay final rulemaking on designated housing, the Department made every effort to review the 200 comments received after the close of the public comment period. The Department believes that the comments addressed in the preamble to this rule reflect the major concerns and issues raised by all commenters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters included housing authorities, associations representing housing authorities, elderly persons, organizations representing the interests of elderly persons, persons with disabilities, organizations representing persons with disabilities, State and local offices on aging, and State and local offices that address such matters as mental health, human services and rehabilitative services. The majority of the commenters were housing authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters expressed support for the Department's proposed implementation of section 622, and praised the Department's efforts to strike a balance between section 622 and the civil rights protections for persons with disabilities contained in the Fair Housing Act, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, the majority of the commenters were highly critical of the proposed rule. While the commenters in favor of the proposed rule were primarily persons with disabilities, their advocacy organizations, and State and local offices that address disability issues, supporters of the proposed rule also included housing authorities. While the commenters opposed to the rule were predominantly housing authorities, associations representing housing authorities, elderly persons and their advocacy organizations, and State and local offices that address elderly issues, these commenters were joined by persons with disabilities and their advocacy organizations in voicing objections to sections of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions in the proposed rule that received the greatest criticism were those provisions that addressed the allocation plan and the supportive service plan requirements. The commenters stated that the Department made both plans unnecessarily complex and unduly burdensome, with the result being that it would be impossible for PHAs to obtain approval to designate housing for elderly families or disabled families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is appreciative of all comments submitted on the January 7, 1994 proposed rule. While many commenters simply expressed their general support or opposition to the proposed rule, other commenters carefully reviewed the rule, and offered detailed and helpful comments on regulatory implementation of section 622. The Department is aware that PHAs and other members of the public are anxious to have final regulations issued for section 622, and that the rulemaking process has taken longer than anticipated or desired. The Department believes, however, that this final rule, which takes into consideration public comment, improves the designated housing process and better serves PHAs and the families that they house.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Clarification of Relationship of Designated Housing Process to Statutes Prohibiting Nondiscrimination Against Elderly Persons or Persons With Disabilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain questions and issues raised by a few commenters made the Department aware that there may be some misunderstanding about the obligations of PHAs that operate designated housing under statutes that contain civil rights protections for elderly persons and persons with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notwithstanding the permissibility of PHAs to designate public housing projects for occupancy by elderly families or by disabled families, PHAs must comply with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Fair Housing Act, the Age Discrimination Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other applicable civil rights statutes and their implementing regulations. Section 622 does not alter the obligations and requirements imposed on PHAs by these statutes and their implementing regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, a PHA may not deny an elderly person who also is a person with disabilities admission to a designated project for elderly families, in whole or in part, on the basis of the elderly person's disability. Similarly, a PHA may not deny a person with disabilities admission to a designated project for disabled families on the basis of the person's age.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also notes that several commenters criticized the proposed rule on the basis that it appeared overly concerned with the housing needs of non-elderly disabled families. The Department does not believe that the concern for the housing needs for non-elderly disabled families as expressed in the proposed rule, and in this final rule, is unfounded or inconsistent with the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is aware, as was the Congress in enacting this legislation, that the majority of projects to be designated will be for elderly families, and the group that will be most affected by this designation will be non-elderly disabled families. Even without the requirement to submit a supportive service plan in addition to the allocation plan, persons with disabilities are not demanding their own separate housing projects as are elderly families. Thus, out of concern that non-elderly disabled persons may have public housing assistance reduced as a result of designation of projects for elderly families, the Congress requires in section 622 that a PHA, in planning how it will allocate its housing resources among the families that it serves, must secure additional housing resources ``that will be sufficient to provide assistance to not less than the number of non-elderly disabled families that would have been housed if occupancy in such units were not restricted pursuant to this section.'' The proposed rule's concern, and that of this final rule, that persons with disabilities not be under-served by the designated housing process is not inconsistent with the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The prescribed components shall be designated as column headings and they may be abbreviated in the schedules. The financial data required by &sect;630.20(m)(2)(i) shall include the financial data required to be submitted by each bank pursuant to the requirement of &sect;630.4(c)(1)(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The supplemental information may be presented separately or in accompanying notes to the Systemwide combined financial statements and shall contain additional disclosures sufficient to explain the basis of the presentation of the supplemental information, the components, and any adjustments contained therein to enable readers to understand the effect of each component on the Systemwide combined financial statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n) List the names of the System Audit Committee members in the report to investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (o) Include a detailed index setting forth the major disclosure captions of this subpart and the page or pages on which the required information appears in the report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart C_Quarterly Reports to Investors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;630.40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Contents of the quarterly report to investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The quarterly report to investors shall contain the information specified in this section along with any other material information necessary to make the required disclosures, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The quarterly report must be presented in a format that is easily understandable and not misleading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rules for condensation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this subpart, major captions to be provided in interim financial statements are the same as those provided in the financial statements contained in the annual report to investors, except that the financial statements included in the quarterly report may be condensed into major captions in accordance with the rules prescribed under this paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interim balance sheets.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When any major balance sheet caption is less than 10 percent of total assets and the amount in the caption has not increased or decreased by more than 25 percent since the end of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interim statements of income.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When any major income statement caption is less than 15 percent of average net income for the 3 most recent fiscal years and the amount in the caption has not increased or decreased by more than 20 percent since the corresponding interim period of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others. In calculating average net income, loss years should be excluded. If losses were incurred in each of the 3 most recent fiscal years, the average loss shall be used for purposes of this test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The interim financial information shall include disclosure either on the face of the financial statements or in accompanying footnotes sufficient to make the interim information presented not misleading. It may be presumed that users of the interim financial information have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year, and the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. Accordingly, footnote disclosure that would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the most recent audited financial statements (such as a statement of significant accounting policies and practices) and details of accounts that have not changed significantly in amount or composition since the end of the most recently completed fiscal year may be omitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Interim reports shall disclose events that have occurred subsequent to the end of the most recently completed fiscal year that have a material impact on the System. Disclosures should encompass, for example, significant changes since the end of the most recently completed fiscal year in such items as accounting principles and practices, estimates used in the preparation of financial statements, status of long-term contracts, capitalization, significant new indebtedness or modification of existing financing agreements, financial assistance received, significant business combinations and liquidations of System institutions, and terminations of System institution status. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, where material contingencies exist, disclosure of such matters shall be provided even though a significant change since yearend may not have occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) In addition to meeting the reporting requirements specified by existing accounting pronouncements for accounting changes, state the date of any material accounting change and the reasons for making it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Any material prior period adjustment made during any period covered by the interim financial statements shall be disclosed, together with its effect upon net income and upon the balance of surplus for any prior period included. If results of operations for any period presented have been adjusted retroactively by such an item subsequent to the initial reporting of such period, similar disclosure of the effect of the change shall be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all adjustments that are necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. A statement to that effect shall be included. Furnish any material information necessary to make the information called for not misleading, such as a statement that the results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) If any amount that would otherwise be required to be shown by this section with respect to any item is not material, it need not be separately shown. The combination of insignificant items is permitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion and analysis of interim financial condition and results of operations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Discuss any material changes to the information disclosed to investors pursuant to &sect;630.20(g) that have occurred during the periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. Provide any additional information needed to enable the reader to assess material changes in financial condition and results of operations between the periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

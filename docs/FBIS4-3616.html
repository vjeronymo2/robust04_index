			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By trainee WEN WEI PO reporter Fang Hsiao-i (2075 2556 </F> 1837): "Wu Jianmin Comments on Handling of Xi Yang Case, Says It  Is China's Internal Affair"]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Apr (WEN WEI PO)--Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Wu Jianmin commented on the Xi Yang case at a Foreign  Ministry news briefing here. He said that the case had  absolutely nothing to do with most-favored-nation [MFN]  treatment and that the handling of the case had nothing to do  with Sino-British relations and with confidence in Hong Kong.    A Hong Kong Commercial Radio reporter said that a few days  ago the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong had publicly supported Xi  Yang. The reporter went on to ask the spokesman whether or not  he was worried about the impact of this incident on China's  efforts to strive for MFN treatment. Wu Jianmin said that the  Xi Yang case was a criminal case, whereas MFN treatment is an  issue between China and the United States. He said that these  two things have nothing to do with each other, therefore, we did  not have anything to worry about.    A Hong Kong Asia Television reporter said that as far as Xi  Yang's case was concerned, the Hong Kong Government wanted to  make representations to the Chinese side through the British  Embassy in China, while the British Government had summoned the  Chinese ambassador to Britain, but these two diplomatic channels  were to no avail. The reporter asked whether or not the case  was related to Sino-British relations? Wu Jianmin replied that  the reason was very simple as the handling of the Xi Yang case  was an internal affair which had nothing to do with Sino-British  relations.    Another Hong Kong reporter asked whether or not the verdict  on Xi Yang would undermine people's confidence in Hong Kong  after the its return in 1997. Wu Jianmin said: China is a  country ruled by law and Xi Yang's case was handled strictly in  accordance with the law. It has nothing to do with confidence in  Hong Kong. From 1 July 1997, the Chinese Government will firmly  implement the policy of one country, two systems in the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region and work in accordance with  the Basic Law. We are fully confident of maintaining Hong  Kong's long-term prosperity and stability and worries are  unfounded.</p>

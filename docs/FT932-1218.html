			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Prudential unit sues Goldman Sachs A US SUBSIDIARY of Prudential, the UK insurance group, has filed a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs, charging the Wall Street securities house with committing fraud over the 1988 leveraged buy-out of Bucyrus-Erie, a Milwaukee-based manufacturer of mining equipment. PPM America, the US fund-management arm of Prudential, is suing Goldman on behalf of Jackson National Life, a Prudential-owned insurance company based in Michigan which bought Dollars 60m of Bucyrus-Erie bonds through a private placement in 1990. The lawsuit, filed in New York, alleges that Goldman rendered Bucyrus-Erie insolvent and incapable of meeting its debt obligations through a series of 'fraudulent conveyances, violations of the federal securities laws, common law fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentations.' Three months ago, the highly-leveraged Milwaukee company failed to meet interest payments on its Dollars 191m of long-term debt. It is currently attempting to put together a financial restructuring, which is likely to involve a filing for bankruptcy. The involvement of Goldman dates back to 1988, when the investment bank organised a Dollars 300m leveraged buy-out of Bucyrus-Erie. The LBO left Goldman, which is reported to have committed only Dollars 1m of its own equity to the deal, holding 37 per cent of the newly private company. PPM America alleges that the deterioration of Bucyrus-Erie's finances following the 1988 LBO led Goldman to 'fraudulently misrepresent' the sale of new bonds to Jackson National in 1990. Additionally, PPM claims that the terms of the LBO 'placed the Goldman group in control of (the company) so that they could realise all the benefits of operating BE while BE's unsecured creditors assumed all of the financial risks associated with such operations.' A small group of investment firms and funds that invested in the Bucyrus-Erie LBO with Goldman were also named as defendants in the suit. A spokesman for Goldman was unavailable for comment last night.</p>

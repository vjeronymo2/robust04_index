			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Absorbing and confusing - Mergers and buy-outs play havoc with portfolios / Equities, French Market Profile FRENCH FUND managers and individual shareholders have watched helplessly over the last year, as the list of stocks in their portfolios has changed and dwindled without any intervention on their part. A wave of mergers and buy-outs has eliminated from the French stock-exchange list a growing number of companies ' often already controlled, clearly or in practice, by a larger group, but nevertheless in many cases interesting components for a fund manager's portfolio. Under France's merger process, one company can be absorbed into another following a vote at a shareholders' meeting. Minority shareholders who might want to hold on to their shares have no choice. This process has in recent months seen the absorption of Dumez, the construction company, into Lyonnaise des Eaux, the water group; or Facom, a maker of hand-tools, into Strafor, the office furniture group; of Compagnie Francaise de l'Afrique Occidentale (CFAO), the distribution and African trading company, into Pinault, the timber group. More recently, Alcatel Alsthom, the electrical engineering and telecommunications group, has announced plans to absorb three of its listed subsidiaries, including Generale Occidentale, formerly the holding company of Sir James Goldsmith. Total, the oil major, plans to do the same with its portfolio holding company Omnium Financier de Paris. Paribas, the investment banking group, adopted a different procedure. Rather than merging, it chose to offer its own shares in exchange for those of Poliet and Ciments Francais, two building material companies which it already controlled. Although this technique leaves minority shareholders with the option of hanging on to their shares, this particular deal caused even greater annoyance, especially among foreign fund managers. After selecting a cement or construction investment for their portfolio, most were furious at being offered an exit into a banking stock. Although this wave of mergers and buy-outs has provoked laments in the French financial press about the dwindling choice offered to investors on the Paris stock exchange, however, some investors have viewed it as a healthy reorganisation of the stock-exchange list. One of the problems with the Paris market, these commentators remark, is that so many of the companies listed on the exchange are controlled by other companies. French investors seem not to worry too much about their lack of voting power in a wholly-controlled company ' wrongly, perhaps, in the light of the numerous occasions in recent years, when minority shareholders have been royally fleeced by the dominant shareholder ' but at the very least, this state of affairs reduces the liquidity of the stock. Often, particularly on the second market, the free float of shares is less than 15 per cent, making it impossible for major investors to deal in any significant size. Even among the bigger companies which are not wholly controlled, a formal or informal pact among the 'hard core' friendly shareholders often reduces the real free float to 50 per cent or less. Bank of France statistics suggest that 35 per cent of listed shares in 1989 were owned by individuals, 20 per cent by institutional investors, 21 per cent by industrial and commercial companies and 23 per cent by foreigners. But stockbrokers DLP James Capel estimate that 50 per cent of the real float of the shares making up the CAC-40 index are held by foreigners. Among French investors, the statistics are open to some interpretation. The latest figures for the number of individual shareowners stand at around 6m, but these date back to 1988, just after the series of privatisations which brought a wave of new investors into the equity market for the first time ' Paribas alone attracted 3.8m small shareholders on its privatisation in 1987. Many of these neophyte shareholders have since sold out, or transferred their holdings into mutual funds, which account for around 8 per cent of equity investment. France's mutual fund industry as a whole is larger than the rest of Europe's put together, with over FFr1,444bn (Pounds 142.80bn) under management at the end of January in Sicavs, or Societes d'Investissement a Capitaux Variables (the main form of mutual fund), according to Europerformance, the specialist organisation which monitors the sector. However, the bulk of this money ' FFr1,052bn ' is invested in money-market or bond funds. French equity funds are much weaker, and several French banks have gone to the UK to look for additional equity fund-management expertise: Societe Generale, the big high-street bank, acquired Touche Remnant, Banque Indosuez, the investment banking arm of the Suez group, bought Gartmore, and Credit Commercial de France, the medium-sized commercial bank, took over Framlington. The Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB) says the amount of money invested through Sicavs in French shares plunged in the first nine months of last year by FFr40bn, to finish up at only FFr102bn at the end of September. One of the problems is that the government's latest tax-sheltered savings plan, the highly successful Plan d'Epargne Populaire, or Pep, is designed more to help fixed-interest investment ' unlike its predecessors, the Monory plan or the Delors Compte d'Epargne en Actions, which explicitly set out to boost equity investment. Savers are putting their money either in the Pep, which attracted FFr105bn last year, or in short-term money-market Sicavs. This has not stopped the CAC-40 index from climbing back to a band around 1850, but as companies start to call for cash ' such as Beghin-Say with a FFr3bn combined rights and convertible bond issue ' it puts a crimp in the flow of funds into the equity market. If the Paris index is to reach again the peak of 2141 it achieved a year ago, it will depend heavily on new investment from foreign institutions to fill this gap.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Letter: Deterring the cynical Sir, The arguments made by the Credit Protection Association (CPA) against interest on overdue commercial debts ('Interest on late debts attacked', February 5) are ill-informed and fundamentally flawed. Such a statute would not give customers extended credit but where unauthorised credit was taken would impose the costs incurred on the late payer. Businesses which pay late already use their suppliers as unpaid bankers; statutory interest would make them pay for the privilege. Efficient collection of debts will, of course, still be important. But by deterring the cynical and calculating late payer, it will be easier to identify and pursue high-risk debts at an early stage.

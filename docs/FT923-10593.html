			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / IMF low-interest facility extended for further year THE International Monetary Fund has decided to extend for one more year its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (Esaf), a fund used to provide special low-interest loans to the poorest third world countries. Esaf, which was set up in 1987, had been due to expire at the end of November, after a one-year extension last year. But the IMF agreed on Monday to a further year. The fund is intended to provide balance of payments support to the poorest IMF member countries, at an interest rate of only 0.5 per cent a year. Finance ministers of the Group of 24 developing nations made a strong plea at this year's spring meeting of the IMF for Esaf to be made permanent, but the policy-making interim committee remained silent on the issue. Although 72 low-income countries are eligible for Esaf assistance, China and India have said they do not intend to call on the fund. Only 19 countries had in fact used the facility by March this year. Most of the Esaf user countries are in Africa, but Bangladesh and Bolivia have also borrowed from the fund.</p>

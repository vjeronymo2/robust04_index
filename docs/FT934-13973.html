			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Euro-convertible bond in yen offered by F&amp;C trust FOREIGN &amp; Colonial Pacific Investment Trust is planning to launch the first Euro-convertible bond to be issued by a UK investment trust in yen, which it hopes will raise Y8bn (Pounds 49.2m). Proceeds will be used to replace existing short-term multi-currency loans of between Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m, and will enable the trust to reduce its borrowing costs significantly, according to Mr Eric Elstob, deputy chairman of the trust. The seven-year convertible bonds have an annual coupon of 3 per cent and the conversion premium will be between 15-20 per cent over the share price at the time of pricing. The bonds, available in bearer or registered form, are aimed at continental European investors who want exposure to the yen, rather than at the typical UK private investor. The trust has gross assets of about Pounds 430m of which 40 per cent are in Japan so it wants to match its yen liabilities with yen assets. The bond issue requires approval by shareholders and warrant holders. Main institutional shareholders include Sun Life and Save &amp; Prosper. The trust invests in the Pacific region and shares have recently been trading at a discount of about 6 per cent to net asset value. With a coupon of 3 per cent, the trust is paying 'a significantly lower coupon than if it were to offer a sterling-denominated convertible bond, and a much lower coupon than for seven-year straight debt,' said Mr Christopher Purvis at SG Warburg Securities, manager for the issue.</p>

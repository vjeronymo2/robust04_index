			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: Clinton resolute but sees perils PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has committed himself resolutely, but not irrevocably, to the cause of Mr Boris Yeltsin. With a flurry of supportive statements and a concerted effort to put new wheels on the western aid train, Mr Clinton has made clear he viewed Mr Yeltsin not just as the current office-holder, with whom the US must deal willy-nilly, but as the best hope for democracy and market-based reform in Russia. But Mr Clinton is also aware of the perils of hitching his policies too firmly to Mr Yeltsin's wagon - all the more so as he accused former President George Bush last year of the same misguided adherence to Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union. Several Russian experts and some newspaper editorialists have accused Mr Clinton of making the same mistake. Criticism became especially pointed when an unnamed senior administration official indicated the US would look the other way if Mr Yeltsin were to adopt unconstitutional means in his battle with the Russian Congress. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who has consistently warned against pinning US policy too firmly to any one leader, sees a strong possibility of Russia relapsing to Pinochet-style authoritarian rule under one of a number of contenders, including Mr Yeltsin. But politicians from both US parties have been more understanding of Mr Clinton's predicament, generally concurring he has no choice but to support Mr Yeltsin, at least as long as the Russian leader is committed to battling the Congress at the ballot box rather than the streets. Some, indeed, would like Mr Clinton to make even clearer whose side he is on.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Broadcast law overhaul urged Mr Louis Sherwood, chairman of HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west country, will tell shareholders tomorrow that there is an urgent need for a new broadcasting act. Mr Sherwood intends to use the platform of the company's annual general meeting to warn that there are so many unresolved problems arising from the 1990 Broadcasting Act that only comprehensive legislation will do. The HTV chairman believes the issues range from the Channel 4 campaign to rid itself of the 'safety net', which will probably mean a Pounds 50m payment to ITV this year, to ownership rules for ITV, and whether British Telecommunications should have the freedom to be a broadcaster. Other problems include future ownership of Independent Television News; the extent to which the regulator, the Independent Television Commission, can dictate programme schedules; and whether existing programme subsidies for the smallest ITV companies should continue. HTV last year opposed the change in the takeover rules that enabled Carlton to take over Central; Granada to take over London Weekend; and MAI, the company that controls Meridian, to swallow Anglia Television. HTV believes little has been achieved as a result, although the deals cost Pounds 50m in banking and legal fees - worth 100 hours of drama. Mr Sherwood is expected to denounce what he believes are two myths that have gained growing support. They are that ITV needs to have big companies to export programmes around the world, and that television should be treated like any other sector in competition terms. The HTV chairman will tell shareholders he knows of no country in the developed world that does not have special rules for television. There is a growing feeling in government that a new broadcasting act is becoming more necessary. The eventual form will probably depend on what decisions are taken on the future of the BBC and cross-media ownership rules.</p>

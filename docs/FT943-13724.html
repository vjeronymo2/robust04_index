			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (20): Price of success - Trade unions are changing Today's South Africa is a country of many parallel revolutions: virtually every institution of state or society is undergoing dramatic change, not least the trade union movement. The union movement, itself an important catalyst of political change during the bad times of apartheid, is today paying the price for its success. The African National Congress, which arguably could not have achieved power without union help, has poached the best and brightest unionists for the government of national unity. Mr Jay Naidoo, formerly general secretary of the most powerful union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), has one of the most important jobs in the new government: he is minister without portfolio in the President's office, charged with overseeing the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Fellow unionist Mr Alec Erwin is deputy minister of finance, Mr Sydney Mufamadi, a former Cosatu official, has the powerful post of minister of safety and security (police), and other unionists serve as influential advisers to ministers or MPs. Overall, Cosatu has lost some 100 of its leaders in recent months, not only to high offices of state, but to the private sector and academia. The result is a crisis of leadership, which could have important implications for labour relations and economic development in the months and years to come. Strong leaders will be required to ensure that South Africa's powerful unions contribute to the process of making the public and private sectors more competitive and productive, rather than fighting change. With 3.5m members, or 26 per cent of the economically active population, the unions are a leading force in society. Cosatu has 1.3m members. Cosatu's outgoing leaders laid a firm basis for co-operative change before leaving the movement, through their participation in various tripartite negotiating forums bringing together business, unions and government for the first time. They brought imagination, pragmatism and clear strategic thinking to bear on the problems of industrial restructuring and socio-economic development, and key thinkers such as Mr Ebrahim Patel of the South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union will continue to do so. But the unions' clout within such corporatist structures will inevitably diminish - at least until a new crop of articulate and forceful unionists can emerge to take the place of those lost. And perhaps more importantly, the leaders' ability to deliver the co-operation of the union rank and file may also be jeopardised; already mine employers report discipline problems at the mines, the direct result of union loss of authority. Government officials believe strong union leadership is essential to South Africa's economic recovery. Tariff reform, prompted by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, will cause upheaval in sectors such as textiles, the motor industry and electronics. Across-the-board wage restraint is viewed as necessary for the success of the Reconstruction and Development Programme, and to rebuild confidence in the economy before measures such as removing exchange controls can be taken. Weak leaders cannot hope to deliver union acceptance of these and other unpopular measures. Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, says the question of wage restraint has not yet been 'battened down.' 'I think a compact as such is not on the cards, but I think a tacit, never-expressed understanding is possible,' he said. His successor, Mr Chris Liebenberg, will be equally keen to secure such an understanding. Government seems to be proposing that Cosatu temper wage demands in exchange for large private-sector programmes to train and upgrade workers and government action to improve what unionists call the 'social wage' - improved social services which reduce the cost pressure of education, health care and transport on workers' pay. Mr Sam Shilowa, Cosatu's new general secretary, seems tacitly to accept this arrangement, although he rules out any unilateral union offer of wage moderation. 'You don't call for wage restraint in a situation where there is no social programme to take the strain off people's salaries. Anyone speaking about wage restraint would first have to tell us what has changed in terms of the distances that have to be travelled from Soweto to Johannesburg, and in terms of the living standards of our people.' But even if Cosatu leaders accept such a 'never-expressed understanding', will their members agree? In many sectors, real wages have fallen over the past four years of recession, and with the economy recovering and Cosatu's political allies in power for the first time, the trend may be towards greater union militancy, rather than moderation. Cosatu officials predict a fairly turbulent year, not necessarily over wages, but issues such as racism in the workplace and greater involvement of workers in corporate decision-making. Some 1.2m man-days have already been lost to strikes in the first half of this year; double the figure for the corresponding period last year. Affirmative action could also prove a flashpoint, although Cosatu opposes the imposition of legislated quotas, arguing that this simply fosters tokenism. Cosatu argues that business must pay to train both black and white workers for more senior positions - with more and more whites joining Cosatu-affiliated unions, the federation cannot afford to ignore their needs  -and union leaders will push this demand forcefully in months to come. In the longer term, says Mr Ebrahim Patel, writing in a recent issue of the Johannesburg Weekly Mail newspaper: 'Unions will tend to reflect the impatience of the community and the urgency of social transformation.' That, in the end, will be what government fears most: a union movement which mobilises popular frustration over the necessarily slow implementation of the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Labour relations will never be the same again.</p>

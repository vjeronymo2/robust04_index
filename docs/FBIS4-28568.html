			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Keiji Urakami] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- The Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) has embarked on redefining  its role in response to changing situations in the world  following the end of the Cold War.    During the just-ended annual ministerial meeting in Paris,  the world's 25 major industrial countries clarified their  resolve to transform an entity that serves merely as a think  tank for the rich nations' club into more of a bridge with newly  emerging economies.    "An open, creative and dynamic OECD can help enlarge the  community of free and prosperous nations throughout the world,"  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said during the  two-day session which ended Wednesday [8 June].    "The opportunity is there," Christopher said in a speech  that  won instant applause from foreign and trade ministers from the  25 countries.    This year's ministerial meeting, the 33rd of its kind since  1973, took up "the role of the Paris-based OECD in an evolving  world" as one of the three key topics.    Christopher's sense of urgency in charting a new course for  the OECD was echoed in a joint communique issued at the end of  the Paris gathering, which proposed reinforcing links with  nonmember countries, especially Asian and former communist bloc  countries, for their eventual integration into the global  economic system.    The OECD said in the communique that the group should "build  up contact, dialogue and cooperation" with nonmembers which it  says are "gaining relevance in the world economy and are basing  their development on market principles, pluralist democracy and  respect for human rights, as the OECD countries have long done."    The communique underscored the need for the OECD to extend  its links, especially to newly emerging economies like China and  South Korea and former communist bloc nations struggling to  shift to a market-oriented economy, such as Poland and Hungary.    The OECD supported South Korea's bid to join the body in  1996, noting the country is taking part in a number of  activities "on the same footing as member countries."    The OECD also said it will deepen policy dialogue with  China,  which was described in the communique as "a leading player in  the world economy."    After the close of the ministerial meeting, the OECD signed  a  cooperation pact with Russia, aimed at smoothing its shift to a  market economy through an increased flow of assistance from the  OECD.    Russia's integration with the West could be "the best  investment we can make in our security and in the security of  all the peoples of Europe," Christopher said.    The communique's emphasis on deepening ties with nonmembers  came after the OECD club opened its door to Mexico as the 25th  member a few weeks ago for the first time in more than two  decades.    The OECD, created in 1961 as a replacement for the  organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), has  served as a catalyst for reconstruction of war-devastated Europe  under the Marshall Plan concept.    "With European countries as core members, the OECD has often  been described as a rich man's club," Akira Hirata, a researcher  at the OECD Development Center, said.    Hirata said the function of the OECD has thus been limited  to  policy coordination only among advanced nations, leaving the  task of promoting dialogue with nonmembers to suborgans like the  Development Assistance Committee (DAC).    "But such a cozy state of relations within the club has  changed in recent years," he said, citing the demise of the  Soviet Union and the collapse of the communist bloc.    "Ties with nonmember countries have gradually played a  bigger  role," Hirata said, ascribing the trend to Asian countries'  explosive economic growth to "levels that cannot be negligible  under the global economic management."    The OECD may justify increased links with nonmembers by  saying it could economically benefit from ties with countries  having huge growth potential, Hirata said.    Asia, for example, was termed "the growth center in the  world  economy" by the 1994 Japanese white paper on economic  cooperation.    "There is also an argument that leaving developing countries  unattended would only help boost a flow of illegal immigrants to  advanced countries, eventually heightening social and political  instability there," Hirata said.    Some OECD ministers like Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring  cautioned against the OECD's adopting too quick an approach to  developing countries like China, however.    Spring cited China's poor human rights record as an example.    Leon Brittan, the trade chief of the European Union (EU),  said, "we must not so widen our membership that our work becomes  shallow."    Mexico's admission met criticism from some OECD countries  which claimed Mexican industries are not advanced enough to be  eligible for the OECD club.</p>

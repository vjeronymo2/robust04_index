			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Markets: Behind every statistic lurks a pigeon - London IN THE never-never land of economic statistics the sun always shines, nightingales sing, inflation is low, unemployment falls, and the economy grows for ever and ever. In the cold, windswept, pigeon-infested world of business, however, markets are tough, margins under pressure and the threat of tax increases before Christmas worries industrialists everywhere. That gulf between the economy on paper and the impressions of people working in it seemed wider than ever this week, particularly in the equity market. To the casual observer who did not trouble to look at the date, this week's economic figures might have been reprinted from the mid-1960s by mistake. Underlying inflation, which had been expected to tick up, fell to a 25-year low on Wednesday. The headline figure fell to a very un-British 1.4 per cent. The dark side to low inflation is the fear in the market that a weak economy is holding prices down. In spite of the sunny economic outlook the FT-SE 100 index could manage a gain of only 8.9 points on the week. Yet retail sales are up sharply over the year, as Wednesday's figures confirmed. A more plausible explanation for continuing low inflation is that cost pressures are weak. Commodities remain subdued, and unit wages in manufacturing have fallen through the year. Paul Turnbull, economist at Smith New Court, is happy that the economy is recovering nicely and that inflation will not accelerate in the near future. As companies take up the slack, productivity gains mean that unit costs fall automatically. That should encourage those who think that the equity market has been riding ahead of companies' ability to deliver. Even Thursday's unemployment figures warmed the heart, if not the market. The largest jobless fall for four years brought the total down to 2.85m. Ever since the total knocked at the door of 3m and turned away, the City has been suspicious that special factors were at work. Now it looks as though the reforms of the 1980s really have made the labour market more flexible. Had you spent the week in chilly Harrogate instead of looking at a City dealing screen things might not have looked so rosy. While taking the waters the Confederation of British Industry rumbled about the dangers of tax increases to the delicate flower of recovery. Retailers have also made much of the potentially destabilising effects of a tax-raising budget in the run up to Christmas. Still, not all of the depression is special pleading. Companies reporting this week continued the real-world gloom of many recent trading statements. Courtaulds and BOC are both suffering. BOC, which follows the prescient practice of announcing its dividends a year in advance, was forced to call a halt to its 20-year run of increased payments. It had perhaps run ahead of itself in boom times, but the industrial gases business tends to recovery late in the economic cycle. Its shares fell 13p to 618p. Courtaulds fared even worse with the shares falling by 51p to 433p over the week. In its global businesses the clampdown on the Chinese economy is encouraging many Asian producers to divert their low cost output to other markets, cutting margins. It will take a substantial upturn in the world economy before the chemicals giants can look for much of an upturn in profits, or dividends. There was good corporate news, at least for some. Lucas Industries was distinctly perky when it was able to finally announce that it had persuaded George Simpson to become its new chief executive. The loser in the tug-of-love struggle was British Aerospace, which needs Simpson's services so badly that it is going to hang on to him for another six months. As the chairman of Rover he has revolutionised working practices and slashed costs while retaining the loyalty of the workforce. Lucas is looking forward to similar treatment. Since the fact only echoed the rumour, neither share was much affected. Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, was also in chipper mood when he reported a 30 per cent increase in half year profits. The figure owed a great deal to the fall in sterling against the dollar, and the shares unenthusiastically fell by 35p to 462p. But the jewel in the ex-colonial company's crown, Hong Kong Telecom, continues to shine brightly. Not only is business in Asia booming, but the surge on the Hong Kong stock market has boosted the value of C&amp;W's 57 per cent stake. Mercury's new One-2-One cellular service in the UK is also becoming so popular that it could do for electronics retailing this Christmas what video games did in 1992. Dixons apparently wanted 20,000 phones to sell in December, but the manufacturers cannot make them fast enough. Book early to avoid disappointment. Such upbeat sentiments are, however, rare. The caution of company chairman about earnings prospects is starting to get through. Fears that the Budget may raise substantial new taxes also overhang the market. Tax-exempt pension funds are concerned that the chancellor may view the tax credit they get with dividend payments as an easy target. Since dividends are only thinly covered, companies could scarcely afford to increase payouts to compensate for the pension funds' loss of income. Yet if the inflation outlook is really as benign as this week's figures suggests, and growth, at least in the UK, approaches 3 per cent in 1994, the equity market has little to grumble at. The last time that equity yields exceeded inflation for any length of time was during the great bull market of 1966-68 when share prices doubled. Rising inflation and the balance of payments crisis eventually burst that bubble. But this week, even the trade figures were good.</p>

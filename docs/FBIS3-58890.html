Concerning the opening of the Community market to products from  East Europe, however, he stressed that this must be a gradual  process as "we cannot afford to get into a major economic and  social crisis by opening up completely our trade to East  European countries just as the United States cannot afford to do  so." Mr. Cot feels that Europe has already "done more than its  share and the American side could do a bit more."</p>

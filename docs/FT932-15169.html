			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Haiti PM lays down conditions to quit HAITI'S military-backed prime minister has said he will resign to make way for democracy, but has also laid out conditions that would further delay President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's return, AP reports from Port-au-Prince. Prime Minister Marc Bazin's statement came immediately after Mr Dante Caputo, UN special envoy, put forward proposals to end the country's 18-month-old political crisis. Mr Caputo suggested a blanket amnesty to the leaders of the September 1991 coup if they made way for an Aristide-approved government. The plan is strongly supported by the Clinton administration. Mr Bazin said he would resign as soon as Mr Aristide had designated a new cabinet leader, but the new prime minister should be subject to approval by the army, the two main parliamentary groups, and business, community and church leaders.</p>

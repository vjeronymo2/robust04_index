			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS SEEK STATE MEDIATION IN STALEMATE OVER RAISES  </P> <P> Disgruntled La Canada teachers picketed twice Tuesday after asking the state to  intervene in stalled salary negotiations with the La Canada Unified School  District.  </P> <P> Two protests -- including one at the district's Board of Education meeting --  followed a request Monday asking the state Public Employee Relations Board to  mediate the talks.  </P> <P> Teachers late last week declared an impasse in negotiations, and no further  meetings with the district are scheduled before the state board decides whether  to intervene. A strike is not expected, district and teacher representatives  said.  </P> <P> Teachers began negotiations in May demanding an 18% wage increase, but later  decreased their request to 10%. District administrators, some of whom concede  their proposals are low, initially offered a 6% increase with contract and pay  benefits for certain teachers, but recently offered an alternative of 7%  without many of those benefits.  </P> <P> Classified employees agreed in November to a 6% increase.  </P> <P> "The cost-of-living increase offer they're making us is an embarrassment," said  Martin Lipofsky, a science teacher at La Canada High School and president of  the La Canada Teachers Assn. "We've done everything we can to make ours  distinguished schools, and our salaries don't reflect that. It's just not  right."  </P> <P> District administrators say a 7% increase is the most the district can afford  to offer its approximately 170 teachers.  </P> <P> "We believe the lower-end salaries on this schedule are pretty low, and are not  tremendously competitive at this time," said Voytek Dolinski, district director  of curriculum. "But I don't see any money out there that is not out there  already. There's no extra money anywhere."  </P> <P> About $800,000 of this year's $15-million budget has been set aside for salary  increases. Other funds viewed by teachers as surplus already have been budgeted  or must be spent elsewhere, district officials said.  </P> <P> A reserve of $415,000 from developer fees, for instance, under state law may  only be used for construction or renovation. Another reserve of about $360,000  has been budgeted for building renovation and is not expected to be available  next year. And about $465,000 has been earmarked by state law to be used only  for fiscal emergencies, according to Carol Siegler, president of the Board of  Education.  </P> <P> Teachers, who are in the second year of a three-year contract with yearly  negotiations over salary, last year received a pay increase of 11.9%, mainly  because of higher enrollments, increases in class size and funds from  Proposition 98, an initiative passed last year that allocates about 40% of the  state's surplus to California schools. Enrollment has leveled off, and all  Proposition 98 funds already have been budgeted to pay teachers' salaries,  Siegler said.  </P> <P> Those explanations have not satisfied angry teachers, who say they are being  slighted for costly satellite dishes, library-media centers and fax machines.  La Canada teachers' salaries -- ranging from $20,265 for a beginning teacher to  $42,970 for 25 years of experience -- are the third lowest in Los Angeles  County. "We contend that because we are top-quality teachers and are producing  a top-quality product, we should at least be in the middle of the range, not  the bottom," said Elizabeth Rose, a La Canada English teacher. District  students consistently score among the highest on state-administered tests.  </P> <P> "What we're talking about is not a few more hundred bucks," Rose said. "The  discrepancy is dramatic."  </P> <P> About 100 teachers marched early Tuesday along a sidewalk in front of La Canada  High School before classes began. Many carried picket signs and displayed them  to passing traffic, while others distributed flyers and window stickers to  staff and students arriving at the high school.  </P> <P> "We used to be top, top, top, but as the years have gone on and things have  taken their toll, we've slipped" in salaries, said Kathleen Seiler, 60, who  taught La Canada elementary school students for 30 years before retiring in  June. "It isn't right that people devote their lives to a career, then, because  of their salaries, don't have a retirement they can look forward to."  </P> <P> Teachers appeared again Tuesday night at the La Canada Board of Education  meeting, armed with information for board members. Teachers first came before  the board Nov. 21 to complain about the proposed wage increase, and have held  community meetings and distributed flyers about their demands, organizers said.  </P></p>

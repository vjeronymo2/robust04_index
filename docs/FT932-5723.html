			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: G&amp;L moves quickly to replace chairman THE BOARD of Giddings &amp; Lewis, the largest US machine tool and industrial automation supplier, has moved quickly to fill the gap left by the resignation of Mr William Fife as chairman and chief executive. The Wisconsin company has appointed Mr Joseph Coppola, currently senior vice-president for manufacturing services at Houston-based Cooper Industries, as chairman and chief executive from July 1. G&amp;L announced on May 7 that Mr Fife had resigned due to policy differences. His resignation, coupled with an earnings statement showing improved first-quarter profits but lower than expected new orders, sparked a Dollars 6.75 fall in G&amp;L's shares to Dollars 20 1/2 . G&amp;L and Cincinnati Milacron are the only two large publicly-quoted US machine tool builders. Mr Fife was given much of the credit for restoring G&amp;L's fortunes, and masterminding the Dollars 70m acquisition of struggling rival Cross &amp; Trecker in 1991. G&amp;L has tried to reassure customers and shareholders that its strategy remained on course despite Mr Fife's departure. In London recently, Mr Richard Kleinfeldt, vice-president and chief financial officer, said: 'The senior management throughout the period of growth and resurgence is still in place. The only difference is that Bill has left.' Mr Kleinfeldt said UK customers had been more concerned about G&amp;L's recent decision to transfer machine tool manufacturing from Arbroath in Scotland to Knowsley on Merseyside. 'They wanted to know whether they will get the same service,' he said. G&amp;L was upgrading the machine shop at Knowsley over the next eight to 12 months. Shares in the company have recovered to around Dollars 24 in Nasdaq over-the-counter trading, and Mr Kleinfeldt said the appointment of Mr Coppola was a clear sign G&amp;L wanted to retain its customer focus. Mr Coppola has been a director of G&amp;L since 1989, and Cooper Industries, which makes electrical and automotive products, tools and hardware, is a major user of machine tools.</p>

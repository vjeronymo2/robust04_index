			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TSUJI'S THREE-POINT FLURRY GIVES RANCHO ALAMITOS THE BOLSA GRANDE TITLE  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills High School knew all about Rancho Alamitos guard Shellie Tsuji  and her ability to hit three-point shots.  </P> <P> They had seen her hit three Tuesday in the Vaqueros' victory over Rim of the  World in the semifinals of the Bolsa Grande Lady Matador Holiday Basketball  Tournament.  </P> <P> So, for the first three quarters in Friday night's championship game, Trabuco  Hills paid special attention the 5-foot, 3-inch Tsuji, holding her to just two  points. But then, midway through the fourth quarter, Trabuco Hills backed off.  That's when Tsuji hit four three-point baskets, including three straight, to  give Rancho Alamitos control of the game and a 72-54 victory.  </P> <P> "They were coming up in my face and they were blocking my shot," Tsuji said.  "Then in the fourth quarter they started backing off because I was bricking 'em  so bad."  </P> <P> The Vaqueros (5-1) led, 44-42, at the end of the third quarter but outscored  Trabuco Hills, 28-12, in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Tsuji was the game's leading scorer with 16 points, 14 of them in the fourth  quarter. Jenny Newsome, who missed almost eight minutes of the first half with  foul trouble, added 15 for the Vaqueros and was the tournament's most valuable  player. Melinda Lira scored 11 points including three key three-point shots to  keep Trabuco Hills at bay.  </P> <P> "Shellie Tsuji had a rough night (early) but she came through when we needed  her," Vaquero Coach Bob Becker said. "I think she was about 0-15 before she  hit.  </P> <P> "The threes helped," added Becker, who also praised his team's hustle. "The  last four minutes we really got down and worked hard."  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills missed 14 of 23 free throws.  </P> <P> "I think we got a little harum-scarum and gave up a lot of shots the last four  minutes," said Trabuco Hills Coach Paul Beidler. "They got hot from outside and  kind of put us away."  </P> <P> DeDe Sampson led Trabuco Hills with 14 points. Joelle Castro had 13 and Shelly  Callhoun 11.  </P> <P> In other Bolsa Grande Tournament games:  </P> <P> Rim of the World 59, Laguna Hills 47 -- Tonya Stevens scored 15 points and  Andrea Nelson added 14 but it was not enough as Laguna Hills lost its bid to  take third place.

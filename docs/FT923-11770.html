			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Arts: Celluloid backstage goings-on - Cinema NOISES OFF (15) Odeon Haymarket BEETHOVEN (U) Plaza UNIVERSAL SOLDIER (18) Odeon Leicester Square FACT one: stage farces are unfilmable. Fact two: Peter Bogdanovich's effective directing career ended 20 years ago with Paper Moon. (A pale shadow of Mr B has since directed things like Mask and Texasville). Fact three: no film with a cast of Americans affecting British accents can be sat through without pain. Fact four: all facts are re-negotiable. Especially in the world of cinema. Bogdanovich's film of Michael Frayn's play Noises Off is a triumph of single-minded panache over the awful warnings of those who said it could not be done. You cannot, claimed the Jeremiahs, translate to the movie screen a stage romp about an acting company whose offstage problems - drink, sexual jealousy, professional rivalry - sabotage the crisp clockwork of the new farce they are performing on a provincial tour. Called Nothing On, this play is a precision piece about dropped trousers, French windows and mistaken identity. But with its cast nightly rending itself apart in the wings, how can an on-stage comedy of errors survive the offstage one? Equally, how can any play about play-acting survive the ventilating processes of film? Yet cinema, as we know, has confounded expectation ever since the first filmgoer screamed at the sight of a seemingly real approaching train. Noises Off continues the grand tradition. It begins as a distant rumble, with stage director Michael Caine puffing clouds of sotto voce sarcasm through the technical rehearsal: all sticking doors, misplaced plates of sardines and a drunken Denholm Elliott missing his cue as the burglar. The train comes closer in 'Act Two', with a backstage glimpse of rival thespians Christopher Reeve and John Ritter fighting over the faded favours of prima attrice Carol Burnett. And it snorts deafeningly into the station in 'Act Three', as we become the stage audience watching the finished shambles from the front of stalls. If I say I laughed till I cried, I have a dreadful fear the words will be ripped out and stuck on the poster. But I did. Not having seen Frayn's play on stage, I had been told that it crackled merrily for two acts before fizzling out in the third. But on film the third act is the funniest of all. The text of the play-within-a-play - at this point in the film we know it by heart - is remodelled by the desperate ad libs of a cast who know the sardines will never be where they should be, that the burglar will drop his trousers instead of the lover, that Ritter and Reeve will go on trying to murder each other on stage, and that Miss Burnett will succeed in murdering the English language with her portrayal of a cockney maid. Bogdanovich could have 'opened out' the play - phrase of doom - and included scenes set in cafes, parks or cheap hotels. Instead he whirls his camera-crane around the theatre's confined space, magically concentrating our and the cast's attention. To prepare the film, he rehearsed them in a real stage production of Noises Off, which he then exposed to author Frayn. What fine-tuning followed produced this perfect-pitch movie. Every slammed door is in tune with every slammed ego, and every cast member is a thing of beauty and a joy forever. * * * How not to direct slapstick is demonstrated by Beethoven. Hollywood today believes that the comedy writer's best friend is a dog: see K-9, Turner And Hooch and company. The theme and variations in each case are the same. Every time our punctual, smartly dressed hero prepares to do something which might advance his career or his family's well-being, he encounters a scirocco of hair, muddy paws and slobbering jaws. The eponymous St Bernard in Beethoven terrorises air-freshener tycoon Charles Grodin and his identikit middle-American family. The dog is a large and 'lovable' nuisance who has escaped from a military experiment laboratory, where it was meant to provide target practice for a new type of super-destructive shell. Instead, chez Grodin, the dog becomes a destructive weapon itself. Farewell the master bedroom; adieu the wall-to-wall carpeting; and how do you expunge muddy pawprints from a Dollars 360 Gucci blazer? Laugh? We wait like locked-in dogs whose noses are pressed to the window for the first sign of life or human interest coming up the driveway. Wit we have already despaired of in reel one. Edmond Dantes and Amy Holden Jones wrote the script, which when not recycling the same joke about doggy destruction, limps into sub-Disney sentimental whimsy. Brian Levant directs. Dogs are part of today's cinematic vogue for anarchic inarticulacy. Reacting against the yuppie Eighties, with its celebration of chattering self-advancement, modern movies favour the grunt of the primal animal. Not just dogs but Dolph Lundgren, hulk extraordinaire. Not just Beethoven the St Bernard but actor-kickboxer Jean-Claude Van Damme, known as the 'Muscles from Brussels.' These two co-star in Universal Soldier, a mentally retarded action thriller brought to you by the same zeitgeist that created Arnold Schwarzenegger. Stretchered out of Vietnam after a near-fatal grudge fight, Lundgren and Van Damme are to be found in present-day Nevada, where they have been re-stitched as semi-robot commandos and work for what appears to be a delinquent subsection of the UN. They go into international crises with all computer systems bleeping and they can survive knives, grenades and bullets. One day Mr Van Damme has a twitch of remembered humanity and decides to escape with a gorgeous TV reporter (Ally Walker). In hot pursuit is Mr Lundgren, hi-jacking his outfit's hi-tech command tank and destroying as much of America as he can before passing Go. This film never even reaches Go. Carolco, the company that gave us 90 million dollars' worth of stunt work in Terminator 2, give us a similar crash diet here. Cars and trucks senselessly collide; service stations suspenselessly explode; and one stomping hulk with a foreign accent is twinned with another in a duel of guttural grunts. What price Mr Lundgren's hobby of making necklaces from his enemies' severed ears? Evolution will soon phase out the human sense of hearing completely if it has nought to feed on but crashes, bangs and lines like: 'He is a little mixed up, give him ze serum.' Revival corner this week is devoted to Peter Pan (U, Odeon West End) and The Thief Of Baghdad (U, Barbican). Perfect for the summer hols.</p>

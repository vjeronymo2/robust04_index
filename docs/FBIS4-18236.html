			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["er." report: "Toepfer Calls For Import Stop"] </F>   [Text] Duesseldorf -- In a sharp manner, Environment  Minister Toepfer has called for an import halt on  chlorofluorocarbons from third countries to the European Union  [EU]. The Christian Democratic Union politician called on  Brussels to no longer grant import permits for the "ozone  killers" as of 1995, even if this is legal. According to  Toepfer, imports of up to 26,000 tonnes of chlorofluorocarbons  to the European Union are again permitted this year, but only if  the material is reprocessed or used. However, with this import  permit, the European Union is exposing itself to the suspicion  that "in practice" it is not taking its commitment to the  protection of the ozone layer "seriously," Toepfer complained.  While Germany will abandon chlorofluorocarbons in 1994, Brussels  is opening "the door to imports." The Commission should  discontinue the allotment of quotas, as soon as the production  of chlorofluorocarbons is terminated all over the European Union  at the end of 1994, he said. Moreover, guarantees from industry  that all substances used in the meantime "do not endanger the  ozone layer" are necessary. Behind the scolding are  investigations regarding illegal chlorofluorocarbon imports from  East Europe to France via Germany.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Censure on rights is rejected China yesterday strongly rejected US censure of its human rights record, describing such criticism as 'utterly unreasonable and totally irresponsible'. China's strong reaction to this latest US criticism of its human rights record reflects concerns about renewal of its Most Favoured Nation status. Removal of its lower tariff privileges in the US market would threaten billions of dollars' worth of textile sales. In response to a US State Department report this week which said that China's human rights behaviour still fell 'far short' of internationally accepted standards, Mr Wu Jianmin, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said: 'The US has no right to make irresponsible remarks about the internal affairs of China or, for that matter, any other country. We resolutely oppose interference in our internal affairs under the excuse of human rights.' The annual State Department accounting of human rights in China criticised Beijing for failing to provide adequate protection for individuals under the terms of the constitution. 'Fundamental human rights provided for in the Chinese constitution frequently are ignored in practice,' the report said. 'Challenges to the Communist party's political authority are often dealt with harshly and arbitrarily.' The State Department report acknowledged China had made positive moves on human rights in 1993, but it was the report's negative tone which captured the headlines.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Two insurers announce plans for expansion TWO OF the country's leading 'direct' insurers have announced expansion plans, underlining the growing popularity of telephone-based sales methods for motor and, to a lesser extent, home insurance. Churchill, the Bromley-based motor insurer, has announced an injection of some Pounds 6m by its Swiss owner, Winterthur, to allow it to continue expansion. The group insures more than 400,000 motorists and, according to chief executive Mr Martin Long, aims to begin marketing home insurance policies next month. The money is needed as rapid growth has put strain on the capital base. Mr Long said Winterthur would make a further Pounds 5m in capital available early next year, allowing the group to push ahead with plans to insure some 550,000 motorists. The Insurance Service, the Royal Insurance subsidiary based in Bristol, is to set up a second regional service centre in Sunderland, paving the way for an increase in business. TIS leases 36,000 sq ft of office and warehouse space in Bristol. Its new building will give it an extra 34,500 sq ft.</p>

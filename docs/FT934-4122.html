			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Judge rules out secrets charge The judge in the Singapore trial of five people accused of breaking the island republic's Official Secrets Act (OSA) by prematurely disclosing an official economic growth estimate has ruled that the prosecution has failed to make a case against one of the accused, but invited the attorney general to bring an amended charge. Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economics department at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore's de facto central bank, had been accused of communicating an official 1992 second-quarter economic growth estimate of 4.6 per cent to two economists, who are alleged to have then shared it with a journalist, whose editor published it. All have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which carry penalties of a maximum of two years in jail or a SDollars 2,000 (Pounds 840) fine or both. After a trial which has so far lasted for 24 days, the judge said the prosecution, led by Singapore's attorney general, had not substantiated its case against Mr Shanmugaratnam on the charge of communicating the growth figure. But the judge then invited the attorney general to bring an amended charge of negligence against the economist. In a case which has intrigued and concerned Singapore's financial community, the prosecution's case has centred on what did, or did not, happen at a meeting in Mr Shanmugaratnam's office at the MAS in June last year. Today the court is due to hear from prosecution and defence on how they wish to proceed in view of the new charge against Mr Shanmugaratnam, after which the judge is expected to decide if the four other accused have cases to answer.</p>

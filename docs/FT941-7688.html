			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: High Gas volume Turnover in British Gas accelerated during the afternoon, reaching 21m shares - the highest single day's business in the stock since last December  -as one institution was said to have sold a block of 7.5m shares at 339p apiece. There was little downside pressure in the share price, however, which settled marginally higher on the session at 339p, ahead of publication this morning of the annual report from Ofgas, the industry regulator. In addition, Gas's preliminary results are scheduled for tomorrow. Kleinwort Benson is forecasting 'clean' historic cost net income of Pounds 1bn, the top of the market range, and an 8.6p final dividend, making 15p for the year, a rise of 5.6 per cent and again at the top of the market range. Nomura is more conservative on both its earnings and dividend estimates, going for net income of Pounds 947m and a dividend total of 14.5p.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TRANSIT CASUALTY BOSS DENIES FALSE 1984 STATEMENT CHARGE  </P> <P> The former head of Los Angeles-based Transit Casualty Co., a high-risk insurer  that left up to $4 billion in unpaid claims when it crumbled in 1985, has  pleaded innocent to a charge of filing a false financial statement.  </P> <P> George Pettengill Bowie, 64, Transit's former chairman and chief executive  officer, entered the plea Thursday in Circuit Court after his indictment by a  Cole County grand jury, county prosecutor Richard Callahan said today.  </P> <P> The charge stems from the company's 1984 financial statement, which indicated a  $21.9-million surplus when in fact Transit's records were "incomplete,  inaccurate, inauditable and in such a state that it was impossible to construct  an accurate financial statement," the indictment said.  </P> <P> Filing a false annual statement is a felony punishable by up to five years in  prison. No trial date has been set for Bowie, who is free on a $250,000  signature bond.  </P></p>

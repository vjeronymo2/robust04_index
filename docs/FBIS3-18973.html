			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Henrik Tuchsen: "Farmers Want Nordic EU </F> Concessions Blocked"]    [Text] The Agricultural Council supports the admission of  new European Union (EU) countries. But the Nordic colleagues  will not be allowed to get away with special concessions and  camouflaged trade barriers.    Danish farmers are now asking the Danish Government to block  the special agricultural provisions that the other Nordic  countries are requesting as part of their EU membership.    The negotiations on the admission of Sweden, Norway, and  Finland have entered a decisive phase. They are scheduled to be  completed by 1 March. But according to Danish farmers, an excess  of special provisions and transition periods that are too long  could shatter the big Danish expectations for the new export  markets.    For this reason, according to a letter to Agriculture  Minister Bjorn Westh (Social Democrat), the Agricultural Council  supports the EU Commission's negotiating proposal, which is  described as disappointing and unsatisfactory by the applicant  countries, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria.    Danish farmers support full membership for the applicant  countries. But according to Agricultural Council administrative  director Klaus Bustrup, complying with the large number of  demands, many of which the council regards as unrealistic and  unacceptable, will mean that the countries will generally retain  their present agricultural policies. This means high tariff  barriers for food products, among other things.    With reference to the applicants' proposals to date, for  example in the veterinary area, farmers warn against a lot of  special concessions that are really camouflaged trade barriers.  For example, the council points out that all demands from the  applicant countries concerning border checks must be rejected as  obvious trade barriers.    We noted that the council seems to be afraid of a lot of  attempts to get provisions that are camouflaged trade barriers.    "Exactly, and that would not be fair. And we cannot accept  special provisions of a general nature, for example allowing the  countries to have some self-sufficiency goals, as they have now  -- that is inconsistent with the whole idea of a common market,"  Bustrup said.    The applicant countries' adjustment to the EU's agricultural  policies is a key problem in the admission negotiations; the  southern European countries in particular have rejected giving  agricultural concessions to the north European applicants.    It is quite clear from the letter to the agriculture  minister  that farmers consider the applicants' demands too unrealistic  and unacceptable. This applies among other things to transition  periods, quota allocations, and subsidy rights.    We asked how he thought the other Nordic countries will  react  when their Nordic colleagues support the strict course laid out  by the EU Commission.    "Naturally we are writing to the minister in this phase of  the negotiations, but I think we have also been quite aboveboard  with respect to our Nordic colleagues," Bustrup said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The third group of 300 Pakistani troops left Lahore  today for the Slovak Republic for onward deployment in Bosnia on  UN peacekeeping duties. At Lahore airport, the contingent was  seen off by senior army officers. The group will have the  requisite training in the Slovak Republic for a period of two  weeks and will then take up duties in the war-torn  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The remaining troops of the main body will  directly fly to Bosnia under a phased program expected to be  completed by the end of July.</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Dispute may delay Taurus project: City and government disagree over who should regulate stock market settlement system A DISPUTE has broken out between the City and the government over who should regulate Taurus, the automated system which will handle the settlement of stock market transactions. The disagreement is threatening further delays to the project, which has already been deferred from October until next Spring. The latest dispute centres on whether the Department of Trade and Industry should oversee the system, or whether it should delegate the job to the Securities and Investments Board and the self-regulating organisations (SROs) set up under the Financial Services Act. Oversight of the many brokers, company registrars, custodians and institutional investors who 'plug in' to the Taurus system, to protect investors from fraud and other losses, will be one of the biggest and most important regulatory jobs in the City. Mr John Redwood, minister for corporate affairs, is thought to fear that giving the job to SIB and the SROs would lead to an unwarranted increase in the bureaucracy which has already built up around the Financial Services Act. It would bring company registrars (which maintain share registers on behalf of companies) and custodians (which maintain shareholdings for institutional investors) within the remit of the FSA regulators for the first time. Cutting out the SIB, on the other hand, would mean giving more regulatory power to London's International Stock Exchange, which is to build and run Taurus. This would be a significant development for the Exchange, which had its regulatory functions emasculated by the FSA. Mr Richard Britton, SIB international director, said: 'The SIB doesn't want to push itself forward and get into empire building. It's up to the government to decide. We stand ready, if the DTI decides there is a role for SIB to play.' Privately, other City regulators express concern that investors could suffer if SIB and the SROs were not given the job. With the increasing automation of share trading and settlement, these two processes are becoming difficult to separate. Also, they argue that the running of settlement arrangements should fall within the scope of investor protection legislation. The FSA regulators say that they receive many complaints about company registrars, but are unable to deal with them because they are an issue only between companies and their shareholders. Cutting out the SIB would also create extra complexity for brokers, since it would force them to report to a new regulator for Taurus purposes. A second dispute has arisen over the creation of a new compensation fund to cover losses through Taurus. The Stock Exchange, with the encouragement of the DTI, has suggested cover of up to Pounds 250,000 for private investors. But the SIB, which oversees a scheme with maximum cover of only Pounds 48,000, is concerned about potential overlap between the two arrangements. The DTI had been hoping to publish its 150-page regulations for Taurus by the end April. Because no decision has yet been taken on who should oversee the system, the regulations are now planned towards the end of May. At the end of last week, the Stock Exchange hinted at further delays in the eventual introduction of the system when it said that Taurus, the City's most important single infrastructure development, will be launched 'in the first half' of 1992.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "America's Refusal"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. refusal to let itself be involved in  European -- and especially French -- initiatives aimed at  putting an end to the war in Bosnia illustrates a paradox which  characterizes America today. The stronger it gets internally,  the less willing to commit itself externally it seems to become.    In his recent State of the Union Address, Bill Clinton  listed  his reasons to be satisfied, all of which were of an internal  nature. Growth now seems assured, consumer and entrepreneur  confidence indicators are rising, over 1.5 billion jobs have  been created in one year, inflation remains under control, the  budget deficit will be cut as soon as next year, and interest  rates are at a low ebb. A look at its traditional evils --  especially crime -- must not hide the fact that America is in a  strong position in this age of global economic competition.    It is then all the more surprising to witness the timid way  in which the United States has been exercising its leadership  abroad. Mr. Clinton can boast no foreign policy achievement. As  for Bosnia, the U.S. President only -- almost casually --  mentioned that the United States could be proud of devising, for  humanitarian purposes, "the longest air lift in human memory."  A rather inadequate contribution considering that this is a  conflict which dents NATO's credibility, mocks the United  Nations Organization, and has already claimed over 100,000 lives.    The U.S. Administration justifies its aloofness with two  arguments. Exerting pressure to stop the fighting at a time  when the Muslims have been regaining some ground would be unfair  to them -- they were sorely provoked, after all -- and would not  lead to a workable solution. Indeed, while the United States  has undertaken to contribute to the peacekeeping force should  the Muslims, Croats, and Serbs come to an agreement, it wants  such troops to secure peace, not to have to force it upon the  belligerents, which means that the agreement would have to be  concluded in good faith, a highly unlikely proposition. To  demand such an agreement -- which is what the Americans have  been doing -- is therefore almost akin to a manifesto of  non-involvement.    Routed in Haiti, battered in Somalia, the U.S.  Administration  has been equally luckless with a "Russian policy" which it had  almost exclusively based on a reformist current which has just  vanished from Boris Yeltsin's new government. Coming after  those half-failures, its refusal to commit itself in Bosnia puts  the finishing touches to the paradoxical face of an America  which is willing to exercise its leadership in the economic  sphere -- GATT, NAFTA -- but no longer in the political one.</p>

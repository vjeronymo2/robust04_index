			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Jan 14 SAPA -- African National  Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela has conceded his  organisation has shifted significantly from its nationalisation  policies contained in its Freedom Charter. "We have guaranteed  investors against confiscation of their property and have  guaranteed their right to repatriate their profits and  dividends. Although the clause on mining is still in the  Freedom Charter, we have made the shift away from  nationalisation," he told delegates at the ANC Youth League  [ANCYL] conference in Soweto on Friday.    The ANCYL's annual conference is the last before the April  27  general election.    Mr Mandela said it was important to organise the economy to  enable it to deliver the goods in the face of high expectations  from the people. "If the ANC government is unable to deliver  the goods, then you should overthrow it because it is not good,"  he said.    He said the ANC had also agreed to a code of conduct for  senior officials to avert the "gravy train" psychosis brought on  by apartheid. He said part of the code stated that any member  of the organisation receiving a donation of more than  R[rand]100,000 should immediately report it to the movement  because the organisation did not want its senior officials to be  unduly influenced.    He said salaries of government ministers after April 27  would  have to be commensurate with those of people in industry as  there was a tendency by state officials to live beyond the means  of ordinary people.    On violence, Mr Mandela said politically-inspired  disturbances had to be settled to ensure international  investment.    He said National Party [NP] leader Mr F W de Klerk was  convinced he would receive the support of most whites, coloureds  and Indians, and that violence would keep Africans away from  polling booths and so boost the NP's chances. This was in line  with NP strategy of using violence to prevent a decisive ANC  victory in the election, Mr Mandela claimed.    He said there was a time when the ANC was proud to proclaim  it was not involved in violence, but rogue elements within self  defence units [SDU] had changed this. "We must admit that  discipline has broken down within some SDUs."    Mr Mandela warned youths against complacency in the run-up  to  the elections. He said the challenge was to ensure the  organisation won 67 percent of votes as indicated in some  opinion polls.</p>

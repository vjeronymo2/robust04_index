			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed CET: "Sweden Agrees to Join EU"; as released </F> by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 1 Mar (BELGA) -- Swedish European Affairs  Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel said that he was satisfied with his  country's agreement with the EU [European Union]. It is an  historic day for Sweden, he added.    The agreement constitutes a good basis for carrying out the  referendum on Sweden's accession to the EU, especially since the  opposition was closely involved in the negotiations.    The minister reported that Sweden's net budget contribution  will not exceed ECU50 million in the first year. Without the  compensation, it would have amounted to about ECU760 million.    For the second year, Sweden's net budget contribution will  rise to ECU150 million. The following year, the contribution  will be significantly higher and by the fourth year, Sweden will  have to pay its full contribution.    Dinkelspiel said that a couple of issues still remain to be  settled. The Twelve have not reached an agreement regarding the  voting procedure in the European Ministerial Council. Spain and  the United Kingdom want to make it easier for large countries to  block a decision. Furthermore, Spain does not want the new  members to participate in the 1996 final settlement of the  European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).    The European Treaty envisages the third and last phase of  the  EMU starting in 1997 with the single currency and the European  Central Bank, provided that a majority of the member states  comply with the conditions.    Spain wants the treaty to be modified, clearly stating that  all decisions must be made by a majority of the current 12  member states.    Belgium and most member states have rejected the Spanish  proposal. The issues have not been discussed so far, however.  Thus, the position of the new member states in the future EMU is  not clearly defined.</p>

Bristol Crown Court was told how Jamaican-born Derek Gregory  had organised the smuggling of more than 100 lb of the drug in  gift-wrapped packages inside four passenger suitcases at  Stansted airport in July 1992.    Customs and Excise officers moved in as the suitcases were  being brought through the "nothing to declare" channel. The haul  was the largest seizure of drugs in passenger luggage in Britain.    Gregory's half-brother, Ernest Ford, 33, was jailed for 12  years and Lee Cameron, 22, for 13 years, for their part in the  scheme to bring cocaine into Britain. Gregory, 26, from  Paddington, west London, showed little emotion as he left the  dock after being sentenced.    Judge McCarraher, passing sentence, said the court knew well  the evils of cocaine, "which destroys people's lives and their  families, and produces crime among those who want to use it and  obtain it illegally."    Gregory and Ford, both of Streatham, southwest London, and  Cameron, of Bristol, were convicted last month on a joint charge  of conspiring with others to smuggle cocaine.    The court was told Ford was the "minder," watching over the  arrival of the drug consignment. Cameron was described as "the  recruiter," seeking out young jobless men in and around Bristol  and offering all expenses-paid trips to South America. The  would-be couriers were told they would be smuggling diamonds.    Three co-accused who brought the suitcases through Customs  were cleared of conspiracy charges. They said they believed they  were smuggling precious stones.    Gregory, known as "the Boss" by his associates, had led an  "international jetset lifestyle" visiting known drug locations  in Africa, India, South America and the U.S. He was deported  from Britain in 1989, having served a two-year sentence for  smuggling cannabis.

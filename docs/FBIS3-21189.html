Problems  such as inadequate control by MITI and the use of technopolises  as ``good causes'' by regions and by politicians snaring public  works projects are behind the retreat from the original concept.    The concept of the technopolis, which started under the  jurisdiction of MITI in 1983, was to aim for innovation based on  the fostering of start-ups and industry-academia cooperation  rooted in the region.    However, today, ten years later, the reality of the  technopolis is very different from the original concept.  <H3>  Local Governments Put Local Revitalization First,  Regionalism and Nurturing of New Industries Second </H3>   The biggest problem is that often the technopolises have  almost become industrial parks not very similar to the research  parks of Silicon Valley on which they were modeled. As local  governments put local revitalization first, they persist in  pursuing factories from Tokyo and Osaka companies, putting in  second place the nurturing of regional distinctiveness and new  industries. The corporations are under the influence of their  headquarters, which is fine when times are good. However, when  the economy plunges, people are quickly recalled and plans are  quickly cut. This makes it difficulty for long-term research to  survive.    Take Hamamatsu City in Shizuoka Prefecture, one of the 26  designated technopolis regions. Its geographic conditions are  favorable and it is blessed with local industries such as  musical instruments and motorcycles. Even here the business plan  is behind schedule.    Toda Industrial Park is at the core of the city's  technopolis  plan. The parceling out of the 100-hectare industrial park began  in March 1990. As the bubble economy still lingered then,  companies were very interested in entering the park. Before two  years were up, the park was 100% parceled out to 68  companies.    However, of the 68 companies, nine have yet to begin  building  one to two years after obtaining the land. That is because  companies had to reconsider totally their investments in plant  and equipment when the economy declined immediately after the  companies signed their contracts.    The sales contract the companies signed with Hamamatsu  includes an obligation to be in operation within three years of  obtaining the land. Companies which do not fulfill that  condition must pay a penalty or return the land to the city. If  this rule is strictly applied, companies will suffer and  Hamamatsu will lose companies it wooed. As a last resort, the  standard of ``operation within three years'' was changed to  ``construction begun within three years.''    However, since prospects are poor for economic recovery in  the latter half (October 1993 to March 1994) of this fiscal  year, meeting even the revised standard will be a tall order for  the companies. The three companies with an October 1993 deadline  have not submitted their applications for architectural approval  and cannot start construction in time. The remaining six  companies with deadlines in April 1994 or January 1995 are  conferring with Hamamatsu on how to meet the construction start  deadline even with scaled down plans for first stage  construction.  <H3>  Retreat of Companies has Begun to Stand Out, a Region That  Hasn't Attracted Even One Company </H3>   Cases of companies giving up on technopolises have begun  appearing as the business climate has worsened. Automotive parts  manufacturer Shin Kobe Plastic had planned to build a factory at  Hiroshima's Chuo Technopolis, but in July 1992 it completely  retreated from the plan and returned the land to Hiroshima  Prefecture. ``Based on the direction of the automotive market,  we must give up on constructing a new plant,'' explained the  company to the prefecture.    The prefecture, which had attracted the company, was  devastated by the cancellation of construction plans. But the  Hiroshima company Mazda, which uses Shin Kobe's products,  suffered a rapid downturn due to the declining demand for  automobiles. There is nothing to be done to relieve the sorry  plight of companies which rely on Mazda.    The problem is not only with Shin Kobe. Last year two other  companies gave up on technopolis plans. Automotive seat belt  manufacturer Takata had acquired land in the prefecturally  operated Taguchi Industrial Park and Daiure, a processor of  urethane for automotive seats, had planned to build a plant in  the prefecturally operated Chiyoda Industrial Park. Both  companies returned the land to the prefecture. Both were hurt by  the recession in the automotive industry.    Hiroshima Prefecture has many automotive parts manufacturers  and subcontractors to large-scale heavy industries such as  ship-building and steel. One purpose of getting the technopolis  designation from MITI was to lessen the prefecture's reliance on  existing industries -- such as automobiles, ship-building, and  steel -- by encouraging location of high-tech industries such as  electronics and machinery in the technopolis. There were some  positive results. The national brewing laboratory and  Matsushita's research laboratory were lured to the technopolis.  But mostly companies in the automotive industry wanted to enter  the technopolis during the bubble era. As a result, there was  insufficient industrial diversification. That's one reason the  current recession has hurt very badly.    Hiroshima and Hamamatsu are in the top three of the 26  technopolises in terms of value of manufactured goods shipped.  They were blessed from the outset with a concentration of  industries such as autos and instruments, moreover they have big  cities nearby. It is noteworthy that companies are giving up  even in these two regions. There are many regions with worse  conditions that cannot even attract industry.    ``In 1984, on the occasion of the moving of Akita Airport,  three industrial parks were created,'' according to Akita  Prefecture's Industrial Promotion Section. ``The good economy  continued and companies were locating as expected. Last year was  the worst. Not one company was attracted to the technopolis. The  severe conditions are continuing this year.''    ``We are working hard to attract companies with inspection  tours and explanatory meetings, but we get a very bad feeling  from the corporate side. Last year we attracted eight companies,  but this year we're stuck at one,'' according to Yamaguchi  Prefecture's Industrial Promotion Section. The majority of  technopolises are having varying degrees of difficulty in  attracting companies due to the sluggish economy.  <H3>  Introductory Pamphlets are Virtually Indistinguishable:  ``Electronics, Biotech, New Materials ...'' </H3>   A diagram (see below) of the changes in number of corporate  locations in the technopolis areas which make up more than ten  percent of Japan's newly established factory locations, shows  that in 1990, driven by the bubble economy, there was a record  of 474 new sitings in those 20 earlier regions designated from  1984 to 1986. This is more than twice the number in 1981.    However, since 1991 the downturn in the economy has been  accompanied by reconsideration of plans for excessive investment  in plant and equipment. The number of new locations has dropped  35% in the two years since 1991, falling to 307 cases in  1992.  Corporate appetites for investment in plants and equipment are  expected to decline further this year.    ``If industrial parks are filled up, that's a kind of  business success. But the technopolises were based originally on  the ideal of Silicon Valley. Despite that, they've become  something very different from nurturers of new industries. There  is a need to reconsider how technopolises differ from industrial  parks.'' This is at the heart of the problem, according to Ichio  Hiramoto, assistant division chief of the social welfare  division of Mitsubishi Research Institute. As an urban  development specialist, Hiramoto has experience with drafting  plans for large scale development projects such as the  technopolises.    The content of introductory pamphlets for the various  technopolises are virtually indistinguishable, particularly in  the fields that they want to develop. They have sweeping goals  in electronics, software, biotechnology, new materials and so  on. It's almost as if their goals were cut by cookie cutter.  There are very few prefectures with the individuality to say  ``if we don't go into that area, we'll lag behind in research in  that field.''  <H3>  Yamagata Prefecture Achieves Success With Research Focus,  ``Make a Distinctive Plan that Doesn't Follow the System'' </H3>   Of course, there are also individualistic approaches.  Yamagata Prefecture decisively narrowed the target for its  research and development, thus overcoming its geographical  handicap.    Life support technologies, such as the development of an  artificial heart and prevention of aging, are the pride of  Yamagata. Yamagata ``aims to be second to none in Japan'' in  research related to living bioradicals such as active oxygen  which is said to be closely related to damage to living  organisms from causes such as cancer and aging, according to  Yamagata Prefecture's Industrial Promotion Section.    In November 1988 a life support technology research and  development organization was set up as a voluntary organization.  It has become a cooperative development project involving 70  companies and 120 university researchers. A Bioradical  Laboratory was built as the core facility with &yen;4.5 billion  raised by the prefecture. The laboratory drew Fumio Inaba,  professor emeritus of Tohoku Institute of Technology from  neighboring Miyagi Prefecture and began a public-private jointly  funded Bio Light Information Laboratory.    It was possible to attract personnel due to good narrowing  of  the research goal and legwork. Yamagata succeeded in creating a  somewhat different kind of attractiveness with its living body  radical research.    ``A prefecture like ours (with poor geographic conditions)  couldn't survive if we did the same thing as everyone else. It  is important to create a distinctive plan for a local area  rather than to be lead by the national system,'' says the  Industrial Promotion Section persuasively.    There are examples of other local governments where several  tens of pre-existing researchers have been collected in a  foundation or in the tertiary sector to create unique  cooperative research between corporations and local universities.    There are many cases in which practical research results  have  been achieved. For example: Kumamoto Prefecture's apparatus  using optical sensors for non-destructive continuous sweetness  testing of mandarin oranges and the Shin Niigata-Nagaoka  technopolis' sub-micron super accurate CNC lathe.    However, unfortunately the technopolises cannot be compared  to America's Silicon Valley, which gave birth to many companies  like Intel that will bring forth a new generation and which has  become a world-wide mecca for the computer industry.  <H3>  Designated Regions With Inflated Egos, Development From  Perspective of a Single Unit of a Bloc is Indispensable </H3>   Why have 26 locations spawned such similar plans?    In 1984, the year after the establishment of the Technopolis  Law, MITI began approving development plans based on prefectural  applications. This is what MITI officials familiar with the  circumstances back then say.    At the project stage the technopolis was distorted into  something completely different from the original concept. MITI  meant to select two to three sites from across the country in a  strict selection process and create very pure research parks  which would serve as national models. However, at the  application stage there were many prefectures which said that if  other prefectures did it, then they wanted to do it. Then the  local Diet members got involved. As a result, 26 locations were  designated representing more than half of the prefectures. For  the Diet members the technopolises were a way of extending the  public works budget for highways and maintenance. Most local  governments used the technopolises for ``good causes'' and ended  up with plans very different from the original intention.  Regional egos and the machinations of politicians have warped  the concept of the technopolis.    MITI itself does not control the budget for developing the  technopolises. The localities have been chartered by MITI to be  in charge of the benefits of public works. Another problem is  inadequate control by MITI which designated 26 regions even  though that contradicted its purposes.    This is not just a problem with the technopolises. It's also  a problem since then with MITI's Key Facilities Siting Law and  its Regional Core Cities Law. Twenty-three locations have been  designated under the Key Facilities Siting Law and 44 (almost  all of the prefectures) for the Regional Core Cities Law. ``Most  of Japan's model development undertakings are influenced by  various dynamics during the implementation stage and tend to get  uniformly watered down across the country,'' says Mitsubishi  Research Institute assistant division chief Hiramoto. The  technopolises reproduce the problems of Japan's administrative  organization on a smaller scale.    The fact of 26 designated regions cannot be changed. ``The  topic for debate is how to deal with role allocation and mutual  cooperation among the 26 regions. It's necessary to think about  how to use limited manpower and funds efficiently. For this  purpose it's necessary to overcome the existing prefectural  framework to think of development from a perspective as one unit  of a bloc,'' says Yoshikazu Iwasaki, chief researcher of the  research division of Japan Industrial Location Center which  deals with research and drafting of development plans.    For example, the seven prefectures of Kyushu and Tohoku's  six  prefectures have each received a technopolis designation. It's  natural that they'll compete in attracting companies to the  region.    In Kyushu at the end of the first phase of the technopolis  plan in 1990, Kumamoto, which had quickly succeeded in  establishing an image as the mecca for the semiconductor and  related[?rinkuu?] industries, achieved 98.9% of its goal  for  industrial shipments whereas on the opposite shore Nagasaki  contented itself with 69.9%.    Nagasaki Prefecture has little flat land and limited  resources, so it would be difficult to locate there industries  such as semiconductors which require large quantities of water.  Prefectural per capita income languishes at forty-fourth among  the prefectures. A major cause of problems has been the reliance  of the local economy on shipbuilding. ``In reality Nagasaki is  equipped with highways and an airport, so in terms of access it  compares favorably, but it has a poor image compared to Kumamoto  and Fukuoka,'' according to Nagasaki Prefecture's Industrial  Promotion Section.    Nagasaki Prefecture appears poised to begin capitalizing on  its shipbuilding skills by fostering local companies in the area  of machine processing and on its long coastline by developing  marine environmental protection technology and ocean bottom  exploration technology.    However, this approach won't work unless it collaborates  with  the neighboring prefectures. If Kyushu's prefectures can  cooperate to attract industries suited to their technical  specialties and geographic characteristics, then development  will occur in a balanced way across Kyushu and companies will  see the advantages of locating in Kyushu.  <H3>  Corporations Also Need to Change Their Thinking and Move  Toward Research Exchange Unhampered by Company-First-Ism </H3>   In the beginning there was no industry clustered in the  U.S.'  Silicon Valley. Stanford University, a second-tier university,  played a role when an industrial park was built near the  university. That was the beginning of Silicon Valley. Now about  2,000 companies have their headquarters in Silicon Valley which  has become a research park whose researchers spin off start-ups  and nurture them into full-blown companies.    ``The biggest difference from Japan is the existence of  ``software programs'' for nurturing promising companies.  Innovation won't come from splendid buildings built from a  public works mentality,'' according to Mitsubishi Research  Institute's Hiramoto.    In Silicon Valley, university researchers may turn into  entrepreneurs the next day and personnel move frequently between  companies. Rather than start off with a building and an  organization, they pull together the people and organization  most suited to fostering development. This is how Silicon Valley  supports creativity.    In Japan, by comparison, even when companies cluster  together  they're separated by company-first-ism. There's little exchange  of research and little technological impact on local companies.  ``There are forums set up by local governments or foundations,  but they are generally little more than social gatherings.  Research exchange across corporate boundaries won't happen just  because people dance the bon odori together,'' said the head of  a laboratory located in a technopolis.    To turn the technopolises into something substantial, it  isn't enough to simply address administrative problems. Change  must be made to corporate research customs and to the  characteristics that make Japanese poor at exchanges.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-11A>           Figure </FIG>      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-12A>           Figure </FIG></p>

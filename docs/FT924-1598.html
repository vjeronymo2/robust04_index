			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Technology: Bake me a tile as hard as you can - Italian ceramics tougher than stone For decades, researchers have struggled to create materials, such as synthetic diamonds or man-made rubber, which are better than their natural equivalents. In ceramics, the process is still relatively young. And while sophisticated compounds have been developed to replace metals in some high-temperature uses, it is only recently that the natural-versus-synthetic debate has reached mass-market goods such as ceramic tiles. By applying increasingly sophisticated materials analysis and automated production techniques, manufacturers can now make heavy-duty tiles more durable and resistant than stone. So confident are some companies about their new products, which are non-absorbent, resistant to chemicals and as attractive to the eye as natural stone, that they guarantee them for up to a century. Most of the technological innovations have taken place in Italy, the home of world tile production. In spite of growing competition from lower cost countries such as Spain, Turkey and Brazil, Italian companies still account for 28 per cent of world output. Most are concentrated in the ugly industrial town of Sassuolo near Modena in Emilia Romagna, a central Italian region. Although local archaeologists have found traces of tile-making dating back to Roman times in the region, the real surge came in the 1960s as natural gas discoveries in the nearby Po basin provided the plentiful energy to accompany the already rich local deposits of clay. Sassuolo today is an environmentalists' nightmare. Its streets heave with lorries heading for export markets such as Germany and Austria, while other trucks bring in clays not found locally. The region's 200 ceramics companies account for well over half the membership of Italy's ceramics industry federation. Like other single-industry centres, Sassuolo contains both makers of the final product and the specialist machinery needed to manufacture it. The area abounds with family firms making everything from tile conveyor belts to high-temperature ovens working at up to 1,2000C. Most ceramics and machinery makers are still small and family-owned with an average workforce of less than 100. However, a crisis in the ceramics industry in the early 1980s led to a shake-out, which some think may be repeated now. Only six companies have sales over L100bn (Pounds 46m), while the two biggest, Iris and Marazzi, account for 20 per cent of national production. The development of bigger, tougher tiles capable of withstanding the daily pounding of railway platforms or shopping centre floors has involved occasional technological leaps, combined with frequent, less dramatic, innovations, says Romano Minozzi, the chairman and founder of Iris. He does not foresee anything to match the invention of single firing, pioneered in 1974 by his arch-rival Marazzi. By eliminating one of the two firing processes needed to make tiles, the discovery speeded up production times and saved immense amounts of energy. Single firing now accounts for around 65 per cent of glazed tiles produced globally. Mr Minozzi thinks the industry's future now lies in smaller, but constant, innovations, notably to improve the consistency of the raw materials and to refine production processes which are already almost entirely automated. Today's tilemakers, as the inheritors of an artistic tradition, are proud that no two tiles are ever quite the same. However, the introduction of increasingly sophisticated process technology has already allowed them unprecedented control over processes such as the mixing of raw materials, glazing and firing, which have traditionally been the most vulnerable to random factors. The result has been to create tiles that offer unprecedented consistency in their composition, and hence new levels of strength and durability. Filippo Marazzi, the owner and chairman of Marazzi, is slightly sceptical of the 100-year guarantees offered by his rival. 'How many customers will be around to make a complaint?' asks one company official. However, even his group now guarantees its new Enduro range for 30 years of heavy-duty use. Such longevity was inconceivable only a few years ago. Iris's single-firing plant in Sassuolo, the biggest and one of the most modern in Italy, illustrates how computers have vastly improved materials handling and automated production in what was until relatively recently a handicrafts industry. The process starts with detailed chemical analysis of each new shipment of clay, quartz, feldspars and other raw materials which form the base substance for ceramic tiles. 'Only by increasingly sophisticated controls can manufacturers be sure of reaching the required quality standards for the new long-life products,' says Giuseppe Marasti, Iris's head of external relations. Mixing, one of the most complex processes, takes place in huge 25-metre long rotating drums, like giant inverted tumble driers. Only by precision mixing, followed by computer-controlled humidification and drying procedures, can the clay-silicon compounds be turned into the atomized powder which is the basis for the individual 'biscuits' from which tiles are made. Computers stretch as far as the kiln. It is there that the key process of vitrification takes place, whereby the various particles comprising the tile are fused into a single structure of immense strength and resistance. Microprocessor-linked sensors track temperatures throughout the kilns, making sure the heat is exactly right at each stage of the firing process. Recently, Marazzi has taken matters one stage further, with a patented new procedure for spraying the biscuits with a fine silicon powder which, when heated, produces a glass-like crystalline surface impervious to attack. Technology has not yet managed to eliminate the deafening noise and pervasive dust of even the most modern tile factory. However, the extent to which tile-making has become a capital-intensive industry is evident at the Iris works, where advances in automation mean that far fewer employees are exposed to such conditions than in the past. 'The human element is largely limited to quality control,' explains Mr Marasti. The Sassuolo plant, capable of producing 14m sq metres of tiles a year - equivalent to over 3 per cent of Italy's total production - works on a three-shift system round the clock with a workforce of just 300. For manufacturers, further advances in technology promise to push tiles to new limits of durability and strength, and help relatively high-cost producers such as the Italians to meet the mounting challenge from lower-cost rivals. For consumers such as architects and builders, looking for the floor and wall-coverings of the future, the choice between 'artificial' tiles and 'natural' stone will be harder than ever.</p>

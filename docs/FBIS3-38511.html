This "real job deficit"  is 1.7 million higher than the number of unemployed given by the  official statistics from Nuremberg, which put the number of  unemployed people in the east at some 1.2 million at the end of  1993. The real statistics include those citizens who  participate in job-promotion schemes offered by the labor  offices or who commute to western Germany, the DGB noted in  Berlin on Wednesday [2 February].    In Saxony, approximately 790,000 are "underemployed," in  Saxony Anhalt 540,000, in Thuringia 510,000, in Brandenburg  455,000, in Mecklenburg Western Pomerania 365,000, and in the  eastern part of Berlin some 275,000. The situation is most  favorable in Dresden, where the job deficit was 23.6 percent at  the end of 1993. Second came Leipzig (28.4 percent deficit),  while, with an unemployment deficit of 41.3 percent, the Suhl  region in Thuringia came at the bottom of the list.</p>

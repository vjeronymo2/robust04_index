			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Goncharov] </F>   [Text] Orenburg April 29 TASS -- Russian Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin who arrived in Orenburg on Friday to celebrate the  250th jubilee of the Orenburg region (gubernia in the past),  said at the airport to journalists that the government will make  payments, first of all, to peasants after the federal budget is  approved by parliament.    "Concerns, now experienced by all Russia, are characteristic  of the Orenburg region too," he stressed. "Let us try and  settle at least some of them," he added.    Journalists welcoming Chernomyrdin at the airport also asked  him other questions. They were interested when a package of  documents on press support is put into operation and what its  essence is.    The premier replied that the government is also interested  in  this question. He expressed doubt that Russian people need the  press and television in such amounts as now. "The state will  maintain several newspapers and tv channels," the cabinet head  assured.    "However, this is for the time being. Experience will show  what to do in future. I'm against commanding the media. The  government plans to issue a special decision on questions of the  press, which do not brook any delay. The decision will be  issued before the adoption of a press law which will be soon  approved."    Asked by ITAR-TASS about his attitude to the Russian  president's decision to suspend till July the execution of the  cabinet's decision on raising customs duties on imports,  Chernomyrdin noted: "We postponed this decision ourselves, since  we `outdid' ourselves."    "There are international norms: When changes are made in  customs duties, three months are given to conclude new contracts  and to establish contacts. We should also abide by this  three-month norm by some items."    The premier's trip to the Orenburg region will last three  days.</p>

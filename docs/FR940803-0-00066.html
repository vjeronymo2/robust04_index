			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Federal awarding agency of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Federal awarding agencies may make site visits, as needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance data from recipients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;518.52  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Financial reporting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A, Financial Status Report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Each Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to use the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A when the SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF&hyph;270 is used only for advances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal awarding agency requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of the documentation on hand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the Federal awarding agency upon request of the recipient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

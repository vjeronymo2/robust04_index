			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in  Ukrainian at 1600 GMT on 30 May carries a 27-minute recorded  news conference by Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr  Moroz in Kiev on 30 May. No video is available.    Moroz is asked about Ukraine's participation in the  Interparliamentary Assembly of CIS countries. Moroz says he  believes Ukraine should be part of this structure "because there  are so many issues to be resolved today--first and foremost,  economic issues in relations and within the CIS."    Moroz then discusses the Crimean issue. He says: "We have  just formed a commission of parliamentary deputies headed by  Borys Oliynyk. They will leave for Crimea in the near future  and will work with the relevant commission of the Crimean  parliament. In my view, we should finally agree on a joint  result that will consent to the abrogation of the decisions of  the Crimean parliament on the introduction of the 1992  Constitution."    Moroz says there is a need to avoid confrontation between  the  Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments. He adds: "I understand  that, in a different situation, one could resort to more radical  measures. Today, however, it is not in the interests of the  world community, of Ukraine, or of many individual countries.  They would not be happy if the Crimean situation became  aggravated. Therefore, in my view, it is simply necessary to  pursue a considered and restraining policy in order to keep the  radicals in Crimea, as well as radicals in other places, within  the Constitution."    Speaking on a political union with Russia, Moroz said: "I  think that we have a political union with Russia today on the  basis of a treaty signed--if I am not mistaken--on 19 November  1991. If we need to clarify some articles of this treaty, and  if there is such a need, then I think we will come to an  agreement with the Russian leadership, and we will conclude a  new treaty. A key aspect of this document, however, would  undoubtedly be the full state sovereignty or state independence  of Ukraine, as well as the state independence of Russia. This  would be a treaty between great neighboring countries."    On the subject of nuclear weapons, Moroz says that foreign  leaders were constantly asking when Ukraine would become a  non-nuclear state, but they never spoke about the conditions  that their states had to fulfill if this happened.    Answering a question on the problems of the Black Sea Fleet,  Moroz says that it was indeed a very complex issue and that many  mistakes had been made. He says he believes that the fleet  should be an element of collective defense but that much time  had already been wasted. He adds that the Black Sea was a zone  of specific interest to both Ukraine and Russia and that the  problems of the fleet should be resolved proceeding from this  fact.    Moroz says he would decline to speak in any more detail on  the issue of the fleet because "there are many aspects that are  very important in themselves. When we begin to take these  aspects as a basis, then we can come up with a decision that is  contrary to what was envisaged when this subject was included in  the agreement or negotiations." He adds that "we should work  toward creating both a Ukrainian fleet and a Russian fleet that  will always have relations between themselves."    Speaking on the subject of nuclear disarmament and the arms  question in general, Moroz says that Ukraine's acquisition of a  non-nuclear status creates certain advantages for the West. He  says: "We gave them the possibility of earning additional  profits. Take, for example, the trade in arms. In the last two  years, the volume of the arms trade by the United States has  increased by approximately 18 billion U.S. dollars, whereas we  have nothing, even though we have enterprises, developed  technology, and products that we could sell in foreign markets."  Moroz adds that the objective interests of Ukraine's economy  must be taken into account and says these interests involve  Ukraine's manufacturing potential, which today is dependent on  the military industrial complex and on those enterprises that  manufacture nuclear weapons.    On the subject of land privatization, Moroz says that land  should not be bought and sold, but could be leased for a period  of 90 years or for shorter periods and that this would not be a  threat to foreign investment.</p>

That's where he prefers to do most of  his business. These are the least intimate of surroundings, but  for the purposes of a discussion about Europe the 22 empty  chairs serve a helpful purpose. The ghosts of Gummer and  Redwood, Portillo and Heseltine, Clarke and Shephard flicker  through the whispering gallery where the drama of Major's  survival -- the pressures that define the choice he must now  make -- is being acted out.    The prime minister, however, is not prepared to read the  script that I and others have written. He doesn't see it that  way. He denies that the politics of survival have anything to  do with his stance on Europe. In his first discursive interview  since the enlargement row began, he portrayed himself as a  broker working for the European cause, who would probably get  what he wanted, and of whom it was "fatuous" to assume he was  doing it because he was being pushed around by sceptic bastards.    "There seems to be a position where on one day I'm a raving  Europhiliac prepared to roll over and accept everything from  Europe, and on the next day I'm a phobe supreme who is supposed  to disagree with everything from Europe," he said. "The truth  is of course a good deal more complex."    For a start, the enlargement negotiation and the matter of  the blocking minority -- shalt 23 votes or 27 be enough to stop  some thungs happening? -- was nothing new. "Time after time  you'll find solutions are reached at the 59th minute of the 11th  hour in the Community. It is not an unusual proposition. I am  not complacent about the difficulties on this occasion, but I  have lived through this before and I think it is perfectly  possible that a satisfactory compromise will be reached."    He declined to speculate what this compromise might be. We  were meeting on Wednesday [23 March] evening, just after a  private audience of l922 committee members had misinterpreted  him as talking about a "two-tier" solution. A false story,  apparently. But how could we conceivably get the best end of a  compromise when we had so few allies?    This was another misreading. Only Spain is a public ally,  but "a number of other countries have indicated that they are  prepared to compromise, that they don't see 27 as a take-it or  leave-it offer. The Portuguese prime minister sat in the seat  you're sitting on and made it perfectly clear that he thought a  compromise was possible."    And later: "A minority feel very strongly about 27. A large  number of them are prepared to compromise."    So there was reason for hope reminiscent, he said, of the  optout on the social chapter during the Maastricht Treaty. That  occasion is big in his memory. He plainly rates his negotiating  ability highly. And his point of principle over the votes, he  revealed, has a longer-term purpose.    "When we joined the Community, the blocking minority  represented 30 per cent of the population of Europe. It has  steadily crept up. At the moment it is 40 per cent, give or take  a point something. If we move to 27, it would be over 41 per  cent." This might be just for two years until the 1996  Intergovernmental Conference, called supposedly to sort out many  big institutional issues. The British fear is that in those two  years a raft of Euro social law, killing jobs, would bypass our  unavailing veto.    But Major is just as fearfill of what will happen in 1996  itself, and later. "When the Visegrad countries (Poland,  Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic) join, as I hope they will  around the turn of the century, if we applied the same  arithmetic we would be getting into the absurd position of  Britain, Germany and France, who provide overwhelmingly the  resources of the Community, being outvoted on the qualified  majority voting (QMV) procedure."    In other words: "If you increase the 40 per cent now, it  makes it more difficult to reduce it within a very short period  in l966, and I think that poses very great problems."    Problems, moreover, not just for Britain. Here comes John  Major, the self-proclaimed good European. "I don't accept the  principle that the good European always accepts what happens to  be the majority view on the day or the fashionable view of the  moment." The good European, on the contrary, looked for policies  that recaptured "the hearts and minds and enthusiasm that many  people had for the Community a few years ago."    Hardly a sceptic formulation: perhaps not very historical  either. Heart, in fact, is not where he any longer locates the  enthusiasm. "The vast majority are Europeans not in their heart  but in their head."    "Are you in your heart or your head?" I asked.    "I am very much a European in my head. I believe it is  essential for the economic wellbeing across Europe."    "But not in your heart?"    "I am more a European in my head than in my heart, but I  want  to see Europe succeed."    This success, I put it to him, was now being imperilled by  his tactics. If he was wrong about the compromise, he might  delay, perhaps kill off, the enlargement Britain had promoted  more keenly than anyone. This wasn't necessary, he said. "Even  if it were genuinely impossible to reach an agreement, there is  still no reason why the Community should not agree that the  enlargement should go ahead on the present basis, knowing they  can return to the debate after that, and in any event return to  it in 1996."    A plausible, but surely disingenuous, suggestion. Designed,  perhaps, to shift the blame for any delay on to the countries  still insisting on the 27-vote block. "You can go ahead with  23, as it is now, knowing it is going to be reviewed. The point  I am making is that you do not have to agree a change in order  to let these other countries in."    If the others won't wear this, Major has steeled himself to  accept a delay. There were various trigger moments. "It is not  imperative that it should be settled next weekend" (when the  Foreign Ministers meet in loannina). But the Swedes, in  particular, needed to get moving on their own parliamentary  votes "a little while after Easter."    There was another limiting moment. "I think probably if you  did not have an agreement until after the European elections,  you could not have enlargement go ahead on the present basis. I  would hope that will not be the case."    Nonetheless, delay is now evidently on the British agenda.  "Enlargement is extremely important. It would be a great shame  if enlargement were to be delayed. But that is what it is. It  would be delayed. I very much hope it will not be."    "I believe we can reach an agreement that will mean it will  not be. But there is an inevitability about enlargement of the  Community. It is going to happen. I hope it is going to happen  on 1st January next year. But because we are very much in  favour of enlargement does not automatically mean that, on  another particular issue, we surrender a British interest about  which we feel strongly."    Any such inevitability is, of course, challenged by anxious  leaders in applicant countries. They fear a catastrophic loss  of momentum for what is already a tricky cause. To Major what  seems to matter more is getting the European system right now.  Time and again, he returned to the problems of those who  already belong.    On the hard-edge politics of all this he gave a series of  replies to scotch the wisdom of the moment. What about the  European Parliament, often cited as the body most trenchantly  defending the 27? Did he see it as infinitely flexible? "No.  But I do think it is probable that if the European Council  reach an accommodation the Parliament, who want enlargement,  will accept that accommodation."    What about the parliaments of the other 11, who all have to  ratify the deal? He'd learned over Maastricht that these  assemblies posed little problem to their leaders. "I do not  think there will be any difficulty with ratifying elsewhere in  Europe whatever the Council agrees."    They were certainly less of a problem than the British  Parliament. With this we reached the nub of Major's crisis, and  the charges now being made against him: of duplicity, cowardice,  desertion of principle kow-towing to the phobes, saving his own  skin, retreating from the heart of Europe.    I pointed out there were certainly more Tories now pushing  him not to compromise. This idea gets on his nerves.    "Can I mention a fallacy in that argument? The fallacy is  that I am wholly reactive and only concerned with one side of my  party or the other. It might perhaps occur to people that might  feel pretty strongly myself about what was the right thing to  do." If he hadn't felt pretty strongly, he wouldn't have  brought back the Maastricht agreement, or seen it through  Parliament. "It is simply fatuous to assume that I an only  structuring what I believe we must do on QMV to take account of  other people's views. I happen to be doing what I believe to be  right."    He couldn't understand why taking a strong line for Britain  was regarded as disgraceful The French did it all the time They  were doing it even as we spoke, blocking an increase of seats in  the European Parliament until a deal was signed guaranteeing the  Parliament would stay in Strasbourg.    "Why is it," he added in seemingly genuine bemusement, "that  only in this country is the debate conducted in these rather  extreme terms of phobic and enthusiast?"    He might well ask. Between these wrenching pressures, he  struggles for survival. Or so it seems. But he rejects an  interpretation of current reality which is one of the few things  almost every Tory politician now agrees on.    "If you're trying to pick up the stories that say I am  deliberately trying to keep this going in order to bang a John  Bull drum at the European election, I just have to say to you  that is plain wrong."    "But it has a sort of John Bull effect."    "It is just plain wrong. I am concerned about the Community  being a success. I am not interested in hauling the walls down.  That doesn't mean I have to agree with every current fashion PR  policy. But no, I am not seeking a campaign for partisan  interest to damage the European Community, most emphatically  not. I want it to have the respect and affection of people in  this country."    Was there not a close connection between the party's fate in  June and his own fate as leader?    "I have made it perfectly clear before that at the last  election I was elected and the Conservative Party was elected,  and I expect to contest the next election as leader of the  Conservative Party and I will do everything to win it and I  think we will."    "Do you feel certain you will be leader of the party at that  time?"    "Indeed I will."    "If a lot of Tory MPs see in the European election that  their  own seats have gone, they're going to panic, aren't they?"    "The parliamentary party I don't believe will."    "That's a very confident statement. They don't seem exactly  unified."    "This is all `if' stuff, isn't it?"    "You can't pretend it's an academic question."    "I have given you my answer as to what I expect."    In this conversation, the prime minister exhibited much  calmness. He thinks nobody understands the EC better than he  does, especially in negotiating mode. He hadn't intended to go  to the brink like this, though it's hard to see how his tactics,  once committed against a deal everyone else thought had been  struck at Lisbon in 1992, could have any other outcome. Unless  he's a good actor, which he may be, he doesn't recognise the  stark terms -- Machiavelli on a bad day -- in which he's  portrayed. Neither phobe nor phile, he equally rejects the  choice of fool or knave.    He is, however, gambling. He intends to stay in Downing  Street for the duration. He sincerely believes he is not  sacrificing "Europe" to this end. And if he does, he will not  believe it.</p>

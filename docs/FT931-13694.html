			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Technology: Watermarks made easy - Worth Watching It usually takes one tonne of paper, a mill and several weeks of waiting to produce watermarked paper for cheques, tickets and other documents. Now, TSI Design, of London, has developed a way of imprinting watermarks using litho printing and speciality inks. The inks contain an ingredient that enables the mark to sink into the paper. TSI says it can produce watermarks for as few as 30 sheets of paper and the cost is little more than that of printing an extra colour. The company believes the technique will prove popular for printing tickets, vouchers and certificates as well as top-notch corporate stationery. TSI: UK, 081 739 7268.</p>

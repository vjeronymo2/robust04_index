			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / American Barrick joins fight for Lac with CDollars 2.1bn bid American Barrick, the gold producer controlled by Canadian entrepreneur Mr Peter Munk, yesterday joined the battle for Lac Minerals with a CDollars 2.1bn (USDollars 1.52bn) bid for the Toronto-based mining group. Barrick's offer is likely to find more favour with Lac directors and shareholders than the hostile bid earlier this month by Royal Oak Mines of Vancouver. Mr James Pitblado, Lac's new chairman, said it was 'always gratifying to be wooed' but added that the offer was 'still inadequate and doesn't reflect the values in this company'. Barrick has offered Lac shareholders CDollars 4 in cash and 0.31 Barrick shares per Lac share, or an all-paper deal of 0.43 Barrick shares per Lac share. The offer is valued at about CDollars 14 a share, fractionally higher than the Royal Oak bid. However, investors are likely to prefer Barrick paper to Royal Oak, which is a much smaller company with higher-cost mines. Mr Munk said the acquisition could give Barrick a chance to repeat the rapid growth it has enjoyed in recent years from the development of the Goldstrike mine in Nevada. Its 'experience, capacity and financial wherewithal' could be used to bring substantial reserves at Lac's two Chilean properties rapidly to production. It would probably sell some of Lac's six largest properties in Canada. Lac last week raised its estimates of reserves in the El Indio belt in northern Chile from 3.5m to 7.3m ounces, plus 11.8m ounces in 'geological resources'. Mr Munk said Barrick would be able to develop these, largely from internal resources. There is also potential for 'significant' savings in overheads when the two companies are combined. Existing and potential earnings would more than offset charges, estimated at a maximum of USDollars 50m a year, for amortisation of goodwill. Barrick shares dipped CDollars 1.12 to close at CDollars 31.25 in Toronto yesterday. Lac gained 88 cents to CDollars 14.25.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Events" newscast] </F>   [Text] According to all polls held in this country, the  Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] will win the 20 March  elections. Rene Figueroa, of ARENA, has said that the voters'  intentions to favor this organization are very clear and that  this tendency is growing as elections day draws closer.    [Begin Figueroa recording] Looking at our own polls and at  those carried out by the University of Central America [UCA] we  find that it is clear that the electoral preferences for the  presidential ticket made up of Armando Calderon Sol and Enrique  Borgo Bustamante indicates that the ARENA candidates are sure  first round winners.    The trend is clear, the backing of the Salvadoran people is  clear, the intentions of the Salvadoran voters are clear.  Another conclusion we have reached is that the Christian  Democratic Party and the National Convergence-Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front [FMLN] coalition are competing for a  distant, very distant, second place. We want to make this  clear. Our polls and those of UCA indicate this.    We have reached the conclusion that as we approach election  day, the support for ARENA grows while the support for the  Christian Democratic Party and for the National Convergence-FMLN  coalition remains unchanged.

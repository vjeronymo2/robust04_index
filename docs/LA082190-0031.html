			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LANDMARKS / COUNTY HISTORICAL SITES;  </P> <P> THE BUENAVENTURA MISSION AQUEDUCT  </P> <P> * HISTORY: Built between 1792 and 1815 by Chumash Indians, under the direction  of either a Franciscan priest from the San Buenaventura Mission, trained in  hydrology, or of stonemasons brought from Mexico. The seven-mile-long aqueduct  supplied water for about 350 mission residents and for crop irrigation.  </P> <P> * LOCATION: Only some sections have been  </P> <P> unearthed. It begins one mile north of the confluence of San Antonio Creek and  the Ventura River, and snakes south to the mission. The largest section, the  Canada Larga, is at 234 Canada Larga Road.  </P> <P> * HOURS: Shown by appointment only. Contact the county Cultural Heritage Board  at 654-3967.  </P> <P> The Buenaventura Mission aqueduct once stretched seven miles to the ocean, but  urban growth and vandals have reduced the county's oldest landmark to rubble.  All that remains are a few buried sections and a 100-foot-long piece protected  by a chain-link fence.  </P> <P> The stone and mortar structure was built by Chumash Indians sometime between  1792 and 1815. Less than a quarter of a mile, including the seven-foot-high  Canada Larga section, remains.  </P> <P> Originally, a series of channels gradually sloped from a dam on the San Antonio  Creek, about one mile north of its junction with the Ventura River, to the San  Buenaventura Mission. The Canada Larga section served as a siphon, drawing  water uphill through covered conduits.  </P> <P> "It's a remarkable structure," said Robert Lopez, an archeology professor at  Moorpark College.  </P> <P> The aqueduct provided a dependable water supply that allowed the mission to  flourish. But it is also credited with changing the Chumash Indians from  hunters and gatherers to farmers, Lopez said.  </P> <P> The aqueduct's origins remain a mystery. Some historians have said construction  began in 1792, 10 years after Father Junipero Serra founded the San  Buenaventura Mission. Others place construction between 1805 and 1815, after  the arrival of Mexican stonemasons. Another puzzle involves the design of the  aqueduct. Some archeologists maintain that it was the brainchild of a  Franciscan priest with military training in hydrologic engineering, while  others claim it was inspired by the ancient Romans.  </P> <P> Sections of the aqueduct were destroyed during an 1861 flood. Later, settlers  used its stones to build foundations for houses or tore it down to plant crops.  </P> <P> A 12-foot-wide hole was blown in the Canada Larga section in 1900 to make way  for a dirt road through Weldon Canyon. Fearing further damage, officials fenced  off the remaining portion in 1977, five years after it was declared a county  landmark.  </P> <P> Archeologists have located seven sections of the aqueduct, including a  ground-level stone channel, east of Ventura Avenue between Vince and Lewis  streets, that served as an unpaved parking lot until the city declared it a  historical landmark in 1982.

The two Gulf oil states recently began "intensive efforts"  to  ease the embargo, but "this campaign did not win the approval"  of other Arab countries because of the February 25 Hebron  massacre, the diplomat told AFP.    "All the other Arab countries want to maintain the indirect  boycott" affecting companies dealing with Israel, the diplomat  said on condition his name not be used.    Diplomats, who had expected the Arab League to agree to lift  the indirect boycott, said Saturday the "climate was not  favorable" because of the massacre of 30 Palestinians by a  Jewish settler in the West Bank town of Hebron.    The United States had called on Arab states to ease their  46-year-old trade boycott of Israel in recognition of the accord  on Palestinian self-rule signed in September.    But Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said on arrival  in  Cairo for the Arab League meeting: "The boycott of Israel was  decided because of its occupation of Arab lands.    "It cannot be lifted before Israel withdraws totally from  occupied Arab territories and the Palestinians create their own  state," al-Shar' said.    Syria made no distinction between the direct boycott of  Israel and the indirect boycott, al-Shar' said. Apart from "one  or two countries," other Arab states had the same view, he added.    Two-thirds of the Arab League's 22 members would have to  support such a move if it came to a vote.    Since the Israeli-PLO accord was signed on September 13,  Washington has called for the indirect boycott to be lifted in  exchange for US participation in developing the Gaza Strip and  West Bank town of Jericho where autonomy is to be launched.    Arab countries have boycotted Israel since it was created in  1948. Three years later, they set up a body in charge of  drawing up a "black list" of international firms with interests  in Israel.    Apart from Egypt, which made peace with Israel in 1979, only  Kuwait has lifted the indirect boycott, last year.    Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani met  in London in January with Israeli counterpart Shim'on Peres and  called for a lifting of the boycott.    Oman has invited Israel to attend a multilateral meeting on  Middle East water resources on April 17 -- the first such move  by a Gulf country.</p>

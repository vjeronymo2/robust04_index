			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL DELAYS ACTION ON ETHICS RULES  EXEMPTIONS  </P> <P> The Fair Political Practices Commission on Wednesday postponed action until  January on a staff recommendation to exempt public officials in small cities  from certain conflict-of-interest regulations.  </P> <P> Discussion of the issue, prompted by a dispute in Signal Hill, was delayed when  officials from Southern California cities could not reach Sacramento after the  city's airport was closed because of fog.  </P> <P> Public officials whose principal residence is 300 feet to 2,500 feet from a  development are restricted from voting on the project unless it affects the  value of their homes the same way it affects other nearby property. The  commission staff has proposed exempting officials in cities with populations  less than 25,000, where council members are elected on an at-large basis and  the city is 10 square miles or less.  </P></p>

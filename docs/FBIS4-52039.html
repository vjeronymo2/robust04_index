			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Justice Minister Shigeto  Nagano hinted at his resignation Friday [6 May] over his earlier  remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre is a fabrication, saying  the remarks were "inappropriate." Nagano told a news conference  that he wants to completely recant his denial of the 1937  Nanjing massacre which he had made in Wednesday's edition of the  MAINICHI SHIMBUN, saying the slaughter was an "undeniable fact."    "My remarks regarding the historical incident (of the  Nanjing  massacre) which I made the other day were inappropriate, so I  would like to withdraw them," Nagano said.    Nagano said, "I share exactly the same view with Prime  Minister (Tsutomu) Hata, who said in Paris that our country's  invasion and colonial rule (of Asian neighbors) inflicted  unbearable suffering and sorrow on many people."    "I feel responsibility deeply, so I would like to live up to  the decision of Hata who appointed me to this office," he said.    Hata, currently on a four-nation European tour, reprimanded  Nagano over the phone on Friday for his remarks, government  sources said.    Nagano told the mass-circulation MAINICHI that "the Nanjing  incident was a fabrication," and that "I still think it wrong to  define the war as a war of aggression (by Japan)."    The sources said Hata was "very concerned" about the Asian  reaction to this latest attempt to reinterpret Japan's prewar  history. "The aggressive behavior of our nation and colonial  domination caused unbearable suffering and sorrow on many  people," Hata reportedly told Nagano while outlining his  cabinet's position.    Supporting former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remarks  that Japan made the invasion toward Asian nations, Nagano said  during Friday's news conference, "Japan with its self-righteous  attitude invaded (those nations) and gave unbearable pain to  (their) people." Nagano said, "each Japanese citizen must  recognize these historical incidents and share the resolve not  to repeat these things."    Nagano, 71, a graduate of the former elite Japanese Military  Academy, assumed the post of first lieutenant in the Japanese  Imperial Army in 1945 when World War II ended.    Nagano, a House of Councillors member of the coalition's  core  party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], is a former chief of  staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force.    Nagano, saying he had visited Nanjing several times before  the end of the World War II, however, said that the number of  people who were killed in Nanjing is not certain. "But, there  must have been a massacre even if the number of those killed  differs according to historians."    On the so-called foreign "comfort women" who were forced to  provide sex to Japanese soldiers during World War II, Nagano  said the government "should deal with the issue sincerely."    Beijing and Seoul led Asian nations in condemning Nagano's  remarks, with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu calling  the remarks a distortion of historical facts.    Domestically, the chorus of reprimands continued to build.  [passage omitted]</p>

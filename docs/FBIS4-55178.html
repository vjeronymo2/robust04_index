			<p>BFN     [Text] As it is known, due to Italy's objections, Slovenia  was not admitted into the so-called E-10 group last week, which  is a group of former socialist countries that are partners to  the G-7 group of the most developed nations. This morning,  Economics and Development Minister Davorin Kracun, who headed  the Slovene delegation at this meeting, spoke about what  actually happened at the Warsaw summit. At the same time he  explained the progress of our negotiations to join GATT. Drago  Flis reports:    [Begin Flis recording] The E-10 group is relatively young.  It pools new Eastern and Central European countries, among  which Slovenia is still an observer for the time being. At the  East-West conference in Warsaw, where Slovenia was represented  by Economics and Development Minister Davorin Kracun, Slovenia  displayed great interest in membership in the E-10 group,  however, this was blocked by Italy, whose representative -- the  charge d'affaires in the Italian Embassy in Warsaw -- cited  instructions from Rome.    This, of course, cannot signal an endless Italian objection,  because other countries, including the United States and  Germany, have no objections to Slovene membership, but, on the  contrary, emphasize that the Slovene economic policy is one of  the most successful among the new countries, that is to say, the  countries in transition. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Brown  promised Kracun that Slovenia will become a full-fledged E-10  member at the next session of the East-West conference, which  will be hosted by the United States, and this group will thus  turn into an E-11 group.    The countries are preparing a partnership for development  plan, which is supposed to be a sort of an economic equivalent  to the military Partnership for Peace plan. According to some  estimates, $200 billion of direct investments from the old, that  is, developed nations gathered in the top G-7 group awaits the  new countries within this scheme. Naturally, the new countries  will need to be open for this, too.    Slovenia is also negotiating with the still existant GATT,  which will transform itself into the world trade organization,  WTO. In the opinion of Minister Kracun, our country has now  reached a favorable regime of protection of our own economy.  For example, in agriculture, which is the most sensitive  department, GATT consented to Slovenia allowing only a minimal  access to our agricultural market, which will be 3 to 5 percent,  with the continued existence of lists of goods, quotas  [preloman], and a 27 percent tariff that will, of course,  continue to protect domestic agriculture.    Slovenia will observe the new norms of international trade  in  industrial imports, where the highest tariff is supposed to be  27 percent, while for many items the new tariff will be lower,  Minister Kracun said, among other things.

			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Dangerfield Sued Over Dog Story: Comedy actor-writer Harold Ramis sued comedian  Rodney Dangerfield, accusing him of stealing an idea for a film about a dog  named Rover Dangerfield "who looked and acted like Dangerfield." In the federal  court suit seeking at least $1 million, Ramis claims that he conceived of Rover  Dangerfield in 1986 and told Dangerfield about his idea of making a movie about  the dog.  </P> <P> The two men reached a contractual agreement whereby Ramis later received  $350,000 from Dangerfield after writing a screenplay for the film. Dangerfield  began production of the film last December, the suit said, but Ramis claims  that Dangerfield has failed to pay the balance on money promised in the  contract. (Case No. 90-6025. Filed Nov. 8, 1990)  </P></p>

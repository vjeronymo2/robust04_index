			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by Mehmet </F> Alkas in the TRT studio -- live]    [Text] [Alkas] In our news report we talked about a more  comprehensive military operation against the Serbs. What do you  think the chances are for such an operation to be carried out?  Do you have any information about that?    [Cetin] As you might remember, after the bombing of the  Sarajevo market place at the beginning of February, NATO waited  for a UN request to act. The request was made on 6 February.  On 9 February, NATO gave the Serbs an ultimatum and delineated  a 20 km wide security belt around Sarajevo. It placed the  weapons in that area under its own control. Had this not been  done, it threatened to carry out air raids.    At the time Turkey argued that since the UN Security Council  had declared six safe havens on 6 May 1993, NATO must do the  same in all the six regions, not only in Sarajevo.    That did not happen, however. Now, a decision has been  reached under which the UN secretary general has the right to  exercise his authority. This is the right decision but it is  too late. In a letter to the NATO secretary general this  morning, the UN secretary general asked him to decide to  destroy, through air raids, the mortar, guns, and tanks in and  around the five additional regions, that is Gorazde, (?Zepce),  Srebrenica, Tuzla, and Bihac. This is a significant  development. It has come too late but it is the right decision.    I want to differentiate between two things. NATO cannot  intervene directly because it is not its area of duty. It can  only intervene if the UN secretary general asks it to. NATO can  carry out two kinds of mission there. One is close air support.  That has been going on very weakly during the past few days.  The commander in the area has to ask for this support each  time. The second mission is an air attack. Now, if it starts  with an air attack, NATO does not have to wait for the request  of the UN Security Council or for the UN officials in  Bosnia-Herzegovina each time it carries out this mission. It  can continue with the air raids until it gets results.    Now, the request has been made to NATO. The NATO Council  will convene in Brussels tomorrow to discuss this request. The  Council is composed of the ambassadors to NATO. After a  decision is reached, NATO will tell Butrus-Ghali that it is  ready to carry out the mission. The minute Butrus-Ghali says go  ahead, NATO can start to act, and after that, as I said, NATO  has the initiative. This is an important development, but there  should not have been so much suffering for this development to  take place. I hope and wish... [changes thought] NATO has 16  members. The decision to carry air raids can only be made if it  is unanimous. Efforts were made today to ensure this unanimity.    [Alkas] There is also the Russian issue. Russian President  Yeltsin has blamed the Serbs for the increased tension. Foreign  Minister Kozyrev accused the Serbs of trying the limits of the  world's patience. Russia announced that it will officially end  its mediator role in the talks with the Serbs. What is  happening in the Russian front, Mr. Cetin?    [Cetin] What the Russian officials are saying is not new.  Russia thought that this problem could be solved through  diplomacy, through negotiations. The United States also asked  Russia to try this path. However, if you look back to the past  two years, you see that the Serbs only tried to gain time. We  said both in Brussels and in New York that the Serbs were taking  part in the negotiations only to gain time, because they needed  time to achieve their aim in Gorazde. That is indeed what  happened. And while doing that, the Serbs deceived the  Russians. They promised that they would leave Gorazde to  positions 3 km away, and that they would not occupy Gorazde.    This is not the first time. We have been living through that  for the past two years. In this way, the Serbs both gained time  and prevented the United Nations and NATO from reaching a  decision earlier.    [Alkas] Do you think that a common approach to the problem  is beginning to take shape between the United States and Russia?    [Cetin] We also talked to the Russians about this issue. I  met with Kozyrev a couple of times. I told him that to solve  this problem in the Balkans, Russia must contribute, that we  must act together. It is a fact that especially due to their  common orthodox religion, Russia and the Serbs have close  relations, Russia has influence over them. The whole world  wanted to take advantage of this, especially the United States.  However, the world later realized that the Belgrade officials,  the Serbs, understand only one language: a determined threat to  intervene. Otherwise, the negotiations mean nothing for them.  The Russians realized this too now. I believe that they can  now contribute more easily at the UN Security Council, if their  policy continues along these lines.    [Alkas] Thank you.</p>

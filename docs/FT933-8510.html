			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Arts: Play with politics - Radio WHEN SO many BBC plays deal with Irish life, it was right to give Tom Paulin's All the Way to the Empire Ballroom (Radio 4, Monday), a dramatic account of how Irish life assumed its present shape. It is October 1921: Paulin shows Lloyd George and Winston Churchill virtually tricking Arthur Griffith into signing the partition agreement that has led to the wretched situation of our own times. The play examines the problems of persuading Griffith, Michael Collins and Erskine Childers to consider partition, and of ensuring that the Unionists would remain loyal enough to keep Lloyd George in Power. But Paulin, being a poet, has added extra drama. We have a glance at Lloyd George's affair with his secretary Frances Stevenson. We have the proposal to make Sir John Lavery (busy painting Collins' portrait) Governor-General of Ireland. There is a mad moment when Lloyd George, in conference with the Irish delegation, loses the paper recording Griffith's agreement. The only concession to true poetry is in Collins's account of the hanging of six of his colleagues. Director Pam Brighton does not ask her company to represent the historic sound of the characters' voices. They are just politicians. Politics of another kind tinged Radio 3's Sunday play, for it was a repeat of the 1989 broadcast of Plato's Symposium, translated by Tom Griffith and directed by John Theocharis. No need to recount the content here - you know it, or you don't. Griffith uses current middle-class language, fluent and expressive, and the performance is excellently done by fine players, with Socrates by Leo McKern, as judgmental and amusing as in his more familiar role, and Paul Shelley as a not-very-drunk Alcibiades. Morally, its view of love between men seems to be coming back into fashion, except in the US navy. File on Four, 4pm on Thursday, dealt with computer crime. It gave several examples of cases that had been reported, even settled, but no hint of how computer interference was carried out. This is a problem for pages other than this. Most computers, we were told, can obtain money in various ways, 'not intellectual'. There is also the problem of the virus, which may not be used for profit but can destroy calculations. One is the 'Friday the 13th' virus, any news of which may be out today. I was disappointed in Radio 3's Changing Times on Tuesday, a view by Max Easterman of how jazz developed up to 1940. This week was dedicated to 1926, and this was the year in which (at school) I became seriously interested in jazz. My key entry was Washboard Blues by Red Nichols and his Five Pennies, recorded that year. It is a clever, almost neo-Mozartian arrangement for five star players (the drummer was later in my record of Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta), who made records that set a fashion among white players. Easterman never mentioned Nichols, the leading white trumpet-player before Beiderbecke, and gave little attention to the small groups, apart from playing the Memphis Five in Tampico to show how poor it was. He was more concerned with the effect of the improved electric recording of the bigger orchestras. Interesting in its way, but less exciting than the small bands, and less to do with jazz. This week's Book at Bedtime on Radio 4 was Alice Walker's tale of a black woman singer who sells her best song to a young white fan. He sings it with all her mannerisms, but confesses that he does not know what it is about. Still, he makes a great fortune, indeed almost lives Presley's life - and death. He rewards the black lady generously, and the moral is 'Try and make the people you know happy.' What made me especially happy was the sympathetic reading by Whoopi Goldberg.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] Koshiro Ishida, director general of the Management  and Coordination Agency and Katsuyuki Hikasa, minister of the  posts and telecommunications, are set to meet on 22 June to make  a final decision on a draft package of deregulatory measures  that have been studied by the Information and Telecommunications  Panel under the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters  [headed by Prime Minister Hata] of the government. The draft  package of deregulatory measures calls for lifting the ban on  the connection of exclusive business telephone circuits to urban  public telephone circuits managed by the Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corporation (NTT), in both international and domestic  telephone services and for reducing the inspection of radio  stations run by domestic telephone companies from once every  year at present to once every five years. The draft package of  deregulatory measures also calls for relaxing the current  regulation on the output of local radio stations. In this way,  the draft package of deregulatory measures, if put into effect,  would provide noteworthy convenience for domestic telephone  subscribers and also have a noteworthy effect on value-added  network (VAN) companies and foreign telephone companies.    The backbone of the draft package of deregulatory measures  in  the information and telecommunications sector is to: 1) lift the  ban on the connection of the exclusive business telephone  circuits to the urban public telephone circuits; 2) to bring  efficiency to the use of radiowaves; and 3) to regulate charges  imposed by telecommunications companies and curb the issuance of  service licenses.    Foreign VAN companies have strongly asked that Japan lift  its  ban on the connection of exclusive business telephone circuits  to urban public telephone circuits. The Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications [MPT] has already announced its decision to  lift the ban on the connection at home. As a result of lifting  the ban, the NTT has suffered a nearly 40 percent fall in  long-distance telephone charges and a sharp decline in the  number of its subscribers. Fearing their adverse effect on the  NTT's management, MPT has taken relief measures, including  allowing the NTT to impose additional charges. MPT plans to  take measures to prevent drastic changes from occurring in the  international telecommunications sector, and the ban on the  connection of exclusive business telephone circuits to the urban  public telephone circuits will be lifted next year.    The number of deregulatory measures on the use of radiowaves  is more than 10, the largest amount. The issuance of individual  licenses for radiowaves used by transmit stations for mobile  telephones (portable and car telephones) will be abolished and a  "comprehensive frequency designation system" will be introduced  whereby the use of all usable frequencies are approved. The  current inspection period of large-scale telecommunications and  radio stations will be extended and they will be inspected only  once every five years.    In the broadcasting sector, the current regulation on the  output of community broadcasting stations, which are also called  mini-FM stations, will be relaxed. Their output has been  regulated uniformly to one watt, and the regulation has been  criticized as incompatible with the situation in local  communities. MPT plans to relax the regulation in terms of not  causing jamming after surveying the number of enterprises or  individuals hoping to open the community broadcasting stations  and potential demand for the community broadcasting stations.  MPT plans to relax the regulation in early 1995.    In addition, measures will be taken to evenly distribute  frequencies to local communities. As part of the effort to  support multimedia, the principle of excluding concentration on  the mass media in the broadcasting sector will be eased. The  current exceptional scope for regulations on charges imposed and  services provided by telecommunications companies that do not  require approvals from MPT will be expanded.    The relaxation of "the demand and supply adjustment clause,"  that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the  Keidanren [the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan]  have strongly demanded, will be deferred until later. The  ministry and the Keidanren have strongly demanded its  relaxation, claiming that the clause is a basic regulation on  participation in and withdrawal from the telecommunications  business in Japan. As a result, the current situation, wherein  MPT approves participation in the telecommunications business  only when it concludes that the participation does not adversary  affect the management of other existing telecommunications  companies, will continue. MPT will continue to study ways to  revamp the current tender system for the use of radiowaves, and  the revamping of the system is not included in the draft package  of deregulatory measures.</p>

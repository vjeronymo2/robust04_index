			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (18): Clever ways of using 'ordinary' information technology - The annual IT Awards promote excellence in applying information technology in business HUMAN ingenuity can put straightforward office automation products and services at the forefront of information technology (IT). This is clear from the increasing numbers of office automation systems among the finalists in the Annual IT Awards competition run by the British Computer Society (BCS), the industry's professional body, to promote and highlight excellence in the application of IT. The awards celebrate their twenty-first anniversary this year and have drawn a record number of entries. They are sponsored by such leading IT companies as BT, Bull, IBM, ICL, Logica, Mercury, Tandem and Unisys, plus the Department of Trade and Industry. The 11 finalist medal winners, three of which will be selected for awards, include some eye-catching high technology projects, such as the Marlboro McLaren racing car which transmits data during a race to an analysis system in the pits. But every-day office automation systems are also there, largely due to humans' ability to spot clever ways of using ordinary technology, rather than because the technology is particularly clever in itself. Trafalgar House group's Engineering Division is among the finalist medal winners with its Global Office, an international network which handles voice, data and fax communications, electronic mail and video-conferencing. The system is claimed to be one of the biggest and sophisticated of its kind in the world. But the thinking behind the system is at least as significant as the technology, if not more so. Mr Jim Noble, the IT director, says the network enables the company's disparate units to operate as what he calls 'a single virtual company.' This means it can cope more easily with peaks and troughs and reduce project schedules. In addition, Trafalgar House has extended the network to clients, which can send their designs and ideas electronically for Trafalgar House engineers to work on: this has 'transformed our competitive advantage,' says Mr Noble. ANOTHER finalist is using even simpler technology - a standard 3.5 in. personal computer disc - to potentially change the face of electronic publishing. FRAX is a small software company in Aberdeen, formed 18 months ago and now employing seven people and eight consultants on contract. Its Smartbook package compresses 100 paces of text and 100 colour images of photographic quality into a standard disc which also includes software for cross-referencing any topic with any other. The package costs Pounds 499. If necessary, FRAX can produce copies from customers' master discs at Pounds 1.25 each, including a disc: in other words a full electronic book on disc for little more than the price of the disc alone. 'CD-Rom has been the only way of distributing such documents, but not many users have CD-Rom drives,' says managing director Mr Bob Garrioch. 'In addition, once you go to press with CD-Rom, it's like printing a book: you can't easily change it. 'Smartbook uses ordinary discs, which can be used with any PC. The text can be prepared and amended using any word processing package.' FRAX sees many office applications for Smartbook. They range from training to distributing fully-illustrated product catalogues which can easily be updated. Sony recently put out the press pack on the new album by singer Paul Young on disc, complete with photographs, interviews and other illustrated information. Another business application is the production of annual reports, with the facility for moving data from the report into a spreadsheet package for analysis or into a library of company information or any other file. The hypertext facilities mean an electronic book could hold a photograph of, say, an office complex with different areas numbered: entering a number could call up information on that area. Such entries to the BCS Awards competition are certainly welcomed by the society - 'the ingenuity in the way IT is used is just amazing,' says Mr Arrick Wilkinson, chairman of the preliminary judging panel for the last eight years. 'In addition, the range and quality - and the way the systems are developed these days, using formal methods and project management disciplines - are all constantly improving.' But why do companies enter for the BCS Awards? The competition is demanding: two judges spend at least half a day with each entrant. The only prize is a trophy or a medal. However, recent finalists say awards are especially important for office automation projects because they help beat the common problem of getting end-users to actually use the system. IT is relatively easy to implement systems - 'the hard part is winning over the users,' says Jim Noble at Trafalgar House. 'Telling them they've got a good system, doesn't work: what really makes the difference is when they see an award and read reports of our success.' Bridie Collier, IT co-ordinator at the Patent Office, sees the BCS Awards as important for systems staff, too. The Patent Office won an award in 1990 with services group Computer Sciences for a Pounds 13.7m project which put 30m records of patents and trade marks online to staff. 'People rarely give you good news: it's usually bad news or requests for enhancements,' she says. 'So although we felt we had a good system, we were never self-congratulatory about it, because the users were always saying, 'Why doesn't it do such-and-such?' 'This meant we didn't think we had a chance. Winning was a great surprise - and made us feel we were right to be pleased with the system.' This reaction is common to many winners. 'This was a recognition of what the whole department was capable of - not just the people who happened to be in that particular project team at that time,' says Mr Mark Nonour, a systems manager at British Airways. The company won a BCS Award in 1991 with a system which works out the most profitable ways of filling flights with passengers. Winning a BCS Award might be icing on the cake to some, but to those trying to 'sell' their systems to their end-users, it can clearly be a key to success. THE WINNING TRIO This year's three BCS Award winners will be announced at London's Waldorf Hotel on November 15 by Mr William Waldegrave, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. All the finalist projects will be on display throughout the afternoon. Free tickets are available from Anna Duckworth at the BCS on (0793) 480 269.</p>

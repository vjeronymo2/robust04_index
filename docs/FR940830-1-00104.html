			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General Assistance (GA) Vendor Payments_7 CFR 273.9(c)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(b)(2)(i) require State agencies to count payments from GA programs (as defined in 7 CFR 271.2) as unearned income even if provided in the form of a third-party payment, unless the vendor payment is specifically exempt under 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13915 of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act (the 1993 Leland Act), Chapter 3, Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 674, enacted August 10, 1993), amended section 5(k)(1)(B) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (the Act), 7 U.S.C. 2014(k)(1)(B), to change the treatment of GA vendor payments. As amended, section 5(k)(1)(B) provides that GA provided to a third party on behalf of a household by a State or local government shall be considered money payable directly to the household if the assistance is provided in lieu of a benefit payable to the household for housing expenses (exclusive of energy or utility-cost assistance) under a State or local general assistance program or another basic assistance program comparable to GA (as determined by the Secretary). Previously, assistance provided for living expenses was included as income, with specified exceptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> House Report 103&hyph;111, p. 30 (May 25, 1993) indicates that administration of the current provision requiring that GA assistance provided for living expenses be counted as income is complex. It also states that a recipient's need for food stamp assistance is not materially affected by many of the vendor payments, such as a voucher for gasoline to get to a job interview or a one-time payment to a utility company to prevent a shutoff of service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the House Report indicates that Congress wanted to reduce the number of GA vendor payments counted as income in States that provide some GA in cash. Under section 1722 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, (Pub. L. 101&hyph;624), GA vendor payments are excluded from income pursuant to section 5(k)(1)(H) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 2014(k)(1)(H), in States in which, by State law, no cash assistance is provided. Section 13915 of the 1993 Leland Act would reduce the differences in treatment of GA payments from one State to another.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1993 Leland Act did not remove the provision of section 5(k)(2) that the requirement to count public assistance (PA) or GA payments shall not apply to certain energy assistance, assistance provided by a State or local housing authority, emergency assistance for migrant or seasonal farmworker households during the period such households are in the job stream, housing assistance payments made to a third party on behalf of a household residing in transitional housing for the homeless, or special or emergency assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Bank loans boosted as credit growth remains subdued Bank lending grew at a faster rate than expected in September, but the overall growth of UK credit is still quite subdued. Figures released by the Bank of England yesterday show that M4, the government's measure of broad money supply, grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent between August and September. Over the 12 months to September, it has risen by 4.8 per cent, well towards the lower end of the government's 3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range. Within the M4 total, sterling lending to the private sector - excluding banks and building societies - rose by Pounds 3bn in September, the highest monthly figure since December 1993. The Bank of England figures appear to contradict statistics from the British Bankers Association which show a rise in lending of only Pounds 183 in September, down from Pounds 1.5bn in August. However, the association's figures exclude building society lending and only cover the main British banking groups. It appears that a wider spread between base rates and money market rates in September caused borrowers to switch from major banks to smaller banks in order to reduce their borrowing costs. Even with the Pounds 3bn jump in September, the trend in growth of bank lending remains very weak. Lending to the M4 private sector rose by 3.7 per cent in the year to September. Total M4 growth has been stronger than that for bank lending because of 'underfunding' by the government, which occurs when the Bank of England does not sell enough gilts to cover the public sector borrowing requirement. Association figures show that the corporate sector is continuing to repay bank borrowing. There was a particularly high repayment of Pounds 719m by the financial sector. The one exception was the manufacturing sector, which borrowed a net Pounds 28m, having repaid Pounds 167m in August. The personal sector continues to borrow, however, with lending for house purchases rising by Pounds 659m and that for credit cards by Pounds 83m. Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International Europe, said that consumer credit growth was quite strong while corporations were merely replacing bank debt with funding from sources such as bonds and equities. While broad money growth has been slow, narrow money growth (mainly notes and coins) has been strong. The Bank of England yesterday revised up the annual growth rate of M0 in September from 7.1 per cent to 7.2 per cent. The government's monitoring range is 0 per cent to 4 per cent.</p>

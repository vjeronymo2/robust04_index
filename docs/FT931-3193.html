			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: CBI attacks job relocations limit THE CHANCELLOR'S proposal to limit tax relief from job relocation packages offered by employers to their employees was unexpected and drew criticism from the Confederation of British Industry. The CBI said the changes would 'add considerably to employers' costs and seriously affect an employees' willingness to relocate'. Tax relief for removal expenses and additional housing costs has existed for more than 40 years in Britain. The Inland Revenue said yesterday the yield from the changes would be nil in 1993-1994 but provide Pounds 200m to the Treasury in 1994-1995, with a Pounds 250m annual yield in the longer term. Under the chancellor's changes tax relief for removal expenses and benefits will be limited to Pounds 8,000 per move with relief available whether or not employees sell their old property. Tax relief for additional housing cost payments for moving into a more expensive housing area will be withdrawn. The proposed changes will apply to employees who begin a new job or move with their existing employer on or after April 6 this year - transitional arrangements will be available for employees already committed to moving. The Inland Revenue said the chancellor's aim was to put tax relief for removal expenses and benefits on to a statutory basis so that employers could be given 'clarity and certainty about the scope of the relief'. Relief is available only where it would be unreasonable to expect the employee to work at the new location without moving nearer to it and provided the employee disposes of his or her old home. The Inland Revenue has also up until now allowed tax exemption for certain payments made by employers to their employees for additional housing costs, such as increased mortgage interest. This relief is only available for a limited time and up to a maximum of Pounds 13,440. It will be withdrawn from April 6 this year. The Inland Revenue estimates that at present around 175,000 employees may benefit from tax-free removal expenses. About 30,000 might also be enjoying certain tax exemption from additional housing costs. It calculates around 100,000 employees will be liable to extra tax as a result of the chancellor's changes, possibly increasing to 150,000 in the 1994-1995 financial year.</p>

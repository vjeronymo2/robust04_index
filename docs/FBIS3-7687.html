			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- Pyongyangites held a  rally today bitterly denouncing the plan of the U.S.  imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam group to deploy Patriot  missiles in South Korea.    Paek Hak-yon, permanent vice-chairman of the Pyongyang  Municipal People's Committee, and other speakers branded the  planned deployment of Patriot missiles as a blatant challenge to  the nation's desire for peace and denuclearisation of the Korean  peninsula and an unpardonable act to exterminate the nation  through a nuclear war by deliberately increasing the tension.    They declared they would not pardon the brigands who  reversed  the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and steps of simultaneous action  agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and are  threatening the DPRK with "sanctions."    The Korean people are not frightened by any missile and the  Team Spirit nuclear war game, they said, warning that the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique must refrain  from reckless war moves and other rash acts.    The speakers declared that the Korean people and the  People's  Army closely united around General Kim Chong-il, their supreme  commander, will smash the aggressors at one blow if they dare  provoke socialist Korea.</p>

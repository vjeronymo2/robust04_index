			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: ANA takes stake in seat booking group ABACUS, south-east Asia's largest airline computer reservation system, yesterday extended its presence in the Asia-Pacific region by taking All Nippon Airlines (ANA), Japan's second largest carrier, as a partner. The move is the latest international tie-up in the fast-growing business of computerised ticket distribution. It comes less than two weeks after the Dollars 1.5bn transatlantic merger of the Galileo and Apollo computer reservation systems in Europe and the US respectively. The deal also strikes a blow in ANA's battle with Japan Airlines (JAL), its rival. ANA is stronger in the Japanese domestic market, but earns only 13 per cent of its sales from international passenger traffic. More than half JAL's sales are to international passengers, and JAL has its own computer reservation system. ANA is paying Dollars 18.2m for a 13.48 per cent stake in Singapore-based Abacus Distribution Systems. The two companies had already linked their reservation computers, but now ANA gains a holding equal to those of Cathy Pacific Airways, China Airlines of Taiwan, Malaysian Airline Systems, Royal Brunei Airlines and Singapore Airlines. Abacus also has a 5 per cent cross-holding with Worldspan, the third biggest US computer reservation system. Worldspan is owned by Delta Airlines, Northwest Airlines, and Trans World Airlines, all of the US. ANA said yesterday: 'We have a close relationship with Worldspan and we wanted a closer relationship with Abacus.' It said the recession had increased Abacus' need for a capital injection. Japan Air Lines will cut all executive salaries by between 5 and 15 per cent for an unspecified period from April, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The move follows poor results in the year to March. In February, JAL forecast a parent company pre-tax loss of Y8bn (Dollars 61.5m) for 1991-92, against profits of Y24.85bn.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: MCI wins Dollars 80m JP Morgan deal MCI Communications, the second-largest US long-distance telecommunications group, has beaten AT&amp;T, of the US, and BT, of the UK, to win an Dollars 80m five-year contract to operate one of the global communications networks of JP Morgan, the New York banking group. The deal with one of the world's most blue-chip banking groups is a significant coup for MCI, which, like other leading telecommunications groups, is keen to build a presence in the expanding global 'outsourcing' market - the trend for multinational companies to contract their global communications needs to an industry expert. MCI will team up with Infonet Services, which is jointly owned by some of the world's leading telecommunications companies. MCI will provide integrated voice and data network services to more than 20 Morgan centres in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America. The deal is a blow to BT's fledgling Syncordia unit, based in Atlanta, Georgia, which was set up to capitalise on multinational outsourcing, but has found it hard to gather rapid momentum. Both BT and AT&amp;T, the leading US long-distance company, were awarded contracts with JP Morgan last year covering other aspects of global communications, but these were far smaller than the MCI contract.</p>

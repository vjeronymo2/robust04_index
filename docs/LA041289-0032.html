			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> 3 PREMIERES IN UMBRELLA SERIES  </P> <P> The diversity of California was the made-to-order theme of the latest Green  Umbrella program Monday night at Japan America Theatre. David Alan Miller  conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group in premieres by three  very different composers, all with at least a remote connection to the Golden  State.  </P> <P> The West Coast premiere of David Lang's "Are You Experienced?" (1987) for  narrator, amplified tuba and chamber orchestra with synthesizer and electric  guitar proved the most ambitious undertaking. Titled after the first album of  rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix, these six movements -- four with texts -- confuse  and disorient both intentionally and unintentionally.  </P> <P> The listener anticipates references to Hendrix's music, but none occur -- save  a short humorous episode where the amplified tuba is used to manipulate  feedback from an amplifier. The text proceeds with a deadpan monologue about  being on the verge of unconsciousness after a blow to the head.  </P> <P> Lang read his texts mixing the monotone narrative styles of William Burroughs  and Laurie Anderson, but humor and shock value faded quickly, as did interest.  Meanwhile, an otherwise inventive style of composition with single-note  repetitions and carefully structured rhythms relentlessly pulsated and at times  loudly banged.  </P> <P> With the exception of a wild electronic solo in the "Dance" movement, Jay  Rozen's tuba-playing went largely unnoticed. Conductor Miller's apt attention  to the score yielded an accurate, polished reading.  </P> <P> Another West Coast premiere, Steven Stucky's modest "Sappho Fragments" (1982)  -- a setting of five short text fragments attributed to Sappho for soprano and  small chamber ensemble -- proceeded with conservative, carefully wrought  instrumental materials. Here, Stucky used additive processes common to the  Minimalist school in a way consistent with his own mainstream, atonal style.  </P> <P> Soprano Jennifer Trost convincingly conveyed the demanding vocal part, singing  in both the original Greek and an English translation. Again, Miller led his  forces admirably.  </P> <P> The U.S. premiere of Finlander Kaija Saariaho's "Lichtbogen"(1985-86) for  flute, electronics and chamber ensemble, demonstrated an intelligent use of  microtonal passages and sonorities in a Ligeti-inspired sonic portrayal of an  arctic landscape.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Walid 'Asfur, minister of energy and mineral  resources, has said the tenders for the power-linkage project  between Jordan and Egypt -- a first stage in a comprehensive  power grid linking Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Turkey --  will be submitted before the end of this year. The project is  expected to be finished by 1997.    In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency, 'Asfur said the  ministers of energy and electricity and the heads of delegations  of the five-way power-linkage states stressed, at the conclusion  of their meetings in Cairo recently, the need for power linkage  between Jordan and Egypt as a basic, first stage in the  comprehensive linkage between the five states.    He noted that it was agreed to give priority in financing  the  project to the implementation of the first stage. The Arab Fund  for Economic and Social Development will finance the two parts  of the Jordanian-Egyptian linkage; the two parts of the  Jordanian-Syrian linkage; and the Syrian part of the  Syrian-Turkish linkage.    'Asfur said the next ministerial meeting of the five-way  power-linkage states will be held in Turkey in April next year.</p>

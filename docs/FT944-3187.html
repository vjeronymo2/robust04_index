			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: BHP and Dia-Met to expand diamond mine Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, and its Canadian partner, Dia-Met Minerals said yesterday that they were expanding the scope of their proposed diamond mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, writes Nikki Tait. The companies said that an updated project development plan, submitted to the Canadian government, had been enlarged to five diamondiferous kimberlite pipes, instead of the three previously suggested. With the inclusion of the two extra pipes, the potential project life could be extended from 20 years to 25 years. If project approvals are granted next year, the first production could occur in 1997. BHP said that initial production would be at 9,000 tonnes of kimberlite per day, rising to 18,000 tonnes per day by the 10th year of production.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Management: Data Protection dodgers face fines - In a Nutshell Companies that have failed to register under the 1984 Data Protection Act risk fines of at least Pounds 5,000. While 182,000 organisations have registered, some 150,000 computer users have yet to do so, according to the national audit office. Under the act, any organisation that keeps details about living people on computer - even just names and addresses - must register their use of the information. The Data Protection Register is to launch a campaign to encourage compliance. Failure to register is a criminal offence and can lead to fines of Pounds 5,000 in the lower courts and unlimited fines in higher courts. Registrar's Information Service. Tel 0625 535777.</p>

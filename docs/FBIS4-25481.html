			<p>BFN     [Text] At the provincial forum on management of  transactions of state assets ownership held on Zoucheng on 9  June, Chen Jianguo, standing committee member of the provincial  party committee and vice governor of the province, stressed: We  should actually strengthen management of transactions of state  assets ownership, make a conscientious analysis of new  circumstances and new problems, research and formulate measures  and methods for ensuring the sound development of transactions  of state assets ownership and for avoiding the loss of  state-owned assets, and promote the establishment of a modern  enterprise system.    Chen Jianguo pointed out: The transaction of property rights  of enterprises is the outcome of the market economy, an  effective way to achieve optimum distribution and rational flow  of assets under the condition of the market economy, and a means  adopted by the government to readjust industrial structure.  Over the past few years, quite a few localities in the province  have conducted useful explorations and experiments for  transactions of property rights of enterprises and have helped  separate government administration from enterprise management  and change the operation mechanism of enterprises through the  methods of absorbing more owners of shares and selling and  leasing enterprises to others. As a result, the vitality of  enterprises has been enhanced and some new experiences have been  created. Some new circumstances and new problems have also  emerged, however. In particular, the loss of state-owned assets  has been extremely serious in a few localities and enterprises.    Chen Jianguo stressed: The transaction of property rights is  a work deeply related to policies and professions. In this  regard, we should not only be positive but also appropriate. In  guiding the specific work, we should successfully grasp the  following several points:    First, the transactions of property right should  persistently  follow the direction of socialism. Second, the transactions of  property right should aim at safeguarding the property and  interests of the state. Third, the transactions of property  rights should be combined with the optimization of industrial  structure and the optimization of the distribution of resources.  Fourth, the transactions of property rights should give full  consideration to the placement of enterprise workers and staff  and to social stability.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / BR to contest door compensation claims BRITISH RAIL yesterday said it would contest legal action over the safety of doors on some InterCity trains following a series of accidents in which passengers died falling from carriages. InterCity, the high-speed division of BR, is facing the first compensation claims relating to the doors since a Health and Safety Executive report in May criticised the locks on older rolling stock. The HSE called for modifications to the doors following 165 deaths between 1981 and 1990. Solicitors acting for the families of two men who died in separate accidents on the west coast main line and another passenger who suffered post-traumatic stress said yesterday they would be seeking Pounds 100,000 total compensation. InterCity denied liability for the accidents, but said it would fit modified locks to almost 2,000 slam-door carriages at a cost of Pounds 17m. Mr Douglas Fraser, acting for solicitors Silvermore Livermore in Liverpool, said he hoped BR would settle. 'If not, we will take them right through the courts.'</p>

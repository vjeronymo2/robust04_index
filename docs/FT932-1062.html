			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: British Coal seeks buyers for more pits BRITISH Coal yesterday offered a further five pits it no longer wants to mine to the private sector and said it was receiving 30 inquiries a week for all mines which have so far been advertised. Yesterday's additions were Vane Tempest, Seaham and Westoe in the north-east of England, Grimethorpe and the linked Houghton Main in Yorkshire and Trentham in Staffordshire. Potential licensees must register their interest by July 16. British Coal has now advertised 14 of the 20 pits it intends to offer to private operators because it no longer sees a market for them under its control. Mr Eddy Hindmarsh, the corporations' head of operations, said it was too early to say how many full tender submissions would result. But there was no operational reason why some of the mines currently being preserved on a care and maintenance basis should not be back in production in the autumn. British Coal has already started to close some of the 12 pits it reprieved in March. Labour is expected to try and rekindle public interest in the issue by focusing on coal when it next has the opportunity to select the subject of a House of Commons debate early next month. The move follows a scathing attack on the government's coal white paper by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, who this week described the document as a 'fraud' intended not to save the jobs of miners but of 'ministers in the House.'</p>

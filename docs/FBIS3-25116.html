Mr. de Beer was reacting to a call  by the president of the Azanian People's Organization [Azapo],  Professor Itumeleng Mosala, for the removal of white teachers  from black towns. Mr. de Beer said that white teachers are  appointed to black schools only when suitably qualified black  educators could not be recruited. He said that in the light of  the distressing matriculation results, Prof. Mosala's statements  could further jeopardize efforts to normalize schooling.</p>

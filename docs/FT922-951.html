			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Letter: US public servants do not chase fat cats Sir, We learn from David Goodhart and Michael Smith ('Playing catch-up with the private sector fat cats', June 23) that Britain's public servants deserve far more money if they are to stay in the same league as their colleagues in the private sector. I had assumed that the words 'public service' and 'job security' meant something - can one imagine a judge getting the sack for incompetence? So one has to look abroad to see if noble traditions survive. They do - in the US, a supreme court judge gets Pounds 86,344 a year at current exchange rates. General Colin Powell, with allowances, gets Pounds 57,211. James Morgan, 20 Rectory Road, London SW13 0DT</p>

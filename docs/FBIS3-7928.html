			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Miroslav Lazanski: "The Secret of Departing </F> Airport"]    [Text] The place from which the four aircraft that were  downed by U.S. F-16 fighters had taken off as well as the  nationality of these downed aircraft are actually the biggest  dilemmas of the air duel in the sky of the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The question to whom belonged the aircraft  that NATO circles initially identified as Super-Galebs, that is  to say, G-4's, and subsequently informed that they were actually  Jastrebs, that is to say, J-1 aircraft, is the key element of  the entire story.    According to some information from NATO, the downed aircraft  allegedly bore old Yugoslav markings, which is peculiar bearing  in mind that aircraft on the entire territory of the former  Yugoslavia no longer carry such markings. One thing is  perfectly obvious, namely, that the downed aircraft definitely  did not take off for Bosnia from the FRY territories, and there  are no uncertainties about this.    The air force of the Serbian Republic possesses 42 Orao  aircraft and only one G-4 Super-Galeb, according to present  information. Because UN observers who register each take-off are  deployed at the Banja Luka airport, there is also a question of  whether the aircraft could have taken off from this airport at  all. True enough, G-4 can take off from grass runways, that is  to say, from provisional war airports, but the UN observers are  probably also supervising the localities where the aircraft of  the Serbian Republic are stationed.  <H5>  Clash of "a Yugo car" and a Train </H5>   Did the two or four U.S. F-16 Fighting Falcons in the air  meet with a group of six G-4's or six Jastrebs that were  returning from a bombing raid on the artillery arms factory in  Novi Travnik and a factory near Bugojno, which is in Muslim  hands, and by firing altogether six air-to-air (Sidewinder) and  (AMRAAM) missiles at them down four aircraft on that occasion?  There are several versions about what happened in the sky above  former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    According to NATO sources, the U.S. fighters asked the  unknown aircraft to land but, allegedly, there was no reply and  for this reason the F-16's fired air-to-air missiles. Four  aircraft were hit and downed, while two aircraft in a low fight  quickly disappeared from the scene of the clash in the direction  of the Adriatic Sea.    According to some other sources, one aircraft each fell in  the vicinity of Kljuc, Sipovo, and Petrovac, and three pilots  allegedly died while one saved himself by ejecting. According  to the same source, one U.S. F-16 was shot down with a missile  from the ground, even though NATO has not confirmed this.    Did the G-4's or perhaps Jastrebs stand any chance at all in  the air duel with the U.S. F-16? The reply is negative, as  these are two entirely different categories of aircraft. The  U.S. aircraft are faster, more mobile in the air, have better  electronics, are better armed, and on top of all this are  receiving help from AWACS so that the pilots in G-4's or  Jastrebs stood absolutely no chance in such an unequal duel.  This was actually a meeting resembling a crash between "a Yugo  car" and a train.  <H5>  Libyan Jastrebs </H5>   Is there a possibility that these were aircraft of the  Republic of Croatia? Croatia does not own G-4 aircraft nor  Jastrebs, unless somebody has sold them to it in the meantime.  Some Arab countries (Libya) namely possess Galeb and Jastreb  aircraft, and the possibility of such a transfer is, therefore,  not completely out of the question, as the arms channels are  very twisted indeed.    Croatian pilots are trained on Galeb and Jastreb aircraft  and  the NATO information that two from the group of six aircraft  flew toward the Adriatic coast is very indicative. NATO should  have released information obtained from AWACS as to where these  aircraft landed.    It is possible that these were aircraft from the fleet of  the  republic of Serbian Krajina which has several aircraft of this  type at Udbina airport. In any case, a group of six aircraft  simultaneously in the air suggests an action of a more important  nature, and the assumptions about the bombing of factories in  Novi Travnik and near Bugojno have some substance. However, the  Croats currently have more motives for attacking these factories  than the Bosnian Serbs do.</p>

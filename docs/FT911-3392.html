			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / World Bank approves Dollars 120m telecom loan for Poland THE World Bank has approved a Dollars 120m loan aimed at improving Poland's inefficient telecommunications system. The loan will help finance the installation of a new digital system including new switches, fibre optic cables and the construction of a satellite ground station to improve international links. The World Bank is also considering a Dollars 300m loan to aid privatisation and industrial restructuring, as well as another Dollars 300m loan for heat supply and conservation projects. A further Dollars 500m of loans devoted to developing financial institutions, employment promotion, agriculture and health services are also being considered. The telecommunications project is primarily aimed at providing an improvement for 70,000 new business subscribers and will be part of Poland's telephone modernisation programme which is set to cost Dollars 1.5bn over the next ten years. Next week PPTT,the country's telecommunications authority, is to announce a shortlist of western companies which are bidding to supply a separate cellular telephone network costing Dollars 150m, which should provide 100,000 lines over five years. The World Bank loan, to be repaid over 17 years, is to be accompanied by an Ecu70m (Pounds 48m) loan from the European Investment Bank. The project includes the installation of 12 digital switches and should improve communications between 17 towns as well as calls abroad. Poland's Finance Ministry has decided to suspend sales of bonds which gave holders a 20 per cent discount when used to buy shares in privatised companies. The issue was to have run till 1994. The decision, which will be implemented early next month, comes after a parliamentary declaration in February criticised the scheme for overly favouring investors. The bonds, with an interest rate index-linked to the monthly inflation rate, have been on sale since December 1989. Zl 196.7bn of the bonds had been sold by the end of February.</p>

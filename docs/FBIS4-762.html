			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M Merten] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Thursday [14 April] said  armed insurrection in kwaZulu/Natal was not a possibility, even  if people expected it to happen. Speaking at a press briefing  in Johannesburg, Mr Buthelezi said it would be sad if South  Africa moved in that direction.    Asked what he would do now that mediation had failed to  settle constitutional differences, Mr Buthelezi said he would  have to discuss the matter with the IFP Central Committee. Mr  Buthelezi said he was disappointed that mediation had failed,  but added the African National Congress and government had never  favoured it.    He said the ANC and government had wasted an opportunity by  which the IFP could have returned to the electoral process and  the elections. Claims that the IFP had spoilt the mediation  effort were nonsense, he said. The election date may have come  up in discussions at some stage, but Mr Buthelezi denied the IFP  used the issue as a hidden agenda.    Mr Buthelezi did not want to commit himself to taking part  in  another planned leaders' summit, but said negotiations could  continue because he would leave no stone unturned to find a  solution.    Reacting to a question on whether Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini would accept a new package offered to him by  government, he said "if people think they can buy him (the king)  with packages, they do not understand him". The king was only  concerned about his people and his land, not himself, he said.    Mr Buthelezi predicted violence would increase in the  province in spite of troops being deployed there. Only Zulus  were killed in taxis or while protesting, he said. "The  catastrophe is here."    But elections in kwaZulu would be held because he did not  have the option to stop them. It was a democratic right for all  South Africans to choose whether to vote or not, he said.    Regarding the provision of polling stations, he said the  kwaZulu government had offered the Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] use of its buildings. Mr Buthelezi said he had  even offered IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler "to put a  word in" so the commission could use buildings which fell under  the control of tribal chiefs.    The process of mediation, which was to have been led by  former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and  British Politician Lord Peter Carrington, came to a halt on the  question of whether the election date should be included in the  terms of reference. Both Mr Kissinger and Lord Carrington  agreed to mediate on a draft version of the terms which had not  mentioned the date. A later draft, revised when government  joined the mediation, specifically excluded the election date.    Mr Buthelezi said he had received a message from Lord  Carrington through the British Embassy that Lord Carrington  wanted the terms of reference consolidated. Mr Buthelezi said  he still did not know the status of this document which was sent  to him and others on Tuesday night.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Text] Major General Ilan Biran, commander of the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] Central Command, has ordered suspension  of the activity of the squads operating against stone throwers  in the West Bank. These squads were set up during the tenure of  Major General Nehemya Tamari in order to apprehend stone  throwers, including opening fire when necessary. The squads  operated for several months, until the military advocate-general  sent a letter instructing clarification of the orders relating  to their operation.    The activity of the squads was resumed when Major General  Dani Yatom was appointed temporary commander of the Central  Command, and was occasionally halted on the basis of operational  considerations. Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, commander of the IDF  forces in the West Bank, renewed the activity of the squads  several months ago. Maj. Gen. Biran ordered to suspend their  operation several days after he entered office.    Central Command sources said Maj. Gen. Biran implemented  this  move in order to avoid unnecessary firing. They said Biran is  checking all the standing orders relating to the Central  Command, mainly open-fire orders, issued during the tenures of  Yatom and Tamari.    An army source said "Biran is examining every order given in  the Central Command and canceling those he does not approve of."  If necessary, Biran will issue out new instructions.    The military sources add that Maj. Gen. Biran has held  meetings with the Central Command's senior officers, including  the division and brigade commanders, and visited the sensitive  areas of the West Bank in order to get personally acquainted  with the various spheres relating to his new post.</p>

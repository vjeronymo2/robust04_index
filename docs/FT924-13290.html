			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: European Leisure falls Pounds 45.6m into the red EUROPEAN LEISURE, the troubled disco and snooker hall operator which is struggling to reorganise despite a mountain of debt, yesterday reported a Pounds 45.6m full-year pre-tax loss after exceptional items. The exceptional charges in the year to June 30 totalled Pounds 47.5m (Pounds 880,000) including Pounds 36.9m in provisions for losses expected on disposals and Pounds 10.6m in goodwill transfers from reserves, and were Pounds 610,000 higher than the charges announced at the time of the interim results. The full year pre-tax loss compares with a Pounds 5.23m profit and came on turnover down 11.3 per cent to Pounds 75.1m (Pounds 84.8m) reflecting the impact of the recession in the UK and continental Europe. While reduced consumer spending has affected the leisure market as a whole, high unemployment among young people has particularly hit European Leisure's customer base. This, coupled with intense competition, affected profitability, although the group's snooker operations proved more resilient and its Maygay Machines business, which designs and manufactures fruit machines, reported a substantial increase in turnover and operating profits. Overall trading profits fell by almost 27 per cent to Pounds 9.58m (Pounds 13.1m), but were helped by Pounds 2m of overhead savings and tighter management controls. Net interest payments rose to Pounds 7.7m (Pounds 6.96m). Losses per share were 29.04p (earnings of 2.52p). As already announced there was a Pounds 8.81m (Pounds 7.35m) extraordinary charge relating to the disposal of the group's two floating nightclubs on the Tyne. Mr Ian Rock, chief executive, said the group's substantial disposal programme, which involves selling 30 out of 111 units including all of its loss-making businesses in France and Spain, was making progress. With shareholders' funds reduced to Pounds 33.8m (Pounds 76.2m) the group's gearing has increased from 94 per cent to 227 per cent. The group remains under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office concerning its acquisition of Midsummer Leisure in 1990. COMMENT European Leisure ran into trouble soon after its acrimonious takeover of Midsummer Leisure. Since then the new management team has written down assets to more realistic levels and identified a fifth of its retail estate, including the loss-making continental businesses, for disposal. However, the recession has hit the group's core young customer group hard. This means that trading profits only just cover the costs of servicing the group's debt. Although the full-year result held no new nasty surprises, the management faces a long uphill struggle to sell businesses and reduce debt - a difficult task in the current climate. Until the balance sheet is considerably strengthened there will be no shareholder dividends. In the meantime the share price is bumping along the bottom at 3p. For those unlucky enough to own the stock, it is probably not worth selling.</p>

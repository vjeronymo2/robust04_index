			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Tuesday [24 May] expressed confidence in the outcome of  bilateral "framework" trade talks after Japan and the United  States agreed to their resumption, saying he believes the two  countries will reach an accord.    "Not only Japan, but the whole world is watching. I am  absolutely confident we will find a way," Hata told reporters at  his official residence.    He also expressed optimism that the trade imbalance between  the two countries will be rectified.    "Japan is determined to open its markets, and the U.S. is  just as determined to sell here. I think all this is going to  be interesting," he said.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai showed confidence  that Japan and the U.S. will come to an agreement before the  meeting of heads of the two countries planned for July in Naples.    "There is no way we will fail with the conditions ready, as  they are," he said, referring to the talks on "priority" issues  -- Japanese Government procurement of medical and  telecommunications equipment, autos and auto parts, and  insurance business.    Noting that Japan's trade surplus is a major reason for  resumption of the negotiations, Kumagai said, "We will make a  big mistake if we lose sight of that fact," and pointed to the  need for Japan to ease regulations to liberalize its market.</p>

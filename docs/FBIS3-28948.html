Choe Myong-hak, 34, and  Kim Tae-pom, 32, arrived at Kimpo Airport carrying Russian  passports, the NSP said. Kim was born in Songchon, South  Pyongan Province, and Choe is from Najin, North Hamkyong  Province. Both of the men left behind families in North Korea.    In 1989, they were dispatched to a lumber factory near  Khabarovsk, Russia, where they worked as drivers. They left the  factory last July and gained Russian passports using the names  of ethnic Koreans there. Sunday's incident marks the first time  that North Koreans have entered South Korea by plane and  defected.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Monday Interview: Premier Democrat on Wall St - Robert Rubin, co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, speaks to Martin Dickson The name Robert Rubin has suddenly become one to bandy about on the Washington dinner party circuit. Bob Rubin is co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, one of America's leading investment banks, and he is that rare (though not unique) phenomenon on overwhelmingly Republican Wall Street - an industry leader who is also a lifelong supporter of the Democratic party. His new-found celebrity beyond the canyons of lower Manhattan stems from the significant behind-the-scenes role he is playing in the election campaign of Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. It was Mr Rubin, a New Yorker born and bred, who chaired a city committee which persuaded the (initially reluctant) Democratic party to stage its national convention in the Big Apple. The same committee then worked to insure that last month's convention took place in a suitably upbeat civic atmosphere. Given New York's volatile nature, it could have been a disaster. In the event, it was a triumphant affirmation of the power of planning, positive thinking and good luck. Mr Rubin has a continuing role in the Clinton campaign. He is one of a handful of academics and financiers advising Mr Clinton's staff on economic policy issues and preparing the nominee for the autumn's important face-to-face debates with President George Bush. All this means that Mr Rubin, who pinned his colours to the Clinton mast long before the presidential primaries began, is being quietly tipped as a leading contender for Treasury secretary if the Democrats win in November. He dismisses such tattle as 'media discussion which is probably irrelevant to what ultimately happens'. But even in his present capacity he would have some influence on the financial policies of a Democratic administration. Mr Rubin is 53, but looks much younger - a neat fit with the youthful Clinton-Gore image. He has a manner both more cerebral and informal than often found on Wall Street. Lean, quietly spoken and with a rather sad-eyed look, he inhabits a modest office notable mainly for its untidy clutter of papers. When Mr Rubin was recently in hospital having a back operation, his wife Judith, an adviser to New York Mayor David Dinkins on protocol matters, took charge of his office and cleaned it up. Mr Rubin jokes that he was 'not exactly wild' about the change. So why is he a Democrat? He cites two main factors, one of the heart and one of the head. The first is his family background. His father was a successful and socially concerned New York lawyer, while a grandfather was a Democratic leader in the city's Brooklyn borough, back in the days when local politicians wielded immense powers of patronage. 'When I was a kid,' he recalls, 'my mother used to tell me these stories about him - how the mayor would come over and they would all meet in the basement and decide who the judges were.' The second factor is his set of political beliefs. He describes himself as 'very pragmatic' on most economic policy issues, while on social affairs he tends to be a centrist. 'But I'm a lot more comfortable trying to work out a compromise position between there and people who are more liberal than I am than between there and people who are more conservative.' But how does he square the fact that Wall Street lives and breathes by the interplay of free and transparent markets, while the Democrats have traditionally been seen as the party of intervention and regulation? Mr Rubin is not sure he would accept this description of the Democrats, maintaining that President Jimmy Carter initiated airline deregulation and talked of 'sunsetting' all regulations, though he did not act on this. Wall Street's self-interest, he adds, lies in having policies which will lay the foundations for long-term US economic success. This is what he sees as the central electoral issue in a country which 'has been very self-confident for a long time, but is now a country with a lot of doubt and anxiety'. 'All the polls show there is a broad-based perception among the American people that this country has serious, long-term structural issues which, if not faced, are going to result in our continuing to have unsatisfactory economic performance. I think the campaign is about who is going to best recognise and address those issues.' Naturally, he thinks Mr Clinton is that person. But how does Mr Rubin respond to the widespread belief on Wall Street that the numbers do not add up in the centrepiece of the Democrats' economic plans - a huge investment in the nation's human and infrastructural capital while gradually reducing the federal budget deficit. Sceptics say the investments cannot be achieved without increasing the deficit, or raising taxes on the middle class, or both. He acknowledges that people can argue with the numbers, but adds that 'as long as you have a trend down (in the deficit) and you're also engaged in a lot of other constructive programmes, I think you're going to be doing a lot that's very good for the economy.' This guardedly bland response contrasts with the sudden, and unexpected, passion with which he addresses what he thinks is 'absolutely one of the most critical domestic issues' facing America - how to 'break the cycle of poverty and disaffection' in the nation's urban ghettoes. It is, he says, 'an issue a lot of people just don't want to face'. His response may seem a little surprising. Compassion for society's underdogs would not seem to be a big Wall Street pre-occupation. That said, a number of Wall Street firms run programmes which encourage employees to act as mentors for the urban poor, providing help and advice to young people, and Goldman is prominent in the movement. Mr Rubin says that, apart from the obvious benefits of the scheme, 'it also gives our people a sense of life beyond Wall Street, which I think is a very, very healthy thing'. By any measure Goldman has for years been one of Wall Street's most successful investment banks. So what makes Goldman tick? He thought that the most important factor was a strong corporate culture which laid a heavy emphasis on teamwork and eschewed personal aggrandisement. He says this matter-of-factly, without boy-scoutish airs, and many analysts say it reflects a truth about the firm, the last big Wall Street house to remain a private partnership. Goldman's teamwork even extends to its unique practice of having two chairmen for the group. Mr Rubin shares the job with Mr Stephen Friedman (a Republican, incidentally) and says it is an 'extraordinary source of strength. If a co-chairmanship works, one plus one equals far more than two.' It works in Goldman's case, he explains, because the two men have both been with the partnership for about 25 years and share similar views on policy matters. 'Neither of us,' he adds, 'has an ego structure that is invested in the notion of being a chief executive officer.' There are a fair number on Wall Street, jealous of Goldman's success, who would enjoy seeing it fall on its face. These are the people who quietly delighted last year in its embarrassment over its share trading connections with the late Mr Robert Maxwell - a subject Mr Rubin declines to address for legal reasons. Linked to these feelings is the widespread belief that most large securities houses with a long run of success are likely to succumb eventually to the sin of hubris - the pride that comes before a tragic fall. Salomon Brothers, enmeshed last year in a bond trading scandal, is just the latest example. So how does Goldman guard against such tendencies? Mr Rubin quotes his co-chairman, Mr Friedman, who once remarked that 'ego was the seminal sin of the 80s' on Wall Street. That, says Mr Rubin, is 'one hell of a good phrase'. He says Goldman will always be prone to individual problems - because that is the nature of a large organisation. But the firm's culture is designed to discourage 'people who feel too full of themselves'. The message from top is that 'when you start to believe in your own infallibility is when you really are in big trouble'. It is a message that might also serve the Clinton campaign well in the run-up to November as it reflects on its remarkable lead in the polls.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1938 Born in New York City.

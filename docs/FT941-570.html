			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark moves lower The D-Mark yesterday gave up some of the gains it made at the end of last week, finishing weaker against the dollar, sterling and European currencies, writes Philip Gawith. Amid fairly quiet trading ahead of the Easter weekend, the D-Mark's retreat was more a case of reversing a trend that had gone too far last week, than a reaction to any fresh data. The D-Mark was led lower in Europe by the resurgent Italian lira ahead of the announcement today of the election result. Dealers said there was an element of short-covering by some investors in anticipation of a post-election rally. Following last week's bout of strength, the D-Mark fell victim to profit-taking before Easter. Volumes, however, were light with dealers reluctant to take positions ahead of the weekend. The German currency gained little support from comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, that he was still worried about the high rate of German money supply growth. On the other hand, a small drop in inflation encouraged those hoping for a quicker fall in interest rates. The statistics office said West German CPI rose 0.2 per cent from February and 3.2 per cent year-on-year, weaker than the previous month's 0.3 per cent and 3.4 per cent. Economists said the figures confirmed the favourable trend of German inflation and predicted the headline number could fall below 3 per cent in the coming months. NatWest Markets in their latest forecast put German CPI at 3.1 per cent in the second quarter and 2.8 per cent in the third quarter. The futures market was cheered by the inflation figures, with the June three-month Euromark contract three basis points firmer at 94.57. The market is thus discounting three-month money at 5.43 per cent in June, compared to the current level of about 5.75 per cent. The December contract was four points higher at 94.91. The overall tone of the futures, however, remains pessimistic. The market expects interest rates to bottom in March next year, with three-month money at 5 per cent compared to 5.75 per cent now. Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, believes rates will be at 3 1/2 to 4 per cent by that time. The outlook for a further fall in the repo rate this week, from 5.80 per cent, remains promising. Call money is currently about 5.70 per cent. Ms Reed predicts a 5 to 7 basis-point fall in the rate. The D-Mark finished against the dollar in London at DM1.6728, down from DM1.668 on Friday. It was also weaker against most currencies in Europe. In terms of the Spanish peseta, it closed at Pta82.15 from Pta82.27. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.6721. Elsewhere in Europe, the lira enjoyed a strong recovery to close in London at L978.4 per D-Mark from L988.8. Analysts said this rally probably reflected short lira positions being squeezed out of the market - that is, people who had sold lira without owning it being forced to buy it back. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, said the market appeared to have revised its view of a desirable Italian election result. Initially the consensus was that the market would prefer a centre-left government, preferably with Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister and former central bank governor, at the helm. Now a greater premium is being placed on a stable government that can implement a credible deficit reduction plan. There is, however, a view in some quarters that a stable government of the centre-right is not possible. The Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 6.00 per cent at a securities repurchase tender held to put funds into the money market. The franc was slightly stronger at FFr3.422 from FFr3.426 against the D-Mark. Sterling had a quiet day, ending firmer against the D-Mark at DM2.5035 from DM2.4978. Analysts said this reflected D-Mark weakness rather than any renewed appetite for pounds. It was marginally lower compared with the stronger dollar, ending at Dollars 1.4966 from Dollars 1.4975. The UK currency has failed repeatedly in recent months to break decisively above Dollars 1.50. Apart from being held back by continuing to trade with the dollar, analysts said the pound remained vulnerable on the political front. The government appears in something of a lose-lose situation in the current debate over EU voting rules: a compromise will anger Tory Euro-sceptics, while a hardline attitude will leave Britain as the odd man out in Europe. The message from sterling futures is that the market is increasingly pessimistic about the outlook for lower interest rates in the UK. The June short sterling contract fell a further 6 basis points to 94.60, while the December future was 9 points off at 94.09. Money market rates were broadly unchanged, with three-month money offered at 5 3/8 per cent. In the discount market, the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 265m. Earlier in the day it put Pounds 522m into the market after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 850m.</p>

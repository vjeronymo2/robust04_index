			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LATINO TO HEAD S.D. COLLEGE DISTRICT;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: IN A SURPRISE MOVE, TRUSTEES NAME AUGUSTINE GALLEGO TO REPLACE J.  WILLIAM WENRICH, THE OUTGOING CHANCELLOR.  </P> <P> Augustine Gallego, a 14-year veteran counselor and administrator in the San  Diego Community College system, was named the district's new chancellor  Wednesday night in a surprise move by trustees.  </P> <P> Gallego, 46, now district director of instructional and student services, will  officially assume the top post Oct. 1 from J. William Wenrich, the  well-respected chancellor who is leaving the district for a similar job in  Dallas County, Tex. During his two-year tenure, Wenrich is credited by trustees  with turning around faculty morale, refocusing academic programs and  strengthening community ties after years of faculty-administration tensions.  </P> <P> A surprised but pleased Gallego told reporters after his appointment that he  hopes to build upon the many initiatives and programs begun by Wenrich.  </P> <P> Gallego will become the first Latino to be chancellor, overseeing more than  100,000 students and 4,100 faculty members at City, Mesa and Miramar colleges,  as well as the Educational Cultural Complex in Southeast San Diego and nine  other continuing education centers.  </P> <P> It is the second-largest among California's 71 community college districts and  plays an important role in providing vocational and part-time education to  working students as well as preparing students academically for transfer to the  UC and Cal State systems who are unable at first to meet four-year-college  financial requirements.  </P> <P> Gallego listed his varied administrative preparation as a strength in carrying  forward state-mandated plans for increasing the number of full-time faculty  members in community colleges, improving ethnic diversity among professors and  students and integrating vocational, academic and basic skills programs.  </P> <P> "My appointment is also important not only symbolically but substantively as  well," the Tucson native said. "I have worked well with numerous community  groups and have an active profile that I hope to continue . . . with outreach  to the community."  </P> <P> In making the announcement, board president Dan Grady said that trustees  decided to move quickly after Wenrich's resignation Aug. 2 so that momentum  built up during Wenrich's tenure would not be lost during a year-long national  search and appointment of an interim chancellor.  </P> <P> "The hiatus under the direction of an interim chancellor was unacceptable,"  Grady said.  </P> <P> "The board decided that it was most important to have in the position . . . a  person who had long experience within the district and could advise the board  based on personal knowledge and historical background."  </P> <P> Three of the five board members -- Grady, Louise Dyer and Charles Reid -- are  retiring at the end of the year. But, although only two-year members Evonne  Schulze and Fred Colby will continue as trustees, Grady and others said that  Gallego will have the ability and personality to work well with any new board.  </P> <P> "He can work with anybody," Colby said. "He's in the mold of Bill (Wenrich) but  he has certain tools to even add things beyond those that Bill started,  especially with the community.  </P> <P> "There was no dissension among any of the trustees. Everyone felt he was the  right person."  </P> <P> Gallego received his bachelor's degree from the University of Arizona and his  master's in educational psychology at UC Davis, where he also served as  associate dean of student affairs for six years.  </P> <P> Gallego came to the San Diego district in 1976 to head the counseling program  at the then-new Educational Cultural Complex. He later served as dean for  continuing education programs, as provost at the ECC and as director of  instructional and student services at City College before assuming the  systemwide post under Wenrich.  </P></p>

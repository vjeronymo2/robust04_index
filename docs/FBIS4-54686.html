			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, May 3 (AFP) -- UN envoy Yasushi Akashi  called on Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic Tuesday [3 May]  to allow UN observers into "critical areas," including the  expected key flashpoint of Brcko, a UN spokesman said here.  Akashi wants the monitors deployed to stabilize the conflict  ahead of ceasefire talks, said Michael Williams, Akashi's  spokesman, ahead of the UN envoy's meeting with Karadzic.    "Mr. Akashi will be pressing the point that it would be  advisable to obtain an enhanced UNPROFOR observation in critical  areas in order to stabilize the situation in anticipation of  possible ceasefire negotiations," Williams said.    Brcko, in northeastern Bosnia, is thought to be the Serbs'  next target after their standoff over Gorazde. Seizure of Brcko  would widen a strategic corridor linking Serbia and Serb-held  areas in northwestern Bosnia.    Akashi and UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander General  Bertrand de Lapresle began talks with Karadzic during the  afternoon in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale, the TANJUG  news agency reported late Tuesday afternoon. "We are hoping  that something positive in that regard will come out of the  meeting this afternoon," Williams added. Earlier in the day  Akashi met Bosnian Government leaders in Sarajevo.    Several western sources have reported concentrations of Serb  and Bosnian Moslem forces near Brcko. Military experts have  predicted it would their next strategic target after Gorazde.</p>

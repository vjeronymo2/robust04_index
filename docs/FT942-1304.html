			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: China development bank focuses on infrastructure The newly-established State Development Bank, an important element of China's financial sector reforms, expects to lend Yn80bn (Dollars 9.3bn) this year for projects in such areas as power generation, transport and telecommunications. Mr Yao Zhenyan, president of the bank - which has been modelled on the Development Bank of Japan - said that the process of evaluating loan requests began within days of the bank being formed in May. The bank's most important function will be to assume the state-oriented lending responsibilities presently shouldered by China's 'big four' specialised banks, allowing them to become commercial entities. The specialised banks had functioned almost as aid agencies for the government's infrastructure needs and were given little encouragement to make independent assessments of the projects. Mr Yao indicated that the new bank would concentrate its energies in the power sector (where there is significant demand for capital), telecommunications and transport. The bank, which has registered capital of Yn50bn, would raise Yn65bn for lending to development projects. It would rely on central government support, but would also tap the commercial banks and eventually would float bonds domestically and internationally. Mr Yao said the bank would shy away from lending for construction, which would be the main responsibility of the Agriculture Development Bank, one of three recently established policy-lending institutions. The other is the Import and Export Credit Bank. But the State Development Bank would support large construction projects such as the Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze river. It was providing Yn3bn in loans this year for the civil works. Mr Yao was adamant that the bank would not assume responsibility for the bad loans of the specialised banks. Western officials had predicted this would be one of the bank's functions. 'We say old problems should be solved through old channels, and new problems should be solved using new methods,' he said. 'If we take over the problems our bank would go bankrupt in three years. 'While commercial banks must be profit-oriented, our bank must not be loss-oriented,' he added. 'This demands that what we will run is a bank and not a currency pool.' Some estimates have put China's infrastructure requirements to the year 2000 at Yn700bn. This includes 121 important projects designated by the state. The State Development Bank also planned to participate in BOT (build-operate-transfer) funding operations and other forms of financing aimed at attracting foreign capital. Mr Yao ranked China's three priority infrastructure areas as the Three Gorges project, the Beijing-Kowloon railway, and power plants 'all the way to Tibet'.</p>

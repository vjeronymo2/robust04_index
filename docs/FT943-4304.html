			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Germany Judging by yesterday's second-quarter growth figures, the German bond market had no reason to push bond yields above 7.5 per cent this week. West German growth, which reached 2.3 per cent in the second quarter, is heavily propelled by construction, exports and stock-building. There is little sign of an inflationary boom in private consumption. Next year's tax increases could prevent that occurring for some time, and if there is not enough demand to absorb the higher level of stocks, the recovery could even falter in the second half. There is little incentive for the Bundesbank to start raising interest rates again in the near term, and recent comments from top officials seem designed to discourage such speculation. But there are other reasons why the bond market may not recover its composure that easily. The first is the perennial problem of supply, with another auction of government bonds due this month. The second is election uncertainty. An SPD victory would raise fresh doubts about Bonn's ability to curb the budget and might also raise expectations for next year's wage round. In those circumstances the Bundesbank might find it harder to ignore the fact that, although M3 money supply growth is decelerating, it is still way above its target range.</p>

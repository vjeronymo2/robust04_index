			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Czech foreign intelligence service--that is, the  Office for Foreign Relations and Information--does not work  against the interests of other countries and is not engaged in  either political or economic espionage. Jan Subert, press  spokesman of the Czech Ministry of the Interior, said this today  in response to reports published in the Berlin-based newspaper  DIE WELT, according to which the activities of espionage  services of East European countries--above all, the Czech  Republic--have increased of late.    According to Subert, the intelligence service gathers  information about foreign activities that might endanger the  security of the Czech Republic. In cooperation with partner  intelligence services, it is oriented toward the areas of global  risks against civilization--such as terrorism, drug trafficking,  and the illegal transfer of arms.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Mercedes Benz to cut workforce by 20,000 MERCEDES BENZ, one of Germany's leading car and lorry makers, is to cut its workforce by 20,000 over the next two years, according to Mr Werner Niefer, chairman. 'Introducing such a short-term programme is urgently necessary if we are to remain competitive, most notably with the Japanese,' he added. Job cuts were only part of a wide-ranging programme, he said. The model range had to be extended and production methods adapted. The aim was to cut costs by 10-12 per cent. Other objectives were to increase research and development links with components suppliers, reduce the range of parts used in Mercedes cars and lorries, and improve plant working times. Reductions in the payroll would come from redundancies, early retirement and natural wastage, Mr Niefer said. The announcement followed broad hints from Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Mercedes' parent, Daimler-Benz. He told journalists in April that the subsidiary had 20,000 excess workers and that it would have to 'cut the fat'. He suggested then that the cuts would not involve redundancies. Mr Niefer, who is also Mr Reuter's deputy, said negotiations with unions were continuing, although broad agreement had been reached.</p>

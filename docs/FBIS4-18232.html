			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [WELT-NACHRICHTENDIENST report: "Germans Expect Lean Times"] </F>   [Text] Wiesbaden -- Germans consider Germany as a business  location jeopardized. They also seem to be preparing for lean  times. This is indicated by a study conducted by the Emnid  research institute for the Chemical Industry Employers  Association.    Only 4 percent of the more than 3,000 persons polled said  that they expect prosperity to grow in the next few years.    According to the study, those polled think that Germany has  dropped from first place to fourth in the listing of most  attractive business locations. The continuing debate has led to  growing insecurity among the people, the study says. Japan,  Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore are considered either better off or  the same as Germany. Only one in four puts Germany first.    Two-thirds of those polled (67 percent) said that Germans  will have to work longer hours and make do with lower wages, if  they want to meet international standards. A total of 43  percent were convinced that German products have become too  expensive in the international markets and are thus no longer  competitive. Two out of three said that Germans will have to  prepare for the growth in prosperity coming to a halt.</p>

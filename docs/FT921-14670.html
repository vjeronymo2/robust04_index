			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Observer: Useful friend Lord Rothschild's six year reign as chairman of the National Gallery Trustees may have ended, but his most permanent contribution to the place has yet to emerge. As a farewell present he is paying for the renovation of the cavernous Central Hall - and restoring it to its 1887 glory. The Hall will act as a meeting place where the gallery's visitors - up by over 500,000 last year to a record 4.3m - can get their bearings. His farewell gift will cost Lord Rothschild Pounds 1m. But this is not the end of his usefulness to the National Gallery. In the spring he takes over as chairman of the National Heritage Fund, which receives Pounds 12m a year from the government to help keep in the UK masterpieces threatened with export. Why should not some of them find a permanent home in the National Gallery ?</p>

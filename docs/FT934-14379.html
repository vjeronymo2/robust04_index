			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Property: For those who want to buy in France - Anthony Blond finds much to commend in a new guide to acquiring property over the Channel HER Britannic Majesty's consuls-general would save pain, misery, tears and woe for their subjects - and much repetition of information by themselves - were they to give a copy of an excellent little guide to every British householder registered with them in France. (A less benign precedent exists in the gift to German newlyweds of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf during his tenure of the chancellery; but that was a boring and incomprehensible work, which this is not). The guide is by Elizabeth Morgan, who begins with a husband but ends up as a single parent with two grown-up daughters. She is an actress and writer who is also a practical, lucid and experienced setter-up of houses (or, rather, holiday homes) in France, having been through three in 20 years. Sensibly, she has stayed in the same neighbourhood on the ground that French neighbours, once acquired, should not be shed lightly. This is not difficult because the provincial French, unlike the gipsy-footed Brits, tend to stay put, sometimes for centuries. But they do die, eventually, and their children will have skipped to a town or to Paris, the great maw feared and disliked by the rest of France but lived in, or around, by a quarter of the population. This means that there are thousands of houses, including some of the 40,000 chateaux, for vacant possession at a quarter to a fifth of the price in overcrowded England. Many need rewiring, re-roofing, connecting to the mains and furbishing but, mostly, these vieilles pierres are not about to fall down. The French, however, do not like these old stones, preferring the detached pavillon, ordered from a brochure, with thermostatic central heating, satellite television, a wodge of cypresses and a double garage. The obtrusive signs of estate agents have not reached deepest France, and seeing a small yellow sticker saying 'A Vendre' and noting the name and number of a notaire - often, the only one in the town - is the first move. He will have other properties to offer, in a very unpushy way, for the notaire's chief interest is to clear the estate and his money comes from the fees: say, 17.5 per cent on a house costing FFr200,000 (Pounds 23,300). The compromis is the agreement to purchase and an agreed price from which you, but not the vendor, can back out - albeit with forfeiture of the deposit. The acte is (for once) what it sounds like and Morgan describes how, at some moment in the transaction, the notaire might have to make an urgent telephone call or visit the lavatory for a prolonged period. At this point, a wad of notes changes hands; for although the French are the most regulated and obedient nation in Europe, a few anarchic, ancient, habits survive. Morgan is efficient about curtain poles (brilliant in France), junk and antiques, giving details of every market; the danger of sun oil; un-itemised telephone bills; sub-letting (don't); amorous workmen (this is very much a woman's book); ironing boards, (buy in France), and irons (buy in England). She even tells us the worthwhile radio and television programmes. She advises against importing British labour, bouncing a cheque, or confronting the French bureaucracy with anything but the humblest of miens. A real vade mecum. Can We Afford the Bidet? A Guide to Setting Up House in France. By Elizabeth Morgan. Leonard Publishing, 176pp, Pounds 14.95.</p>

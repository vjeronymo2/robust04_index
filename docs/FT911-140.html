			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (1): Japanese still set the pace - The importance of the human element in the production process permeates Japanese methods. Now Western companies are beginning to appreciate that there is a limit to what the computer can do to help the manufacturers MANUFACTURING methods have changed profoundly in the US and Europe over the past few years. The adoption of total quality control and just-in-time techniques have proven necessary to compete with Japanese manufacturers, whose fundamentally different approach has set standards of efficiency and quality Western manufacturers are still striving to emulate. A comparative study of motor car manufacture in the US and Japan published recently by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology makes the point powerfully. General Motors' plant in Framingham in the US takes 31 hours to assemble a car. There are 135 defects in every 100 cars and a two week inventory of parts. Toyota's Takaoka plant in Japan produces a car every 16 hours with on 45 faults per 100 cars. Its inventory is sufficient to sustain production for a mere two hours. The West's struggle to compete with Japan's growing manufacturing superiority has been marked by false starts and expensive excursions up technological blind alleys. Western companies failed initially to understand the nature of the difference in manufacturing philosophies, believing that low labour costs and heavy use of technology were the answer. In fact, with the appreciation of the yen, Japan's labour costs are not all that different from its Western competitors. Japanese manufacturers certainly use computers but sparingly, preferring to design their products to suit them for manufacture, rather than the other way about. They build quality into their products rather than inspect later for faults. Responsibility for quality control is entrusted to the production worker rather than the Western-style quality control department. Increasingly, the trend is to parallelism or concurrent engineering, where customer requirements, product design, manufacturing technology and cost accountancy proceed in parallel and information is continuously fed back to modify the manufacturing processes. These ideas of design for manufacture and respect for the contribution individuals can make to manufacturing quality permeate Japanese manufacturing methods. They are now diffusing to the West and are the essential backcloth against which the growing use of computers in manufacturing must be seen. Computer systems for manufacturers are supplied by computer makers rather than traditional machine tool companies. Hardware comes from companies such as IBM, ICL, Digital Equipment, Hewlett Packard, and Bull Software is supplied by companies such as Istel Automation, Kewill Systems and Prime Computers among a host of others. All agree that with most Western economies exhibiting weakness, if not actual recession, business is tough: 'but not as bad as it's made out to be' according to Mr Peter Willis of IBM. Mr Graham McKenzie, technical unit manager for Digital Equipment in the UK says that buyers are focusing on the business benefits of installing computer systems. The industry is not helped by the continuing difficulty the accountancy profession has found in cost justifying investment in modern computer equipment. A detailed study of the US valve industry by Dr Peter Weill called Do Computers Pay Off?, (ICIT Press, 1990) concluded that the relationship between computer investment and manufacturing was circular: 'It was not possible to identify the unique contribution of any particular year of IT investment. It is not clear that this can ever be achieved statistically'. The advent of the microprocessor, by making available virtually unlimited computer power at low cost, has given manufacturers a wide range of powerful, computer-based technologies which can be deployed on the factory floor as well as the back office. There is computer aided design (Cad), pioneered by aerospace and computer manufacturers, which provides not only an electronic drawing board, but also product design information. Computer aided engineering (CAE) automates the design process making it possible to test the validity of a design before moving to the prototype stage. Computer aided manufacturing (Cam) involves a range of intelligent shop-floor machinery including robots, numerically controlled machine tools, flexible manufacturing centres and automated handling systems. Much of this is taken for granted. Mr Brian Small, managing director of Ingersoll Engineers, a UK manufacturing consultancy, says that manufacturing computers today look like and are bought like conventional machine tools. Convenience and simplicity of purchase does not guarantee success in operation however and there are serious dangers in assuming that manufacturing problems yield to an injection of technology. The Strathclyde Institute, an independent manufacturing consultancy warns in a recent report: 'Many people equate improved competitiveness in manufacture with the application of state-of-the-art technology such as powerful computer systems, MRP, Cad and robotics. While it may be advantageous or necessary for a company to apply these and other enabling technologies in pursuit of excellence, this should only be as part of an overall company strategy.'* 'If such technologies are applied to a company without cognisance of the needs or effects on other areas, at present or in the future, then it may be difficult if not impossible to integrate the patchwork of systems across the company.' Integration is the important word in manufacturing automation. The goal for forward looking companies is computer integrated manufacture (Cim), an overused piece of jargon with many definitions. One comprehensive definition from the Strathclyde Institute is: 'an amalgam of computer aided engineering and drafting, computer aided manufacturing, flexible manufacturing systems, tooling and quality support systems, in-process gauging and automated final inspection, automated storage and materials handling, and operations control within a business information system.' Mr Willis of IBM warns, however, that too often the 'i' in Cim stands for interconnection rather than integration. There has to be, he explains, an underlying Cim architecture: 'To complete a 1,000-piece jigsaw, you have to have all the pieces and a picture on the box.' There is probably not a single true Cim operation anywhere in the world. Cell manufacture is emerging as one of the biggest steps towards integrated manufacture. A survey by Ingersoll Engineers** suggests that over half of the UK's engineering companies have implemented cell manufacture in some part of their business. Cells are self-contained manufacturing units with the machines, controls, people and support needed to make a finished product complete with payment schemes, incentives, performance measurements and accountability. 'Well over 90 per cent of manufacturers who have implemented cells have seen an improvement in performance and 40 per cent describe the improvement as significant. Fewer than 2 per cent have abandoned the approach,' says Ingersoll. Computer technology has a part to play in the flow of information necessary to support and underpin these developments. Successful manufacturers in the 1990s, however, will emphasise the human dimension: 'What do you need to do the job?' will replace the order 'Look after that machine]' *Computer Integrated Manufacture for the Engineering Industry, The Strathclyde Institute 1990, Financial Times Business Information, 071-799 2002. **Competitive Manufacturing - the quiet revolution, Ingersoll Engineers, 1990, 0926 427088.</p>

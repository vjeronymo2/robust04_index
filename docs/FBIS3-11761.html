			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 24 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Canadian Prime  Minister Jean Chretien told the Mexican Congress today Mexico  has the capability to overcome the blow stemming from the murder  of the presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary  Party [PRI].    Referring to Luis Donaldo Colosio's murder before members of  the six congressional political parties, Chretien said: "I am  sure they (Mexicans) will bear this tragedy and will continue to  advance in democracy."    Chretien addressed Congress following a one-hour meeting  with  Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari that was held this  morning at Los Pinos Presidential Residence in Mexico City.    Chretien underscored in his speech: "In moments such as  these, we are all brothers and sisters, and I am confident this  tragedy will bring us even closer and that Mexico will continue  to fight to defend its democratic values."    Minutes before, in his welcome speech to Chretien, PRI  Senator Silvia Hernandez said with a weak voice and tears in her  eyes that, unfortunately, he "came at a time of national sorrow  which under other circumstances would have been a time for  celebration."    Hernandez conveyed the respect Mexicans feel for Canada due  to its democratic and multicultural background and for being a  nation that has always offered its support to developing  countries, showing its concern for the respect of human rights  and the environment.    At the end of his speech, members of the various parties  asked Chretien questions regarding NAFTA, the situation of  Indians in Canada, and Quebec's separatist movement.    Regarding NAFTA, Chretien explained it substantially  improves  the bilateral agreement Canada had with the United States and it  will help improve living standards in North America.    He said he is convinced of the advantages free trade  entails,  recalling the Canadian economy has been able to rank among the  seven most developed economies in the world because its export  sector is the leading source in job creation.    Chretien said Canada is the main exporter per capita in the  world, clarifying the NAFTA members (Canada, the United States,  and Mexico) must still work on the definition of subsidies and  dumping to establish more clear rules and a more just trade.    Regarding the situation of Canadian Indians, he said the  solution has been and should be "cultural diversity in unity" so  that instead of trying to westernize the Indian peoples, "they  prefer to guarantee them their autonomy."    In this sense, Chretien said Quebec's separatist movement  has  always existed, and although it might be legitimate, he is  confident people in Quebec prefer to remain members of the  Canadian federation.    Chretien began today a three-day official visit to Mexico  where he had planned to attend a dinner in his honor offered by  President Salinas de Gortari.    The event was canceled, however, due to the attempt against  Colosio Murrieta, who was shot in the head and abdomen following  a political meeting in the northwestern city of Tijuana.    Three hours after the attack, Colosio Murrieta, 44, died in  Tijuana General Hospital despite the efforts of a team of  doctors to save his life.</p>

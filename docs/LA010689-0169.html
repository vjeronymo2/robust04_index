			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> TOP FEDERAL NEGOTIATOR ENTERS EASTERN AIRLINES TALKS WITH MACHINISTS  </P> <P> Intense negotiations between troubled Eastern Airlines and its largest union,  in a contract dispute for more than a year, began today under the direction of  the chairman of the National Mediation Board.  </P> <P> Management negotiators headed by Tom Matthews, senior vice president for human  resources, and Machinists negotiators led by District 100 President Charles E.  Bryan began meeting this morning at an undisclosed location. No deadline has  been set.  </P> <P> Chairman Walter Wallace of the National Mediation Board flew here Thursday from  Washington to oversee the talks, which will continue daily late into the night,  unless Wallace and mediator Harry Bickford decide the two sides are making no  progress.  </P> <P> A federal declaration of an impasse would trigger a 30-day cooling-off period,  after which the 8,500-member union could strike and management would impose its  own work conditions.  </P> <P> "Mediators are always optimistic, but we have a ways to go," said Bickford, who  has directed the mediation since Jan. 26. Mediation began then after  negotiations stalled.  </P> <P> Wallace's presence adds to the pressure on the negotiators to settle. Entry of  such a high-level mediator usually would not occur until the 30-day cooling-off  period.  </P> <P> Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said management wants a settlement, although  Eastern executives have been lobbying for months for declaration of an impasse.  They say a 30-day deadline will get the talks moving.  </P> <P> The two sides have been $200 million apart since July. The Machinists' last  offer called for a $50-million raise; the company asked $150 million in wage  concessions, mainly from such non-mechanics as baggage handlers and janitors,  who make up about half the Machinists union.  </P></p>

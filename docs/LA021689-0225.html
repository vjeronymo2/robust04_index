			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YEUTTER TO BE A 'WARRIOR' FOR GLOBAL TRADING -- BUSH  </P> <P> The United States will pursue free and fair global trade relentlessly,  President Bush pledged today, touting Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter  as a hard-nosed warrior for those goals.  </P> <P> At a swearing-in ceremony for Yeutter at the Agriculture Department, Bush  praised the man who served as an aggressive and successful trade ambassador  under President Reagan. At Bush's request two months ago, Yeutter agreed to  take the Cabinet position, a lifelong goal, rather than leave government.  </P> <P> Today's half-hour session was a formality because Yeutter took the oath of  office within hours of his Senate confirmation Feb. 8, but it gave Bush an  opportunity to discuss the future of world trade negotiations.  </P> <P> "Agriculture is one of the most difficult areas in our trade talks," the  President said. "Agriculture is an area where we attach extraordinarily high  priority in international discussions."  </P> <P> Trade reform talks are deadlocked at the moment because of disagreements about  agricultural trade. The European Community opposes a U.S. proposal for  worldwide elimination of uneven farm subsidies and trade barriers.  </P> <P> "Fair, free and open world markets -- that's what we want," Bush said. "That's  what we're working for, and in the end that's what we're determined to get."  </P> <P> Yeutter, who has been working quietly in his new job, promised Bush and the  department's employees to lead "a team at the top . . . that will be strong,  competent and energetic."  </P> <P> Yeutter has yet to announce his selections for top jobs in his department, or  even to name a press secretary. His most significant decision in his first week  was how many extra acres of soybeans and sunflowers farmers will be allowed to  plant under a provision of the drought relief law.  </P></p>

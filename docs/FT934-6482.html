			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Nthn Foods easier A gloomy message from Northern Foods, accompanying otherwise acceptable results, sent the shares scurrying downwards, although they rallied towards the end of a turbulent session. They closed 4 off at 225p in busy trade of 2.7m. Food manufacturing analysts said the cautious statement was in keeping with a downbeat post-results meeting, in which the company said that tough price pressures from the first half increased in the second. Downgrades quickly followed, with the market range some 10 per cent lower at Pounds 155m to Pounds 162m.</p>

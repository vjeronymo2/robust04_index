In a press release published 31 January, CONACOM called for  the holding of a true national conference and proposed a  schedule, including five steps, for the holding of this  conference.    CONACOM says that such a conference must be preceded by:    A. The formation of a political coalition among the  political    groups that agree to work jointly for a way out of the    crisis;    B. The designation by President Aristide of a new prime  minister;    C. The formation of a government of national concord;    D. The holding of a sociopolitical rally; and    E. The holding of a national conference following Aristide's  return to Haiti.    CONACOM rejects an arrangement precipitated in form and time  [as heard] and invites all the country's sons to be aware of the  seriousness of the crisis.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / International Company News: Generali detects signs of recovery from weak trends GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance company, may be recovering from the deteriorating market trends which have depressed its domestic earnings in recent years. Mr Eugenio Coppola di Canzano, chairman, said there were signs of 'a certain improvement' in the market, based on figures for the first four months of this year. 'I see 1992 as a bit better than the previous year, and I think 1993, for some sectors especially, should allow us to get back to break-even at the underwriting level.' Generali, like all Italy's insurers, has suffered from growing underwriting losses on its non-life business domestically, particularly in motor insurance. Last year, parent company losses amounted to L112.8bn on non-life activities, against underwriting earnings of L493.4bn on the life side. The company said it expected a 'slight improvement' in its domestic underwriting results this year. In spite of warning signs of some slowdown in generating new premiums, 'we expect profits to rise in 1992', it forecast. Group net earnings before minority interests rose to L672.2bn (Dollars 576m) last year from L546.3bn in 1990. The parent company's share reached L563.9bn, up from L467.8bn in 1990. Group premium income, adjusted for inter-group reinsurance business, rose by 17.1 per cent to L16,005bn. Some L6,243bn stemmed from life business and L9,762bn from non-life activities. The Italian market comprised 37.7 per cent of the total. Mr Coppola di Canzano said the group was now aiming to plug gaps in its foreign network, notably in Latin America and eastern Europe, while consolidating existing activities in Europe. Generali's joint venture with Banco Central Hispanoamericano, should give it about 10 per cent of the Spanish insurance market, and would also be used to establish a bridgehead in Latin America. He said liberalisation in a number of Latin American countries had created new opportunities, persuading Generali to reverse a decision taken almost three decades earlier to pull out. In the US, he ruled out any direct investment in Equitable, the US insurer in which Axa-Midi of France has taken a stake. Generali has a substantial holding in Axa-Midi. However the company said any decision to participate in a possible Axa-Midi rights issue linked to the transformation of Equitable from its current status as a mutual insurer would be decided 'at that moment'. Mr Coppola di Canzano said that by the end of April, 46 per cent of the warrants linked to last year's big rights issue by Generali had been exercised.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / World Trade News: Bolivia and Chile sign tariff-cutting accord BOLIVIA and Chile have signed a tariff-cutting agreement, during a two-day conference of Rio Group foreign ministers in the eastern Bolivian city of Santa Cruz. Under the trade accord, Chile and Bolivia will abolish tariffs on 150 goods. Both will contact private-sector companies to start studying the feasibility of a pipeline to export Bolivian natural gas to northern Chile. Chilean exports to Bolivia were worth some Dollars 135m (Pounds 95m) last year, while Bolivian exports to Chile were worth Dollars 18m, though the La Paz government believes the accord will increase this by Dollars 35m. The conference called on President Bill Clinton to continue the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative of his predecessor. Mr Enrique Silva Cimma, Chilean foreign minister and conference spokesman, said freer trade with the US should not block greater economic integration between Latin American countries. Venezuela signalled it was willing to resume diplomatic relations with Peru, which were broken when President Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress last April. Both Peru and Panama were invited to rejoin the Rio group. Panama, asked to rejoin as part of the Central American delegation, may continue to seek individual membership. The Rio Group meeting, attended by 12 Latin American and Caribbean foreign ministers, was preparing for an October meeting of Rio Group heads of state in Chile.</p>

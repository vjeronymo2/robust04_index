			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: R-R foreign buying Aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce continued to attract overseas interest and edged forward a halfpenny to 150p in an otherwise poor day for the market. Volume was 3.2m shares. US investment bank Lehman Brothers is among those institutions which have moved to satisfy continuing demand from overseas investors, following last week's company announcement that the foreign share ownership level had reached the maximum permitted of 29.5 per cent. Lehman said it has issued 5m call warrants with a maturity date of December 1994 with the specific aim of satisfying European and US demand for Rolls-Royce. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was said earlier this week to be looking to make a similar move. Currently any further direct purchases by non-UK investors would have to be relinquished or transferred to UK ownership as soon as the company confirms the purchases, a move dictated by its articles of association.</p>

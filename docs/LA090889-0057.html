			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is reassessing a 30-year-old policy of military aid to Africa  that, with little other forms of assistance, has resulted in a loss of  influence on the continent, Jane's Soviet Intelligence Review said. A detailed  analysis by the London publication that specializes in East-West affairs said  that Soviet influence in Africa is waning because, instead of providing  development aid as the West does, the Kremlin has done little more since 1960  than provide weapons for civil wars. Moscow's major achievement in Africa has  been to prevent the overthrow of Communist governments in Angola and Ethiopia,  its two closest allies in Africa, Jane's said.  </P></p>

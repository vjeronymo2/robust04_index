			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Knyazev: "Americans To Promote Their </F> Technologies in Russia: Oil and Gas Center Opening in Tyumen"]    [Text] The governments of Russia and the United States  attach great importance to international cooperation in the oil  and gas industry, as demonstrated by an agreement between  Vice-President Albert Gore and Viktor Chernomyrdin to establish  a Russian-American oil and gas technology center in Tyumen. The  agreement was reached in mid-December 1993 during a visit to  Russia by Mr. Gore. Yesterday an American delegation headed by  David Pamfry, head of the U.S. Department of Energy's Department  of Energy Research, left Tyumen after signing a specific  agreement on establishment of the center with oblast  administration chief Leonid Roketskiy.    Both sides have an interest in establishing the oil and gas  technology center, which should begin operating this summer.  Russia needs investment in its oil and gas complex, as well as  U.S. equipment and technology. The Americans, according to Mr.  Roketskiy, "are forced to resort to `migrant labor'," as their  oil production is declining due to market forces. According to  projections by American sources, in 1994 the United States will  shut down approximately 50,000 wells and an equal number will  operate below capacity if oil prices remain at the current level  of $14 a barrel.    According to the charter documents drawn up by  TyumenNIIGiprogaz [Tyumen State Scientific Research Institute  for Gas Industry Planning] the center will collect and collate  information, draw up technical and financial plans for the use  of Russian technology and equipment in the United States and  American technology and equipment in Russia, and carry out joint  projects and research in the field of oil and gas production.  The U.S. Government has allocated $400,000 to set up the center,  which as a non-commercial organization will have to operate on a  cost recovery basis. During negotiations Mr. Roketskiy stated  that the center's opening should be noted by a Russian  government decree, which would give the center greater  importance. As KOMMERSANT reported yesterday, the oblast  administration has already drafted such a decree. However, Mr.  Roketskiy denied that by doing so the oblast is attempting to  induce Moscow to finance the center.</p>

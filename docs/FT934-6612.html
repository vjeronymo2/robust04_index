			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Thorp's 2,100 jobs 'at risk' Abandonment of British Nuclear Fuels' Pounds 2.85bn Thorp plant would cost 2,100 jobs directly and increase unemployment in the Copeland area of West Cumbria to 26.4 per cent, a report published yesterday says. The research by the GMB general union also warns that if the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant is not commissioned Sellafield's entire operating cost will fall on its Magnox reprocessing division, making it doubtful whether the site's operations will remain commercially viable. The report says this could lead to the complete closure of Sellafield, Copeland's biggest employer, with the loss of 9,600 related jobs, raising the area's unemployment to 48.9 per cent. Closure of BNF's West Cumbrian operation is the 'hidden agenda' of Greenpeace and other anti-Thorp groups, the document says. It dismisses the dry storage option for nuclear fuel, proposed by Thorp opponents, as an interim solution which is technically impractical and will create at most only 100 full-time permanent jobs. The report was launched yesterday in Whitehaven by the GMB, Sellafield's biggest union representing 3,000 of the 8,000 BNF employees. The launch was supported by Copeland district council and the Confederation of British Industry, which are concerned at the economic implications should Thorp not go ahead. An announcement by the government is imminent. Unemployment in the Copeland travel to work area now stands at 11.5 per cent or 3,685 people. The report says this is expected to rise by 2,400 to 18.9 per cent when Thorp's construction is complete. Thorp: West Cumbria and Employment.

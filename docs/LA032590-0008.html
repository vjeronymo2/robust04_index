			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> DESIGN;  </P> <P> CAROUSEL DREAMER  </P> <P> AS A YOUNG BOY, Augustin Rodiles "would spend all my allowance money riding the  carousel. To me, those horses were as real as a dream."  </P> <P> Now 35, Rodiles, a cabinet maker by trade and master carousel horse carver by  avocation, is giving shape to his childhood dream. And, like many a dreamer,  Rodiles wants to share his visions. He'll be teaching a class in miniature  carousel horse carving at Pasadena's Victory Park in April. "It's great fun for  me -- the ones that appreciate the art of carousel horses are full-grown men  and women," says Rodiles.  </P> <P> But if owning one, not making one, is your objective, Rodiles will be only too  happy to accommodate. Rodiles makes full-size (60" tall, 60" long) horses for  sale; hand-sculpted with carving tools -- no hammers -- they take two to three  months to produce. The price: about $4,000 for unpainted ones, $5,000 for  painted versions "because they take so much longer to do."  </P> <P> The horses are made from sugar pine, in the traditional way -- hollow, to save  weight on the carousel. "I make reproductions," says Rodiles, "but I always  change the pattern a little bit. In the future, I'm going to make my own  designs, following the traditional way."  </P> <P> And, says Rodiles, who made his first horse only five years ago: "I am barely  beginning on the art of carousel horses. I am positive that one day I will be  able to say more of what I have done to contribute to the art of carousel."  </P> <P>  Augustin Rodiles, by appointment only, (818) 797-5328; Wood-carving class:  Friday nights from April 9 to June 15 at Victory Park, 2575 Paloma St.,  Pasadena., (818) 798-0865 MARTIN ZIMMERMAN  </P></p>

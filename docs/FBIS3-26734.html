			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- The "State Council  Provisions on the Work Hours of Workers and Staff Members" have  been promulgated. The Labor and Personnel Ministries have  offered the following explanation regarding these "Provisions":    The provisions give workers and staff members more time to  study, educate their children, and attend to household chores.  They will surely further arouse the initiative of workers and  staff members in socialist construction, preserve and inspire  their enthusiasm for production, and increase their vitality in  production and construction. These provisions appropriately  shorten the work hours, scientifically and rationally schedule  work and rest hours, and carry great significance for protecting  the health of workers and staff members; for improving work  efficiency and labor productivity; for promoting better  management in organizations, enterprises, and institutions; and  for advancing the development of production.    There will be a unified system of work hours throughout the  country. The State Council "Provisions" apply to workers and  staff members in all organs, mass organizations, enterprises,  institutions, and other organizations in the PRC. Enterprises  include those under various single-mode or mixed economic  ownerships, such as state-owned, collectively owned, privately  run, individually run, and foreign-funded enterprises. They  also include mines; factories; and construction, communications  and transportation, logging, farming, commercial, and service  entities.    Our country used to implement special provisions regarding  the work hours of workers and staff members working under  extraordinary conditions and those whose circumstances were  special. For instance, the chemical industry implemented a  system consisting of "three work days and one day off," as well  as a system of six or seven work hours, for workers engaged in  operations involving toxic and harmful substances, based on the  distinctive aspects and conditions of production. Coal mines  implemented a four-shift system, consisting of six work hours  per shift, for operations in coal pits. The textile industry  implemented a system of "four shifts with three workers working  and one resting on each shift." Female workers and staff members  who had babies under one year old were given an hour for nursing  each work day. If the work hours of workers and staff members  working under extraordinary conditions or those whose  circumstances are special still need to be shortened  appropriately following the implementation of these provisions,  they should be handled according to relevant state provisions.    The work and rest hours of state organs and institutions  must  be unified. Beginning the day the "Provisions" are implemented,  rest days will fall on Saturday and Sunday in the first week and  on Sunday in the second week, with the cycle continuing  regardless of which month or year it is. This will facilitate  the normal operation of all endeavors in all sectors of society.  In light of their actual conditions, enterprises may make  provisions in accordance with the requirement for an average  44-hour work week consisting of eight hours each day. State  organs aside, hospitals, kindergartens, primary schools, and  units having a bearing on people's livelihoods must also unify  their work and rest hours. Therefore, we will unify the work and  rest hours of both institutions and state organs. Although  workers and staff members in the civil aviation and railway  sectors may work for more than eight hours each day, their  average work week will not exceed 44 hours.    In implementing the "Provisions," all units should  strengthen  management, strictly enforce discipline, and strive to tap their  potential to ensure the completion of their production tasks and  work without increasing personnel and spending. They should not  let the implementation of the 44-hour work week affect their  normal operations and economic performance; nor should they  reduce the salaries of their workers and staff members. No  enterprise or individual may extend the work hours of their  workers and staff members without authorization. We should  remedy the practice of fulfilling production tasks through  overtime. If special circumstances and urgent tasks require the  extension of work hours for workers and staff members, we should  follow relevant state provisions. All social service units --  such as commercial, catering, public transportation, postal and  telecommunications, and transportation units -- must consider  people's interests in rescheduling production and work hours.  They should take effective measures to solve problems arising  from such rescheduling, and create more convenient living and  working conditions for people. Labor and personnel departments  all levels should supervise and inspect progress in implementing  the "Provisions." If the "Provisions" are violated, they should  mete out punishment in accordance with relevant provisions.</p>

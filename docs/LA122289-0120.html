			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> U.S. Memories Signs License Pact: International Business Machines will license  its 4-megabyte dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip manufacturing  capabilities to U.S. Memories, a proposed consortium that plans to produce  semiconductors. The deal, which was expected, represents the third hurdle that  the venture had to clear before it could begin operating. Earlier, the venture  developed a business plan and received assurances that the plan does not  violate antitrust laws. However, the final condition -- getting sufficient  participation and financial support from American chip makers -- still remains.  </P></p>

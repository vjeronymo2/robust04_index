			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Heavy provisions leave Bredero with net liabilities SWINGEING provisions against a Hammersmith office development have pushed Bredero Properties, the development company that is 49 per cent owned by Slough Estates, into a 1992 pre-tax loss of Pounds 106.4m. The loss, which compares with a 1991 loss of Pounds 4.5m, means that the company now has net liabilities of Pounds 24.6m, compared with net assets of Pounds 82m at the end of 1991. Net liabilities per share were 94p (net assets of 196p). The figures have been prepared on a going concern basis. The dividend is again passed and there is no payment on the preference shares for the last six months of 1992. The company is still negotiating a restructuring of its Pounds 110.6m of debt with its banks, led by Barclays. It has reached an agreement in principle for the refinancing of its Centre West project in Hammersmith, which is financed by a syndicate of 12 banks. 'A successful conclusion to this refinancing would significantly improve the underlying financial position of the Group and restore shareholders' funds to a positive position,' the company said. Slough Estates has given a guarantee to London Transport to complete the Centre West scheme if Bredero is unable to do so. Centre West, a 225,000 sq ft office and retail development of which 80,000 sq ft has been sold to Coca-Cola for Pounds 30m, accounted for Pounds 77.68m of the Pounds 105.07m of exceptional charges. Part of this relates to an agreement to take over responsibility for a 13-year lease on Coca-Cola's former offices. Exceptionals also included a Pounds 21.5m provision against the carrying value of other assets, principally development sites, a Pounds 3.88m loss on the disposal of the Bon Accord Centre and a Pounds 2m provision for refinancing costs. The announcement pushed Bredero's share price down from 12p to 7 1/2 p. The company incurred a loss before exceptional items of Pounds 1.37m, against a profit Pounds 2.02m. Turnover was Pounds 70.8m (Pounds 53.3m) and losses per share worked through at 292.7p (13.1p).</p>

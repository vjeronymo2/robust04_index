			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister </F> Haris Silajdzic in Vienna by Nermin Karamehmedovic in Sarajevo  on 14 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Karamehmedovic] Mr. Silajdzic, let me first greet  you, and then ask you to assess the developments in Vienna.    [Silajdzic] As you know, the draft constitution has been  completed. The constitution is based on the international  subjectivity and integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so this is an  issue of an internal transformation of the constitutional  organization. The constitutional solutions remain open to the  third side, as does the entire peace process. These are the  main points. I can say that the proposed solutions are based on  the well-known democratic solutions and the guarantees of the  highest standards of human rights, including the collective,  individual, and ethnic rights.    The constitution establishes a federation with the usual  competencies and the manner of decisionmaking that guarantees  the principles of national equality and the influence of the  democratic and multiparty political system. The agreement and  the constitution imply the mechanisms of integrating  Bosnia-Herzegovina into the integration processes, domestic and  international guarantees of human rights and, if I may stress,  particular stress is placed on human rights in this document,  that is, human rights follow immediately after the establishment  of the federation. Why? We believe, all of us here, that the  case of Bosnia-Herzegovina is a case of an unprecedented  violation of human rights. That means that we have to get used  to the fact that human rights are not just an appendage, but  rather the main point. We all have to get used to that. We  have to try and live by that. All the people, all the  individuals, on the territory of the federation enjoy the right  to life, to freedom, to equality before the law, to no  discrimination based on race, creed, language, political  beliefs, and so on. All the people have the right to privacy,  to freedom of movement, to asylum, to property, to the  fundamental freedoms, the freedom of speech, the freedom of  press, the freedom of thought, consciousness, belief, religion,  and so on. These are the fundamental freedoms that we will try  and apply in reality. They are of course on paper in this  document. I would like to stress that. The rest is practically  technical stuff.    [Karamehmedovic] You stated yesterday that this document,  this agreement, is an important step toward the global solution  to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The next step [words indistinct] is an  attempt to try and get the Serb side to join the agreement in  some form. Are you an optimist in that respect?    [Silajdzic] I must say that I am not. The statements issued  by the representatives of the aggressor's side so far do not  seem to indicate that they are willing to join this process. We  of course wish they would, but if one is to base one's  conclusion on the statements that we have heard, then (?that  will not be the case).    [Karamehmedovic] Finally, there was an announcement that  perhaps next weekend the official signing of the documents could  take place, with President Alija Izetbegovic of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, and Croatian President Franjo  Tudjman. Do you think it could happen within this announced  deadline?    [Silajdzic] Yes, Presidents Izetbegovic and Tudjman would  sign the documents concerning the intention to form a  confederation, that is, on the international level, and the  documents concerning the constitution of the federation. I  think that could happen on the 18th [of March], that is, on the  set date.</p>

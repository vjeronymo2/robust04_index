			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Choe Kwang, member of the Workers' Party of Korea </F> Central Committee Political Bureau and chief of Staff of the  Korean People's Army, to the central report meeting marking the  first anniversary of the appointment of Kim Chong-il as chairman  of the DPRK National Defense Committee held at the 8 February  cultural hall in Pyongyang -- live]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] A tense situation in which a  war may break out anytime prevails in our country at present  because of the vicious antisocialist, anti-Republic maneuvers by  the U.S. imperialists and other international reactionary forces.    The U.S. imperialists, who had broken up [patan] the third  round of DPRK-U.S. talks, had the UN Security Council release  the president's statement, which makes unjustifiable  [tangchiannun] demands on us, and are more openly maneuvering to  crush [apsal] us.    Moreover, the U.S. imperialists are more frantically kicking  up commotions for military pressure, while saying that they  would resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise and that  they would not hesitate to wage another Korean war.    In step with them, the puppet South Korean clique intends to  stage the nuclear war exercise against us at all cost and  babbles that it would offer punitive retaliation [ungjing pobok]  against us and use this as an opportunity to achieve  reunification if it is necessary.    The South Korean puppets put all the puppet armed forces on  special alert and even made public a dangerous new plan to  invade the North.    Teaming up with the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppets, the Japanese reactionaries, as well, got more deeply  involved in the maneuvers to ignite a fuse to a new war on the  South Korean peninsula. [sentence as heard]    All facts show that the maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists  and other reactionaries to isolate and crush [apsal] our  republic have reached their extreme and that, as a result, a war  may break out on the Korean peninsula anytime.    However, any maneuver by the enemy cannot frighten our  people  and the People's Army, under the outstanding leadership of the  great commander [yongjang].    If the bastards ignite a fuse to a war after all, our people  and the People's Army, filled with a firm resolve to share the  same destiny with the party, will resolutely tackle them head on  and mercilessly sweep out [mujabihage ssuroborilgut] the enemy.  [applause]    Responding to the use of force with force and dialogue with  dialogue is our firm will and policy [himenun himuro taehwaenun  taehwaro tappyonhanun kossi uriui hwakko pudonghan uijiimyo  chongchaegimnida].    The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys must not  miscalculate  [osan] our firm will and policy and act with discretion after  clearly seeing the trend of the times.    All the people and People's Army officers and men must  vigorously wage the struggle to reliably defend the socialist  fatherland and the revolutionary gains from the enemy's  infringement [chimhae], build the country's defensive forces  impregnable, and strengthen the People's Army into an invincible  revolutionary army.

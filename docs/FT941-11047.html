			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Arafat-Peres Cairo meeting in balance Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, was yesterday considering whether to go ahead with today's planned meeting in Cairo between his foreign minister, Mr Shimon Peres, and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman. Mr Rabin and Mr Peres have denied they are at loggerheads over the negotiations, but Mr Peres' aides have leaked reports that the foreign minister is frustrated at the army's intervention in the negotiating process. Mr Peres was due to meet Mr Rabin last night to decide the strategy for the Cairo talks. If Mr Peres goes to Cairo today, political experts say he will have Mr Rabin's mandate to settle an agreement at least on the remaining security issues and therefore ensure Mr Arafat's participation. Mr Arafat has said he would not attend the Cairo talks unless there were prospects for the signing of a long-delayed agreement providing for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho. Negotiations with the PLO are at a delicate stage. A draft agreement reached between Mr Peres and Mr Arafat in Switzerland last weekend has raised objections from the Israeli army. Senior officers have insisted Israel must maintain absolute control of security at the border crossings between Egypt and Gaza and between Jordan and Jericho. They also want total control over lateral roads leading to the Jewish settlements in Gaza and over the safe passages granted to the Palestinians. Some cabinet ministers, including Ms Ora Namir, the welfare minister, yesterday criticised the influence of the army on the peace process. Mr Rabin recently said there was no hurry in reaching a final agreement and he would only be ready to sign once all issues were resolved. Mr Haim Ramon, the politician most favoured by Israelis to succeed Mr Yitzhak Rabin as Labour prime minister, yesterday resigned from the cabinet over a row about health insurance policy. The resignation means Mr Rabin carries responsibility as prime minister, defence minister and acting minister of health, the interior and religious affairs. He will have to find a way of keeping Mr Ramon, a spokesman of the reform wing of the Labour party, in the government.</p>

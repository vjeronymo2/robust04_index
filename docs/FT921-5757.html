			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Turkey struggles to make sense of trade with CIS republics: Some euphoria has evaporated SOME of the euphoria with which Turkish business greeted the dissolution of Soviet Union is evaporating as officials struggle to make sense of the new trade relations with the emerging republics. For all the talk of new regional banks, both a Black Sea Bank and a Central Asian Bank have been mooted, Turkey's Eximbank has currently suspended all guarantees on credits to the new republics. Turkey's 20-year gas protocol with the Soviet Union, first agreed in 1984, must now be renegotiated, though with whom is unclear. Gas proceeds have underpinned Turkish-Soviet trade which in 1990 was worth Dollars 1.7bn.( Pounds 970m). But Turkey feels it has a headstart in the former Soviet republics, especially the Turkish-speaking Central Asian states, as a trade conduit for western companies, and a political counterweight to Iran. 'To go with a Turkish company is going to be the only way to do business in these republics,' one Turkish industrialist said. Turkey this month initialled a broad agreement with the eight states around the Black Sea to co-ordinate policy on the environment, infrastructure and transport. In Tehran last month, Turkey, Iran and Pakistan met to revive the 27-year-old Economic Co-operation Organisation (ECO), welcoming Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan as new members. Turkey is well placed to arrange offtake deals, using the republics' natural resources as collateral for trade financing, similar to the Soviet gas pipeline. But the current coal and oil dispute between Russia and Ukraine underlines the need for agreement between the republics on distribution of raw materials. Commodity trading may give Turkey some business; in the longer term, with the shortage of foreign exchange, Turkish traders will have to look at barter deals. Interbank, a privately-owned Istanbul bank, has set up a countertrade operation with Kaukomarkkinat of Finland. Turkish companies have little countertrade experience and without foreign partners, may be limited to dealing in commodities they can sell in the domestic Turkish market. Turkish groups have made use of western aid credits. Enka, for example, has built military housing for Soviet troops returning from former East Germany. A new channel for Turkish groups will be to bid on World Bank and other multilateral agency projects, using this experience. But the picture remains unclear as long as western banks are unable to agree settlement on the Dollars 60bn (Pounds 34.2bn) of outstanding Soviet debt, set as the key pre-condition for the republics to join the Bank or the IMF. Clearly, finance will remain the main obstacle, at a time of mounting budget problems at home. Turkey's proposal for new regional banks is dismissed as little more than a political gesture to the new republics. 'Setting up a new bank is not going to work if an appetite for doing business does not exist,' says a London-based trade finance specialist. Mr Melih Araz, head of Interbank, says the private sector is unlikely to want to put in equity. 'The state has to chip in.' One western official familiar with China in the 1970s, said companies may find a similar trade environment. Unlike Russia and the Ukraine, the Turkic republics have still to tackle the issue of price controls, private land ownership or private enterprise, and have no banking infrastructure. Western officials are worried the first step taken by the poorer Central Asian republics may be to raise tariffs to protect themselves. In the short term, trade with neighbouring Black Sea republics seems likely to slow. Gas proceeds, 70 per cent of which had to be used to buy Turkish goods under 'best effort' terms, are now in Russian hands. Armenia may offer best short-term business prospects, attracting funds from the Armenian diaspora in the US and Europe. Mr Ishak Alaton, head of Alarko Holdings, was in Ankara this week seeking government approval for a Dollars 20m project to rebuild Trabzon Port, using US Armenian money. The project would provide a land route to the Black Sea for the central Asian republics.</p>

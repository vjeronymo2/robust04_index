			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, June 28, RIA -- Latvia's President Guntis  Ulmanis and the government of that Baltic republic have agreed  to return the citizenship law, passed by the Latvian parliament  on June 21, to the legislature for amendment, Latvian Prime  Minister Valdis Birkavs said in a televised statement on night.  "We shall not allow the Latvian people to perish because of the  citizenship law," he said. "We shall not allow this law to bar  our way to Europe, the only place where Latvia can survive."    A special working group has been formed to amend the act.  According to Mr. Birkavs, it is working on the formulas that  will make Latvia's national interests compatible with the  requirements of international organisations, especially the  Council of Europe. The principle of quotas in granting  citizenship is expected to be replaced by some other conditions  for naturalisation. Specifically, the prime minister said that  harsher language requirements will be made to the claimants for  Latvian citizenship and a strict procedure will be established  for naturalisation of non-citizens.    The amendments worked out by the working group will be  submitted to the parliament, which is on holiday since june 23  and is expected to resume its sessions right after U.S.  President Bill Clinton's visit to Latvia on July 6.</p>

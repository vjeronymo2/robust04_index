			<p>BFN     [Text] Xian, June 14 (XINHUA) -- The number of China's  cities has almost doubled over the past decade, a momentum  keeping pace with the country's rapid economic growth.    This was reported by the China City Development Society,  which has just closed its third session in this capital of  northwest China's Shaanxi Province.    By the end of 1993 China had 570 cities, a 97-percent  increase from 1983.    In 1993 three out of ten Chinese lived in cities, while ten  years ago less than two were urban residents.    Now 59 percent of the total national product and more than  three-quarters of the state revenues come from cities.    The mix of big, medium and small cities has emerged as a  more  balanced combination assisting the social development.    Liu Guoguang, and director of the society, said that the  process of urbanization is driven by China's reform and opening  up.    When China's economy rocketed at a double-digit growth rate  from 1992 to 1993, some 45 new cities sprang up a year. While  for two decades before reform only one city emerged every year  and a half. [sentence as received]    This phenomenon was also complicated by the regional  discrepancy of economic development in China.    Rising in the fast-growing eastern and central areas, the  tide of newly emerging cities slows as it reaches the relatively  backward western parts of the country.    Between 1983 and 1993, the number of cities in the eastern  areas increased from 103 to 247; in central China, from 122 to  215; and in the western region, from 64 to 108.    Liu, also a leading economist, said that the development of  cities will promote science and technology and improve  efficiency, thereby quickening economic growth.    Experts present at the meeting said that a number of China's  big cities will emerge early in the next century as  international metropolises, including Beijing, Shanghai,  Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xian, Wuhan and Dalian.</p>

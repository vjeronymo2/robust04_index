			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Healthy signs at Czech power group Ceske Energeticke Zavody (CEZ), the partially-privatised Czech energy group and one of the country's largest companies, expects pre-tax profits of Kcs18.5bn (Dollars 620m) for 1993, according to preliminary figures. Operating revenues are expected to be Kcs49bn, against expenditures of Kcs30.5bn. There are no comparable figures for 1992. CEZ is one of the most popular stocks on the Czech market, and considered a blue-chip investment by foreign analysts. Investment funds and individual investors secured 33 per cent of the company's stock during the the first wave of voucher privatisation, completed shortly before last summer. Another tranche of shares will be sold this year within the second round of voucher privatisation. The National Property Fund (NPF), an institution established to oversee privatisations and manage the state's shareholdings, still holds 67 per cent of CEZ's share capital. However, Mr Tomas Jezek, NPF chairman, recently suggested it may reduce its stake to 51 per cent this year. CEZ has a quasi monopoly of power generation in the Czech Republic - there are a few small power plants run by municipalities - with no significant competitor on the domestic market. It has large investment plans to modernise production and improve environmental controls. Since trading began in July, the price of CEZ shares has risen dramatically, from Kcs645 per share to Kcs2,050 at the close on last Thursday's session of the Prague stock exchange. (The exchange has two sessions a week, on Tuesday and Thursday.) At that price, the company's market value would be about Kcs102bn. Since 1992, the company has spent Dollars 50m from a World Bank loan to help finance desulphurisation at several power plants. Investment this year is expected to be Kcs30bn, with Kcs8bn spent on desulphurisation, and about Kcs11bn on completing the nuclear power plant at Temelin, in southern Bohemia. Last year, CEZ exported electricity worth Kcs1.5bn, mainly to Italy and Austria.</p>

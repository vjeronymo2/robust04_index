			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Menem begins long campaign for re-election: A split opposition boosts his chances A week is a long time in politics but, when it comes to Argentine election campaigns, six months is not considered overlong. Nearly half a year before next May's presidential elections, Mr Carlos Menem last weekend officially launched his re-election bid at a huge rally of Peronist faithful on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. President Menem, having earlier this year engineered constitutional reforms enabling him to seek a second term, has now begun the process of ensuring four more years in office. To win outright he needs 45 per cent of the vote, or more than 40 per cent provided he is 10 points clear of the next candidate. The president's aspirations, which had been dulled earlier in the year by sagging popularity and the gathering strength of the opposition Frente Grande coalition, received a shot in the arm last month when fellow Peronist Governor Eduardo Duhalde scored an important victory in the province of Buenos Aires. Mr Duhalde, mirroring Mr Menem's constitutional tinkering, won 61 per cent of electoral support in a plebiscite proposing that he be allowed to stand again as governor. Although Mr Duhalde's win may have owed as much to his personal style of leadership as to general approval for the Peronist national agenda, Mr Menem was quick to claim the victory as his own. 'This is a vote for my government's model,' he said. Mr Menem's claim was partially endorsed by a recent opinion poll suggesting he would win the forthcoming election, without the need of a second-round run-off, by polling nearly 44 per cent of the vote, against 20 per cent each for the Frente Grande and Radicals. Just as Mr Menem sought to take credit for the governor's victory, so too has his party been keen to scotch rumours of a power struggle between the president and Mr Duhalde, who has made no secret of his presidential aspirations in 1999. Mr Duhalde is considered more of an old-fashioned populist and is thought to dislike aspects of the government's economic restructuring policies. He has made several calls for a return to 'the politics of work', an implied criticism of unemployment, which now exceeds 10 per cent. But any signs of discord within the governing party are outweighed by the bitter infighting of the opposition, the two most important sectors of which  -the Radicals and the Frente Grande - will nominate their presidential candidates on Sunday. The Radical party, the traditional counter to Peronism, has virtually split into two wings, represented by presidential hopefuls Mr Federico Storani and Mr Horacio Massaccesi. The two have fought a bruising pre-election campaign, with Mr Storani accusing his opponent of ideological capitulation to the governing Peronists. Mr Storani has hinted that, if nominated, he may be willing to forge an electoral pact with the Frente Grande coalition in order to mount a serious challenge to Mr Menem. The Radical party has lost much credibility as an opposition force since its leader, former President Raul Alfonsn, yielded to Mr Menem's wishes and supported the constitutional changes that may well deliver the Peronists a second presidential term. The Radicals are also remembered as the party whose government led to a period of hyper-inflation; Mr Alfonsn admitted recently that 'the economy exploded in our hands'. The void left by the Radicals has in part been filled by the Frente Grande, a centre-left coalition headed by Mr Carlos 'Chacho' Alvarez, a charismatic Peronist dissident. The Frente, which shot to prominence in April's constitutional assembly elections - when it defeated the Peronists in the federal capital of Buenos Aires - is the great hope of those wishing to unseat Mr Menem. But the Frente has also been racked by unseemly internal squabbles and may be losing ground. Mr Alvarez, partly in mind of the defeat in Brazil of Mr Lus Inacio Lula da Silva, is seeking to reposition himself in the camp of the moderate, electable, centre. But this stance has disenchanted the coalition's more radical contingent, part of which has broken off into a separate faction. Mr Rosendo Fraga, a political analyst, says the Frente has much to do if it is to persuade the electorate that it can risk a potentially destabilising change of government. Mr Fraga also believes that, to have any chance of success, the Frente will have to reach some sort of electoral alliance with the Radicals. For the moment the Peronists can afford to sit back in the hope that the opposition will self-destruct. Mr Menem does not enjoy the levels of popularity that he did a few years ago but, unless the opposition is able to rally behind a single flag, this is unlikely to prevent the president riding home to a second term.</p>

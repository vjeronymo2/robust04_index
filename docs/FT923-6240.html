			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Firmer bond prices help to steady Dow Wall Street AIDED BY a broadly stable dollar and a rally in bond prices, US stock markets held their ground yesterday after four days of heavy losses, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.05 at 3,232.22, having pulled back from an early 18-point decline. The more broadly based Stan-dard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, eventually finishing 0.89 firmer on the day at 411.61, but the American SE composite ended 1.38 off at 379.52 and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.17 at 554.22. Turnover on the New York SE came to 203m shares. The main influence on equity sentiment remained the dollar, and its effect on bond prices. After an early decline, the US currency managed to hold its ground above DM1.40. The lack of another dollar debacle boosted bond prices. With the rise in bond yields halted, stock market sentiment improved, and after some early losses triggered by computer sell programs, share prices climbed steadily back to positive territory in the morning. The day's only economic news, a fall in the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey for August, was brushed aside, even though the data suggested that the economy will remain sluggish for the rest of the summer and probably longer. Car manufacturers were heavily traded as the latest auto sales figures came out. General Motors eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 33 3/4 in turnover of 4.4m shares and Chrysler softened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 19 1/2 in volume of 1.9m - both were expected to report lower mid-August car sales but higher truck sales. Ford, however, added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 40 1/8 on news of a 28 per cent improvement in car sales. Two ADRs stood out: Telefonos de Mexico fell initially - as investors reacted to a decline in Mexican stocks on Monday - but recovered to end Dollars  1/8 up on balance at Dollars 43 5/8 on turnover of 2.7m; and UK food group Grand Metropolitan dropped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 30 after the company filed for a Dollars 600m issue of fixed-rate debt sec-urities and said 1992 pre-tax profits would be in line with a year ago. Insurers, heavily sold on Monday, remained a feature in the wake of the hurricane in south Florida which by yesterday afternoon was threatening to inflict heavy damage on the Louisiana coast and the city of New Orleans. Aetna edged Dollars  3/8 lower to Dollars 38 5/8 , Cigna eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 50 7/8 , Travelers firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 20 3/4 and Geico improved Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 57 1/4 . Deere &amp; Co shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 38 1/2 after the agricultural equipment manufacturer posted fiscal third-quarter net income of just 12 cents a share, down from 41 cents a share earned a year ago. The company also warned that the outlook for the rest of the year was uncertain. Canada THE FORTUNES of the US dollar kept Toronto stocks on a tight string during the day before the market closed slightly weaker after moderate trading. The TSE 300 index slipped 5.0 to 3,375.8 and declines outpaced advances by 282 to 241 after volume of 25.9m shares valued at CDollars 250.8m. Gold shares gave back about half of Monday's 2.4 per cent index gain, losing 1.23 per cent. Sears Canada said it will issue 10.5m common shares at CDollars 7.25 each, with Sears Roebuck agreeing to subscribe for one-half of the issue. The stock was off CDollars  5/8 at CDollars 7 1/8 on about 2.6m shares traded. Bank of Montreal, CDollars  1/4 firmer at CDollars 45 3/4, reported higher third-quarter and nine-month earnings.</p>

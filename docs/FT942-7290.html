			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / People: Noble: realistic with the actuality Skye Bridge Ltd, developer of the highly unpopular toll-bridge which next year will eliminate the ferry trip across the Kyle of Lochalsh to Skye in Scotland, has persuaded Sir Iain Noble, one of the project's most authoritative critics, to become its chairman. Noble, who is an Edinburgh merchant banker (he co-founded Noble Grossart and chairs Noble &amp; Co), owns an estate on Skye and is a Gaelic speaker, still thinks the bridge is a waste of the government's money on a non-essential project. Although Skye Bridge, a consortium of (the construction companies) Miller Group and Dywidag (of Germany) and Bank of America, is financing the bridge and will recoup the Pounds 17m construction cost from tolls, the Scottish Office is spending Pounds 6m on the connecting roads. 'The ferries are the most efficient and cheapest way of crossing to Skye,' says Sir Iain. 'The government will lose the profit which Caledonian Macbrayne makes on them, and about 30 ferrymen will lose their jobs. With tolls on the bridge the highest in Europe (Pounds 5 for a car), it's not surprising it's unpopular.' So why take on the job? 'You can't spend your life girning (moaning) about what's done,' says Noble. 'The bridge is now an actuality. What we must do is make it an important Skye-based business. Yes, I can imagine all the brickbats that will be thrown at me. But the tolls are set by parliament. People should work on their MPs to get them reduced or abolished.'</p>

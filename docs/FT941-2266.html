			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / People: Taking a chair in social housing Former Mercantile House chairman John Barkshire, who in the 1970s and 1980s was one of the City's more entrepreneurial figures, has taken on the chairmanship of Chaco Investments which is pioneering ways of attracting institutional finance into social housing. Chaco, a subsidiary of TR Property Investment Trust, was set up four years ago by Leon Clifton, 45, who had been helping finance inner city developments. Its name comes from Chaco Canyon in New Mexico where a group of Indians had pioneered community housing. The rapid growth of housing associations, and the cutback in government funding for social housing, has led to increasing calls for private sector funding to augment the resources provided by banks and building societies. Chaco's brief is to encourage the big investment institutions to start investing in social housing again after an absence of over 30 years caused by worries about rent controls and other financial restrictions. Chaco recently helped Scottish Amicable buy 500 housing association properties, worth Pounds 8m, from Coventry's CCHA Housing. It was the first time that an institution had taken an equity stake in housing association properties built before 1988 and was welcomed by the Housing Corporation, the government regulator. However, if Chaco is to do more deals of this type it needs access to a much bigger pool of institutional funds and the company is hoping that under John Barkshire's chairmanship its name will become better known in the City. Barkshire, 59, who sits on the boards of Sun Life, Savills, Household Mortgage Corporation, and TR Property Investment Trust, expects to appoint at least one more non-executive to the Chaco board. He has also not ruled out the possibility of widening Chaco's shareholder base at some stage. At the moment TR Property owns 90 per cent and Clifton owns 10 per cent.</p>

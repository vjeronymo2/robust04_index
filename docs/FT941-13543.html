			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Flotation expected to value MDIS at Pounds 250m McDonnell Information Systems, a computing services company based in Hemel Hempstead, is hoping to raise Pounds 150m through a long-anticipated full public offering now set for early March. The company will announce its plans today and publish its prospectus next month. Its merchant bankers are Baring Brothers and its stockbrokers are National Westminster Wood Mackenzie. The flotation is expected to value the company at about Pounds 250m. The funds will be used to pay down debt incurred when a group of investors led by Baring Capital Investors bought the company last year from McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace group. Mr Jeremy Causley, chief executive, and 16 of the company's senior managers were involved in the buy-out. The value of the deal has not been disclosed but according to Acquisitions Monthly, which tracks merger and acquisition activity, it was closed for a consideration of about Pounds 120m and a total deal package of about Pounds 160m. Mr Causley said yesterday that the rationale behind the flotation was the creation of a debt-free group with the stamp of approval which accrues to a successful public company. He was concerned that lack of a listing might be hampering the group's progress, especially in bidding for large contracts. MDIS's non-executive chairman is Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Storehouse and Newspaper Publishing and Sir Terry Heiser, former permanent secretary at the Department of the Environment is a non-executive director. Last year's buy-out created one of the largest UK-owned information technology groups with specific skills in software and services for central and local government, the police, libraries and health care. It employs some 1,800 people, 1,300 of them in the UK. For the six months to June 30, pre-tax profits were Pounds 5.2m on revenue of Pounds 66.5m. MDIS traditionally performs better in the second half of the year and for the full year operating profits are expected to be Pounds 22m, up 16 per cent on the previous year, on revenues of Pounds 148m. Mr Causley said two key decisions had been crucial to the company's development. First, the decision in the early 1980s to concentrate on niche markets. MDIS now supplies, for example, information systems to two thirds of the UK's police forces and was the first to meet the specifications for the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System (Holmes). The system, called Micah, is now used in the UK in major incidents such as murder and rape investigations and has been sold to police forces in Australia, Hong Kong and the US. The company has also supplied computer systems to 85 government organisations and to 170 local authorities. Second, the decision in 1988 to get out of hardware manufacture, leaving the company free to develop open or industry standard systems using hardware from a variety of suppliers. The company also markets a software system called PRO-IV designed to make the writing computer programs easier and faster. It has signed a worldwide distribution agreement for the system with Fujitsu of Japan, the world's second largest information technology group.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Santa Cruz de la Sierra] </F>   [Excerpts] Government Minister German Quiroga today held a  news conference to inform the public about the arrest of Isaac  Chavarria Diez de Medina during a special operation by the  Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) on 25 and 26 January.  Quiroga also reported that 21 other people, who allegedly are  members of one of the largest drug trafficking rings in the  country, also were taken into custody as a result of this drug  enforcement operation. The minister noted that this constitutes  a mortal blow to a gang that has been operating in Bolivia and  other countries since the mid-70's thanks to the support of  Colombian drug cartels. The gang led by Chavarria was not only  engaged in selling thousands of kilograms of illegal drugs but  also the laundering of millions of U.S. dollars.    Moreover, Meco Domingez' cooperation with police since he  was  arrested by police last December on drug trafficking charges  played a decisive role as it enabled police to arrest these 22  people. [passage omitted]    Chavarria's gang turned over 500 kg of drugs every  fortnight.  It is believed that the drug was processed in sophisticated  laboratories located in some forested regions in El Beni  Department. [passage omitted]    During this operation--called Endless--the FELCN conducted a  mass roundup of alleged drug traffickers and seized 14  properties and a large number of weapons, including rifles,  shotguns, machine guns, grenades, and three radio transmitters.  The names of the members of Chavarria's gang are: Alcides  Isaac Chavarria Diez de Medina, top leader of the gang; Arturo  Chavarria Catacora; Julia Saucedo de Chavarria, Alcides Isaac  Chavarria's wife; Ilarion (Eigua Cordoba; Cristobal Salazar  Cortez; Elmer Gutierrez (Nosti); Walter Velazco Eguez; Andres  (Piso) Soto; Manuel Mercado Pammo; Fernando Anez Rojas; Eduardo  Salvatierra Saavedra; Juan Saca (Adiran); Desiderio Rojas Cejas;  Marta Cortez Salazar; and Isabel (Sanz) Roca, who were taken  into custody at San Bonifacio ranch in El Beni Department.  Other members, namely Miguel Alberto Losada Anez, Hugo Munoz  Leanos, Juan Carlos (Peredo) Paz, Miguel Benquique, (Castulio)  Salcedo, Elio Claros Rocha, and Julia Rodriguez were arrested in  Santa Cruz de la Sierra.

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DONATIONS OF LEFTOVER FOOD HIT A SNAG;  </P> <P> HOTELS SAY HEALTH LAWS, INSURANCE PREVENT REDISTRIBUTION  </P> <P> In a land of excess, Bryna Monsein thinks her story has particular relevance.  </P> <P> Recently, the Bethesda, Md., resident decided to donate the leftovers from her  daughter's wedding reception at downtown Washington's Mayflower Hotel to the  Community for Creative Non-Violence, a homeless advocacy group.  </P> <P> "Wonderful food," she says. "Blackened sirloin, shrimp scampi, chicken piccata,  wonderful pasta."  </P> <P> But the Mayflower, fearing it would be liable if anyone became ill, refused.  </P> <P> "I was really sad," she says. "To think of all that food going into the garbage  was just pitiful."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Common Concerns  </P> <P> But not unusual. A number of local hotels, citing health regulations, insurance  and public relations concerns, refuse to redistribute food they haven't served.  Still, caterers, who would presumably have the same concerns, have earned a  reputation for being generous with their clients' extra food.  </P> <P> "Somehow caterers have been more sensitized than hotels and restaurants," says  Carol Fennelly of CCNV.  </P> <P> Hotel managers say it is not a question of sensitivity.  </P> <P> "Once food is dispensed, at no time could it be given away," says Paul J.  Sacco, general manager of the Omni Shoreham Hotel. "Health laws would dictate  that you would not be able to reissue it."  </P> <P> Sacco's opinion was echoed by other hotel managers, but, according to Sidney  Hall, chief of food protection for the District of Columbia's Department of  Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, "There are no such regulations." Hall says  hotels can donate food to charity "so long as the food is wholesome and has not  been used by former patrons."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reasoning May Not Hold  </P> <P> But Kevin McPhee, director of food and beverages at the Mayflower, insists that  the hotel is legally liable for the food it prepares.  </P> <P> "It is not a question of donating food. We donate food. But donating food that  has already been prepared for another purpose, that is another question," he  says. "Particularly hot food. If it has to be reheated it is exposed to  potential bacteria. We're very careful about these things. We have that  liability."  </P> <P> But Fennelly says hotels are protected from liability for food "donated in good  faith" by "Good Samaritan" laws in the District of Columbia and neighboring  Maryland and Virginia.  </P> <P> Still, some catering directors, like Brent Ashton at the Omni Shoreham, are  wary of "loopholes in the law."  </P> <P> Hall, the food protection chief, says the only condition he is aware of is that  food be "transported in the proper vehicle . . . Hot food must be kept hot.  Cold food cold."  </P> <P> Fennelly characterizes the hotels' position as "baloney . . . They can do it if  they choose to. A lot of restaurants use it as an excuse not to give food  away."  </P> <P> "I think a lot of the hotels couldn't necessarily be bothered," says the Rev.  John Adams of So Others May Eat, an ecumenical food agency. "It's certainly not  against the law."  </P> <P> Bryna Monsein, who doesn't want others to repeat her experience, has sought  legal recourse. Her attorney, Earl Colson, has written a letter that he hopes  will serve as the basis for future agreements between hotels and relief  agencies. In it, a charity acknowledges "that we have received the food in good  condition," and promises "to refrigerate and otherwise keep the food in a  sanitary condition suitable for consumption."  </P> <P> The agency agrees to release the hotel "from any claim that may arise because  of your having supplied this food." And also promises to "indemnify you against  any claim made by any homeless person to whom we have provided portions of this  food."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legal Until Proven Otherwise  </P> <P> "It will stand up in court" as a contract, Colson says. "Whether a hotel will  say, 'Oh, that does it,' and contribute the food, I don't know."  </P> <P> Kevin McPhee of the Mayflower says he has seen similar documents before. "What  I don't know is, if tested, would it hold?"  </P> <P> In lieu of a test, Monsein recommends a client investigate a hotel's donation  policy before booking an event.  </P> <P> "My feeling is, if people knew about it, they would make these arrangements in  the beginning," she says. "All it involves is saying, 'Will you please?' "  </P></p>

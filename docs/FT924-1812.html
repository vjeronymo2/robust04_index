			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lower exceptionals help reduce losses at YJ Lovell YJ LOVELL (Holdings), the Buckinghamshire-based housebuilder and property developer which recently negotiated a three year loan agreement with its bankers, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 12.2m for the year to September 30, compared to a Pounds 20.3m loss in the previous 12 months. The losses, which amounted to Pounds 23.7m (Pounds 47.6m) at the retained level, came on turnover which declined 24 per cent to Pounds 276.9m (Pounds 363m) reflecting extremely depressed trading conditions in the UK construction and housing markets. Losses per share were 13.7p (22.6p), and the final dividend is again omitted. The share price dropped  1/2 p to 10p after the announcement. Profit after interest payments of Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 6.67m) but before exceptional items fell by 56 per cent to Pounds 2.26m (Pounds 5.09m). Construction operations, excluding plant hire, remained profitable as did partnership house building where 1,845 units were completed, up from 1,774 last time. Exceptional losses of Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 25.4m) comprised a further Pounds 9m in property write-downs, group restructuring costs of Pounds 2.67m including redundancy payments, and the Pounds 2.75m costs incurred in renegotiating the bank facilities earlier this year. Below the line extraordinary losses before taxation were Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 36.1m). These additional provisions were needed because of the continued reduction of values in some of the group's businesses, many of which are in the process of being discontinued. Mr Bob Sellier, chief executive, acknowledged that Lovell has 'a lot of problems,' but he said 'we have faced up to them and we are working through them realistically.' n He said particular attention is being paid to cash flow management. During the latest period the group showed a net inflow of Pounds 11.3m. As a result, net debt on the balance sheet fell to Pounds 55.2m (Pounds 66.6m). Off balance sheet there was a further Pounds 45m of borrowings at the year-end. Shareholders funds fell to Pounds 45.5m (Pounds 70.4m), reflecting the consolidation of the business.</p>

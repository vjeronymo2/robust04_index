			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / International Company News: Coup puts bank on top down under  -NAB's acquisitive streak may not have been satisfied by its takeover of the troubled Bank of New Zealand Mr Don Argus, managing director of National Australia Bank (NAB), is doing his best not to look smug this week after pulling off a coup which makes NAB the biggest bank in Australia and New Zealand. Mr Argus has good reason to be pleased. NAB was roundly criticised during the 1980s for failing to take part in the scramble for domestic asset growth which accompanied the disastrous antipodean entrepreneurial boom. Instead, Mr Argus and his Melbourne-based colleagues concentrated on reducing costs and expanding overseas, principally through careful acquisitions in the UK and Ireland. NAB's latest overseas move, the NZDollars 1.48bn (USDollars 800m) purchase of the troubled Bank of New Zealand (BNZ), announced on Tuesday, has been widely hailed as a deal which offers multiple benefits to all parties. New Zealand's conservative government has disposed of an embarrassing liability inherited from the previous Labour government, which was forced to rescue the BNZ in 1988 after it faced collapse under a mountain of entrepreneurial debt. Fay, Richwhite, the New Zealand merchant bank which oiled the wheels of the rescue by taking a 27 per cent stake in BNZ, will emerge from what looked like an embarrassing mistake by breaking even on the deal. But the real winner is NAB, which becomes the largest player in an important regional market at a cost of some NZDollars 200m less than it was prepared to pay five years ago, when it emerged that a rescue of some kind was inevitable. Characteristically, the ultra-cautious NAB management has insisted on an eight-week delay in completion of the deal while it conducts a detailed examination of the BNZ books. The purpose of the delay is to ensure that there are no unexpected holes in the accounts, particularly in the area of non-performing loans and the valuation of the property portfolio. However, the accounting checks are unlikely to turn up much that has escaped NAB's accountants in the five years since the bank began stalking BNZ. In addition, the deal limits NAB's exposure to potential taxation, litigation and property revaluation losses to 15.7 per cent of any liability beyond BNZ's existing provisions. The real significance of the deal is that it confirms NAB's position as the biggest and best of Australia's four leading banks, in terms of both assets and management quality. The addition of BNZ's assets of NZDollars 19.8bn (ADollars 14.5bn) will increase NAB's global assets to ADollars 109.6bn (USDollars 81.7bn), putting it ahead of Westpac Banking Corporation with ADollars 107.5bn and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) with ADollars 99.2bn. Commonwealth Bank, the government-controlled bank which was part-privatised last year, has assets of just under ADollars 90bn. Moreover, NAB has weathered recession and the shake-out from the 1980s better than its rivals, mainly because of tighter control of costs and margins, and its pursuit of the home loans market rather than riskier commercial lending. As a result, NAB has been able to get on top of its bad debt problems more quickly than its competitors, enabling it to eliminate losses in domestic commercial and finance lending. NAB recently reported net profits of ADollars 405.6m for the six months to March, which compared with ADollars 135.5m at ANZ and a loss of ADollars 1.67bn at Westpac, after bad debt write-offs of ADollars 2.65bn. NAB has been helped by the contribution to earnings from its subsidiaries in the UK and Ireland - Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank, Northern Bank and National Irish Bank - all of which were acquired in the last five years. The contribution has declined in line with recession in the UK and Ireland from 45 per cent of net profits in the first half of 1990-91 to 31 per cent in the first half of the current year. However, analysts say the decline in European earnings should be reversed when the economy recovers. Overseas earnings are likely to be be lifted by efficiency gains as NAB brings the expenses of its European subsidiaries into line with the lower levels achieved in Australia. The acquisition of BNZ increases NAB's overseas assets from 43 per cent of total assets to 51 per cent, giving it a significantly larger overseas investment than either ANZ, at 34 per cent, or Westpac, at 36 per cent. NAB confirmed after the announcement of the BNZ deal that it remains interested in further overseas acquisitions, particularly in the US or the south of the UK, where it is unrepresented. The bank's capital adequacy ratio will fall from 11.7 per cent to 10.1 per cent following the BNZ acquisition, but remains well above the 8 per cent level required by the Reserve Bank of Australia. This would allow Mr Argus to make one or more small acquisitions without returning to the markets for fresh capital. But analysts suggest NAB may have something more exciting in mind in the medium term. The most unexpected development of the last few years has been the relegation of Westpac, once Australia's undisputed leading bank, to the bottom of the Australasian banking league. The decline, mainly caused by Westpac's rapid accumulation of poor quality assets in the 1980s, has caused the group's market capitalisation to fall from more than ADollars 7bn to just over ADollars 4bn. By contrast, NAB's strong performance has lifted its market valuation to more than ADollars 9bn, making it Australia's second largest company after Broken Hill Propriety (BHP). NAB is known to have considered bidding for both Westpac and ANZ, valued at just over ADollars 4m, but has been prevented by the ruling Labor government's policy of preventing mergers between Australia's six leading financial institutions. That policy will disappear if, as seems increasingly likely, the opposition conservatives win the next federal election, due by mid-1993. If that happens, NAB may need to raise fresh capital, but there seems little to prevent a bid for one of its rivals. That would nearly double its asset base and create an Australian banking group of global importance.  -------------------------------------------------------------- AUSTRALIA'S LEADING BANKS (ADOLLARS BN)  --------------------------------------------------------------                                      NAB    Westpac    ANZ  -------------------------------------------------------------- Total assets                        109.6*   107.3    99.2 Interim net profit/(loss)           405.6   (1,067)  135.5 Non-performing loans                 4.25     8.19    3.53 As % of risk weighted assets          5.4     10.6     4.5 Capital adequacy ratio (%)             10*     8.4    10.8  -------------------------------------------------------------- *Includes BNZ  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

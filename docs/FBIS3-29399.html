The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "the  cut was made in consideration of the domestic economy and I  think it's an appropriate measure.    "It will have a good effect on the European economy as  well,"  the source said.    The Bundesbank announced it will reduce the discount rate to  5.25 percent from 5.75 percent, effective Friday, while leaving  the Lombard emergency financing rate unchanged at 6.75 percent.    The move will have "no particular impact on Japan's  financial  policy," the source added.</p>

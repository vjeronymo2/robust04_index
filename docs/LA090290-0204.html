			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: PETER FALK'S PRIZE-WINNING TOMATOES  </P> <P> It's hard to imagine Peter Falk on TV without that rumpled raincoat and nasty  old cigar. But he did have a prime time on television long before "Columbo."  </P> <P> His first Emmy-winning work-for "Price of Tomatoes," a 1962 episode of the  anthology series The Dick Powell Show-can be seen Saturday at 3 p.m. on KDOC.  </P> <P> Falk plays Aristide Fresco, a partner in his father's produce firm and the  opposite of the thoughtful, slow-talking Lt. Columbo. Fresco talks-or  yells-first and thinks later.  </P> <P> And he's got a lot to think about-a truckload of Mexican tomatoes that will  make him thousands of dollars if he can get them to Cincinnati and beat the  competition. He's got a good head start in Texas, until he gives a lift to a  pregnant Romanian (Inger Stevens) who's illegally in the United States but  determined that her baby be born in America.  </P> <P> Also up for the Emmy that Falk won were Lee Marvin, for a role in an "Alcoa  Premiere," and Mickey Rooney and Milton Berle, who starred in their own  episodes of "The Dick Powell Show." Stevens was nominated for a best-actress  Emmy for her performance. "The Dick Powell Show" is one of the few dramatic  anthologies from yesteryear that still plays on television. In the '50s and  early '60s, you could watch at least one almost every night.  </P></p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y to present debt plan to bankers on Thursday OLYMPIA &amp; York, the troubled property developer, is to meet on Thursday with representatives of its 15 largest creditor banks to outline long-term plans to restructure its Dollars 12bn debt. At the meeting, to be held in London, O&amp;Y will for the first time give the banks details of how much interest it would like them to defer and how long it would like them to wait for interest and principal payments. O&amp;Y said it would provide the banks with a five-year business plan. It said it expected banks would find 'the plans reasonable' and a basis for further negotiation. Until now, O&amp;Y has only provided banks with details of how much money it needs to borrow to keep operating for the next 90 days. The company has been finding it difficult to raise funds for its short-term requirements in Canada and at Canary Wharf, the office development in east London. Providers of around Dollars 5bn of loans to O&amp;Y's parent company and close subsidiaries are expected to be asked to make the biggest sacrifices. Interest and principal could be deferred to the end of the decade. Of the Dollars 5bn, the main facility is a Dollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan to Olympia &amp; York Resources Credit Corporation which is split into four portions: a Dollars 1.25m European tranche, arranged by Credit Lyonnais of France and Germany's Commerzbank, each of which are thought to hold Dollars 250m; a Dollars 750m Asian portion, all of which is said by bankers to have been provided by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Dollars 250m provided by Royal Bank of Canada; Dollars 250m provided by Daichi Kangyo Bank, the biggest Japanese bank. All these banks are expected to be represented at Thursday's meeting. Also expected to attend are Citicorp of the US, Barclays of the UK, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Bank of Nova Scotia. They will act as representatives of all 100 of O&amp;Y's banks. The disclosure of the size of Hongkong Bank's exposure will embarrass that bank, given that it is in the middle of a battle with the UK's Lloyds Bank for control of Midland Bank. Yesterday Hongkong Bank refused to confirm or deny that it was holding all Dollars 750m. The meeting will be addressed by Mr Steve Miller, the investment banker from James D Wolfenson Inc in charge of O&amp;Y's bank negotiations, and by Mr Gerald Greenwald, who was recently made president and deputy chief executive of O&amp;Y. Bankers said they hoped Mr Paul Reichmann, O&amp;Y's founder, would attend the meeting. However, an O&amp;Y spokesman said he did not know whether Mr Reichmann would be there.</p>

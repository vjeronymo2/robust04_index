			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / NUM overtaken in size by Equity THE ONCE mighty National Union of Mineworkers was last year overtaken in size by Equity, the actors' union, as affiliates to the Trades Union Congress saw their membership decline to the lowest level since 1947. The NUM's decline to 44,352 at the end of last year compares with 200,000 during the 1984-85 miners' strike and 53,112 in 1990. Membership of Equity has risen from 32,525 in 1984 to 44,379. Figures published by the TUC yesterday show that membership of its affiliates fell last year by 440,000 to 7.76m out of a total workforce of more than 24m. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said: 'Whilst these figures are disappointing, they say more about the state of the economy than they do about trade unions.' Unemployment increased by 700,000 last year. The TUC said it remained the largest national trade union organisation in western Europe. It added that union density in the UK - the percentage of the workforce who are members of unions - compared well with other developed countries. Of the 72 affiliated unions, 57 recorded a drop in membership last year, costing the TUC more than Pounds 500,000 in lost affiliation fees. The three largest unions were among those hardest hit, with the TGWU and GMB general unions both suffering a 7 per cent decline to 1.13m and 862,000 respectively. The engineering section of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union fell 11 per cent to 622,000. Britain's smallest union - the Sheffield Wool Shear Workers Union - lost one member, down from 17 to 16. Gainers included the Nalgo public service union, up from 744,000 to 759,000 and the CPSA Civil Service union, up 1,889 to 124,566. The latest membership figures mean the TUC's general council will be reduced by six to 50 members. The TGWU, GMB, AEEU and MSF general technical union - whose recorded membership fell from 653,000 to 604,000 - will all lose one seat, as will the UCW communication workers' union.</p>

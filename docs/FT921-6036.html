			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At A Glance): Gloom for building societies There was not much in the way of good news in figures released by the building societies association this week. The best was a modest upturn in net receipts to Pounds 293m in January after two months of net outflows - a far cry from the Pounds 934m in net receipts in January 1991 and the year's peak of Pounds 1.3bn in April. Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said last month's inflow of money 'owed much to the first anniversary of Tessa accounts. The underlying flow of savings remains subdued and this pattern seems set to continue for the foreseeable future.' There was little sign of improvement in the societies' mortgage business either. Net new lending at Pounds 2.27bn in January was down from Pounds 2.53bn in December.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (8): An alternative to costly, tiring travel - Video-Conferencing VIDEO-CONFERENCING is a technology and business communications medium whose time may finally have arrived. Equipment prices are falling, simple-to-use desktop and PC-card systems are appearing and for the first time video-conferencing and video-telephony are beginning to offer a real alternative to costly, inconvenient and tiring travel. According to the US-based Gartner Group the world market for video-conferencing equipment is now worth about Dollars 200m and is doubling each year. Dial-up, high performance systems are the fastest growing sector accounting for about 70 per cent of the total market and are forecast to account for about 98 per cent of the market by 1995. The big three video-conferencing system manufacturers are PictureTel, which has about 75 per cent of the US market for dial-up video-conferencing at data rates of under 384 kilobits per second (Kbps), GEC Plessey Telecommunications of the UK, and California-based Compression Labs which produce high-end systems with data rates of above 384Kbps. Indicating the market's dynamism, PictureTel's turnover doubled last year to Dollars 76m. Frost and Sullivan, the market research group, estimated recently that the number of installed video-conferencing units in the US would surge from 4,660 in 1990 to 162,000 in 1995. In the UK market, analysts estimate that 3,400 video-conferencing systems, big studio-type systems and transportable 'roll-around' or 'roll-about' systems, were sold last year and that sales are roughly doubling each year. Several factors are driving the recent rapid growth in dial-up video-conferencing. Firstly, the cost of equipment has fallen dramatically from about Pounds 200,000 in 1986 to about Pounds 20,000 in mid-1991 (for one end). According to PictureTel's UK subsidiary, prices are roughly halving every two years. PictureTel, which has its European headquarters at Slough in the UK, introduced a Pounds 17,000 dial-up roll-about system in September which is designed to work on 64kbps ISDN lines. These falling costs have been made possible by the availability of VLSI codecs, the advanced integrated circuits used in systems to digitise and compress the picture. Secondly, the availability of dial-up high-speed data connections like Mercury's Switchband 64kbps-1920kbps dial-up bandwidth-on-demand service, launched last autumn, means that users are charged on the basis of bandwidth only. Instead of having to own or lease expensive data connections which are not used all the time, companies can now dial-up the capacity they require without pre-booking as and when they want it. In the UK now, inland video calls can cost as little as Pounds 15 an hour - cheaper than a taxi to Heathrow from central London - and a transatlantic call costs about Pounds 160 an hour. In The US, costs are even lower with a coast-to-coast call costing between Dollars 15 to Dollars 20 an hour. Thirdly, technical improvements have resulted in higher quality sound and pictures over lower levels of bandwidth. Old systems used to produce jerky images on 2Megabit lines while today's systems produce much more acceptable video on 128kbps lines. While falling equipment and usage charges make video-conferencing affordable to more organisations, a growing awareness of other issues like the time and cost of travelling - and its impact on the environment - are also adding to its attractions. This means that video-conferencing is no longer just a boardroom novelty, but is also being used by geographically dispersed project and sales teams, consultants, specialists and others at executive and middle management level. In the US, the biggest customers for dial-up video-conferencing are still the Fortune 500 multinationals who mainly use it for internal communications. But companies are also encouraging their suppliers to use video-conferencing to improve communications. Another factor which has helped boost equipment sales has been the agreement of a CCITT standard called PX64 or H261 which will ensure that dial-up video-conferencing systems interconnect with each other. In the UK, both BT - which holds about an 80 per cent share of the UK video-conferencing market and doubled its turnover from video-conferencing sales last year - and Mercury offer public video-conferencing facilities for hire by the hour and multipoint video-conferencing connecting multiple sites, as well as selling video-conferencing packages. For example, Mercury, which has distribution agreements with the main equipment suppliers, can provide a full executive video-conferencing system including an electronics module, monitors, cameras and desktop keypads and a choice of network services options including Switchband. Mr Andy Gent, business development manager with Mercury Datacoms, says with confidence, 'we're at the right time and the right place - video-conferencing is what people want and the market is growing rapidly.' In the past year, a new low-end video-conferencing market segment has also begun to open up and promises to have a dramatic impact on the office. Desktop and plug-in PC-card video-conferencing systems built around small video cameras and ISDN telephone lines have begun to appear and although only a few hundred systems are expected to be sold this year perhaps as many as 50,000 could be sold in 1993 including an estimated 8,000 in the UK. Among the suppliers of PC-based videophones and desktop video-conferencing systems in the UK is BT which has spent over Pounds 20m developing visual services in the last five years. Earlier this year BT, in partnership with IBM, unveiled a PC-based videophone which will cost about Pounds 4,000 and be available next year. The system comprises a plug-in videocodec card, a small video camera and a connection to the ISDN network. Similar systems are promised by Compression Laboratories of the US which has developed its Cameo personal video system with Apple Computer and by PictureTel which has been working with both IBM and Siemens of Germany. Meanwhile, Hitachi has begun selling a desktop teleconferencing system weighing 13lbs and the size of an ordinary video recorder. The Dollars 14,900 machine, on sale in Japan and the US, has two transmission speeds, 64 and 128 kbps. Hitachi says it expects annual sales of 2,000 systems in each country. By the end of this year, BT also promises dedicated desktop video-conferencing units which will cost about Pounds 7,000 to Pounds 8,000 and can have document readers and auxiliary cameras added to them. (BT's desktop video-conference unit is pictured on page one of this survey.) Mr Ian Fox, a senior consultant with BIS, the IT consultancy, believes that the longer-term trend will be towards these desktop and PC-based systems. Until now he argues only a few companies with 'megabucks' could afford the sophisticated high-end systems. But the potential market for low-cost video-conferencing is huge and he predicts that 'we will see major growth,' particularly because the recession has focused attention on reducing travel ling costs - 'in my view, it's one of the most exciting, if not the most exciting move in information technology today.' However, he is much less enthusiastic about the short-term prospects for home videophones already on sale in France and Japan and those like the Pounds 400 analogue model BT plans to launch by the end of the year, or the Dollars 1,500 model launched recently in the US by AT and T, because he argues the video quality available at present is 'not sufficient.' Mercury's Andy Gent agrees that 'it is debatable how fast that (video-telephony) market will develop.' Nevertheless, Frost and Sullivan forecast that the world market for visual communications in general will be worth about Dollars 3bn by the mid-1990s. If the analysts are right, the 1990s may well indeed be remembered as the decade when video telecommunications came of age.</p>

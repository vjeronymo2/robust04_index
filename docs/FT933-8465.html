			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Beijing puts new clamps on media CHINA has announced additional restrictions on news dissemination in a clear sign that as part of the current austerity drive the authorities are also intent on reining in the local media. The State Council, or cabinet, warned in the new regulations, issued at the weekend, against the holding of unauthorised news conferences, and urged the press to concentrate on 'positive news'. The State Council circular stated that news conferences should focus on 'important issues' such as promoting 'economic and spiritual civilisation'. The crackdown on the spread of information coincides with attempts by the central government to regain control of the economy under a new stabilisation plan introduced last month. It also comes amid signs of a sterner attitude towards art and literature generally with the banning late last month of the award-winning film, Farewell To My Concubine. The authorities have given no reason for the ban, but members of the leadership are believed to have been incensed by the film's negative portrayal of the Communist party. The State Council circular also warned against the leaking of 'party and state secrets', using language reminiscent of an earlier, less liberal era. The new regulations follow measures introduced this month to penalise severely journalists who accepted bribes or other financial inducements  - what was described at the time as 'newswriting for illicit payment'. The authorities were reacting to the fairly widespread practice of Chinese journalists accepting money to write flattering articles about companies and their products. Tighter restrictions on the media coincide with attempts by Beijing to combat corruption, fight tax evasion, and counter rampant smuggling across China's borders. The Bank of China, the country's central bank, will issue its first Hong Kong dollars next May, one of its vice chairman was quoted as saying yesterday, Reuter reports from Beijing. The initial volume was expected to be in the region of HKDollars 3bn to HKDollars 6bn (Pounds 258m to Pounds 517m), Mr Huang Diyan told the Xinhua news agency. Until now, the British colony's dollars have been issued only by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Corp (HKSBC) and the Standard Chartered Bank. A British colony since 1842, Hong Kong becomes a Chinese special administrative region on July 1 1997. Mr Huang said all the necessary legal procedures for the issue were completed, leaving only technicalities to sort out. 'We sincerely hope that the Hong Kong Bank, Standard Chartered and other international banks will stay and develop in Hong Kong on a long-term basis, so as to jointly work toward the prosperity of Hong Kong's financial market and consolidate and further promote its status as an international financial centre,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSCOPE;  </P> <P> CAL POLY MEN CAGERS AIM TO RETURN TO WINNING WAYS  </P> <P> After two straight losses to NCAA Division I opponents, the Cal Poly Pomona  men's basketball team hopes to get back on the winning track against two lower  division teams tonight and Saturday at Pomona.  </P> <P> The Broncos, who lost to Southern Utah State and UC Berkeley to drop to a 1-3  record, meet Pomona-Pitzer at 7:30 tonight and UC Davis at 7:30 p.m. Saturday.  Both games are at Kellogg Gymnasium.  </P> <P> Pomona-Pitzer, a Division III team, takes a 1-3 record into the game. Davis, a  Division II squad, is 1-1.  </P> <P> The Broncos were soundly defeated by their Division I opponents, dropping a  112-94 decision to Southern Utah and falling 95-72 against California.  </P> <P> However, the Broncos have received outstanding play all along from 6-6 forward  Terry Ross. The junior scored 20 points and grabbed eight rebounds against  Southern Utah and added 20 points and 11 rebounds to lead the way against  California.  </P> <P> Pomona, which does not have a senior in its opening lineup, will also start  juniors Ken Scalmanini (6-4) at forward, Rafael Vargas (6-7) at center and  Chancellor McCobb (6-3) at guard and sophomore D. J. Norman (6-1) at the other  guard spot.  </P> <P> The Broncos will face a Pomona-Pitzer team that is also struggling. The  Sagehens, defending Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference  champions, won their season opener over Swarthmore of Pennsylvania, 66-62, but  have lost their last three games.  </P> <P> The Sagehens are paced by 6-2 senior guard David Todd, who averages 18.7  points. Davis, Pomona's Saturday opponent, is sparked by junior forward Matt  Cordova. The 6-3 Cordova averages 16 points.  </P> <P> The Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball team will attempt to remain undefeated  when it meets UC Santa Barbara at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Poly Pavilion.  </P> <P> Pomona will take a 3-0 record into the game. Santa Barbara is 2-0. The Broncos  defeated Santa Barbara, 66-60, last season.  </P> <P> The Broncos, who reached the NCAA Division II final last season, will be facing  their second straight Division I opponent. Pomona defeated Weber State, 70-68,  in its last game.  </P> <P> The victory over Weber State was a milestone for Pomona coach Darlene May, who  record the 400th victory of her college career. May, in her 16th season as a  college coach, has a 400-91 record -- a brilliant winning percentage of .815.  That also tied her for fourth with Joanne Bracker of Midland Lutheran on the  list of all-time women's leaders in wins.  </P> <P> On the court, Pomona has been led by 6-2 senior forward Niki Bracken. An  All-America selection last season, Bracken scored 22 points and grabbed nine  rebounds against Weber State.  </P> <P> In addition to Bracken, the Bronco starters are juniors Kelly Connelly (6-1) at  forward and Stephanie Coons (5-11) and Denise Ogburn (5-5) at guard and senior  Marcine Edmonds (6-1) at center. Pomona also has an impressive freshman in  reserve in 6-2 center Danielle Carter, an All-CIF performer at Fontana High  last season.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara will counter Pomona with good size on its front line including  6-4 sophomore center Susie Matthews.  </P> <P> Citrus College in Glendora will play host to the eight-team 1989 California  Community College State Women's Volleyball Tournament that starts Saturday in  the school's gym.  </P> <P> Games will start at 9 a.m. Saturday and 9:30 a.m. Sunday. Admission is $5 for  adults and $3 for students and senior citizens.  </P> <P> The double-elimination tournament will include four teams from Northern  California and four from Southern California. First-round pairings have yet to  be determined.  </P></p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum prices up The increasing tension in South African cities pushed platinum prices up in both London and New York yesterday, writes Our Commodities Staff. In London speculative buying and short covering took the price to more than Dollars 370 a troy ounce in late trading, the highest since early February. Nymex July futures jumped Dollars 9.60 to Dollars 372 in early trading. 'The market is a bit thin and small parcels can exaggerate price moves,' one dealer said. South Africa supplies about 75 per cent of western world platinum, which is used principally in jewellery, autocatalysts and electronics.</p>

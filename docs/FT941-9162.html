			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Respect for determination Sir, I thought that fearing the Japanese was exclusively an American characteristic. You surprise me with your 'Shoot-out in the DC corral' (February 12/13) editorial. What in effect you propose is a no-win situation. If the Americans will give up in order to save Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's job as prime minister, they will be accused of interfering with Japan's internal affairs. At the same time, and for the umpteenth time, the Americans will come back unfairly empty handed. This is business and the Japanese will respect the Americans for it if, once and for all, the Americans will be more focused, determined and strong.

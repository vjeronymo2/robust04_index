			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with the press statement by Kang  Sok-chu, North Korean vice foreign minister, that the exchange  of special envoys is not a precondition for the third round of  the U.S.-North Korean talks, a senior government official today  stressed that the government position that the exchange should  be made before the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks  remains unchanged.    The official said that although North Korea seems to be  making this assertion on the basis that the exchange of special  envoys was not specified in the U.S.-North Korean written  agreement in New York, the exchange of special envoys was agreed  upon internally between the United States and North Korea,  though the United States acceded to the North Korean demand not  to include it in the written agreement.    The official said that, therefore, Kang Sok-chu's allegation  that the text of the New York agreement mentions only the  resumption of the working contact and that it does not make any  reference to the realization of the exchange of special envoys  is an absurd allegation aimed at overturning the explicit  agreement between the United States and North Korea.</p>

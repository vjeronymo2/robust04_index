			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GIRL IN THE PHOTOGRAPH  </P> <P> Too many people are trying to reverse the facts of history by pretending that  the young men we sent to fight and die in Vietnam were heroes who did something  glorious for us. To the contrary, like the Vietnamese people, our soldiers were  miserable victims of an insane policy, and their accomplishments came to zero.  </P> <P> Although physically and emotionally damaged, Kim Phuc wants to come here and  work for reconciliation. That is heroic.  </P> <P> EUGENE KUSMIAK, Fallbrook  </P></p>

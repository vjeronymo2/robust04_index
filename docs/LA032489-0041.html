			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIPARTISAN U.S. ACCORD REACHED ON NICARAGUA;  </P> <P> OUTLINE CALLS FOR BUSH TO SEEK PEACEFUL SOLUTION IN EXCHANGE FOR OK OF  NON-LETHAL CONTRA AID  </P> <P> The Bush Administration and leaders of both parties in Congress reached  agreement Thursday on the outline of a bipartisan policy on Nicaragua, the  first such consensus in almost a decade of U.S. attempts to deal with the  Sandinista revolution.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, hammered out in two weeks of hard bargaining on Capitol  Hill, Congress will approve a 10-month renewal of non-military aid for the  Contras who have been fighting to overthrow the leftist government,  Administration officials and members of Congress said.  </P> <P> In return, they said, the Administration will commit itself to pursuing a  peaceful, political solution to the Central American conflict, with the  eventual goal of returning the Contras to civilian life in a more democratic  Nicaragua.  </P> <P> President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III were still calling  Republican senators Thursday evening, trying to win their agreement to the  final version of the plan, aides said. A senior Administration official warned  that the pact "could still come unglued" because of remaining opposition from  both hard-line liberals and conservatives.  </P> <P> But barring any last-minute hitches, White House officials said, Bush plans to  announce the bipartisan pact after a meeting with congressional leaders this  morning.  </P> <P> "The point of this plan is to end the era in which Nicaragua was a contentious,  divisive issue and to produce a policy which will clearly be United States  policy -- not just the Administration's policy or the Democrats' policy," a  State Department official said.  </P> <P> "We are keeping the Contras in place as a viable military force, which is a  pressure point against the Sandinistas. . . . And now the Administration can  begin to do its job, which is to use diplomatic pressure to bring democracy to  Nicaragua."  </P> <P> The agreement appeared to be a victory for both Baker, who devised and  negotiated the pact, and House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), who delivered the  support of a majority of House Democrats by holding out for a key amendment: a  clause that allows Congress to halt aid to the Contras if it decides that the  Administration is not pursuing a peaceful settlement.  </P> <P> The willingness of both sides to seek a consensus represents a major shift. The  Reagan Administration had doggedly sought military aid for the Contras and  showed little taste for compromise.  </P> <P> "Where we are united, we succeed in foreign policy, and where we're divided, we  fail," Baker said earlier this week. "We've been divided on Central America;  it's been a very emotional and divisive issue for eight to 10 years. I think  that before we can anticipate success in the region, we're going to have to get  our act together up here . . . and pursue a unified approach."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Baker Is Sincere'  </P> <P> "I believe Jim Baker is sincere," Wright said in an interview Wednesday, before  the agreement was reached. ". . . Essentially, what has to be done is to give  our colleagues (in Congress) an adequate assurance that our commitment is to  the peace process."  </P> <P> The agreement sets out a two-page statement of U.S. policies and objectives in  Central America and pledges the Administration and both parties in Congress to  work for their fulfillment, officials said. Its main provisions are that:  </P> <P>  -- The United States will support the peace process already launched by the  presidents of the five Central American nations to reach negotiated solutions  to the region's internal conflicts.  </P> <P>  -- The United States will continue to press for full democracy in Nicaragua,  including free and fair elections in February of next year.  </P> <P>  -- At the same time, Congress will approve renewed non-military aid for the  Contras for the 10 months beginning May 1, to maintain the rebels as a  potential threat until the elections are held. The aid will be provided "at  existing levels," meaning about $5.2 million a month, according to  Administration officials.  </P> <P>  -- In return, the Administration will ensure that the Contras do not receive  secret military aid and do not engage in offensive military action against the  Sandinistas.  </P> <P>  -- As democracy is achieved in Nicaragua, the United States will support the  voluntary demobilization of the Contras and their reintegration into Nicaragua  or relocation elsewhere in Central America.  </P> <P>  -- The United States will also work to protect its own security interests in  Central America, and will negotiate directly with the Soviet Union to reduce  Soviet aid to Cuba and Nicaragua.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Active Role Seen  </P> <P> Once the new, bipartisan policy is announced, the Administration is expected to  take a more active role in the Central American diplomatic process than before,  officials said. Among several actions under consideration, they said, Bush may  name a special envoy to the region and Baker may visit the four U.S. allies  there -- El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica -- as early as next  month.  </P> <P> Among their aims, they said, will be to focus attention on Nicaragua's internal  political system so that the Sandinistas' movement toward democracy, or their  lack of movement, becomes the main issue in the area's diplomacy.  </P> <P> The ultimate goal, at least on paper, is a free election in Nicaragua next  February, and a political situation in which the Contras voluntarily disband.  But senior Administration officials acknowledge that they are still skeptical  that the Sandinistas are willing to meet U.S. demands for more democracy.  </P> <P> "They haven't performed yet, have they?" asked one.  </P> <P> If diplomacy fails, Administration officials say that they reserve the right to  ask Congress for military aid for the Contras to restart Nicaragua's guerrilla  war. But Wright and other Democrats adamantly insist that they will never agree  to renewed military aid.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pact Marks 1st Success  </P> <P> If the bipartisan pact on Central America holds up, even if only on Capitol  Hill -- it will be the Bush Administration's first solid foreign policy  success. Bush and Baker sought the unusual policy agreement, aides said,  because both are convinced that the Administration's success in foreign affairs  depends directly on the breadth of bipartisan support it can command.  </P> <P> Within the first weeks after Bush's election last November, Baker met with  Wright in a long session to seek bipartisan cooperation. The meeting, at the  apartment of former Democratic Party Chairman Robert S. Strauss, quickly turned  to the thorny problem of Nicaragua, according to a source who was present.  </P> <P> Later, after Inauguration Day, Baker told his new aides at the State Department  that a bipartisan agreement on Nicaragua was one of his first priorities.  </P> <P> On March 2, Baker quietly unveiled his proposal in meetings with Senate  Republican leaders -- and, again, with Wright. A senior Administration official  told reporters that the goal of U.S. policy in Nicaragua has shifted from  overthrowing the Sandinistas to merely "containing" them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Feverish Negotiations  </P> <P> Initially, Baker's plan won remarkable support from both Democratic and  Republican congressional leaders, weary of the long battles over Nicaragua  policy. But last week, resistance to the plan increased among both liberal  Democrats and conservative Republicans, prompting Baker to launch a feverish  round of negotiations.  </P> <P> Skeptical Democrats, led by Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), complained that they  were being asked to give the Administration a blank check. "I am simply looking  for an escape hatch" if things go wrong, Obey said.  </P> <P> His "escape hatch" turned out to be an amendment to the plan that Baker  accepted on Thursday. Under the amendment, the Administration can provide the  Contras with aid from May through November but must seek the approval of  congressional leaders before releasing any aid after that.  </P> <P> At the same time, officials said, some conservative Republicans complained that  the plan went too far toward endorsing the goal of disbanding the Contras. The  peace plan approved last month by the Central American presidents calls for  dismantling the rebel army, but Administration officials contend that Nicaragua  must achieve internal democracy first.  </P> <P> "A lot of the conservatives were unhappy with the language (in Baker's plan)  about relocation" of the Contras, one Administration official said. He said  that Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) had expressed  reservations about that provision.  </P> <P> In the end, officials said, Baker won the approval of the liberal House  Democratic leadership before he was able to tie down the approval of his own  conservative allies.  </P> <P> Times staff writers William J. Eaton and Jack Nelson contributed to this  article.  </P></p>

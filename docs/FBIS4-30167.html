			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Challenge to DPRK and Chongnyon"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The minister of justice  and the general director of the public security investigation  agency of Japan on June 21 prattled that "most perfect measures"  must be taken for watching and investigating the movements of  the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan  (Chongnyon). Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today brands this  as a revellation of the Japanese authorities' attempt to further  expand and intensify the crackdown on Chongnyon and a vicious  challenge to the DPRK and Chongnyon.    The news analyst says:    The Japanese authorities are assuming the legal and moral  responsibility for ensuring the activities of Chongnyon, a  patriotic and legitimate overseas citizens' organisation of the  DPRK, and the democratic and national rights of the Koreans in  Japan.    Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities' crackdown on  Chongnyon, timing to coincide with the moves of the imperialists  and reactionaries to stifle the DPRK on the plea of "nuclear  suspicion", is part of their hostile policy toward the DPRK and  a deliberate and premeditated political suppression to threaten  Chongnyon, interrupt its patriotic activities and furthermore,  remove it.    The Korean people and the compatriots in Japan value the  dignity and sovereignty of the nation and will never pardon  those who encroach upon it.    The Japanese authorities must stop the suppression of  Chongnyon at once, mindful that they will be to blame for the  consequences of their undisguised crackdown on Chongnyon and  moves to stifle the DPRK.</p>

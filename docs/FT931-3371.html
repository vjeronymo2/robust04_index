			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (4): Consumers through the ages CONSUMPTION AND THE WORLD OF GOODS Edited by John Brewer and Roy Porter Routledge, Pounds 75, 564 pages LIKE A vast jigsaw puzzle, this enormous 25-essay volume, ranging from the encyclopaedic (patterns of English and Anglo-American consumption between 1550 and 1800) to the microscopically detailed (an examination of a Lancashire woman's habits of consumption between 1751 and 1781) is only fully satisfying once the final piece slots home. Here we are in the final years of the 20th century, still without a taxonomy of consumerism. Perhaps the subject is just too vast. The University of California at Los Angeles has decided to try to rectify our lack of understanding and this monster volume - at a monstrous but no doubt justifiable price - is the first of three on culture and consumption in the 17th and 18th centuries. Focusing on those two centuries as a perceived moment of shift from individual into mass consumption - though several of the contributing scholars question that premise - the presence of Adam Smith quietly dominates. 'Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer. The maxim is so perfectly self-evident, that it would be absurd to attempt to prove it,' said Smith. Yet, as Joyce Appleby points out in her contribution: 'Smith was far from happy with the human propensity to consume, characterising it variously as a fascination for 'baubles and trinkets', a passion for accumulating objects of 'frivolous utility' and, worse, a vehicle for deception with the false promise that wealth will bring happiness.' If the 1980s saw emphasis on the first Adam Smith quote, the 1990s look like promoting the second. The contributors pose many important questions, though answers are more scarce. Part of the effort, well elucidated in the opening section by the editors, is to find a home within academic exploration for study of all facets of the consumption of goods, a home which eschews crude Marxism and does not superficially relegate such a key element of our lives to fashion. Appleby again: 'Why, in the floodtide of Enlightenment enthusiasms for freedom - free speech, free inquiry, free labour, free trade, free contract  -was free consumption never articulated as a social goal? . . . Why is it . . . that consumption, which is the linchpin of our modern social system, has never been the linchpin of our theories explaining modernity?' Part of the explanation for that lacuna might well come from the paradoxes inherent in consumption, as Roy Porter so entertainingly delineates in an essay which considers consumption as both health (eating and drinking) and disease (tuberculosis). 'The dialectics of wealth and waste were worrisome. Buying and selling were vital for life-giving commerce. Yet what was spending, but the dissipation of accumulated resources, leading to economic entropy? Conspicuous consumption was conspicuous waste.' By the mid 19th century the subterranean revolution from individual to mass consumption was over and Thomas Carlyle could write with conviction that 'cash payment has become the sole nexus of man to man'. Mass consumption became used as a means of political hegemony: by 1775 the American colonies were taking 9,000 different commodities, a trade frequently tied up by legal prohibitions against alternative sources. Once started, this ball keeps rolling. Jean-Christophe Agnew quotes a US soldier from the second world war: 'I am in this damn mess as much to help keep the custom of drinking Cokes as I am to preserve the million other benefits our country blesses its citizens with.' This book deserves to be widely read, for it contains the seeds of something much greater than its own absorbing research. Sources as diverse as US trend-spotting gurus and the Japanese advertising agency Dentsu tell us we are in for a period of extended shunning of mass-marketed consumables, as purchasers become more interested in individualising consumption habits. They also tell us that will not be a phenomenon which dies when the recession lifts. If that is so, then understanding the historical and cultural roots of mass consumerism will be imperative. This book provides an excellent starting point.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Companies 'under-insured'  -In a Nutshell Small high-technology companies are heavily under-insured in crucial areas of their business, according to a study by the University of Central England. While 95 per cent of respondents took out standard property and liability insurance, only 5 per cent had key man insurance and 8 per cent professional indemnity cover, the report said. Fewer than 10 per cent of companies surveyed were protected against loss of patents and other forms of intellectual property. Report available from University of Central England in Birmingham.

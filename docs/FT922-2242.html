			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Partial eclipse darkens Japan THE CURRENT eclipse of Japan's economic sun will not last for ever. But there are more constructive ways for the Japanese authorities to remove the shadow than simply to sit, wait and pray to the gods. The Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance together have the power to stimulate domestic demand. Both economic and political logic suggest they use it. The Bank of Japan's unwillingness to acknowledge the risks the economy faces is understandable, if misguided. Most economies would have buckled under the combined strain of a harsh monetary tightening and financial market collapse. But the bank has so far skilfully managed to deflate Japan's frighteningly large asset market bubble without prompting anything more than a modest deceleration of economic growth. Not even the most pessimistic observers expect Japan to suffer a fall in output, let alone a recession on the scale suffered by the US or UK. More likely Japanese economic growth will slip to a respectable 2 per cent this year. What then, the central bank and finance ministry might ask, is all the fuss about? But Japan's policy-makers cannot afford to be so sanguine. The risk Japan faces is not a sharp fall in output but instead that the return to trend economic growth will take years rather than months. For a sign of things to come, officials have only to observe the anaemic recovery in America and the corpse-like state of the UK economy, and listen to the resigned tones of once optimistic civil servants and forecasters. Japan is, in fact, suffering from the very same underlying problem that has strangled economic recoveries in the Anglo-Saxon world. Companies, consumers and banks are all burdened by varying degrees of outstanding debts. The weakness of the stock market and the accumulation of bad debts in the banking sector have already depressed confidence and activity outside the financial community. Corporate profitability is weak and expected to deteriorate; bankruptcies are rising and overtime working is falling. Broad money growth may be sluggish because companies do not want to borrow for investment, but even if they did the banks would be in no position to offer new finance. Yet Japan does not have to stand back and take these deflationary blows on the chin. The Bank of Japan, unlike the Bank of England, retains the ability to set a flexible course for monetary policy; and reason demands more interest rate cuts than Mr Yoshida Mieno, its governor, has so far been willing to deliver. The inflation risk is negligible as the low level of long rates indicates; and a further percentage point off the discount rate would provide welcome relief to Japan's troubled banking sector. Similarly, the finance ministry, unlike the US Treasury, has ample room to stimulate domestic demand through active fiscal policy. The budget balance that counts - that of the general government - is in healthy surplus, and the public sector, unlike the private sector, has plenty of worthwhile investment opportunities. The underlying strength of the Japanese economy will ensure that it eventually resumes its place in the sun, although the heat may not be quite as intense as in the late 1980s. But the Japanese authorities have a clear interest in this happening sooner rather than later. The longer growth in Japan remains slow, the more consumers will reduce their spending on imports and the larger Japan's current account will become. A looser monetary and fiscal policy is the sensible way to cut this deficit and smooth international trade relations. Inaction only increases the risk that the US or EC will try to impose a more brutal solution.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / EC to step up links to central Europe Poland, Hungary, the Czech lands and Slovakia - yesterday agreed to strengthen their political ties through a regular dialogue, particularly on foreign policy. The decision was taken at the first formal summit of the the Community and the so-called Visegrad group of countries, soon to be expanded from three to four members after the split of Czechoslovakia into two separate republics. Though closer political consultations, including joint meetings of foreign ministers, were welcomed by the central European leaders, they made clear that they were hoping for more specific commitments on the timetable for their future entry into the Community as full members. Mr Joszef Antall, Hungary's prime minister, drew attention to central Europe's broader economic and security concerns and called on the EC to 'retain a sense of solidarity and not treat the region as Europe's backyard.' Despite the collapse of the Soviet empire, Europe still needed 'a solid political and military organisation like Nato and a continuing US military presence.' Mr John Major, the British prime minister and current president of the EC, on whose initiative the meeting was held, went out of his way to assure them of the Community's support for 'the tough political and economic reforms' which they had undertaken. Their meeting symbolised the EC's wish to work together with the central European countries and to cement the new relationship it had forged with them through association agreements signed last December. All shared a common commitment to democracy and human rights and to free trade across the whole European continent. They would 'eventually' become full members, once they could face the competition from the more developed western European countries, he said. Though it was unlikely that a timetable for their entry into the Community would be fixed in the foreseeable future, Mr Major said that clear criteria for membership would be drawn up in time for the December EC summit in Edinburgh. Yesterday's meeting provided Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak prime minister, with his first exposure to international politics at the highest level. It also allowed Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, to explain the details of the customs and monetary agreements worked out between the two republics which will become separate states on January 1. Behind the scenes Czechoslovak and Hungarian negotiators worked with Community officials to seek a solution to the increasingly embittered conflict between Hungary and Slovakia over the Gabcikovo dam. Later Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said both new states would become full members of the bank in the New Year.</p>

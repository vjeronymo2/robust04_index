			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 13 (CTK) -- "Hardly have we started  to appear and already problems are upon us," the revamped  SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA (SLOVAK REPUBLIC) complains on its front  page today. The daily, close to the former premier, Vladimir  Meciar, used to be published as REPUBLIKA by the News Agency of  the Slovak Republic (TA SR) but came out on Thursday [12 May]  with a new name and the old layout. It is published now by the  Salus limited company, which is co-owned by Meciar's Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS).    The paper reports that Pavol Weiss, a leader of the Liberal  Party, has lodged a complaint with the General Prosecutor's  Office to investigate whether the paper has committed the  criminal act of public defamation of the republic by its new  name. At the same time, the culture minister has asked the  publisher to change the name, although the abuse of the state  name is only theoretical.    On May 12, TA SR Director General Ivan Melichercik said that  REPUBLIKA was originally intended to be purely a news agency  paper but owing to its marked political bias it became  "incompatible with the fundamental principles of a news agency".    From the beginning of its existence REPUBLIKA "dragged a  boulder of debts behind it"; this contradicted TA SR's legally  defined status as a public corporation, which is not permitted  any loss-making entrepreneurial activity. "TA SR's divorce from  REPUBLIKA proceeds solely from these premises," Melichercik  stated.</p>

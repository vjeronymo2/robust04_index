			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ SOCIETY SPECIALIZATION  </P> <P> Trad, Dixieland, New Orleans and related older jazz forms are more uplifting,  fun and consistent with the upbeat spirit of the American experience than so  much of the later, dissonant, brooding jazz that draws inspiration from poppy  pods and Colombian agriculture.  </P> <P> Trad-oriented jazz societies are deeply aware of, and grateful for, the black  invention of jazz a century ago. Apart from the elderly members of the  Preservation Hall Jazz Band, there are practically no blacks learning, playing  or interested in listening to classic jazz, and outreach efforts by clubs like  ours fall flat. Actually, we're keeping alive benchmark music that blacks have  abandoned.  </P> <P> WILL CONNELLY  </P> <P> President, Hot Jazz &amp; Alligator Gumbo Society  </P> <P> Plantation, Fla.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Robin Williams and Kathleen Turner are due for some razzing as Harvard's Hasty  Pudding Theatricals' man and woman of the year. The group called Turner ("The  Accidental Tourist," "Body Heat," "Romancing the Stone" and "Peggy Sue Got  Married") a "stellar and versatile actress whose combination of sass and  glamour has defined her as a leading actress of our generation." She'll be  honored Feb. 14 with a parade through Cambridge, Mass. Williams was cited as  "probably the only actor who can claim to have portrayed a cartoon character, a  real-life character and an alien" in his roles ("Popeye," "The World According  to Garp," "Good Morning, Vietnam," "Mork &amp; Mindy"). He'll be honored Feb.  21 at the premiere of "Whiskey Business," Hasty Pudding Theatricals' 141st  annual musical. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

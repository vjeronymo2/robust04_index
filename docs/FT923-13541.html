			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Smith set for decisive victory MR JOHN SMITH is set for a crushing victory over Mr Bryan Gould in this week's Labour leadership contest with the support of up to 90 per cent of the party's electorate, Philip Stephens writes. The shadow chancellor's campaign advisers predicted yesterday that his overwhelming support in all three branches of the electoral college that chooses the leader - the unions, parliamentary party and constituencies - would give him unprecedented authority as leader. In 1983 Mr Neil Kinnock secured 71 per cent of the vote. Mrs Margaret Beckett is expected to beat off comfortably challenges from Mr John Prescott and Mr Gould when the votes in the deputy and the leadership contest are counted on Saturday. Her team is confident that she is already assured of well over 50 per cent of the vote. Mr Prescott is expected to win second place, with Mr Gould trailing in third. Mr Gould's team yesterday conceded defeat in both contests with a call for the new party leadership to acknowledge the role he had played in ensuring the 'genuine' choice of leaders. Mr David Blunkett, who has led the Gould campaign, said that once the result was announced the candidates should put behind them the 'harsh words' spoken during the campaign and Mr Gould should be given a 'major role' in the leadership team. Mr Smith's aides indicated that there would be no attempt to 'punish' the challenger by giving him a low-profile post in the new shadow cabinet.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This exemption will be effective as of September 10, 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Written Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Notice of Proposed Exemption (the Notice), the Department invited all interested persons to submit written comments and any requests for a hearing on the proposed exemption within forty-five (45) days from the date of the publication of the Notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . All written comments and requests for a hearing were to have been received by the Department by April 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As of the close of the comment period, the Department had received eight (8) letters from interested persons commenting on the proposed exemption in addition to comment letters from the applicant. In this regard, the Department forwarded copies of the commentators' letters to the applicant and requested that the applicant address in writing the concerns raised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a letter dated May 4 1994, the applicant responded to the commentators, as requested by the Department. In this regard, the applicant stated that in general the concerns of the commentators did not identify any factual issues or express any direct objection to the exemption. The comments from the commentators on the proposed exemption were summarized by the applicant as follows: (1) Some of the comment letters were generally opposed to anything that would adversely affect their pension; (2) others of the comment letters expressed general concerns regarding the effect of the exemption on pension benefits; and (3) one comment letter supported the exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the opinion of the applicant the one favorable comment letter would appear to need no response. In response to the adverse comment letters, the applicant notes that the granting of the exemption in and of itself does not affect the security of pensions payable from the Plans participating in the Master Trust. In this regard, the applicant maintains: (1) That the granting of the exemption does not reduce the obligation to pay benefits of any of the Plans participating in the Master Trust; (2) that the exemption does not affect the duty of the sponsoring employer to comply with the funding requirements of applicable law; (3) that the I/F has determined that the terms of the agreement reached with LSI result in an overall transaction that is equal to or superior to transactions that could be negotiated with unrelated third parties; (4) that the terms of the agreement provide for LSI to pay $6 million to the Master Trust; (5) that based on the terms agreed to and the receipt of the $6 million dollar payment, the I/F has determined that the Master Trust is assured an internal rate of return in excess of 11% on the Property; and (6) that the terms of the agreement provide the Master Trust with significant opportunity to obtain an advantageous investment return with very little downside risk. Based on these considerations, the applicant maintains that no adverse effect on pension benefits payable by the Plans participating in the Master Trust should occur if the exemption is granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two of the commentators requested that the Department schedule a hearing on the matter, in accordance section 29 CFR 2570.46 of the Department's regulations which provides that the Department in its discretion may convene a hearing if requested by any interested persons who may be adversely affected by the exemption and where such exemption proposes to grant relief from section 406(b) of the Act. In response to this request for a hearing, the applicant points out that the commentators do not object to any specific issue in connection with the grant of the exemption, but expresses only general concern for how the exemption might affect health insurance, life insurance, and monthly pension benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's regulations regarding the right to a hearing state that a request for hearing must include ``a statement of the issues to be addressed and a general description of the evidence to be presented at the hearing. Further, the regulations state that the Department will grant a request for hearing ``where a hearing is necessary to fully explore material factual issues identified by the person requesting the hearing'' or may decline to hold a hearing ``where the factual issues identified can be fully explored through the submission of evidence in written form.'' The Department has concluded that the issues identified by the commentators, who requested a hearing, have been full explored in the case record including the material submitted by the applicant in response to the comments. Accordingly, the Department has determined not to hold a public hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the above comments and request for a hearing received from interested persons, the applicant informed the Department in submissions dated April 8, 1994, and April 22, 1994, of certain factual changes to the information contained in the application and technical clarifications to the language of the Notice. The following items represents a summary of the comments submitted to the Department by the applicant subsequent to the publication of the Notice: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (j) MKRA or its successors will monitor the fair market value of the Master Trust in order to insure that the fair market value of the Property will at no time exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total fair market value of the assets of the Master Trust; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) LSI has either paid directly or reimbursed the Master Trust for any fees, other than trustee and investment management fees, incurred in connection with the transactions with respect to the ownership of the Property by the Master Trust, and in the future, the Master Trust will incur no fees in connection with the transactions, other than fees paid to the trustee and to the investment manager; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) LSI has filed Forms 5330 and paid the excise taxes with respect to the Lease of the Property for years 1987&hyph;1989 and, LSI, not later than sixty (60) days after the date the grant of this exemption is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , will file Forms 5330 and will pay the excise taxes for the period after December 31, 1989, and before the effective date of this exemption. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This exemption will be effective as of September 10, 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Written Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Notice of Proposed Exemption (the Notice), the Department invited all interested persons to submit written comments and any requests for a hearing on the proposed exemption within forty-five (45) days from the date of the publication of the Notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Political turmoil jars Venezuela CONFIDENCE in Venezuela's ability to return to stability following a failed military uprising in February has been shaken by renewed political turmoil. President Carlos Andres Perez admitted this week that several officers in the armed forces had been questioned by the military intelligence office. Newspaper reports, which could not be independently confirmed, have indicated that both military officers and civilians had been questioned about an alleged conspiracy against the government. The reports came after several weeks of heightened political tension, following an attempted assassination, death threats against allegedly corrupt politicians and renewed student protests. This week the government was forced to deny initial reports that a presidential assassination attempt was made on Monday when Mr Perez was visiting the western state of Zulia. According to official reports, a lorry drove at speed past a bus carrying Mr Perez and other officials following the inauguration of a new hospital in the town of Paraguaipoa. The truck refused orders to halt, and the president's security team shot and killed the driver and his passenger, identified as Guajira Indians who were said to be drunk. The incident follows an attempt last month on the life of Mr Antonio Rios, the former president of Venezuela's largest labour organisation, the CTV. The alleged perpetrator, Cesar Eduardo Pena La Cruz, said he was working with a new political organisation which was dedicated to killing prominent Venezuelan figures identified as 'corrupt'. Mr Rios, who was shot and seriously wounded, is facing charges of influence peddling. He has denied wrongdoing.</p>

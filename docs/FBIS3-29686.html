Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: My visit is aimed at  strengthening the relations of good neighborliness, friendship,  and cooperation between Vietnam and Cambodia. The visit is also  aimed at making preparations for the forthcoming visit to  Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. Besides my talks with  Prince Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister and minister of  foreign affairs and international cooperation, I was also  received by First Prime Minister Ranariddh, Second Prime  Minister Hun Sen, and Chea Sim, acting chief of state and  chairman of the National Assembly. It is necessary to say that  talks and meetings between the Vietnamese and Cambodian  delegations proceeded in an atmosphere of frankness, sincerity,  and mutual understanding. The Cambodian leaders stressed the  long-standing relations of traditional friendship between the  two countries. In this spirit, the Cambodian leaders expressed  the confidence that all issues of bilateral relations can be  definitely resolved. We have discussed orientations and  measures aimed at accelerating bilateral relations. We have  exchanged views on the signing of agreements on economic, trade,  scientific-technological, cultural, and education cooperations.  We have also discussed cooperation in the fields of promoting  investment and avoiding double taxation. We have agreed that  efforts should be made to complete all essential work so that  these agreements can be signed during the official visit to  Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. The two sides expressed  the confidence that the upcoming visit to Vietnam by Cambodian  National Assembly Chairman Chea Sim and the official visit to  Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will open up a new stage  in the relations of friendship and cooperation between the two  nations.    We have agreed to settle the pending issues through  negotiations in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding.  These are issues related to the border demarcation and  Vietnamese residents in Cambodia which were discussed during the  visit to Vietnam by the two copremiers of the Cambodian  provisional government in August 1993. Concerning this issue,  both sides agreed that it is necessary to set up an essential  mechanism to exchange views and work out a solution for the  problem in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding. We  have also agreed to exchange visits by delegations of different  fields and levels between the two countries. During my meetings  with Cambodian officials, we discussed orientations, measures,  and other concrete issues in the field of bilateral relations.    Minister Nguyen Manh Cam stressed: During talks between the  Vietnamese and Cambodian delegations, both sides expressed the  common determination to strengthen and expand the relations of  good neighborliness and friendship and the multifaceted  cooperation for mutual interest. It is necessary to say that  these relations have developed on the basis of the principles  stipulated in the January 1992 Vietnam-Cambodia Joint Communique  and the August 1993 Vietnam- Cambodia Joint Statement. These  are the principles of respecting each other's national  independence, sovereignty, self-determination, and territorial  integrity. In summing up, my visit to Cambodia was a splendid  success. It is hoped that this visit will undoubtedly  contribute to strengthening, consolidating, and developing the  relations of traditional friendship and cooperation between the  two countries. I can say that these relations not only serve  the interests and meet requirements for development and  prosperity in each country, but also contribute to consolidating  the trend of peace, stability, and cooperation for development  in the region.    Afterward, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam answered  reporters' questions.    Answering an AFP correspondent's question on the mechanism  for resolving pending issues between the two nations, Minister  Nguyen Manh Cam said: We have planned to exchange delegations  at two levels, namely the specialist and governmental levels.  When the specialists complete all essential work, delegations  at governmental level will meet to make the final decision.    Dealing with an ASSOCIATED PRESS correspondent's question on  ethnic Vietnamese who were stuck in the Cambodia-Vietnam border  areas, Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: In our talks and meetings  with the Cambodian side, we asked the Cambodian Government to  take measures to resolve the issue of ethnic Vietnamese and  Vietnamese who live in Cambodia for a long time. These people  have fled to the border areas in the wake of the Khmer Rouge  massacre in the recent past. The Cambodian side said that they  will pay special attention to resolving this issue by studying  and taking essential measures to alleviate difficulties endured  by these ethnic Vietnamese.    Answering the Voice of America correspondent's question on  the Khmer Rouge's action of continuing to massacre ethnic  Vietnamese and Vietnamese residents in Cambodia, Minister Nguyen  Manh Cam stressed: Stemming from the relations of friendship  and cooperation, we believe that the government of the Kingdom  of Cambodia will take essential measures to stop this massacre.  I understand that this act of the Cambodian Government will  contribute to ensuring security for Cambodia itself, this is  because the massacre of foreigners in the country will directly  affect the security of Cambodia. Racial discrimination and  massacre only create complications to countries concerned while  causing losses to the nation with ethnic minorities. This is  because the ethnic minorities, in one way or another, have  contributed to economic building and developing of the country  of their residence. The Khmer Rouge's massacre of ethnic  Vietnamese has been and will be further condemned by world  public opinion.    Dealing with a REUTER correspondent's question on the  possibility of Vietnam selling weapons and military equipment to  Cambodia at the proposal of the Cambodian Government, Minister  Nguyen Manh Cam asserted: Vietnam has never engaged in arms  trading.</p>

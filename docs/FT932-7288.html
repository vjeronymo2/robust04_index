			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Challenge on power prices THE TWO main electricity generators for England and Wales were warned by the industry regulator yesterday that they might face a monopolies referral if they failed to explain adequately why their prices have risen since March. Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of the Office of Electricity Regulation (Offer), also said he was investigating complaints about the attitude of National Power, the main generator, to potential buyers of plant it plans to close. The two issues are among several potential areas of conflict between the regulator and the generators. Prof Littlechild, who is also investigating the generators' costs and margins, has said he will decide on a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission by 1995. 'Perhaps the decision will have to be taken earlier,' he said yesterday. A growing number of analysts believe a referral is inevitable, although some believe the regulator would be unwilling to let the future of the industry be decided by authorities outside his control. Prof Littlechild, publishing his annual report yesterday, said improvements in the industry since privatisation included a sharp reduction in domestic disconnections - down 62 per cent 1991 and 1992 - and the growth of electricity supply competition. The main area of difficulty was the market power of National Power and PowerGen, the two main generators, he said, even though competition was increasing through the expansion of independent power plants. He said he had received little response from the generators following his request three weeks ago for an explanation of price rises in the electricity wholesale pool this month and in April. 'I am treating this as a serious matter,' he said. 'It is extremely important that pool works efficiently.' Although he has also asked National Grid for an explanation of why pool-associated prices have risen, he said that company's role was not a cause for concern. Prof Littlechild also said he believed there was scope for development in the way the pool operated. Because prices were determined only by bids from the generators of electricity it was only 'half a market'. He said demand-side bidding, under which large users could be paid to reduce demand at short notice, could lead to more stability and efficiency. Prof Littlechild said he hoped to complete a review of price controls of the regional electricity companies' supply businesses by the end of June. Offer Annual Report 1992.

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MOOSE KNOCKS MUSHER OUT OF RACE LEAD;  </P> <P> IDITAROD: THE ANIMAL CHARGED FOUR-TIME WINNER RICK SWENSON'S TEAM, INJURING ONE  DOG.  </P> <P> A moose knocked four-time winner Rick Swenson out of the lead of the Iditarod  Trail Sled Dog Race today, stomping through his team and slowing him enough to  allow defending champion Joe Runyan to move in front.  </P> <P> Swenson had left McGrath hours before anyone else, but he turned back after the  run-in with the moose and waited for other racers to try their luck with the  animal.  </P> <P> A veterinarian checked out one of Swenson's injured dogs, which was pronounced  fit.  </P> <P> Nine other racers set out before dawn -- none reporting any more moose -- but  Swenson waited for daylight before returning to the trail, and that dropped him  to 10th place.  </P> <P> Swenson said he saw the moose ahead of him at the first river portage about a  mile out of McGrath and was trying to cross the river ahead of it.  </P> <P> "She was on the river," Swenson said. "It was just one of those normal races to  see who would get there first."  </P> <P> Swenson said he had hoped the moose would keep going, but it turned into his  team, trampling some of the dogs and turning them back on the sled.  </P> <P> While Swenson waited, the nine who set out included Runyan, Lavon Barve and  three-time winner Susan Butcher. Runyan was first into the next checkpoint 23  miles away at Takotna and headed on to Ophir, a ghost town left from  turn-of-the-century gold mining days.  </P> <P> Officials in McGrath rerouted the race through town because of deep snow along  the usual Kuskokwim River route.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Butcher came upon seventh-placed Tim Osmar as he fired shots into  the air to scare off a buffalo that would not leave the trail.  </P> <P> "Susan Butcher showed up in her red (snow) suit and that's what did it," Osmar  said. "She scared the buffalo right on."  </P> <P> Mushers are encountering some of the 800 animals that freely roam Alaska in  five herds.  </P> <P> In all, 18 of the 68 teams still in the endurance run from Anchorage to Nome  had pulled into McGrath by 6:30 a.m. today.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BAPTISM OF OIL, MALATHION GREENS O.C.'S LEGISLATORS  </P> <P> If the environmental movement were a tent revival meeting, the faithful would  be shouting hallelujahs.  </P> <P> That's because the non-believing legislators from Orange County -- recently  chastened by the sheen of oil on their beaches and the mist of malathion on  their constituents -- now say they have seen the light and are rushing to pass  a series of laws and resolutions that call for either spending money or  increasing government regulation to protect the environment.  </P> <P> The apparent conversion is especially ironic to longtime environmentalists, who  have come to regard Orange County legislators as bitter adversaries on issues  ranging from air pollution to preserving ancient forests.  </P> <P> "Both with the malathion and the oil spill, I think we've seen some  'born-again' environmentalists," said Mike Paparian, state director of the  Sierra Club.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) quipped: "Some of these Rip Van Winkles  are waking up, and I think it's good."  </P> <P> So far, county lawmakers have rushed to write or co-sponsor four bills and  resolutions in response to the state's aerial eradication effort against the  Mediterranean fruit fly, which began Nov. 30 in Brea, only to be expanded over  36 square miles around Garden Grove and Westminster by late January.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in reaction to the Feb. 7 oil spill off Huntington Beach -- an  environmental insult that made international news -- the Orange County  delegation has offered or co-authored five measures that take the  uncharacteristic approach of insisting on greater government regulation,  including a demand for double-hulled vessels and large fines against oil  companies involved in future spills.  </P> <P> The spate of legislative activity has underscored a decided greening of county  officials. With the exception of state Sens. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach)  and Cecil N. Greene (D-Norwalk), the rest of the delegation from the state's  third-largest county has earned such a bad reputation in environmental circles  that one activist recently called county legislators a "cancer in the state."  </P> <P> Especially repugnant to traditional environmentalists have been three county  assemblymen: Gil Ferguson of Newport Beach, Nolan Frizzelle of Huntington Beach  and Dennis Brown of Los Alamitos. Their votes on 40 issues last year were so  anti-environmental that the San Francisco-based California League of  Conservation Voters named them among the Legislature's "Filthy Five."  </P> <P> Brown, in particular, is known around the Capitol as a legislator who would  rather bite off his own hand than vote for government regulation or a tax  increase, which most environmental measures involve.  </P> <P> But several days after the American Trader ran over its own anchor and began to  ooze crude oil onto beaches in his district, Brown signed up as a co-author on  legislation that would stiffen regulation of tankers and impose large fines for  future spills.  </P> <P> "Yeah, it was a consequence" of the spill, Brown said, adding that he is not  enthralled with the measure. "Had it not been for the spill, I'm sure I would  not have signed onto it."  </P> <P> And Frizzelle, who was quick to blame environmentalist-inspired regulations for  the American Trader spill last month, ended up delighting those same people by  casting a key vote to get new tanker regulations out of an Assembly committee  two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "I didn't vote the way I voted to become some sort of environmentalist,"  Frizzelle said, adding that he supported the measure in exchange for some  promised changes down the line.  </P> <P> Not everyone from the county is jumping on the environmental bandwagon these  days, of course.  </P> <P> Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson (R-La Habra) said last week that it would  be "hypocritical" for him to raise a fuss about the malathion spraying because  he supported similar eradication efforts in Northern California.  </P> <P> "The neighbors, many of them, were out there covering their cars," he said  about the first malathion spraying of his home. "I said, 'The hell with it.' I  got the car washed a week later."  </P> <P> Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) has also declined to share in the spate of  county legislation. Lewis, who has one of the lowest environmental rankings in  the Legislature, did not return telephone calls last week.  </P> <P> Those signs are enough to make some mainstream environmentalists, such as Paula  Carrell of the Sierra Club, openly skeptical that any Orange County conversion  will stick.  </P> <P> A lobbyist for the 160,000-member Sierra Club, Carrell is quick to point out  that the delegation's "voting record clearly shows a lack of concern for  environmental values."  </P> <P> "Their sudden conversion is a reflection of the crisis in their back yards -- a  crisis that occurred because of a history of refusing to prevent the crisis in  the first place," Carrell said. "They only care when it is in their back yard,  but they don't care about the environment generally."  </P> <P> Lucy Blake, executive director of the 30,000-member League of Conservation  Voters, was a bit more charitable: "Clearly, when the oil began washing up on  the beach, there were a lot of brand-new environmentalists out there. At my  most optimistic, I can say I'm encouraged, and I'm glad we see a lot of people  concerned about these issues.  </P> <P> "Being more cynical, it might be fair to say that some of these people are  doing a little electioneering."  </P> <P> One legislator feeling the heat these days is Ferguson, who has drawn a serious  challenger in this year's Republican primary. The challenger, Phyllis Badham,  said she plans to use the environment as an issue against the former employee  of the Irvine Co.  </P> <P> Ferguson has consistently drawn the ire of the Conservation League and the  Sierra Club for sponsoring pro-development measures, including a 1986 bill that  would have nullified several local growth-control initiatives and gutted other  regulatory tools, such as open-space zones and density restrictions.  </P> <P> Ferguson also voted against the 1986 law that holds oil companies financially  responsible for spills -- the same law under which British Petroleum and its  tanker company paid for the cleanup in Ferguson's district.  </P> <P> In response to the spill, however, the avowed conservative said he is working  on two bills that would encourage the state to use new technology to clean up  future slicks, as well as train cleanup volunteers.  </P> <P> "I might not be your definition of an environmentalist, but I feel that I'm  sensitive to environmental concerns," said Ferguson, who is openly testy about  such inquiries.  </P> <P> "It's just that I want to balance them against economic concerns," he said.  "After all, people aren't falling dead in the streets. People are living longer  in America and California than ever in the history of mankind. People are  healthier today than they've ever been. People are stronger today than they've  ever been."  </P> <P> Less defensive about her environmental transformation is Assemblywoman Doris  Allen (R-Cypress), who readily admitted that she became an opponent of the  Medfly eradication program only because of malathion spraying taking place in  her 71st Assembly District.  </P> <P> "When your ox is gored, it becomes very real," Allen said. "You see the  reactions and the upset of the people in your district, and you begin to  experience their fear and their questions, and you experience them from your  neighbors and your family.  </P> <P> "I'll admit," she said, "malathion is an eye-opener."  </P> <P> Particularly illuminating, she said, was her 74-year-old mother being sprayed  with the pesticide when she ran out of her Lakewood home a couple of weeks ago  to look at the low-flying state helicopters. Allen's own home has been sprayed,  after which the lawmaker washed off her patio furniture.  </P> <P> Last year, according to voting records, Allen opposed key pesticide and toxic  control measures, including one that would have outlawed the use of 15  agricultural sprays linked with cancer. In years past, Allen has voted against  measures that would keep pesticides out of drinking water, toxic dumps away  from schools and require farmers to post warnings in pesticide-treated fields.  </P> <P> Within the past several weeks, however, Allen has appeared at a bipartisan  press conference to question the eradication program, which had existed for 10  years. She has signed a Feb. 26 letter of protest to Gov. George Deukmejian and  introduced legislation that would put up administrative hurdles -- including  72-hour advance notice and multilingual public notices -- before more spraying  could be conducted.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) has also reacted to the malathion  spraying in his district, and on his home, with a bill calling on the state to  spend $1 million extra to boost the production of sterile Medflies, from  100,000 to 250,000 flies a week. The extra supply of sterile insects, used to  reduce the number of the pest's offspring, would allow the state to stop  spraying altogether, Pringle said.  </P> <P> Would Pringle have considered such a measure if his district had not been  sprayed?  </P> <P> "Probably not," he said. "My job is to represent the people who elected me  here, and there was a tremendous outcry from the residents in my community,  expressing concern over the aerial spraying."  </P> <P> Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) admitted that he has made mistakes in past  anti-environmental votes. The former Anaheim mayor is locked in a bitter  statewide race for lieutenant governor with Bergeson, who opened her campaign  by trying to portray herself as more sympathetic than Seymour to environmental  issues.  </P> <P> Indeed, records show that Seymour voted against laws making oil companies pay  for oil spills, as well as setting aside $2.5 million to aid in those cleanups.  Bergeson voted for both.  </P> <P> Last year, however, both were ranked about even by the Conservation League for  their environmental votes, and Bergeson last week drew a dart from the group  for her vote to kill a bill to require local governments to make sure there are  enough roads, sewers and schools before approving new development.  </P> <P> Seymour said that his change of heart has been a gradual process accelerated by  the March, 1989, Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and  that the Huntington Beach spill reinforced his heightened concern.  </P> <P> Seymour last month introduced two measures, one of which requires state  officials to oversee the unloading of environmentally hazardous cargo in  coastal waters. Bergeson's oil spill measure would require that only  double-hulled tankers be allowed in state waters.  </P> <P> "Certainly, if I had known that Valdez would have occurred and the American  Trader would have occurred, then back in 1984 and 1985 I would have been voting  differently," Seymour said.  </P> <P> "We make mistakes. I make mistakes. I'm not going to always be right.  Therefore, to expect one to never change a position on an issue . . . is too  much to ask."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad), whose district includes San Clemente  and parts of Dana Point, said it is a "fair analysis" that malathion spraying  and the Huntington Beach spill have changed -- at least to some degree -- the  hearts of the Orange County delegation.  </P> <P> In a way, he said, the recent environmental episodes remind him of how old-time  local officials used to decide on where to put up stop signs around town: "The  old rule is you don't put up a stop sign unless you have a serious accident and  someone is killed.  </P> <P> "I don't believe that," Frazee said, "but that seems to be the rule in our  society, in our government."  </P> <P> GREEN POWER: ENVIRONMENTAL RECORDS OF O.C. LEGISLATORS  </P> <P> Orange County legislators' votes on selected environmental bills between 1984  and 1989. An F designates a vote in favor of a position taken by environmental  groups, while an O designates an opposing vote. A " -- " means the legislators  declined to vote, were absent or had not yet been elected.  </P> <P> The percentages reflect the number of times each legislator has voted in  agreement with environmental groups on 210 key environmental issues over the  last six years.  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> Doris Allen R-Cypress  </P> <P> Overall rating: 42%  </P> <P> PESTICIDES/TOXICS  </P> <P>

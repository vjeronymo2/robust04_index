			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE  </P> <P> "Revisionist Historian" Paul J. Bodnar's letter to The Times (July 9) was  highly typical of religious right-zoomed-out-weebies and their continued  attempts to present a reshapen historical fiction.  </P> <P> I'd like to remind Mr. Bodnar about that concept called "Separation of Church  and State." It is the view that these two channels of power should be kept  distinct. Now, our founding fathers were struck by this idea as being a rather  swell one, and subsequently used in the First Amendment to our Constitution,  thus keeping said powers separate, and preventing homogeneity between religious  sects.  </P> <P> I think this information adequately challenges Bodnar's allegation that "our"  churches are "the reserved place of honor and respect for the American flag."  </P> <P> MICHAEL T. DRAKE  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THANKS FOR HELPING A LADY IN DISTRESS  </P> <P> There are kind, helpful young men in our society!  </P> <P> While driving alone the morning of June 26 on the San Diego Freeway through the  Santa Monica Mountains, my car suddenly stopped.  </P> <P> After several cars and trucks went around me, a young man pulled up in front,  offered to call the CHP on his phone and immediately drove off. Next a van  stopped, three young men jumped out and pushed my car across an on-ramp to the  shoulder. They jumped back into their vehicle and off they went.  </P> <P> The CHP arrived and called the Automobile Assn. of America, which took care of  my problem.  </P> <P> I'll be forever grateful to these exceptional men who helped a lady in  distress.  </P> <P> IRENE N. BRUCKER  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Unions threaten BT with showdown on jobs The three unions representing staff at British Telecommunications warned yesterday that they would withdraw all co-operation if the company imposed any compulsory redundancies over the next few years. Their angry response followed disclosures by Sir Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, to the Financial Times that the company intends to shed a further 50,000 jobs on top of 90,000 which have already gone through voluntary severance over the past four years. Sir Iain made clear some job losses might have to be compulsory to bring the workforce to 100,000. The unions said yesterday: 'Over the past four years the BT unions have co-operated in reducing staffing by an un-precedented 90,000 jobs while supporting the company's commitment to maintain the highest quality of service to customers.' The three unions - the National Communications Union (NCU), the Union of Communication Workers (UCW) and the Society of Telecom Executives (STE) - added: 'This co-operation was conditional on any job losses being voluntary and achieved through a combination of a voluntary release package and redeployment opportunities.' They did not threaten strike action but warned they were 'determined to oppose any member of any union being made compulsorily redundant'. The STE will be particularly hard hit by further job losses. The union, which represents managers, is already committed by a conference decision to ballot for industrial action if compulsory redundancies are announced. The company wants to shed more than 6,000 of its 35,000 managers. Union officials fear that BT may announce compulsory job losses among the managerial grades later this month or in the early autumn. The NCU, which represents staff below managerial level, has a written understanding with BT that there will be no compulsory redundancies before the end of this financial year. That union has made clear that any resort to compulsion for job losses will lead to an immediate strike ballot.</p>

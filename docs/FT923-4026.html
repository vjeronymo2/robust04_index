			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / People: Walking innocently into Granada TV Charles Allen, the accountant with a management background in the catering and leisure industries who was yesterday appointed chief executive of Granada Television, has one essential qualification for his new job. He has walked down Coronation Street, the set for Granada's most famous television programme. His former job - chief executive of Granada Leisure - included responsibility for studio tours of the set. Allen, a 35-year-old Scotsman who has worked for GrandMet and the Compass Vending Group, is the first to admit he has no experience of television but will start to learn on his arrival this morning. He expects to be challenging everything - asking what everything costs and how it's done. 'Innocence is wonderful. You are allowed to ask questions,' he says. After talks with programme makers, Allen will be drawing up a plan for the future of Granada Television over the next six months. 'I shall very much be looking to see how we can take the business forward,' he says, emphasising his skills as 'a good leader and negotiator'. He will clearly be looking to find the most appropriate structure for the television company at a time when all British television is going through an era of tension and change. Allen is involved with Business in the Community and has recently worked on a management development project chaired by the Prince of Wales. He replaces Andrew Quinn who is leaving Granada to become the first chief executive of the ITV Association. Quinn in turn replaced David Plowright who was forced to resign at the beginning of this year. ***** Douglas O'Brien was yesterday named the new president and chief executive of Bank of Ireland First Holdings Inc (BOIFH), the loss-making New Hampshire subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland. He replaces Bill Marshall who announced his retirement two months ago, after two years in the job. O'Brien, 53, leaves a senior post at National Westminster's US subsidiary, National Westminster Bancorp, where, as senior executive vice president, he held responsibility for its Dollars 23bn US retail banking operations. Bank of Ireland has lost some Dollars 260m in the US since it took over First New Hampshire bank in 1988. It is currently integrating two other banks - Amoskeag and Bank-East - into the BOIFH holding company, which is being supervised by a senior Bank of Ireland executive Des O'Reilly. In its half-year results BOIFH reported that it 'is still on schedule to achieve fully its target cost savings of Dollars 40m by October 1992'. ***** English China Clays' chief executive Andrew Teare celebrated his 50th birthday yesterday by adding another heavyweight name to his board of directors. Sir Christopher Harding, the 52-year-old chairman of BET, is the third non-executive director to join the English China Clays boardroom in the past four months and his arrival completes the recent strengthening of the ECC board, says Teare. Sir Christopher, a long-time director of Hanson who recently stepped down as chairman of British Nuclear Fuels, joins Rank Organisation managing director, Michael Gifford, and ICI executive director, Rob Margetts, on the board. Teare, who has recently been appointed a non-executive of the Prudential Corporation, says that his company has used a variety of processes to find its new non-executive directors. It was looking for non-execs who were active in their own companies and came from similar sized but complementary businesses. In the case of Harding, it is understood that ECC went through an intermediary. Teare's aim is to have executive and non-executive directors in roughly equal balance on his board. Each director has been appointed for a three-year term with the option of a second term. 'Cadbury would be proud of us,' says Teare, referring to Sir Adrian Cadbury's recent report on corporate governance. ***** For a relatively young financial institution, the 18-month-old European Bank for Reconstruction and Development continues to have an above average turnover of staff in its public relations department. James Rosenstein, 46, is the latest to head for the exit. He is leaving his job as the EBRD's chief press and public affairs officer to become director of communications for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, which represents 14 manufacturers. When Barbara Ann Clay, formerly public affairs director at the US Treasury, took on the role of the EBRD's chief spokesperson earlier this year, she was the fourth person to handle the EBRD's relations with the outside world.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from "NHK News 7" program] </F>   [Text] At the meeting of the ruling coalition parties'  representatives today, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and  Komeito suggested that the ruling parties should be reorganized  into one party to facilitate electoral cooperation. It was  decided that the ruling parties' representatives' meeting would  serve as the venue for coordinating views on electoral  cooperation and realignment of political parties.    During today's meeting, Shinseito representative Deputy  Secretary General Kozo Watanabe, Komeito Secretary General  Yuichi Ichikawa, and Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] Secretary  General Takashi Yonezawa commented on the Social Democratic  Party of Japan's [SDPJ] plan to unite the social democratic and  liberal forces. They said that if there is no plan for the  ruling parties to become one party in the future, electoral  cooperation will not be possible in the upper house elections  scheduled for summer 1995. They also pointed out that even in  the lower house elections, it would be impossible to cooperate  in the single-seat constituencies while competing in the  proportional-representation constituencies. They indicated that  it is necessary for the ruling parties to aim to form a new-new  party [shin shin to] to campaign effectively in the forthcoming  elections.    In response, SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo said, it is  still a viable method of electoral cooperation for the ruling  parties to coordinate on the choice of candidates and cooperate  with each other in the elections. He stated that it is not  possible to proceed right away to form a new-new party.    In light of these differing views, the ruling coalition  parties decided to use representatives' meetings or party heads'  meetings as venues to coordinate views on electoral cooperation,  and to discuss the closely-related issue of the realignment of  political parties for the time being.</p>

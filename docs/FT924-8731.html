			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Pressure growing for Mexican electoral reform: Nafta and the economy are causing problems for Salinas too FOR President Carlos Salinas of Mexico, now entering his fifth year in office, these are anxious times. The country's current account deficit widened earlier this year just as foreign capital dried up, forcing the government to raise interest rates to ensure continued inflows of finance and to slow growth. Pressure is intensifying on Mr Salinas to reform a political system which has ensured that the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has held power for 63 years. While this agenda includes a reform of the party that brought him to office, he has to be careful that the reforms do not so split the PRI that it loses the 1994 presidential election. Further complicating matters, his friend and ally to the north - President George Bush - has been voted out of office, adding to uncertainty over one of Mr Salinas's central policies, the North American Free Trade Agreement. Without Nafta's ratification, Mr Salinas will be seen to have lost his biggest gamble. The issues facing Mr Salinas are linked. If Mexico's regional politics degenerate into violence in the coming year, it will hurt the chances for ratification of Nafta. Without Nafta, the level of investment required to sustain growth and the current account deficit will be difficult to achieve. Without an upturn in growth in 1994, the prospects for the PRI in the presidential elections will be weakened. Mr Salinas will have at the very least a central role in choosing the PRI's presidential candidate next year even if, as seems unlikely, the traditional dedazo - the presidential nomination which has in the past effectively appointed the next president - is diluted to give the rank and file of the party a bigger say. Before then, he will want to defuse the controversies which have followed the election of PRI candidates for a handful of state governorships. Mr Salinas is widely held to have intervened to replace the governors, the latest in the state of Michoacan, following protests about alleged fraud from the left-of-centre Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Such protests have fatally weakened the credibility of Mexico's electoral rules, while the gubernatorial resignations have divided the PRI rank and file, and strengthened the opposition. With less than two years before the presidential election, Mr Salinas needs to change the system fast. In his state of the union address this month Mr Salinas outlined his strategy to defuse this tension, through further reform of the federal electoral system to provide a model which will be followed by the states. The proposals are expected to be passed into law next year. According to government officials, the proposals include ceilings on private campaign contributions and expenditure, more public funding, auditing of campaign revenue, rules to ensure fair access to the news media, in particular television, and greater independence for the bodies overseeing the election. Parties will have the right to veto who sits on the electoral bodies. Although reforms are unlikely to satisfy the PRD - the advantage of incumbency is so huge in Mexico that a level playing field for all parties may be impossible to secure - Mr Salinas's more immediate problem may be the damaging effect on morale of PRI party members. Many PRIistas are already hugely dissatisfied with the way Mr Salinas has undermined their power, and the president is still calling for further reform of the party, in its finances, ideology, candidate selection and internal structure. The reform, he told the Financial Times, 'has not finished, it has to go further, and the elements have to be defended as such as part of a deepening process of reform'. The state of the union address also gave clues about how Mr Salinas would approach economic problems. There was an unequivocal commitment that fiscal policy would not be loosened in an attempt to accelerate growth. The government plans a budget surplus next year to follow this year's. Furthermore, government officials say other economic reforms can be expected. These include a simplification of the 1973 foreign investment law, which will leave foreign investment excluded from only a small number of industries viewed as strategic. The government is also working on plans to make the central bank independent, a significant step likely to be interpreted positively by financial markets and business. 'I'm convinced that a strong professional and experienced central bank is essential for any process of reform,' said the president, hinting at a change other government officials say is forthcoming. The government hopes these and other measures will consolidate and institutionalise the economic reforms it has already passed. 'We must emphatically make this deep process of reform part of the everyday life of the population. 'That's when the reforms become institutionalised. Then they won't depend on individuals for them to be successful or permanent. Institutional reform is a fundamental element,' Mr Salinas said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Poland finds itself in a lucky period,  where there are no real threats, Jerzy Milewski, the deputy  minister of national defense, said at a specially organized  discussion meeting at the National Defense Ministry [MON] on  Polish defense policy.    Another participant in the discussion, Andrzej Karkoszka, a  department director in MON, pointed at the danger for Europe  that ensues from conflicts of the so-called old type--that is,  national, ethnic, and religious ones. In his opinion, hopes to  prevent such conflicts should be attached with UN and CSCE  actions.    [Begin recording of unidentified official] Poland cannot  build its own security around its borders on its own. Poland  must base this security upon a broader system: from the global  one, through the regional--that is, the continental one--to a  subregional one. We know that every greater conflict in Europe  rolled across Poland or involved Poland, and vice versa. We  hope that our security, in connection with the above, will be  linked to that broader security. [end recording]    [Announcer] The small budget of the Defense Ministry was  pointed out in the discussion. It was recalled that an average  Pole pays 10 times less for defense than a German citizen.  Asked if Poland can afford to modernize its Armed Forces, which  would help give us full NATO membership, Minister Milewski  replied:    [Begin Milewski recording] There are no defined requirements  by the NATO side concerning the size of our defense budget. On  the other hand, we know the size of the financial burden carried  by societies in countries that are current NATO members. We  believe that, if 3 percent of the gross national product is  assigned for the Polish Republic's defense budget, and if we  have some sort of an assurance that this figure will be  maintained in the next five to 10 years, we will find that such  an amount, albeit a minimal one, will be sufficient to meet our  aims.

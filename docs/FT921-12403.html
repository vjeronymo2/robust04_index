			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Li Peng ends isolation with four-nation visit CHINA'S Prime Minister Li Peng arrived in Rome last night on his first trip to the west since the 1989 crackdown in Beijing on pro-democracy protests. The tour takes him to the United Nations and four European countries, Reuter reports from Beijing. Li is accompanied by his wife and Qian Qichen, foreign minister. Li Lanqing, minister for foreign trade, is also in the party, according to the official New China News Agency. In Rome, hundreds marched on Saturday to denounce the Italian government for becoming the first western country to receive Li since the army's attack on protesters in Tiananmen Square. The Chinese leader will spend two days in Italy before attending the World Economic Forum that opens on January 30 in Davos, Switzerland. On January 31 he will attend a special summit of the United Nations Security Council in New York. He rounds off his trip with visits to Portugal from February 2 to 4 and Spain from February 4 to 6.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Kissinger had BNL business links: Former secretary of state resigned from bank's advisory board MR HENRY KISSINGER who heads the international consulting firm - Kissinger Associates - had business links with Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the Italian bank whose branch in Atlanta, Georgia made Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in unauthorised loans to Iraq, according to Mr Henry Gonzalez, the chairman of the US House Banking Committee. BNL's activities in the US are at the centre of a wide-ranging congressional inquiry into how its funds were used to buy militarily useful US technology and equipment until as late as June 1990, a few weeks before the invasion of Kuwait. Mr Kissinger last night denied knowledge of the improper Iraqi loans. The former US Secretary of State confirmed, however, that he served until early this year as a paid member of BNL's international advisory board along with distinguished British public figures. Mr Kissinger resigned the BNL position on February 22, 1991 because of the BNL Atlanta scandal. Mr Kissinger said last night: 'I didn't have any idea of what BNL was doing in Iraq. All I know was what I read in the papers. I resigned earlier this year because I don't want to be connected, I don't want to be asked about this sort of question.' Congressman Henry Gonzalez, the Texan Democrat investigating the BNL affair, also claimed that Kissinger Associates advised US companies exporting to Iraq, several of which were BNL-financed. Kissinger Associates is an international consultancy with blue-chip clients such as Midland bank, advising on political and commercial risk. Among its early recruits were Mr Brent Scowcroft, currently President George Bush's national Security Adviser, as well as Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, a veteran diplomat, currently deputy US secretary of state. Both resigned on taking office in 1989. In a lengthy statement on the floor of the House of Representatives, Mr Henry Gonzalez described how Mr Alan Stoga, a present Kissinger Associates executive, met Mr Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in June 1989. At the meeting, Mr Saddam apparently expressed interest in expanding commercial relations with the US. 'Many Kissinger Associates clients received US export licences for exports to Iraq. Several were also the beneficiaries of BNL loans to Iraq,' said Mr Gonzalez. In response, Mr Kissinger said his firm 'derived no income from Iraq'. To his knowledge, Mr Stoga did not advise Iraq on any financial matters, but he recalled that Mr Stoga told him that he was identified at the Saddam meeting 'as an expert on debt and could advise.' The former US secretary of state, who has rarely spoken about his clients or his business, said that his firm would not have interceded with the US government to secure export licences for clients, but that 'it is possible that somebody may have advised a client on how to get a licence.' In his Congressional statement, Mr Gonzalez said Mr Eagleburger, who worked for Kissinger Associates until two years ago, served on the board of Ljubljanksa Bank (LBS), the Yugoslav bank. He revealed that Federal Reserve investigators have found that between 1986 and August 1989 'BNL fuelled a significant amount of LBS's growth in the US with 20 to 25 per cent of LBS's business from BNL.' Among Mr Eagleburger's past clients was Enerjoprojeckt, a Yugoslavian construction company that built several large projects in Iraq, Mr Gonzalez said. Mr Gonzalez said he wished to make clear that he was not accusing anyone of any illegalities.</p>

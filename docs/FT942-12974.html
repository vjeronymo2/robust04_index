			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / American money brings new risks to markets American investors made more than doubled net purchases of Dollars 67.8bn (Pounds 45bn) of foreign equities in 1993. That was actually a bigger total than the aggregate net acquisition of non-US stocks by Americans in the whole decade of the 1980s. Such statistics, just released by the Securities Industry Association, provide dramatic evidence of how the globalisation of portfolio investment is transforming the world's capital markets. No wonder the financial economist Mr Henry Kaufman has warned this week of the inadequacy of regulatory institutions to cope with new risks. Much greater volatility of securities prices will be a consequence, he says. Of the Dollars 67.8bn almost half went into Europe, with much of the rest split between Latin America (Dollars 12bn) and Asia (Dollars 17bn). Although Hong Kong (Dollars 6bn) received a large proportion of the publicity and glamour, Mexico (Dollars 5bn) received almost as much capital. The rush of foreign companies to raise capital through Dollars 10bn of American Depositary Receipt offerings may have influenced the country allocations, especially towards Latin America: in all, the emerging markets (not including Hong Kong) claimed Dollars 14bn of net equity investment. Out of 20 countries only Ireland is listed as the source of net repatriation by US investors. Americans were also eager buyers of bonds, with a threefold increase to Dollars 60.8bn net. Here Europe had much greater dominance at Dollars 55bn. Despite all the hyping of Latin American fixed-interest paper it seems that only Mexico (at Dollars 6bn) attracted substantial amounts of capital. As for flows in the reverse direction, foreigners bought Dollars 21.5bn of US equities in 1993, after being net sellers in 1992. They were rather bigger buyers of bonds, however, to the tune of more than Dollars 90bn. So for all the cross-border rush by US pension funds and mutual funds the overall net purchase of securities by the US was a comparatively trivial Dollars 17bn in 1993 (actually only the second year since 1980 that the chronically low-saving Americans have been net exporters of portfolio capital). The statistics do not explain the disappointing performance of the dollar over the past year. About half of the overseas equity purchases by US investors may be attributable to pension funds, the rest to mutual funds and other shorter-term institutions. As for bonds, pension funds appear to have played a smaller role, with the emphasis instead on mutual funds, hedge funds and other short-term players. In fact the bond outflows were already tailing away sharply in the final quarter and the global bond market tumble in the first quarter of 1994 no doubt reflected attempts to withdraw. Such cross-border flows are enormous by past standards: in the mid-1980s, year after year, US net purchases of foreign stocks and bonds combined were under Dollars 10bn. Growing correlation of market movements is a clear consequence, with European bonds, for instance, tracking the gyrations of dollar bonds even though the cyclical economic background is very different. Last year's feature was the export from the US of volatility: instead of marginal savings flooding into US equities, which rose only 7 per cent in 1993, they went abroad to Europe, Latin America and Asia, where markets rose by up to 100 per cent (the World ex US Index rose 30 per cent). Mr Kaufman's worries focus on the potential instability of this rootless investment capital. Bond mutual funds in the US, for instance, increased from Dollars 20bn in 1982 to more than Dollars 700bn today, with investors shifting from savings deposits to riskier domestic bonds and now towards global bonds. They have the right, in theory anyway, to sell any time a panic grips them. The same applies, in spades, to stock funds, worth another Dollars 700bn. Hence Mr Kaufman's suggestion that 60 to 90 days' withdrawal notice should be phased in for stock and bond mutual funds, starting with new purchases. Investors attracted partly by instant dealing facilities should understand that investments in long-term securities markets are not like instant access accounts. But they would have to decide whether the pleasure of travelling hopefully was justified by the risk of arriving in the wrong market and being stuck there for three agonising months.</p>

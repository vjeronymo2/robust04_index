			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Letter: Nuclear Electric making fossil generators nervous Sir, Lex (September 2) was right on power prices and the real costs of electricity. The nuclear levy question is certainly a diversion from the larger issues - but it's a diversion which has attracted both PowerGen and Offer over the last couple of days, with both calling simplistically for a cut in our levy rate. Nuclear Electric's response to remarks by Prof Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, at the Energy Intensive Users' Group is quite clear. The following is an extract of a letter I have sent to him. 'You state that in a competitive market customers would not have to bear 'the higher costs of nuclear electricity'. This simple statement is fanciful, and fails to address policy issues relating to the way the privatisation was structured, the real costs of other fuels and the other subsidies hidden in the market. You also avoid the issue of who will bear the costs of nuclear provisions if the customer does not. I find it strange that you propose to go on record as suggesting that customers should not meet the full costs of the electricity they consume.' Offer, of course, was merely responding to pressure brought to bear by others. Which brings us back to PowerGen. Ed Wallis is very free with advice  -and Nuclear Electric's money - and may even have reaped some short-term PR kudos as a result, by claiming to have devised a mechanism which would even support British coal. But is this not the same Ed Wallis who is investing almost Pounds 40m on Merseyside, building a facility to import 5m tonnes of foreign coal a year, at the kind of prices which would allow him to offer cheap electricity to the major energy users? The truth is that Nuclear Electric is now enjoying record output and market share, with costs consistently coming down, and the fossil generators are becoming more nervous. Our financial arrangements are transparent to all - unlike theirs. I'm delighted that we have been singled out for such special attention - it is a commercial compliment to our success.

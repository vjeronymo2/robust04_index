			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD clearly rejects the latter suggestion. Coverage of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 8 housing project under subtitle D must be based on evidence that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project was originally designed primarily for seniors, not solely on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner's ``belief'' that it was designed primarily for seniors. HUD also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> declines to adopt the commenter's first suggestion. While some ``housing for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> older persons,'' as this term is defined in 24 CFR part 100, subpart E, could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also constitute section 8 housing that is covered by subtitle D, some would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD emphasizes that the list of primary and secondary documents are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to be all inclusive, but rather provide examples of the types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents that would be acceptable. The language of the rule itself expresses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that intent by referring in both cases to ``sources  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> such as <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' (emphasis added)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before listing the examples. (See &sect;880.612a(b)(1) (i) and (ii) and comparable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections in other parts covered by this rule.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that documents that indicate approval of a project's final proposal frequently spell out the intended nature of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project, yet these documents may not qualify ``as any other underwriting or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial document collected at or before loan closing.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in the response to the preceding comment, the list of sources does not exclude other sources such as a ``final proposal'' approved by HUD. To avoid any implication that the source list is limited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underwriting or financial documents, the word ``other'' has been removed from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section (e.g., see &sect;880.612a(b)(1)(i) and comparable sections in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts covered by this rule).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the language of the interim rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that there could be five primary sources that demonstrate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project's eligibility and one which indicates otherwise in which case the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner would be required to turn to secondary sources to establish a project's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility. The commenter states that requiring an owner to look to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary sources, which are inferior to primary sources, when a majority of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources indicate that the project was designed primarily for occupancy by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly families does not make sense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD agrees with the commenter that requiring an owner to look at secondary sources when a majority of primary sources ``demonstrate'' the original design of the project does not make sense, but disagrees that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule indicates that this is the course of action that an owner would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follow. The critical language in the rule is ``clear evidence'' of original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design. The rule states that ``In any case where the primary sources do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> clear evidence  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of original design of the project for occupancy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily by elderly families, including those cases where primary documents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the use for which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project was originally designed.'' (Emphasis added.) (See 24 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 880.612a(b)(2) and comparable provisions in other parts covered by this rule.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establishing original design, therefore, is not simply a matter of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the numbers fall; that is, establishing original design is not a matter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of counting how many documents favor a project originally designed for seniors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and how many documents oppose such design. The focus is to be on the type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence located and how clearly the evidence may address the issue of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original design. If one primary source clearly (unambiguously) establishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original design of a seniors project, and one or more other primary sources do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not specifically address the original design of the project and are ambiguous,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the owner need not look to secondary sources to establish a project's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility. In this case, the owner may rely on the single primary source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that establishes clear evidence of a project originally designed for seniors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conversely, the single primary source may clearly establish that the project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not originally designed for seniors. Again, however, where the primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources conflict (i.e., are equally ambiguous or equally specific), the owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must go to secondary sources. An example of a document that clearly specifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the project's original design could be the market studies projecting occupancy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by seniors on which underwriting decisions were made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the documentation concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project's identity must take into account the definitions of ``elderly family'' and ``elderly person'' as this term has been used over the past several years to include ``persons with disabilities.'' The commenter stated that ``documents using the words `elderly person' or `elderly family' must be viewed as evidence of an intent to serve people 62 years of age and older and people with disabilities.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD disagrees with the commenter, and addressed this issue in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule. (59 FR 22917&hyph;22918) Because one of the previous definitions of ``elderly families'' in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act included disabled families, it is not clear from documents that indicate a project was developed for ``elderly families'' whether the project for elderly families was intended to mean housing for the broader eligible category of elderly families (i.e., elderly families and disabled families) or housing for families who qualified by virtue of age alone. Thus a document's statement that the project is a project for elderly families, in and of itself, would not constitute clear evidence which category of family was to be served, i.e., the broader category of elderly family or the family who qualified by age alone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the final rule must explicitly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require owners to make available for inspection by applicants, tenants and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their advocates, all relevant documents regarding elderly-only designation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including any conflicting documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim rule provided that the owner, if challenged on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the issue of eligibility of the project for the election, ``must be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support the project's eligibility through the production of supporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence.'' (See &sect;880.612a(a)(2)(i) and comparable sections in other parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by this rule.) HUD has revised this language in the final rule to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that the owner, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project for the election, must be able to support the project's eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the production of all relevant documentation in the owner's possession  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that pertains to the original design of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the final rule must explicitly allow individual States to decide the question of how State law will regulate a permissive election of elderly selection preferences because subtitle D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits the election ``notwithstanding any other provision of law.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that the following language be included in the rule:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Nothing in this rule is intended to limit any State or local law that affords disabled families greater access than the minimum required by this section to projects eligible for the preference provided by this section, nor is it intended to relieve an owner of fair housing obligations imposed by State or local law.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``notwithstanding any other provision of law'' language of subtitle D (see first sentence of sections 651 and 652 of subtitle D; 42 U.S.C. 13611 and 13612) is not intended, as indicated by the commenter, to restrict or limit implementation of the elderly preference as authorized by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtitle D by requiring an owner to ensure that implementation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtitle D preferences is not inconsistent with other statutes and regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may address the issue of the degree of access to covered section 8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing by non-elderly persons with disabilities. The ``notwithstanding any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other provision of law'' is intended to do just the opposite, which is to allow an owner of a covered section 8 project to implement the subtitle D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferences and reservation of units in the manner authorized by subtitle D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without concern whether other laws may provide for a different implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an elderly preference, or a greater percentage of units to be reserved for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-elderly disabled persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the final rule must make clear that a zero reservation of units for disabled families is unacceptable. Two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters objected to the statement in the preamble to the May 3, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule that if a covered project did not have any disabled families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residing in the project on the two dates specified in the statute, the owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be required to reserve any units for disabled families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subtitle D clearly allows for zero reservation of units. The statute does not impose a minimum percentage of units to be reserved for nonelderly disabled families, and the subtitle D rule reflects this statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheme. Subtitle D (section 652(b) of the HCD Act of 1992) provides as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Number of Units <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Each owner required to reserve units in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project for occupancy under subsection (a) shall reserve a number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of units in the project that is not less than the lesser of_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) the number of units equivalent to the higher of_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) the percentage of units in the project that were occupied by such disabled families upon the date of enactment of this Act; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) the percentage of units in the project that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were occupied by such families upon January 1, 1992;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) 10 percent of the number of units in the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

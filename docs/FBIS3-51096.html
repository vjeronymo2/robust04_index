In these assemblies, everyone has the  opportunity to give his opinion on different aspects of our  economy and finances. Juan Bautista, a worker at this factory,  answered questions asked by our reporter, Roberto Cavada.    [Cavada] One of the topics that came up in this assembly,  which has been called the Workers Parliament, today here in the  Miguel Fernandez Tobacco Factory was the issue of whether money  of dubious origin, accumulated in great quantities by small  sectors of the population, should be confiscated. I was very  interested in the opinion that Juan Bautista expressed to the  rest of his comrades and I have asked him to express that  opinion for the rest of the Cuban people. What is your opinion,  Juan?    [Bautista] We believe that this money of dubious origin  should be confiscated, especially since the money was obtained  illegally and by exploiting the needs of the workers due to the  situation that the country is currently facing.    [Cavada] How would you determine who obtained it through  dubious means and who obtained it through legal means and hard  work?    [Bautista] This is simple. No worker can have 200,000 pesos  stashed in the bank or in his home.    [Cavada] Another of the questions that was asked today in  your factory and which was debated by the workers concerned the  price policy [politica de precio] that the country should  follow. What is your opinion?    [Bautista] Marx established that the principle of  socialistic  distribution was not entirely fair but that it was the only  principle realistically applicable to socialism. In other words,  everyone should contribute according to his capacity and receive  according to his work. The price policy would fulfill this  principle of distribution that applies and should apply in  socialism. Each person should contribute to society according to  his capacity and should receive according to his work. This  principle should allow him to have access to determined products  that could be offered.    [Cavada] Juan, in a nutshell, as an old tobacco worker, how  do you think the state can confront the excess of currency and  restructure the economy?    [Bautista] I believe the way to confront the excess of  currency is by increasing production. At the moment, we must  take steps to overcome the situation; in other words, find an  equilibrium between the amount of currency and the amount of  goods available. The definite solution to this problem is to  increase production and the efficiency of our enterprises. I  believe one of the topics that was analyzed at the assembly was  subsidies to the enterprises. I believe inefficient enterprises  should not be subsidized. I believe every enterprise director,  together with the labor union and the rest of the organizations,  should find the way for those enterprises to become efficient.    [Cavada] That is the opinion of Cuban workers. This is the  case of Juan Bautista, an longtime tobacco worker, who continues  to produce and give his opinion at the Miguel Fernandez Factory  where today began what the Cuban Workers Federation has called  the Workers Parliament.</p>

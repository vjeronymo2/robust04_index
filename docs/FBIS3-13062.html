Both, however, have expressed willingness to purchase  unspecified quantities of national gas from Iran and try to  reschedule Iran's debts to them.    The Iranian proposal first came from President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani at the beginning of PRC Vice Premier and  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's three-day visit which ended  yesterday. Hashemi-Rafsanjani then made the same proposal to  Indian Foreign Minister Dinesh Singh, who is currently in Tehran  for economic talks.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani's plan calls for the creation of an axis  through which Iran, Pakistan, India, the PRC, and Japan would  form a bloc opposed to U.S. hegemony.    The Iranian president told his Chinese and Indian guests  that  Washington's current "provocations" against Japan on trade  matters should persuade Japan to join such a grouping.    A senior Pakistani diplomat said yesterday that the Iranian  idea is nothing more than "a far from serious illusion." He  added that Hashemi-Rafsanjani last year suggested a similar plan  when Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto visited Tehran.    A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday that  his  government had not received any Iranian official proposal for  the formation of an Asian defense pact.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani had hoped to persuade Qichen and Singh to  meet with their Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati with a  view to issuing a joint statement about the creation of the "new  axis," but the two ministers refused to meet with one another.  A highly-placed Iranian diplomat said that "the initiative did  not evoke the required reactions, but we made good progress on  the Kashmir issue." After meeting with Singh,  Hashemi-Rafsanjani dropped his traditional calls for the full  implementation of the UN resolutions on Kashmir. Intead he  supported New Delhi's call for negotiations between India and  Pakistan to resolve the issue "in the interest of the people of  Kashmir and the entire region."    Iran is known to owe the PRC and India $2 billion and hopes  the two countries will agree to reschedule the debts along the  same lines as the agreement Tehran concluded with Bonn.    Iranian and Western diplomatic sources confirmed yesterday  that both Qian Qichen and Singh explained to the Iranian leaders  that their countries will not cooperate with Iran militarily  unless Iran pays what it owes for past arms purchases.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["GV" report: "Prime Minister Aho Visits Murmansk"] </F>   [Text] Representatives of Finnish trade and industry are  keen to learn about the development plans of the Murmansk region  and possibilities of direct trading. These wishes were  presented to the leaders of the Murmansk region on Monday by  Prime Minister Esko Aho (Center Party), at the beginning of a  two-day visit to Murmansk. Prime Minister Aho arrived in  Murmansk with an official delegation and a large trade  delegation on Monday afternoon. He was met by Jevgeniy Komarov,  governor of the Murmansk region.    Aho and Komarov held a brief discussion on Monday before  rushing off to a seminar dealing with current and future  cooperation projects. This seminar was attended by Finnish  officials and business people.    Governor Komarov, who held the opening speech at the  seminar,  pointed out that Aho's visit to Murmansk was the first one made  by a Finnish prime minister. It was, according to him, no  coincidence that the visit came so soon after President Martti  Ahtisaari's visit to Moscow. Aho also stressed that the  multiple visits this year had been instrumental in developing  relations between Finland and Russia. Aho had already visited  St. Petersburg and Carelia. In his opinion, these visits are  indicative of Finland's genuine interest in a cooperation with  its neighboring regions. The visit is a response to the  constructive criticism made earlier by Governor Komarov  concerning the Finns' interest in the Murmansk region. This is  why the prime minister's working visit includes a business  delegation of 20 persons with management representatives from  small- and medium-sized companies. According to Aho, Finnish  companies want certain basic infrastructures in Murmansk to  improve. He mentioned the issue of transport communications, a  relaxation of border controls, more efficient banking and  financing systems, and better data communications. In addition,  Aho said that Finnish companies have two general requests.  First, they want more information about the development plans  of the Murmansk region and the possibility for enterprises to  use foreign currency in trading. Second, they need information  about direct foreign trade opportunities. Aho stated that the  Finns are potentially interested in the utilization of the  Murmansk region's natural resources. After the seminar, Aho and  a small part of his delegation set off on a fishing trip on the  Ponoj river in the East of the Kola Peninsula.  <H5>  Investment Guarantees </H5>   Martin Saarikangas, CEO of Kvaerner Masa-Yards and head of  the commercial delegation, also wanted guarantees for foreign  investments. Such guarantees could take the form, for instance,  of natural resources or land areas. According to Governor  Komarov, a regulation with regard to the protection of invested  capital in the Murmansk region is being prepared. Finnish  business leaders at the seminar were pariticularly interested in  the natural resources of the continental shelf, more  particularly, the presence of natural gas in Sjtokmanovskoje [as  received]. Neste CEO Kai Hietarinta pointed out that the issue  was not only oil or gas, but also transportation, ship repairs,  and terminals. Hietarinta said that the Finns are cooperating  with the autonomous region of Nenetsia [as received] and  expressed his hope for an increased cooperation between Nenetsia  and the Murmansk region.  <H5>  Neste Ships Under Russian Flag </H5>   Neste also has shipping plans in the Arctic area. On Monday,  the board of Neste decided to charter one of the company's ships  to a joint venture enterprise in Murmansk to sail under Russian  flag. A law is being prepared in Russia which will give Russian  ships the sole right to Arctic transports, and Neste's strategy  therefore is to put its ships under Russian flag.</p>

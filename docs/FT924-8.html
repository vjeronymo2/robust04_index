			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow finishes flat after morning rally Wall Street US EQUITY prices finished nearly flat yesterday afternoon after a brief morning rally ebbed in dull pre-holiday trading, with traders disregarding the day's economic statistics in favor of year-end portfolio adjustments, writes Laurie Morse. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 10.27 at 3,321.11 on volume of 185m shares. Advancing issues led decliners by 1,049 to 763. The Dow took some support from gains in IBM and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, two blue chip stocks which recovered slightly after being battered early in the week. IBM closed  3/8 igher at 50 1/8 and 3M was up  1/4 at 100 3/8 . IBM was the second most active stock of the day, rallying on news it had won a Dollars 3bn 10-year contract to provide information services to defense contractor McDonnell Douglas. On Tuesday the Dow had closed down 22.42 points at 3,310.84. Among broader market measures, the Standard and Poors 500 index rose 0.83 to 438.81, the American Stock Exchange composite rose 1.92 to 395.75 and the Nasdaq composite was up 2.84 to close at a record 671.85. News that the Chicago Purchasing Managers' survey of US economic conditions rose to an adjusted 59.8 in December, from 54 in November, forshadowed a bullish national report next week, and underscored traders expectations for a gradually improving US economy. The survey is used as a barometer of business confidence, and any reading above 50 generally indicates an expanding economy. 'This is all very good news, so long as it doesn't get too good,' said Mr. Larry Wachtel, market analyst with Prudential Securities. 'If it gets too good, it will make bond yields go up, and that will make stock prices go down.' The US November index of leading economic indicators underscored the slow-but-steady growth scenario for the stock market. The index rose 0.8 of a percentage point in the month, a slightly stronger gain than forecast. Glaxo Holdings American depositary receipts was the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with investors scurrying to buy the shares following news Tuesday that it had received approval to market its new anti-migrane drug in the US. The stock finished up  5/8 8 at 23 7/8 . Merck, another pharmaceutical company that received approval for its Taxol cancer-fighting drug, failed to take support from the news Tuesday and was down  1/8 at 44 in active trading. Citicorp was up  7/8 at 21 5/8 in active trading. Canada TORONTO STOCKS ended up in sluggish dealings ahead of the New Year, bolstered by gains on Wall Street. Traders said activity may remain lackluster until next week. Junior miner Sikamen Gold, buoyed by a recent Canadian diamond find in Central Africa, led actives. The TSE-300 composite index rose 12 points or 0.36 per cent to 3,326.8 on volume of 30m shares valued at CDollars 190 million, compared to 41m shares on Tuesday. Advancing issues led declines 315 to 239 with 262 unchanged. Other actives included Laidlaw's class B shares which rose  3/8 to 11 7/8 , bolstering the TSE's transportation group.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S CORNER  </P> <P> Despite the blockbuster success of the miniseries "Lonesome Dove," the three  networks have just finished the lowest-rated February sweeps in their history.  All the records the networks are setting in television these days seem to be  new lows.  </P> <P> February is one of four months annually when the Nielsen and Arbitron ratings  services take particularly intensive surveys, and the results are used in  determining advertising rates. The most important sweeps are in February and  November.  </P> <P> The combined three-network rating for February was down almost four points from  the same month last year. The total average share for the three networks -- the  number of TV sets that were tuned to ABC, CBS and NBC -- stood at 69 percent.  That means that more TV viewers than ever were watching something else.  </P> <P> Is there a way for the networks to put a rosy filter over these downbeat  numbers? "We consider them almost a blessing," says David M. Poltrack, a CBS  vice president who is the king of network research. Poltrack says that even  though the total network numbers are down, CBS actually improved on its  performance over last year. So, whoopee.  </P> <P> "The numbers are very positive from CBS' point of view," Poltrack says. "We're  up in every single day part." Day parts are what networks divide the broadcast  day into: daytime, prime time, late night, and so on. Though still locked in  third place, CBS improved on last year's February sweeps by 7 percent. NBC was  up 3 percent.  </P> <P> ABC was down 31 percent, but Poltrack says that figure is misleading because  last February, ABC had two weeks of Winter Olympics coverage, making its  ratings unusually high.  </P> <P> It gets complicated, doesn't it? And television is a business in which there  are an infinite number of ways to lie, or at least fib, with statistics. If  your show gets a lousy rating, you can always say it gets great "demographics"  -- that it's doing well with women 18-to-25, for instance, or with midgets  making more than $40,000 a year.  </P> <P> The networks are pitiful helpless giants watching much of their audience take a  hike. But in their defense, there's no way of knowing how much of the latest  hike-taking can be traced to last year's writers' strike, which disrupted and  delayed the new fall prime-time schedules.  </P> <P> "We are gradually recovering from the strike, and it hurt us worse than we  thought it would," says Poltrack. "I personally believe we will never fully  recover, that we have permanently lost one full share point as a result."  </P> <P> Because of the strike and the abundance of reruns on the networks, viewers went  wandering last fall. Among the places they landed is the fledgling Fox Network,  which has fewer stations than any of the big three but which continues to score  solid gains on Sunday nights, especially with the corrosive sitcom "Married . .  . With Children."  </P> <P> For CBS, meanwhile, the miniseries "Lonesome Dove" was a boon, doing better in  the ratings than CBS had promised advertisers, and, more importantly, giving  network television a shot in the arm.  </P> <P> "It sort of brought people back to network television and got people talking  about it again," Poltrack says. "It really was the first big event since the  strike to do that. Normally it happens in the fall when the new shows are  introduced, but this year, we lost that."  </P> <P> Poltrack thinks that "Lonesome Dove" lured not only viewers who normally don't  watch the networks, but also enticed "the upper socioeconomic audience" that  normally "isn't watching television at all." The four-night Western spectacular  proved to be "a tremendous psychological rallying point for CBS," Poltrack  says.  </P> <P> The network is otherwise experiencing a season of embarrassing clunkers and  dismal flops.  </P> <P> Figures from the February sweeps will be analyzed, dissected, stood on their  heads and turned inside out. Independent stations, those not affiliated with  any network, will claim a great victory because the network share is down  again, but the independents as a group were up only two-tenths of a rating  point from last February's results.  </P> <P> While the number-crunchers hunch over their computers and the sales departments  figure out how to bend and shape them and beat them into meaninglessness (and  that may not be too hard to do), the lesson of "Lonesome Dove" would seem to be  a simple one:  </P> <P> Put on better programs, and more people will want to watch them.  </P></p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Ulster TV up 25% to Pounds 2.45m Growth in advertising revenue pushed the pre-tax profits of Ulster Television up by 25 per cent in the six months to the end of June to Pounds 2.45m. The Northern Ireland broadcaster increased advertising revenue by 16.1 per cent to Pounds 14.1m, a rate of growth more than double that achieved by the ITV system as a whole. The growth was influenced, said Mr John McGuckian, the Ulster chairman, by a share of viewing that continued to be the highest of any television channel in the UK and the fact that consumer expenditure in the recession had held up better in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK. Current trading continued to be healthy and the television market in the UK was strengthening as a result of growing confidence in recovery. 'We expect that this will be reflected in the forthcoming 1995 negotiations this autumn with those advertisers on annual agreements,' Mr McGuckian said. Ulster Television also reaffirmed its intention to apply, with partners, for a cable television licence for Northern Ireland. Turnover for the six months was Pounds 15m, an increase of 13.6 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 6.25p to 15.6p and the interim dividend rises from 6.25p to 7.5p. Investment income at Pounds 204,000 was significantly lower than the Pounds 641,000 last year, reflecting lower deposit and dividend income, but will realise an exceptional pre-tax gain of Pounds 860,000 in the full year from the sale of part of its stake in SES, the Luxembourg-based satellite system. The share price rose 15p to close at 685p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The news today, as it has been all week, is  about a series of meetings held by the office of the Chamber of  Deputies in an effort to solve the political deadlock. A second  meeting is planned for today between the office of the Chamber  of Deputies and the General Staff of the Haitian Armed Forces.  The meeting will relate to the political crisis and current  deadlock. On Tuesday, 19 April, the military authorities  received a delegation of deputies to hear the various scenarios  for a solution to the crisis. Within the scope of this  initiative, the deputies met on 20 April with representatives of  the Episcopal Conference and with the Vatican's ambassador to  Port-au-Prince. Edner Jean filed a report:    [Begin Jean recording] As the consultations move forward,  the  solution to the crisis is moving farther and farther away from  Article 149 of the Constitution, at least so far as the Chamber  of Deputies is concerned. The last meeting with the Army only  reinforced the position held by the majority of deputies and  expressed a thousand times -- the inapplicability of Article 149  of the Constitution at the current juncture.    If the military did not totally disregard that option,  neither are they willing to support the legislators favoring  such an approach. The Army would rather seek a concerted  solution, confessed Deputy Pierre Simon Georges, president of  the Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion], who participated in  this meeting at Army Headquarters. The deputy from Camp-Perin  who was the first, on 8 October 1991, to vote for Article 149,  today believes that this constitutional provision has seen its  day and that the Clean Sweep solution would be a breach of  democracy.    Deputy Pierre Simon Georges, who never hid his affinity with  the Army, invites the military to analyze the grave  socioeconomic consequences that could lead to a total blockade  of the country. [passage omitted]    From a generally reliable source, we have learned that the  deputies are due to meet with the Army General Staff again on  Thursday. Meanwhile, the president of the lower chamber is  tirelessly pursuing his consultations. Objective: to collect the  maximum amount of data before taking any new action to fill the  governmental vacuum.    Frantz Robert Monde has the moral support of the Chamber of  Deputies. However, some legislators regret the fact that the  preliminary results of those meetings were covered in camera.  [passage omitted]. It should be pointed out that this series of  meetings is due to close with a phone conference with President  Aristide in Washington. [end recording]</p>

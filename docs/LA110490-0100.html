			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRINGLE, UMBERG INSPIRE 'NO' VOTE ON TERM LIMITS  </P> <P> Curt Pringle, the incumbent assemblyman from the 72nd Assembly District, admits  that he and his campaign workers intentionally distributed campaign literature  known to contain false statements.  </P> <P> In short, he admits he lied to the voters.  </P> <P> What's his excuse? That the material was already printed.  </P> <P> No wonder the California Journal, when ranking 79 Assembly members, put Pringle  among the bottom 10 in integrity and the bottom 12 in brains.  </P> <P> KARLA LOUISE BELL, Newport Beach  </P></p>

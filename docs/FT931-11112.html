			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Calls for payment in BCCI collapse OPPOSITION MPs yesterday renewed calls for a government commitment to compensate customers who lost money when Bank of Credit and Commerce International collapsed. Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, used Scottish questions to demand an assurance the government would accept the advice of a forthcoming select committee report if it recommended compensation should be paid. He was supported by Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat MP for Ross Cromarty &amp; Skye, who said he hoped the Scottish Office would take a more 'enlightened' view of the word compensation than the Treasury had in its dealings with local councils. But their appeals were sidestepped by Mr Allan Stewart, junior Scottish minister, who said the government's response to the report would be a matter for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. The cross-party Treasury and Civil Service committee is expected to recommend compensation for BCCI's former customers in a supplementary report on the affair to be published later this month. In a separate move, Mr Vaz stepped up his criticism of BCCI's liquidators using a new parliamentary early day motion. The motion expressed regret that Mr Christopher Morris - head of corporate special services at Touche Ross and a joint BCCI liquidator - had 'failed to justify his firm's astonishing and exorbitant fees'.</p>

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Leading Article: UK still in recession THE SECOND quarter of 1992 was not, it turns out, when the UK's long recession came to an end. With the 0.1 per cent decline in overall gross domestic product, the recession, like an unwelcome guest, kept its foot in the door. But it was no more than the oil and gas extraction foot that stayed. The rest of the economy did grow by 0.1 per cent. Nonetheless, output must now rise by more than 1 1/2 per cent between the first and second halves of 1992 if GDP is not to shrink yet again this year. The Treasury's forecasts of 1 per cent growth in GDP between 1991 and 1992 are, once again, for the waste paper basket. Almost all sectors of the economy were either stagnant or shrank between the first two quarters. The exception was manufacturing, which grew by 0.4 per cent. But this growth will not endure without a sustained increase in final demand. The post-election bounce in demand has not been maintained. While the three months to July saw retail sales 0.3 per cent higher than in the previous three months, July itself registered a small decline. Worse, the latest distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British Industry, taken in late July and early August, was unremittingly gloomy. A third of respondents said the volume of sales in July was higher than a year ago, but 48 per cent said it was lower. Car sales have been particularly disappointing. The change of registration prefix in August is supposed to stimulate the appetites of the car buyer. It has not done so. Sales have merely matched last year's dismal levels. No wonder Ford UK felt obliged to announce a three-day week. Unsold vehicles Carmakers must cut their stocks of unsold vehicles. Should that pattern become more general, manufacturing output will turn down once more. Happily, the figures on stocks released this week do not support the gloomiest view. They show not involuntary accumulation, but a decline of Pounds 1,093m, at 1985 prices, in the value of the stocks held by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers during the second quarter. But stocks of finished goods with manufacturers still rose by Pounds 149m. Restocking is, in any case, not enough to create a strong recovery. That depends on final demand. But the government has just tightened its system for controlling future levels of public spending. Meanwhile, as the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin notes, non-oil export volumes rose by only 0.8 per cent between the second half of 1991 and the first half of 1992. This is particularly depressing in the midst of a deep recession, precisely when one might expect exports to soar. Private consumption is, in any case, much the most important component of demand, accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. It is the failure of consumers to spend that worries the government most. Not long ago Mr Stephen Dorrell, the finance secretary, insisted that low inflation was bound to generate the confidence to spend. He also noted that since joining the ERM a family on average earnings with a Pounds 30,000 mortgage had seen real disposable income rise by 18.5 per cent, or Pounds 35 a week. So why are all those ungrateful families not going out to spend and spend? Silly time The simplest answer is that low inflation cannot generate confidence in people who have just bet on high inflation. Moreover, the Treasury seems unable to grasp that especially in an economy with a liberalised capital market a very high proportion of private spending is, in fact, investment. This is not true just of housing. It is also true of cars, washing machines or refrigerators. The timing of such purchase is alterable. Right now seems a silly time to buy. On the basis of current retail price inflation and short-term rates of interest, the real rate of interest is 6 per cent. If the prime minister is right about zero inflation, the long-term real rate of interest verges on 9 per cent. Why borrow to spend now, when one can save and buy still more later? Low inflation does, indeed, breed confidence. But it is the confidence to save; not the urge to spend. Past experience gives a still more powerful reason to postpone consumption and reduce debt. People borrowed five years or so ago because they believed they were richer than they actually were and that they would get still richer by buying houses and other real assets. Now they are far poorer than they thought, itself a good reason to lower consumption. In addition, the highest return investment available is to reduce their indebtedness. What the government offers the consumer, a world of zero inflation, is no reason to spend. For indebted consumers, for consumers who fear the loss of a job, for consumers - almost 1m of them - with negative equity in their houses, zero inflation is an excellent reason to save. The government's promised elimination of inflation is not a solution to the recession; it is becoming a contributory cause.</p>

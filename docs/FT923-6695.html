			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Letter: Franchise by appointment Sir, Your coverage of such recent financial scandals as Maxwell, BCCI and Blue Arrow has been laudable. However, I do feel your usual high standards of investigation and analysis have slip-ped. In your editions late this week I could discover no coverage relating to a leading Texan financier, Mr John Bryan: no pictures, bar charts, nor even an eight-page survey, 'Franchising the Royal Family'. The FinanciaI Times must surely have an opinion: are his activities within the Financial Services Act (1986) or not? Sally Beynon, 7 Coton Road, Grantchester, Cambridge</p>

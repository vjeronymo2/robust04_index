			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Daily News seeks time to find buyer THE New York Daily News, the loss-making tabloid that was acquired last year by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, has asked a federal bankruptcy judge for more time to find a buyer and to formulate a reorganisation plan. The newspaper, which last December filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law, filed court documents that named four parties as prospective buyers. These include Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian publishing tycoon, and Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the New York property developer and owner of US News and World Report magazine. In its filing, the newspaper asked Judge Tina Brozman to extend from April 3 until June 30 the period during which it has the sole right to propose a reorganisation plan. After that time, creditors could file competing plans. A hearing has been set for March 27. Mr Howard Seife, lawyer for the newspaper's creditors, said a number of prospective buyers had examined the finances and operations of The Daily News and were meeting with a group that is screening candidates. The screening panel includes Salomon Brothers, the investment bank adviser to the newspaper, as well as trade union and creditor representatives. Mr Kevin Maxwell, who took over as chairman of the newspaper following the death of his father last November, subsequently resigned his position, along with other Maxwell-linked directors of the New York newspaper.</p>

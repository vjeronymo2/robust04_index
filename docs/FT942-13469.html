			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Little margin for campaign error: Ernesto Zedillo cannot assume an easy victory in Mexico's presidential race Today Mr Ernesto Zedillo begins the third week of his campaign to become Mexico's next president in a political climate as difficult as any confronted by a candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party. As he criss-crosses the country in search of votes in August's election, Mr Zedillo must wrestle with several problems: his own party's unhappiness over his nomination; a stagnant economy; a rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas that has still not been fully suppressed; and with growing public scepticism over the investigation into the assassination on March 23 of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI presidential candidate whom he has replaced. With the opposition parties weak and the PRI enjoying the benefits of 65 consecutive years in power, Mr Zedillo is the strong favourite to win. But some opinion polls show the PRI's lead has narrowed, and he cannot be sure of victory. Mr Zedillo is, moreover, not a natural campaigner - something even his admirers admit - although political observers detect an improvement in his performance over the past two weeks. A former central bank official and budget minister, with an economics doctorate from Yale University, Mr Zedillo has never held elected office and, until last month, was hardly known outside political circles in Mexico City. He was imposed on the party by President Carlos Salinas, who cannot be re-elected under the constitution. The opposition within the PRI to Mr Zedillo's nomination was fierce, reflecting little enthusiasm for a candidate committed to more Salinas-style pro-market reforms. The difficulties of grooming Mr Zedillo for the presidency became apparent during a recent campaign swing in Mexico City. First, he addressed about 10,000 members of the Revolutionary Confederation of Workers and Farmers, Mexico's second-largest labour union, then a neighbourhood organisation, and finally took an almost unnoticed walk through a bus terminal. At his first stop, the union bash, Mr Zedillo tried to identify with the working class, telling the labourers that he had worked evenings as a young boy, that his father was a humble electrician and his mother a union member. He promised generally he would govern Mexico for the workers, and propose only reforms that benefited them. But try as he might, his clinical delivery and his self-consciousness made him look more the central banker he was than the man of the people he aspires to be. While glad-handing crowds is not his forte, Mr Zedillo's strengths are his intelligence and his reputation for honesty. Officials who have worked for him marvel at his administrative effectiveness and ability to marshal facts and arguments. These qualities stood him in good stead at his second stop, a meeting of 150 neighbours in a middle-class district of Mexico City. One woman raised the problems of old people, and Mr Zedillo explained the deficiencies of Mexico's social security system, and how he would rectify them. Another asked about workplace safety rules, and the candidate impressed his audience with his knowledge of the regulations and problems of enforcement. For an hour and a half he answered questions on prostitution, urban transport, water quality, toxic waste, drug policy and other issues with clarity and ease. Afterwards Mr Zedillo, clearly happy with his performance, said: 'I like these meetings - what you call focus groups - you get to know people's real problems.' Advisers say he will use such meetings, plus radio and television interviews, to improve his image. But these efforts may be undermined by his unpopularity in his own party, which is forcing him to seek allies among the party old guard. Such alliances could cloud his efforts to project a clean-cut, modern image, and may constrain his freedom to act if he wins the election. Mr Zedillo's most powerful ally is Mr Carlos Hank Gonzalez, the 66-year-old agriculture minister. A former state governor, mayor of Mexico City and tourism secretary, Mr Hank Gonzalez is probably the wealthiest and most formidable member of the Salinas cabinet. He and his followers have taken over the PRI electoral machine in recent weeks, and are likely to demand top jobs in a future Zedillo administration. 'Mr Zedillo is not in charge,' says Mr Miguel Basanez, head of Mori of Mexico, a polling organisation, reflecting a view that the PRI candidate has made too many concessions to the party's old guard. 'He is bringing back people who are very threatening and who want to return to the ways of the past.' While no evidence has been produced, opinion polls indicate widespread public suspicions that some members of the PRI were involved in the killing of Mr Colosio, who represented the modern, reformist wing of the party. He posed a threat to influential party officials who opposed, among other things, his plans to shake up the PRI, his attempts to make the election process more transparent, and his pro-market economics. The special prosecutor overseeing the investigation fed such theories when he concluded that six people aided the assassin who has confessed to killing Mr Colosio, and had four of them, including a PRI official, arrested. Though the PRI official has been released, the suspicion lingers that individuals within the PRI could have had a hand in Mr Colosio's death. Mr Zedillo's campaign could thus be hurt. His problems extend well beyond the investigation, however. Political instability and the rise in US bond yields meant the peso nudged the lower limit of its fluctuation band against the dollar, which forced the Mexican government to raise domestic interest rates from 8.8 per cent in late February to 18 per cent last week. This will postpone the recovery which the PRI had hoped would guarantee electoral triumph. Most economists now expect another period of flat growth in the first half of this year, after the modest 0.4 per cent economic expansion last year. Growing concerns over the economy have contributed to a fall about 20per cent in Mexico's principal stock market index since early February, even though the market rallied strongly late last week as investors picked up bargains. The government may have to maintain interest rates at current high levels, which will choke economic growth still further, in order to avoid a politically costly devaluation out of the exchange rate band. The PRI has made a stable exchange rate the centrepiece of its economic strategy. Amid the political and economic gloom, Mr Zedillo can take comfort from the fact that neither of the main opposition candidates inspires much voter enthusiasm. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of the leftwing party of Democratic Revolution, is distrusted by many investors for his populist views, and some fear that, if he were to displace the deeply entrenched PRI, his election would lead to serious civil conflict and an economic crisis. Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the candidate of the centre-right opposition who is trailing third in the polls, is hardly known nationally. His National Action party has no support in the agricultural south, and is seen by many as too socially conservative and pro-business. Mr Zedillo enjoys other advantages: the principal television networks openly support him, and the PRI has more money and is better at getting its supporters to the polls than its opponents. Even allowing for recession, polls show people generally feel better off than in 1988, when President Salinas came to power. But in a year of many surprises, no PRI organiser is taking anything for granted. As Mr Zedillo takes to the campaign trail, he has little margin for error.</p>

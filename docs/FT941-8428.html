			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / From Russia with complaints and disillusion: Jews flocked from the former Soviet Union to the Promised Land looking for a better life  -but on their terms. As Anne Applebaum reports, they received a shock The last time I saw Ilyusha was two years ago; it was the week before he was due to travel to Tel Aviv from Lvov, his birthplace in western Ukraine. His bags were packed, his aircraft ticket awaited him, his immigration papers had been prepared. He was planning to travel via Warsaw in order to trade a few things on the way; Ilyusha did not want to arrive in the Promised Land without cash. We walked through Lvov, a city with a history that has included Poles and Jews, Habsburg governors and Hungarian merchants, but not many contacts with the Middle East. Ilyusha, very much a Lvoviak (he 'traded things' for a living, speaking Russian, Polish and Ukrainian along the way), was nevertheless telling me that he had the Middle East - Arabs, Israelis, sand, everything - all worked out. He had memorised Ha-Tikva, the Israeli national anthem. He had been told of a restaurant that served pork sausage. He knew lots of people - a dozen of his school friends were there already - and that they watched Russian television and read Russian newspapers. Soviet citizens adapted easily, he said. 'If they want me to fight, I'll fight. If they want me to become religious, I'll convert. I'll fit in.' He had heard stories of arranged marriages and fake birth certificates ('We can get anybody to Israel if we want to') and told me a joke: 'What will be the second language of Israel in 10 years? The answer is Hebrew - because Russian will be the first language.' He expected that life in Israel would continue more or less as it had in Lvov except that, in Israel, the telephones would work, the supermarkets would be stocked with food and, if one worked hard, it might be possible to own a flat. Over the next two years, mutual friends passed on occasional reports of Ilyusha's progress and I heard even more frequent accounts of Israel's Soviet immigrants. Nearly 500,000 Jews have arrived there from the former Soviet Union since August 1989, a huge number for a country of 5m people: imagine 6m emigres from post-communist Europe arriving suddenly in Britain. Among them were 60,000 doctors, 10,000 musicians, and a proportion of educated people four times larger than that of the existing Jewish population of Israel. They were welcomed at first with almost messianic enthusiasm. Simcha Dinitz, the chairman of the Jewish Agency (which oversees the immigration process), understood immediately that this wave of immigration might finally make Israel secure in the Middle East: 'No longer are we a nation which might disappear, which might be easily pushed into the sea,' he said. The Arab world recognised this, too, and did its best to stop the Jews from coming; Dinitz is not alone in citing their failure to halt the immigration as one reason for the decision of the Palestine Liberation Organisation to talk peace. If, however, the first reaction was enthusiasm, the second was disappointment. Not only was there no immediate cultural renaissance: there were pianists sweeping the streets, nuclear physicists emptying dustbins, top scientists emigrating again upon arrival and others returning home. In 1993, the huge burst of immigration slowed to a trickle; only about 7,000 arrive every month now. In Israel these days, you hear that the Russians (as they are usually called) have pushed up prostitution, tax and unemployment rates and that nothing is good enough for them; they are never satisfied. One left-wing Israeli told me she had disliked the Russians ever since she heard them calling the Falashas (Jews from Ethiopia) racist names. The Falashas, she said, had at least wanted to come here, whereas everyone knew the Russians just wanted handouts from the state. An Orthodox woman told me that her community's attempt to integrate some Russian families had failed: they took advantage of what people gave them, complained constantly, and never even pretended to be Jewish. Perhaps some of these disappointments have been due to a misunderstanding. Whereas their grandparents - like Israel's founders - might have spoken Yiddish and lived in Jewish communities, most Soviet Jews of this generation are Russian-speaking and, if asked, would call themselves Russian. Obsession with classical music, and an almost religious love of lofty literature and heavy novels, are Russian characteristics; so are high expectations from the state and a propensity to complain. Bringing them, their prejudices and their assumptions to the Middle East is a complicated prospect, more so than either side had expected - like grafting an alien branch onto a tree. Bearing this in mind, I went to see Ilyusha, who now lives in a small flat on the outskirts of Jerusalem. He opened the door, smiled - then frowned at the bottle I had brought as a gift. 'Ah, we don't drink here any more,' he said, placing it on the shelf. The climate was wrong and Israeli vodka was expensive and poor quality. 'It tastes of peaches,' he explained. 'I simply got used to doing without it.' He had acquired new eating habits, too: avocados cost less than potatoes in Israel while oranges and lemons - non-existent in Russia - were practically free. It seemed, at first, as if that was the limit of adjustment. Ilyusha spoke Russian to his girlfriend and had few Israeli friends. He still laughed about the number of 'Jews' who had arrived in Israel under false pretences and how good the Russians were at beating the Israeli system. Once again, he told a joke: 'What will be the second language of Israel in 10 years? The answer is Hebrew - because Russian will be the first language.' This time, though, when I asked if that really would prove to be true, he stopped laughing. No, he said, it was not true. Contrary to what he and his friends had expected in Lvov, Israel had not adjusted to the Russians; they had been forced to adjust to Israel. Knowing the words to Ha-Tikva had not proved enough. Learning to cook was part of the change, but learning to work was more important. In Soviet society, money was made informally - on the side, through friends and connections, rather than through an office job. In Israel, though, Ilyusha first learned enough Hebrew to find work as an armed security guard, then as a hotel receptionist. After a while, he saw he could be a receptionist but not a manager, so he signed up to study for a masters' degree in business administration. This, too, had to be treated differently. University was not something taken seriously in the Soviet Union, where connections helped to gain entry to a degree course and even a medical school degree could be bought. In Israel, degrees matter: many of the 'doctors' from the Soviet Union proved, in fact, unqualified by Israeli standards. Ilyusha was studying hard: so hard, in fact, that he no longer saw any of his Lvov friends. It is often said that the famous Jewish sense of humour disappeared when the Jews moved to Israel. Ilyusha admitted that this might be true, but only because there was less time to think up new jokes. In Lvov, one spent afternoons drinking and talking. In Israel, with 5 1/2 -day weeks and constant financial pressure, it was impossible to live the same way. Much more difficult are political adjustments. In the Soviet Union, the state was to be laughed at, but Israel belongs to another extreme: everyone serves in the army and people feel a loyalty to the state - or, at least, the nation - because of the danger it faces; that loyalty is much stronger than that felt by many west Europeans to their countries. In the Soviet Union, too, private values ranked higher than public ones: among Russians, it was thought more admirable to love and understand poetry, for example, than merely to obey the law. Some Soviet Jews have responded to the shift in values with snobbery. Israeli literature is inferior to that of Russia, and Israeli television is inferior to Russian, they claim, while all of the nonsense about the army is shallow patriotism, of the sort indulged in by the Russian lower classes. One Soviet couple told me, with great pride, that their friends had set up special weekend classes to supplement Israeli schools, which did not require children to learn poetry by heart. One wonders if this will last: how long is it possible to recite verses about snowy forests when the landscape outside is dry desert? Others have moved from snobbery to cynicism. Contrary to what was expected from people fleeing communism, Soviet Jews were responsible in part for electing Israel's Labour government at the last general election. Equally contrarily, they may well vote for a Likud government later on. But these are protest votes - against the status quo and poor conditions for new immigrants - rather than votes for anything positive. Curiously enough, although their enthusiasm for Israel (and Israel's for them) is low, the evidence is that the Soviet Jews have been responsible for an economic upturn. A huge leap in construction and consumption has led to increased production, while growth in exports to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (engineered mainly by Soviet Jews) has helped to improve trade figures. In fact, more than 70 per cent of Soviet Jews now have jobs, and companies run by them are attracting attention for their rate of growth. Yet, the feeling persists that the Soviet Jews are not assimilating. 'We don't ever see them,' people often say. 'We don't feel their presence.' Perhaps it is because those who are assimilating are becoming Israeli and, therefore, unremarkable, while those who are not will never be noticed by the mainstream, anyway. But the Russians themselves often say the same thing: we are invisible here, we don't matter. Perhaps, though, it is because there is little pleasure for an immigrant in assimilating. For Ilyusha, fitting in is a matter of working out the system and then conforming to it. For someone older, adapting can also include realising that an entire life's accumulated wisdom no longer has much relevance. Even for those with good jobs and flats, the pace of life has accelerated and responsibilities have multiplied. New habits will take many years to form, the attainment of happiness many more. The experience of Russians in Israel could help to explain why Russians in Russia also vote in protest against the changes there: unless imposed from above, no one will undergo them willingly. Ilyusha merely shrugged when I asked if he was pleased he had decided to leave. 'Happy I left Lvov, yes. Happy in Israel? Too early to say.'</p>

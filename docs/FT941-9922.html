			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Western Mining boss keeps his cool - The improving position of a leading Australian mining group If Hugh Morgan, the controversial boss of Western Mining Corporation, is fazed by calls for his head, his style gives nothing away. How long does he intend to remain as managing director of one of Australia's largest mining groups, he was asked yesterday. 'I haven't given it a moment's thought,' came the immediate reply. There was just a touch of bravado. Admittedly, Mr Morgan is batting on an improving wicket. WMC's interim figures showed a 25.1 per cent increase in equity-consolidated profits after tax but before abnormals, thanks to a strong contribution from the 48.25 per cent interest in Alcoa of Australia. By the time the Alcoa contribution turns down in the current calender year, says WMC, higher earnings from its nickel and copper operations should be showing through. The WMC share price, meanwhile, has benefited hugely from the improved sentiment towards resource stocks and the booming Australian stockmarket. It has rallied from a low of ADollars 3.83 some 15 months ago, to reach ADollars 8 this week. But whether this will disperse the question marks surrounding Mr Morgan's tenure is a moot point. They have persisted for many months now - and every time the clouds start to lift, a new storm seems to come along. To recap, back in the 1980s WMC made a disastrous foray in to the North American mining sector. As part of this strategy, it acquired a company called Seabright for around CDollars 92m (USDollars 124m). Within weeks, it had described Seabright's main asset, the Beaver Dam deposit, as hopeless. WMC eventually wrote off its investment and proceeded to sue Seabright directors, who counter-sued WMC. Last year, a Canadian court delivered a judgment which was scathing about WMC's behaviour, and ordered the Australian company to pay damages and costs. WMC proceeded to appeal. The second, and arguably more serious, debacle concerned the rich Ernest Henry copper/gold deposit in Queensland. WMC was forced to relinquish it this year to Savage Resources from whom it had bought options over the area, after it was disclosed that a WMC exploration team trespassed on the lease area and then failed to advise Savage of its work. WMC also took a ADollars 20m charge to cover legal and settlement costs related to the affair. Finally, in November, there was Lady Bountiful. WMC and Ord Minnett paid ADollars 20m to settle a case in which it was alleged that a report by an Australian stockbroker - stating that WMC's sale of a 50 per cent interest in the Lady Bountiful gold mine was 'fair and reasonable' - was negligent. The settlement cost was split equally between the broker and WMC. WMC's interim figures carry a ADollars 10m abnormal charge as a result. Then, just as this series of adverse settlements came to an end, the Seabright issue resurfaced. WMC's appeal was turned down last month amid more condemnatory comments, and WMC is still deciding whether to take the matter to the Canadian Supreme Court. The price of these mishaps has been large. In legal and settlement costs alone, the three episodes have produced charges of ADollars 40m. Ernest Henry has been lost, and hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on the now-aborted North American foray. But, to date, few heads have rolled. In the wake of the Ernest Henry affair, WMC appointed Mr Ian Burgess, deputy chairman of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, to the board, who duly carried out an internal inquiry. As a result, the board decided that WMC's management structure was 'satisfactory'. It did, however, recommend a further review of internal corporate procedures, and a reduction in workload for senior executives. Mr Morgan, notoriously outspoken, was required to 'minimise his involvement in outside activities'. Uneasy though the current situation is, the extent to which it bears on the company's stock market performance is a matter of debate. Certain institutions are reportedly shy of the shares while the current regime persists. But at least some analysts think that perspective is being lost. 'Morgan's not favoured by everyone,' says one Sydney-based pundit, 'and if he was replaced maybe you'd see 10 or 20 cents on the share price, but it's not a big issue.' So, for the time being at least, Mr Morgan is left to spell out a strategy which sees WMC aiming for size and cost competitiveness. 'The concentration has to be on becoming a large, low-cost operator . . . we have to get bigger,' he says. WMC has already spelt out its thinking in the nickel and copper areas. Throughout the recent plunge in nickel prices, the company has adhered to a planned overhaul of production facilities, with a view to substantially increasing capacity by 1995. The recommissioning of its Kalgoorlie nickel smelter took place in December, and the division, says Mr Morgan, has been trading profitably in the current half-year. On the copper front, the purchase of BP's 49 per cent interest in the Olympic Dam project, means that this is now wholly-owned and the first 'optimisation project' to increase output is also under way. The fate of some of the smaller interests is less clear. Mr Morgan admits that the oil and gas assets are under rolling review, and that some minor properties might be discarded. On the gold front, which remains a significant part of the business, he notes that 'in Australia, there are not many large low-cost operators . . . which means you might have to go elsewhere'. In the meantime, WMC has the advantage of a strong balance sheet, with the debt to equity ratio standing at around 11 per cent at the half-year. That will increase, perhaps 20 per cent, by end-June, with the annual ADollars 780m capital expenditure programme weighted to the second half. But on this score, at least, headaches do not loom.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Familiar chorus urges compensation for depositors CONSERVATIVE MPS may have ensured that yesterday's committee report did not formally recommend that the government reconsider the question of compensation for BCCI's UK depositors. But that did not stop the document producing a chorus of similar demands. In the Commons Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, highlighted prime minister John Major's 'commitment that, under the Citizen's Charter, the public would be compensated where the authorities had failed.' The report concluded the Bank of England had 'manifestly failed' in its supervisory duties in the case of BCCI, he said - did this mean sufferers would be compensated? But Mr Tony Newton, Leader of the Commons, standing in for Mr Major, sought to damp expectations, saying chancellor Norman Lamont had already examined the issue after the publication of Lord Justice Bingham's report. While the government would 'study carefully' the new report, Mr Newton did not anticipate it would alter the original conclusion which was that no extra compensation should be offered beyond that already available by law. Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP for Leicester East - who has campaigned hard for BCCI depositors - described the report as 'brilliant' and said the case for compensation was now 'unanswerable'. He said: 'So severe is this latest criticism that I would be astonished if the government proceeded with the appointment of the deputy governor Eddie George to the governorship.' Mr Rory Mair, chief executive of Ross and Cromarty district council and spokesman for the committee co-ordinating local authority action for compensation, said the report 'shows there is a substantial case for compensation for those depositors who lost money in the closure of BCCI'. For Labour's front bench Mr Alastair Darling concentrated on regulatory matters, saying there was 'clearly a case for considering a new body whose sole responsibility would be banking supervision.' In its carefully worded conclusions, the report cites a pledge attributed to Mr Lamont in July 1991 that he would consider the implications for compensation if the Bank was found not to have 'discharged its role and duty properly and competently'. In one of many references to Sir Thomas Bingham's earlier inquiry into BCCI it goes on to say: 'It is, in our view, impossible to conclude from the Bingham report that the Bank's role and duty as supervisor was discharged 'properly and competently'. 'On the contrary, we believe that the Bingham Report demonstrates conclusively that the Bank of England 'failed to discharge its supervisory duties' in respect of BCCI.' The committee singled out Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the out-going Bank governor, for personal criticism over some of his comments during an appearance before the committee last November. The report also criticises aspects of the Bank's response to the two reports produced in 1990 by Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors, and the final attempts to restructure the bank before its closure in July 1991. The committee welcomed the government's response to the Bingham report's recommendations and the Bank's decision to implement those aspects of Sir Thomas's findings that fell directly within its control.</p>

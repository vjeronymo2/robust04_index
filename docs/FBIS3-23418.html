This was announced by Sa'd Mujbir, secretary of the Foreign  Affairs Committee at the General People's Congress in Libya, in  a speech he delivered at the meeting of the International  Parliamentary Union currently being held in Paris.    Sa'd Mujbir said that "to you and through you, we declare to  the whole world that we officially accept the proposal by Mr.  Black, professor of law in Scotland, for the Libyans to be tried  before the International Court of Justice in The Hague with the  participation of judges from Scotland".    It is worth noting that Colonel al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the  Libyan revolution, has previously agreed for the two Libyans to  be tried at the International Court of Justice without  mentioning Scottish participation, but this was rejected every  time by the United States and Britain.</p>

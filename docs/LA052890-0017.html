			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIDIEST VICTORY OF BUSH'S PRESIDENCY;  </P> <P> BUT NOW CLEAN AIR BILL GOES TO SMOKE-FILLED ROOM  </P> <P> Two versions of a federal Clean Air Act now heading for conference on Capitol  Hill should someday make many Americans breathe easier.  </P> <P> But the big winners right now are President George Bush and Southern  California.  </P> <P> The proposed new clean-air requirements could unravel, of course, if John  Sununu, White House chief of staff, gets too ambitious about the "fine-tuning"  he says it needs while the Senate and House negotiate away differences in their  bills. Or it could unravel if some environmentalists are right in saying that  part of the fine print is fine-tuning that would weaken their impact.  </P> <P> But for now, and for Bush, the 401-21 House vote for the bill -- with his marks  all over it -- is the tidiest victory of his presidency.  </P> <P> And, perhaps for the first time, Southern California has a chance for air clean  enough to meet health standards, thanks to the militant diligence of Rep. Henry  A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and bipartisan teamwork by Rep. Jerry Lewis  (R-Redlands).  </P> <P> And Bush got everything he asked for, and then some.  </P> <P> Both the Senate and House approved his pioneering program to control acid rain  that is killing lakes and forests in Canada and the northeastern United States  (mostly from industry in the Midwest).  </P> <P> Both bills call for 10-million-ton reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions.  </P> <P> Both versions went along with the Bush idea to give utilities that make an  extra effort to cut emissions pollution credits that they could save for future  use or sell to other companies.  </P> <P> And toxic emissions from chemical plants and other polluters would fall by as  much as 75% to 90%.  </P> <P> But the most significant breakthroughs for Southern California are in new  proposals, presented most effectively in the House version, for controlling  automobile pollution, which accounts for half of the region's smog.  </P> <P> In one example of what makes the House bill by far the preferable one, the  Senate version dictates precisely how crude oil must be refined to make cleaner  gasoline. (It seems that when politicians start practicing chemistry, strange  things happen.) The Senate formula would, in effect, make  carbon-monoxide-reducing ethanol, most commonly made from corn, the only  gasoline additive that could raise its oxygen content to stipulated levels.  This might make senators from corn states more interested in clean air. But  ethanol also increases emissions of the basic ingredients of smog, and for  Southern California and many other urban areas, that is bad.  </P> <P> The House version is much more flexible.  </P> <P> Both bills force 60% reductions in auto emissions of nitrogen oxides and 40%  cuts in hydrocarbons by mid-decade; these are the two worst smog culprits.  </P> <P> And there's a bonus for California.  </P> <P> When Waxman failed to get a mandate for production of cars that burn cleaner  fuels than gasoline, he made a deal. He settled for a test program for  California that would require the auto industry to build 750,000 cars in the  next seven years that produce only half the pollutants allowed under existing  law. They could burn natural gas or even reformulated gasoline as long as they  met the standard. A terrific move.  </P> <P> The bills could cost American industry and consumers $20 billion a year, so  writing the Clean Air Act was a bruising process. And it's not over yet.  </P> <P> But at this point, it looks like winners all around.  </P></p>

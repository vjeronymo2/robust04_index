			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / The debaters could do better Debate on the Maastricht Treaty in the French parliament is presenting an absorbing spectacle of the French political establishment at work. After an abortive rearguard attempt by an old-style Gaullist to have the treaty thrown out altogether, the National Assembly last week ploughed into a three-day debate, in which all the party spokesmen delivered their weighty speeches. This first phase of the process will be wound up tomorrow with, probably, a solid vote in favour. What the debate has revealed so far is that there is an unexpectedly large minority in the National Assembly, and probably therefore an even larger minority in the country at large, which is passionately opposed to the European Community and all it stands for. The Communists, of course, all voted en bloc for the rearguard action; but the fact that nearly half the Gaullists did so as well was much less expected. We should not have been surprised. The federalist tendencies in the Maastricht Treaty are deeply at odds with the nationalist values of Gaullism; it was after all an alliance between Gaullists and Communists which finally defeated the ill-starred project for a European Defence Community in 1954. Many of the Gaullist faithful were likely to answer the call to fight the federalists. Yet even the Gaullist party leadership was taken by surprise. Some say that Maastricht has prompted the most intense French debate on Europe since the Treaty of Rome in 1957. It is nearer the truth to say that it has prompted the only real debate on Europe since 1957. In practice, discussion of Europe has been stifled, for two reasons. First, the French treat the European Community as a branch of foreign policy, which comes under the exclusive authority of the president; the French parliament is told what happens in Brussels, but is not consulted. When the Single European Act came up for ratification in 1986, Mr Jacques Chirac and the Gaullists were in power; they did not presume to reject it. Second, although Mr Chirac is uncontested leader of the Gaullist party, he appears to have no political convictions on anything. On Europe he has taken refuge in ambiguity, and his party has not been forced to decide where it stands. The Gaullists' official ambiguity on Europe was glaringly obvious last week. Socialists, centrists and the centre-right UDF all set out their views on the future of the Community; they mostly approved the Maastricht Treaty and the general direction it was pointing. But Alain Juppe, secretary-general of the Gaullists, was careful not to describe a Gaullist vision of Europe. He said the Gaullists would vote yes to the treaty, provided the government introduced a long list of domestic safeguards; although how he could promise any such thing is a mystery. Among other changes, he wanted the French constitution to say that French sovereignty is inalienable, that the Community is composed of a union of independent states, that France will continue to have an ultimate right of veto in Brussels, and that the National Assembly will in future be consulted on Community legislation. By contrast, the Gaullists would not agree to give the vote in local elections to residents from other EC countries. This insistence on sovereignty is understandable. As an ancient and centralised unitary state, France is challenged especially deeply by the Community model: the one is Jacobin, universalist, interventionist and assimilationist; the other is liberal, pluralist, decentralised and quasi-federal. It is not just the Gaullists who feel this clash of political culture. Yet it is a pity that the French debate has largely side-stepped two major strategic dilemmas* facing the Community. The first is the nature of European union; if this is the aim, Europe's parliaments and peoples will need a much clearer and more explicit explanation than could be deduced from the current French debate. To claim that we cannot foresee the final stage is just a facile excuse: every extra step will become more difficult for national political systems, and the full implications must be spelled out, debated and accepted. The second strategic dilemma is that of enlargement. There is a foolish but common assumption that the Community has an obligation to admit 10 or 20 new members. Yet it is plain that a 30-member Community could not create a real European union, and would probably fall apart. Do the advocates of limitless enlargement, like the Gaullists and the British Conservatives, really want a Community which is dominated by small countries, many of which are neutral? They do not tell us. We can be sure that this will not be France's last big debate on Europe. We must just hope that practice makes perfect, and that they will do better next time. * L'Europe en Danger, Laurent Cohen-Tanugi, Fayard, FFr98.</p>

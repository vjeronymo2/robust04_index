			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> NYSE TO BEGIN OFF-HOURS TRADING SOON, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> The New York Stock Exchange will begin trading stocks outside of its normal  hours and off its trading floor later this year, a first in its nearly 200-year  history, a newspaper reported.  </P> <P> The plans are an attempt to recapture trading volume in NYSE-listed stocks from  foreign markets, especially London and Tokyo, as the world moves toward  around-the-clock stock trading, the New York Times said in an early edition of  today's newspaper.  </P> <P> The new trading will be conducted electronically and may bypass the  specialists, the floor traders through whom stock transactions are routed  currently, the Times said.  </P> <P> The newspaper cited unidentified people in the industry who have been briefed  by stock exchange officials.  </P> <P> Richard Torrenzano, an exchange spokesman reached late Wednesday, said the Big  Board has been studying the possibility of off-hours trading for two years,  "and we've begun to discuss some very innovative ways to approach that idea.  </P> <P> "If we see a need by our customers to have an off-hour trading system, we will  move very innovatively and quickly to meet that customer demand," he said.  </P> <P> The Times said the exchange plans to begin two limited after-hours trading  sessions later this year, with different rules applying than during daytime  trading.  </P> <P> Sometime in 1991, the exchange plans to conduct auctions of each Big Board  stock at 8 p.m., midnight and 5 a.m. New York time, the newspaper said. Each  stock would trade only once at each auction, with all trades combined at a  single agreed price.  </P> <P> The three auction times would coincide with the start of the Tokyo business  day, the middle of the Tokyo day and the early part of the London business day.  </P> <P> It is estimated that 15 million to 20 million shares of NYSE stocks trade each  day outside of exchange hours. Average volume during the exchange's 9:30 a.m.  to 4 p.m. session has been running at about 160 million shares recently.  </P></p>

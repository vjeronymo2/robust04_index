			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Imperial Oil to cut 12% of its staff IMPERIAL Oil, Canada's biggest oil company, yesterday unveiled a reorganisation which includes the closure of about 1,000 retail outlets, unspecified cuts in refining capacity, and a 12 per cent reduction in its 14,000-strong workforce. The restructuring, hastened by severe pressure on all sectors of the oil and gas industry, includes turning business operations which operate as free-standing units into divisions of the parent company. Imperial is 70 per cent owned by Exxon of New York. It suffered the first operating loss in its history last year. Mr Arden Haynes, chairman, said yesterday that 'these are tough times and they call for tough but sensible actions.' The company said that it would cut its refining capacity in Ontario, and said that prospects for its Ioco refinery in British Columbia were 'very difficult'. Mr Haynes said 'while decisions on specific refineries will be made later in the year, there is no doubt some rationalisation is required.' Imperial's refining capacity is about 510,000 barrels a day (b/d). Its Nanticoke and Sarnia refineries in Ontario have a combined capacity of 218,000 b/d. The Ioco plant has a 43,000 b/d capacity. The company is also considering divestment of non-core chemicals businesses.</p>

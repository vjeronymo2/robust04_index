			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Warburg stake cut Recent Footsie entrant SG Warburg was the most heavily traded stock in the London market as one stakeholder cut its holding to 4.9 per cent, marking a footnote to the hostile takeover threat that dogged the merchant bank seven years ago. Canadian National Railway Pension Fund Trust reduced its stake from 12 per cent, selling 15.1m shares at 705p a share to Cazenove and UBS which placed them in the market at 712p a share. Canadian National took the original stake in late 1986 from Mr Paul Steinberg's Reliance Insurance which sold the shares when it despaired of being able to launch a hostile bid. The pension fund paid almost Pounds 100m for its shares then, a hefty premium to the market value, and yesterday sold the seven per cent for Pounds 106.5m. Underlying Warburg shares fell 12 to 727p with 37m traded. Abbey National suffered a profit downgrade by NatWest securities. The house cut its current year forecast by Pounds 27m to Pounds 640m to reflect higher than previously expected provisions in Europe and a fall in mortgage applications later this year. The shares were down 4 at one stage but rallied to close 2 weaker at 410p. Royal Bank of Scotland eased 1 1/2 to 288p as Hoare Govett reiterated its sell stance. Oil group Burmah Castrol recovered from recent falls closing 6 1/2 higher at 716 1/2 p. ICI was weaker as the recently demerged chemicals group announced at its annual meeting that business conditions in continental Europe remained poor in spite of recovery signs in some markets. However, the company's chief executive Mr Ronnie Hampel hit out at the recent rash of downgrades saying: 'I don't understand what the analyst community is about. We have not changed our stance right the way through.' Health care products company London International Group closed lower on balance as the company reported a profit of Pounds 27.89m after exceptionals against analysts' forecasts of around Pounds 33m. The headline figure was well up on the previous year and the company made a positive statement but the output from LIG's photo-processing arm was even more disappointing than anticipated. The shares closed 6 lower at 176p although Hoare Govett remained positive focusing on the yield and arguing that the company was 'managing well in a very difficult environment'. Against a largely flat sector Boots continued a modest climb, adding 5 1/2 to 450p. GUS 'A', subject of enfranchisement hopes recently, enjoyed the fillip of a Nomura buy note and improved 4 to 1763p. Courts, one of the market's star performers this week after good results, moved its rise on the week to 114 and ended the day at 632p. It also benefited from the recommendation of NatWest. Food manufacturers' shares went their separate ways with dairy-related issues mixed despite market belief that a milk price rise had been agreed between the Milk Marketing Board and the supermarkets. In reasonable volume of 3.4m for a quiet day Northern Foods added 3 to 276p while Unigate gave up 2 to 344p. Unigate had suffered from market doubts over progress at Nutricia, a Dutch baby food and nutrition company of which it owns a third, but these were stemmed by the end of trading. The chancellor's hints at possible higher taxes in the November Budget summoned the spectre of higher food levies to the market and depressed a couple of large retailers, according to one analyst. Sainsbury lost 11 to close at 488p and Tesco gave up 5 to 215p. Another blamed the performances on a generally weak sector and investors seizing the chance to exit after a reasonably buoyant period. Tesco denied press reports of a boardroom battle. The market responded enthusiastically to an announcement by David S. Smith, the paper and packaging manufacturer, that it is buying Spicers Group, the office products wholesaler, for Pounds 95m, raising the cash via a one-for-four offer at 305p a share. A bullish profit forecast by the company helped the shares rise 16 to 359p. Bid speculation and general confidence boosted some northern brewers. Hardys and Hansons, the Nottingham-based company, moved ahead 16 to 247p. Joseph Holt, the Manchester-based family concern, advanced 50 to close at 3075p. Greene King was not so fortunate: the shares lost 13 to 516p with dealers attributing the fall to a stock overhang. Generally, the sector was in retreat with Whitbread 'B' the only large stock to show buoyancy - putting on 18 to 998p.</p>

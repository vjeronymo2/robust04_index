			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORLEY CALLAGHAN; CANADIAN WRITER, HEMINGWAY COMRADE  </P> <P> Morley Callaghan, a highly respected Canadian writer who was a contemporary of  Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, has died in Toronto. He was 87.  </P> <P> Callaghan's son Barry, also a writer, said his father died on Saturday after  hospitalization and surgery for an undisclosed illness.  </P> <P> The elder Callaghan's novels included "The Loved and the Lost," "They Shall  Inherit the Earth," "The Many Colored Coat," and "A Fine and Private Place."  </P> <P> His more than 100 short stories were published in major magazines including the  New Yorker, the Saturday Evening Post, Harper's Bazaar and Esquire.  </P> <P> Among Callaghan's best known books was "That Summer in Paris," an account of  his friendship with Hemingway and Fitzgerald when they were living in Paris in  the late 1920s.  </P> <P> Callaghan, who published three novels before he was 30, shared Hemingway's and  Fitzgerald's editor at Scribner's in New York, Maxwell Perkins.  </P> <P> Born in Toronto, Callaghan first became friendly with Hemingway in 1920 when  Callaghan was still a student and working part time on the Toronto Star, where  Hemingway was a seasoned reporter. When Callaghan moved to Paris in 1928, he  again encountered Hemingway, who continued to encourage him in his literary  efforts.  </P> <P> Callaghan was invited to box with Hemingway at the American Club in Paris, an  event he later believed clouded his entire career.  </P> <P> Although four inches shorter than the 6-foot-tall, 200-pound Hemingway,  Callaghan knocked him down. Fitzgerald was the timekeeper, and the furious  Hemingway blamed him for deliberately letting the round go on too long.  </P> <P> Callaghan claimed that Fitzgerald became so engrossed in watching the fight he  forgot to call the round at the agreed-upon one minute, suddenly exclaiming:  "Oh, my God, I let the round go four minutes!"  </P> <P> The much-discussed incident led to tensions and estrangement of all three  writers and caused Callaghan to lament in his later years: "I'm probably better  known for boxing with Hemingway than for anything I've written."  </P> <P> Although Callaghan was well received by literary critics, including Edmund  Wilson, who likened his work to that of Chekhov and Turgenev, the Canadian  writer felt he suffered by repeated comparisons with Hemingway and Fitzgerald.  </P> <P> He is survived by two sons, Barry and Michael. His wife died six years ago.  </P></p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: White raven turns rival carmakers green - The ways BMW is planning to stay ahead of the competition BMW turns other car manufacturers green with envy. The Munich-based group's cars are sleek, sporty, and popular; its sales and profits keep on rising; and it looks assured of a smooth succession when Mr Eberhard von Kunheim steps aside as chief executive after a period in the top job unequalled in the world motor industry. He gave no hints as to when that would be when speaking at the annual press conference this week. But, at the age of 63, the time cannot be too far off when the man who has steered BMW into a period of steadily-rising profits decides to retire. The obvious successor is Mr Wolfgang Reitzle, the development director who recently turned down an offer from the family owners of Porsche, the beleaguered maker of high-priced sports cars, to become its chief executive. The snappily dressed Mr Reitzle, 20 years younger than Mr von Kunheim, shows every sign of wanting to get more closely to grips with the problems ahead for the German motor industry. 'We have to change the structure of our company. The conventional cost-cutting approach will not be enough to enable us to face the challenges of the next 10 years.' At first sight, BMW would seem to face far fewer problems than other car companies. It has suffered less than, say, Volkswagen, from the growing difference between production costs in Germany and elsewhere. Last year, BMW's turnover was 10 per cent higher at DM29.8bn (Dollars 18bn) and net profits up by 12.5 per cent to DM783m. These results set BMW apart from much of the rest of the world motor industry - at least in Europe and the US - which is struggling to ward off the impact of recession and to combat stiffer competition, notably from Japan. 'We are almost like a white raven,' quips Mr Volker Doppelfeld, the finance director. 'We don't mind if there are several white ravens, but we want to be one of them.' Staying up with the industry's elite will be expensive. Since 1988, BMW's turnover has risen by 21 per cent but development spending has moved up by 35 per cent. 'BMW is healthy and BMW is strong,' Mr Doppelfeld asserts. Cash-flow last year was DM2.8bn compared with capital spending of DM2.1bn and its securities and cash holdings exceed DM4bn. It made a flying start to 1992 with a 24 per cent jump in turnover. But the comparison was with a period during which it was gearing up production of the new 3-series, accounting for nearly 60 per cent of production. Even so, it expects results to improve further this year. BMW will have to use its financial and innovative strength with increasing agility to keep matching the competition. Germany's labour costs are some of the highest in the world, and wage claims this year have approached 10 per cent. It is against this background that the gradual reduction of labour and the consideration of sites for a possible US plant must be seen. As outlined by Mr Reitzle, BMW's strategy is to go for market niches and segments within those niches. Its touring (estate) version of the 3-series is an example of this, as are its convertibles. 'If we streamline the whole company in all its activities so that we can develop, produce, and sell more efficiently than others in certain market segments and with low volumes and lots of variations, then we shall be in a unique position,' he says. At the end of this year, BMW will bring out the M3, the high-performance sports version of the 3-series. By building on the company's strengths of design, image, and technology, Mr Reitzle hopes BMW will be able in the future to charge a price premium of some 15 per cent over comparable models. This is much less than Mercedes-Benz charges for some of its cars. BMW has long passed the critical size needed to finance such an approach, he reckons. With modern and flexible manufacturing technology, much shorter runs of cars and components are possible without operating at a loss. 'We can make 30 or 40 12-cylinder engines a day and earn money'. Last year, BMW made 553,000 cars, a rise of 6.5 per cent; this year will see a further increase. Ten years ago, it produced 378,000. BMW, in which most of the shares are owned by the wealthy Quandt family, could well have a rougher ride ahead of it than in recent years. The US tax on luxury goods above Dollars 30,000 certainly hurts sales of its more expensive models in the US, and competition from Japanese cars such as the Lexus and Infiniti will hot up. Currency swings can hurt sales. Moreover, there are Germany's high costs, a problem for all of the country's producers. More and more of the components it buys, whether or not from German companies, are made abroad. The fuel injection valves BMW buys from Robert Bosch are actually made in South Carolina. That just happens to be one of the potential sites the car-maker has been looking at in the US.</p>

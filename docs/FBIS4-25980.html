			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Thanks to joint efforts exerted by working  personnel responsible for inspecting commodity prices, our  province has achieved initial results in its mass inspection of  commodity prices. The inspection has taken selling at marked  prices as a breakthrough point to straighten out market order  and prices. As a result of hard work over the past two months,  the practice of selling at marked prices has become increasingly  popular. More than 95 percent of department stores, 95 to 96  percent of eating houses, and 60 percent of supermarkets and  individual traders have followed this practice.    Some 140,000 units were inspected and it was discovered that  80,000 units had failed to abide by the relevant rules and  regulations. Fines totalling more than 120,000 yuan were  imposed. In the meantime, our inspection personnel also  seriously handled cases of those units or individuals who  increased prices arbitrarily before the promulgation of measures  aimed at curbing price increases in light of the seriousness of  their illegal practice. [passage indistinct] [passage omitted]    Our inspection personnel exerted their main efforts in  inspecting 8,130 key units and discovered 2,343 law violation  cases involving 15.49 million yuan. In the course of carrying  out their inspection work, they also paid attention to handling  cases reported by the masses. They dealt with a total of more  than 1,200 cases reported by the masses, more than 1,000 cases  of which were handled immediately. Although certain results  have been achieved in the mass inspection work, there are still  some problems:    First, the prices of a small number of daily necessities  still remain high.    Second, it is more difficult to standardize prices on market  fairs or set prices for individual traders.    Third, cases of our inspection personnel being besieged,  scolded, and beaten still happen from time to time.    In future, relevant departments must truly take effective  measures to promote the healthy development of our mass  inspection work.</p>

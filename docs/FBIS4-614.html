			<p>BFN     [Text] At least six regional leaders of the Wit Wolwe  [White Wolves] will apparently support the Freedom Front of  General Constand Viljoen in the election. Earlier this week  their leader, Barend Strydom, also indicated his support for the  Freedom Front. A man claiming to be the leader of the Wit Wolwe  in the southern [Orange] Free State, Mr. Eddie Visagie, told our  Bloemfontein staff that he and the Wit Wolwe leaders in the  northern [Orange] Free State, Eastern and Northern Cape,  Kalahari, and the Transvaal have all decided to support the  Freedom Front in the coming election. The Freedom Front said  earlier that the party welcomed any support; however, it would  not consider Mr. Strydom as a candidate because of his past.</p>

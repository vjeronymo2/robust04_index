			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Afternoon weakness, but bourses recover Bourses had a nervous afternoon after a surprisingly strong report on employment toppled Treasuries in the US, but bonds stabilised in Europe later in the day, and equities seemed to follow suit, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS recovered from an 18-point drop on the US data to close with the CAC-40 index up 0.03 at 1,920.78, up 2.6 per cent on the week, although turnover stayed light at an estimated FFr1.7bn. The financial sector did well again with Cie. Bancaire, the top performer among CAC 40 constituents, rising FFr15 or 3.3 per cent to FFr495 and the municipal lender, Credit Local, extending Thursday's gains on accelerated lending growth with a further advance of FFr10.50, or 2.7 per cent to FFr397.50. Eurotunnel eased 40 centimes to FFr22.55. The company said yesterday that it had been been granted a judicial review of its case challenging the legality of duty-free trade offered by cross-Channel ferries, its main competitor. The packaging group, Pechiney International, slipped again with a fall of FFr2.90 to FFr146 after indications this week of flat first half profits. MADRID ended about a percentage point above its worst, the market's swing from an oversold position leaving the general index 1.91 higher at 293.56, still 1.8 per cent down on the week. Turnover recovered to Pta34.70bn from Thursday's Pta28.7bn. Repsol extended its gains with a lift of Pta125, or 3.3 per cent to Pta3,880 while Endesa changed direction with a recovery of Pta60 to Pta5,450. FRANKFURT's Dax index closed the session 7.00 higher at 2,050.85, up 0.7 per cent on the week in turnover of just DM4.7m. Three strong strands of reasoning moved blue chips during the official session. Carmakers were strong, with BMW rising DM9 to DM799, Daimler DM11.80 to DM728.80 and Porsche DM35, or 4.5 per cent to DM818. Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok of Robert Fleming in Frankfurt said that US car registration figures hit the German media yesterday; Porsche showed a big rise from a low base and its illiquid shares offered a naive response. Meanwhile, BMW seemed to be financing the Rover acquisition with ease, and Daimler said that its car sales and production figures were the best-ever in any single half year, following deep recession in 1993. Chemicals were weak, reflecting the fashion for selectivity in cyclicals; in defensives the three big utilities, RWE, Veba and Viag, were all up by around 2 per cent, suggesting that German investors were still safety-conscious. ZURICH continued on its downward path, the SMI index losing 30.2 to 2,560.3, taking the week's decline to 1.2 per cent. Roche certificates, which fell 3.2 per cent on Thursday after James Capel downgraded the issue, came under renewed pressure on selling by London based investors. The stock gave up SFr80 before finding local buying support at SFr6,000. Ciba fell SFr13 to SFr777. CS Holding, which had been under less downward pressure in recent days than the rest of the sector, fell SFr10 to SFr566. MILAN remained on hold, still waiting for budget details which are now promised in a few days' time, and the Comit index gave up 4.40 to 686.92, little changed on the week. Pirelli, however, bucked the downward trend, rising L20 to L2,539 after the managing director was reported as saying that the financial position was good with consolidated debt below L2,000bn from L2,130bn at the end of last year. Ina, on its third trading day, was unchanged at the placing price of L2,400. AMSTERDAM was mixed with a downward bias and the AEX index dipped 0.38 to 385.84 after a session enlivened only briefly by the US employment data. The market was little changed on the week. Fokker stood out, gaining 70 cents to Fl 15.70 as retail investors began buying on news that the aircraft maker would detail its refinancing plans soon. Professionals remained sceptical and said they would prefer to wait for the details. ISTANBUL suffered a fresh blow with the annulment of a draft law which gave the cabinet powers in privatisation. The composite index dropped 4.6 per cent in heavy selling, ending 986.14 lower at 20,423.51 and reducing the week's gains to 5.4 per cent. State-sector shares dipped to their lower price margins but bargain-hunting in private issues brought some relief in the second half of the session.

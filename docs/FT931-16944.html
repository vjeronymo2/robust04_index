			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Observer: Bill summons his porter The fellows of University College, Oxford, Bill Clinton's old alma mater, are in a right tizzy. After months of successfully stonewalling questions from President Bush's agents and the world's media on just what young Bill did, or did not do, during his carefree Oxford days, they had been expecting a fistful of invites to his inauguration. It is not as if invites are in short supply and the college has just awarded Clinton an honorary fellowship. So imagine the consternation at high table when it was learned that the only person to receive an invite was the head porter in whose lodge young Clinton spent many a happy hour. Unfortunately the porter is now far too old to go. No doubt, the jealous fellows will now draw straws but another porter might be more suitable. After all, Clinton's folksie inauguration party is expected to be reminiscent of Andrew Jackson's in 1828 and therefore much more fun for a college servant than a crusty don.</p>

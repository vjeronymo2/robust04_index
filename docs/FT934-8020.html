			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Reduced debt provisions help ANZ back to black AUSTRALIA and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) yesterday kicked off the Australian banks' reporting season with news of a ADollars 246.5m (USDollars 161m) profit after tax and abnormal items for the year to end-September. The figure compared with a loss of ADollars 579m in the previous year, and was struck after abnormal items of ADollars 213.2m, compared with ADollars 0.9m. However, the market - which had hoped for net profits of around ADollars 300m - was disappointed, and ANZ shares closed 1 cent lower at ADollars 4.44, having posted a gain of 8 cents ahead of the announcement. Other bank shares, notably National Australia Bank, dipped in sympathy. ANZ's chairman, Mr John Gough, said that the bank's main aim during the year had been 'to address asset quality' and he noted that the need to provide for bad and doubtful debts had fallen sharply, especially in the second half, as asset values stabilised. Before doubtful debts, restructuring charges and abnormal items, ANZ's operating profit stood at ADollars 1.36bn, only 3.7 per cent higher than in the previous year. However, the specific provision for bad and doubtful debts more than halved from ADollars 1.6bn to ADollars 628.7m, while the general provision for bad and doubtful debts fell from ADollars 337.3m to ADollars 5m. Restructuring costs were ADollars 54.8m, compared with ADollars 95.1m last time. The level of net non-accrual loans (where accrual of interest and fees has ceased) was reduced from ADollars 3.07bn to ADollars 2.18bn, and now represents 42.6 per cent of shareholders' equity, compared with 66.9 per cent a year ago. Asset sales, meanwhile, were ahead of budget, and produced around ADollars 1bn. By the year end, the group's capital adequacy ratio stood at 10.8 per cent, with 5.9 per cent in tier one capital. A large element of the abnormal items - ADollars 101.8m - reflected a write-down in the value of net deferred tax assets. Other major items included a ADollars 23.5m loss from the sale of the pastoral and shipping businesses of Dalgety Farmers, and about ADollars 83m of property-related losses or write-downs.</p>

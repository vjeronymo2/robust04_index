			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>   [Text] United Nations February 21 TASS -- On Russia's  initiative the United Nations Security Council convened for a  closed-door consultations late on Sunday [20 February] to  discuss the latest developments around Sarajevo. ITAR-TASS  learned that the Security Council meeting was called because of  Russia's serious concern over the unclear situation with the use  of the NATO air force against the Serbian heavy arms near  Sarajevo, including those which could not be withdrawn on  schedule because of bad weather.    "The Russian Federation raised on Sunday afternoon the  question about the convocation of the Security Council because  the situation looked as though all the accords on Sarajevo could  be disrupted because the Serbs left their arms to be taken over  by the United Nations but the United Nations failed to take  control because of snowfalls. We were very worried, because the  weapons left uncontrolled by the U.N. forces could be seen as a  bait for the beginning of air strikes, which are absolutely  unnecessary in these circumstances," Russian ambassador to the  United Nations Yuliy Vorontsov told ITAR-TASS.    "This is why we convened the Security Council in order to  draw the attention of all, including the U.N. forces, the U.N.  secretary-general and his special envoy to the former Yugoslavia  Yasushi Akashi, to the need to urgently take control over these  weapons and preclude any possibility of unjustified air strikes,  which could disrupt not only all accords on Sarajevo but also  possible agreements on Bosnia and herzegovina. The moment was  very tense, and this is why we convened the council," Vorontsov  said.    "At the meeting, we raised these questions and stressed that  neither the U.N. secretary-general nor Akashi must forget that  the "clues" to air strikes were in their hands, in the hands of  the United Nations and its secretary-general, and that the NATO  command may not launch air strikes on its own, when it is quite  clear that the Serbs are abiding by the necessary conditions and  complying with the obligations they assumed.    "This is why we approached the U.N. secretary-general, the  chairman of the Security Council and the council members to urge  them to be most attentive to reminding the secretary-general  that he is holding the key and that Mr. Akashi is on the spot  and must see the situation as it really is, and not to open any  "windows of possibility" for air strikes.    "But when we were discussing this question, a report arrived  from Akashi that he would not make any decisions because the  Serbs were true to their word, that the weapons had been  withdrawn and that he would take control over those arms that  still remained in place quite soon. Our aim was achieved. The  possibility of a technical error because of the snow, which  could result in very complicated, bloody and possibly  irreversible events, was closed," Vorontsov said.    Responding to an ITAR-TASS question about the reaction of  the  Security Council members to Russia's intervention, Vorontsov  said, "the members of the Security Council thanked the Russian  side for the active part it took in solving this problem, for  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's appeal to the Serb leaders and  the attainment of the accord on the withdrawal of their arms  from Sarajevo. They also appreciated the sending of Russian  troops to Sarajevo. The troops are there and stationed close to  Sarajevo, and this is seen as a good sign".</p>

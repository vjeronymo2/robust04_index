			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / American Express shares hit by statement THE share price of American Express, the US travel and financial services group, fell sharply yesterday as Wall Street reacted with displeasure to the news that Mr James Robinson had managed both to salvage his job as chairman and to have himself named chairman and chief executive of Shearson Lehman, the troubled investment bank and brokerage subsidiary. Mr Robinson has been harshly criticised by Wall Street analysts for credit losses, lower profits and pressure on the company's share price. In early trading yesterday the price dropped by Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 23 1/2 , more than 8 per cent, before closing at Dollars 24. Mr Robinson announced plans to step down as chief executive last month. Instead the company announced on Monday that Mr Robinson would stay on as chairman and that he would take over from Mr Howard Clark as chairman and chief executive of American Express's Shearson Lehman banking and brokerage subsidiary. Mr Harvey Golub, the 53-year-old president of American Express, was named to take over as group chief executive. Sir Colin Marshall, the British Airways chief executive, had been a leading outside candidate for the job and was contacted by the American Express search committee, according to executives at the company. Analysts were equally disappointed at losses reported for 1992 by Shearson, as well as by the near halving of American Express group net profits for 1992, to Dollars 436m. Background, Page 26</p>

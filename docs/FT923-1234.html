			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pittard Garnar advances 22% but issues warning PITTARD GARNAR, the leather company which is on a recovery path, announced a 22 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.27m for the half year to June 30. Mr David Macdonald, chairman, admitted that the results fell short of expectations because of depressed economic conditions in the UK and the US. He attributed the pre-tax gain to continued reduction in bank debt and struck a cautious note for the second half. Sales fell 6 per cent to Pounds 47.3m (Pounds 50.5m) on weakened demand, especially in its clothing and chamois division and shoes and leather goods. Sales at the gloving division rose to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 9.7m) against a fall to Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 17.1m) in shoes and to Pounds 20.6m (Pounds 23.6m) in clothing. Operating profit fell to Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 2.33m) largely due to a Pounds 200,000 loss in the clothing division (Pounds 200,000 profit). Interest charges, however, fell to Pounds 945,000 (Pounds 1.3m). The group trimmed borrowings to Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 18.5m) for gearing of 51 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 3.5p (2.5p) and an interim dividend of 0.5p (nil) is declared.</p>

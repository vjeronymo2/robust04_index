			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] France is putting the final touches to its plan  for humanitarian intervention in Rwanda. [passage omitted]    French efforts to explain the plan do not seem to be finding  much response among the Rwandans. The prime minister appointed  by the Arusha accord, Faustin Twagiramungu, wonders why France  wants to intervene in Rwanda. He is against this intervention.  Assane Diop contacted Mr. Twagiramungu by phone in Montreal:    [Begin recording] [Twagiramungu] My position is very clear.  I imagine it is the same as that of most Rwandans. Given the  involvement of France in the Rwandan conflict since 1990 up  until the signing of the peace accord, France should not  intervene, even if the resolution is presented to the UN  Security Council.    Second, you yourself know that the second UNAMIR [UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda] now exists, in accordance with UN  Resolution No. 9-18. This resolution should be implemented.    What we might rather ask of France is to supply the  logistical material so that the 5,500 troops that have been  agreed on can (?come) to Rwanda.    [Diop] In other words, even if the United Nations votes for  the French resolution to send 1,000 French troops, you will not  accept a physical presence of French troops?    [Twagiramungu] No, indeed. [end recording]</p>

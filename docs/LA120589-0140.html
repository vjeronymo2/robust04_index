			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 1 IN 7 O.C. HOUSEHOLDS COULD AFFORD OCT. MEDIAN HOME PRICE  </P> <P> For the third consecutive month, only one in seven Orange County households  could afford a house at October's median home price.  </P> <P> That price was $253,034, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. That  meant a household needed an annual income of $83,657 to afford the monthly  payments of $2,091, the trade association said Monday.  </P> <P> Only 14% of the county's households earn that much or more.  </P> <P> A year ago, one in five households in the county could afford a median-priced  house, which then cost $222,036.  </P> <P> Orange County was not the least affordable of the state's big housing markets  in October. That honor went again to San Francisco and Ventura County, where  only 11% of households could afford the median price. That price was $262,271  in San Francisco and $251,364 in Ventura County.  </P> <P> Statewide, 19% of households could afford the median-priced house at $193,557,  up from 18% in September.  </P> <P> That does not mean a big improvement, however. It merely reflects the fact that  more homes are being sold in lower-priced markets and that fewer homes are  being sold in high-priced markets like Orange County, the trade association  said.  </P></p>

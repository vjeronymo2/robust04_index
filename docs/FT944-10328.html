			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US-Japan trade talks to resume The US and Japan have agreed to resume negotiations on opening up Japan's car market and decided to make another try at striking a long-awaited glass deal, Reuter reports from Jakarta. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, secured the commitment to new negotiations after a two-hour meeting with Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, his Japanese counterpart. 'Our meeting was very positive,' said Mr Kantor. 'We have agreed to re-engage on the full range of auto and auto parts issues.' Mr Hashimoto, and Mr Kantor are in Jakarta for broader Asia-Pacific talks. 'It's always helpful to meet. We will move forward as rapidly as we can,' said Mr Kantor, noting there were 'separate potential solutions' to each part of the sprawling car sector. Altogether, cars and car parts make up 60 per cent of the lopsided two-way trade flow, despite repeated efforts to strike a deal and cut the Dollars 60bn imbalance. Mr Kantor said no time had been set for the car talks but lower level officials would meet on December 5-6, to try to iron out differences over Japan's Dollars 4.5bn flat glass market.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Political Notebook: Europe - the Tories' fatal attraction It is Europe that really counts. Amid the stunned confusions of ministers and Conservative MPs at Westminster it was possible to find a theory for each and for all seasons. Most had the government stumbling to defeat at the next general election. Some included a coup d'etat to replace Mr John Major with Mr Michael Heseltine or, just maybe, Mr Kenneth Clarke. Others gave the prime minister another year before his party disintegrated into two or three warring factions. There was even the odd senior Tory willing to venture that in the grand sweep of history this was no more than a ripple: the government might yet recover. Certainly Mr Major seems to think so. In the early hours of yesterday morning he stormed from the government whips' office after what observers took to be a less-than-cheerful inquest into the VAT defeat with Mr Clarke. Hours later he was addressing a dawn breakfast for captains of industry with the exuberant demeanour of the victor rather than the vanquished. No one knows whether he will decide before the election that there are better things to do in life than be pelted with bricks by members of his own party. No one can doubt that he is tough. But, once the speculation and the scheming at Westminster is stripped away, Europe emerges again and again as the Tories' fatal attraction. Mr Major made the point himself when he urged his business audience not to let the extremists - the sceptics or the federalists - dominate the argument. Britain could remain at the heart of Europe without selling its sovereign soul. Tell that to the exiled sceptics on the backbenches whose well-planned ambush ensured the VAT defeat; or to the small band of Euro-enthusiasts who mutter these days that Mr Major has been captured by the sceptics. If there is to be a rational debate about Britain's future in Europe then the government and the Tory party must demonstrate first that they are capable of conducting it. The sceptics hold sway - not just the irreconcilable fanatics but a broader swathe of rightish Tories whose instincts if not their intellects have driven them to seek political security in anti-Europeanism. The pro-Europeans talk about a passing phase but the centre of gravity in the party has shifted. Mr Peter Lilley can now state confidently that the government will fight the next election on a Euro-sceptic platform. The cabinet's Euro enthusiasts have let the argument go by default. Sure, Mr Clarke will tell anyone who asks him that he still favours a single European currency. He has been active behind-the-scenes in trying to prevent Mr Major promising a referendum on monetary union. But there has been no concerted effort to persuade the doubters that Europe is about more than preventing the bureaucrats of Brussels from interfering in the lives of Britons. So when Mr Major and his cabinet colleagues travel to the Essen EU summit later today their posture will be defensive. Let's hope, one minister remarked this week, that Chancellor Helmut Kohl does not say anything silly about a federal Europe and hand fresh ammunition to the sceptics. Mr Douglas Hurd is preparing a strategy to tilt back the balance - to remind Conservatives that they have prospered as the party of Europe. His ideas for a sharper European defence identity have been delayed but not shelved by the tensions in the Western alliance caused by Bosnia. He is working up proposals for changes in the shape of the Brussels Commission and in the role of national parliaments to provide a positive British agenda for the 1996 intergovernmental conference. More mundanely, Mr Hurd has sent to every minister a long-overdue balance sheet putting the advantages alongside the inconveniences of EU membership. The idea is that they might find time to have the occasional good word to say about Britain's membership. Tory party activists can expect something similar in their Christmas mail. But the opportunity may already have passed to re-establish a common platform on which the bulk of the Conservative party can stand. Certainly some of the sceptics will be impossible to win back for any programme other than progressive disengagement. It is no good Mr Hurd producing carefully crafted arguments for Britain's place in Europe if cabinet colleagues are permitted to flirt with the possibility of eventual withdrawal. Mr Major cannot complain about the divisions in his party unless he can demonstrate that he leads a united cabinet. Last night he signalled that he realises time is running out and opened the door still wider to the possibility of a referendum. It may be too late. But if that is so, Europe has the capacity to break more than this prime minister and this government. It might well break permanently the Conservative party.</p>

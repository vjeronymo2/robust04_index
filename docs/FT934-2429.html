			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Leading Article: People's law European leaders have been emphasising the principle of subsidiarity to counter post-Maastricht complaints that Europe's decision-makers had lost contact with the people. Decentralising, where possible, the exercise of power throughout the European Union represents a plausible way of quelling voters' suspicions about the influence of unaccountable bureaucracies. However, to adapt a phrase from its deliberations on unemployment, the EU must recognise that there are no miracle cures to the problem of putting subsidiarity into practice. The weekend announcement that the European Commission will repeal 16 pieces of legislation deemed to contradict subsidiarity is an encouraging step. Much more needs to be done, however, both to define the areas where the doctrine can sensibly be applied, and to make more transparent the way it is implemented. The Euro-laws to be recast into more manageable 'framework' directives include 1980 legislation on drinking and bathing water quality. Britain and France argued that these gave national authorities insufficient leeway to set their own methods of achieving overriding quality and health standards. It is ironic that two countries with highly centralised governments should have successfully defended a principle normally seen as promoting devolution. However, detailed regulations on water quality - an area which does not materially affect cross-border competition, and where centralised rules offer no economies of scale - can be left to democratic forces in member countries. Rather as attic-clogging lumber must regularly be discarded, continuous checks are needed to ascertain whether Brussels' existing stocks of legislation are in line with subsidiarity. Equally important, new laws must conform to the principle. The Commission needs to exercise a benign centralising influence in verifying that member states enforce directives on the single market. As the Union matures, the Commission's role will move anyway towards executing and monitoring measures, rather than initiating them. One problem is the opacity of the system under which governments ask the Commission to check whether legislation passes the subsidiarity test. If the EU set up a consultative body of independent experts to produce annual reports on how subsidiarity is being applied, that would be a valuable way to show voters that the principle adds up to more than just one inelegant word.</p>

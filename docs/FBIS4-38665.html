			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, 31 May, BNS -- The Estonian Cabinet at its  meeting Tuesday [31 May] ruled to postpone its formal decision  on setting up the Estonian company under the joint Baltic  peacekeeping battalion plan and refer the draft decision for  further review to the Defense Ministry.    Under the joint Baltic plan, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania  would each set up a company as part of the Baltic battalion to  be formed for participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations.    All three countries also count on Western support for the  project. "International assistance programs are expected to be  launched as soon as we have a legal basis for the formation of  the peacekeeping company," Enn Tupp, the head of the defense  policy department in the Estonian Defense Ministry said in an  interview earlier.    He said the three countries hope to staff the battalion by  August.</p>

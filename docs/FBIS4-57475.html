			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nelson Luiz de Oliveira in Brasilia] </F>   [Text] A government led by Luis Inacio Lula da Silva would  no longer allow the monthly entry of nearly $1 billion into the  country. This is the average foreign capital brought into the  country by investors for speculative operations, namely in stock  markets. On 17 May in remarks to Radio CBN, Lula said that if  elected, he would allow only foreign capital that is intended  for creating jobs. After lunching with foreign executives in Sao  Paulo, Lula said: "It will be up to the Central Bank [BC] to  define which investment is speculative."    According to BC figures, $19.7 billion was brought into the  country from 1990 to 1993 for purchasing stocks and for  investments in the financial market. The monthly average of  foreign capital brought into the country for this purpose in  1993 stood at $1.2 billion. A total of $3.9 billion was brought  in during the first two months of 1994.    In August, then-Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso,  who is now a presidential candidate, took measures to stem the  inflow of foreign capital, which already was exerting pressure  on the issuance of Brazilian currency. Institutional investors  (pension funds, insurance companies, and others) were channeling  large resources not only into stock markets but also into fixed  income investments. The latter were then excluded from stock  market operations and subjected to an Financial Operations Tax  surcharge.    Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) sources conveyed  their surprise over Lula's remarks. Stock markets would be  strongly affected by restrictive measures. They believe it will  be difficult to define which operations by institutional foreign  investors are speculative. Normally, the amount of capital that  leaves the country monthly after obtaining profits accounts for  40 percent of the incoming capital.    CVM sources fear that Lula would allow only direct  investments. These investments totaled $3.4 billion from 1990 to  1993 and $481 million during the first two months of 1994.</p>

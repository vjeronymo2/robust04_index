			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Pounds 50m UK boost for business in Hanoi British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd wound up a 24-hour visit to Vietnam yesterday by signing a Pounds 50m (Dollars 77.5m) mixed credit package designed to spur British business in a country where he acknowledged British investment had lagged behind. 'Everyone who comes here can see that Vietnam is moving very fast and we are determined to move fast alongside Vietnam,' said Mr Hurd, the first British foreign secretary to visit Vietnam. He singled out oil and gas, air transport and banking as particularly promising areas. The credit deal commits Britain to almost three times the total aid it gave Vietnam from 1990 to 1993. Although he admitted that France, the US, Russia and Japan were ahead in providing Vietnam with much of its infrastructure, Mr Hurd suggested that 'historical reasons' explained much of this. He added: 'In that sense Britain came late, but is now coming fast'. Britain is the ninth largest investor in Vietnam, with 17 projects worth a total of Dollars 402m. Most of the money is in the oil and gas sector. Mr Michael Turner, chairman of Commercial Aerospace at British Aerospace and one of eight business people accompanying Mr Hurd on the four-nation Asian tour, said Vietnamese air traffic was growing at 36 per cent and that the agreement would help finance the growth of Vietnam's air fleet. He said he expected to see the delivery of 10 to 15 Airbus A320s to Vietnam in the next 18 months. BAe, a 20 per cent shareholder in Airbus Industrie which produces Airbus aircraft, hoped to sell smaller jets and turbo-props for Vietnam's domestic routes, now serviced by ageing Sovet-era Tupolevs. The nation's flag carrier, Victor Airlines, has said it needs 60 to 80 new aircraft over the next decade, and has indicated it will buy rather than lease them. Under the mixed credit deal, signed in principle at the Paris Club donors' conference in December 1993, 35 per cent of the value of British goods and services would be made available to the Vietnamese government as a grant of aid. The remaining 65 per cent would be financed by export credit loans guaranteed by the Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD). Although no contracts were signed by any of the eight businessmen, Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank on Wednesday received agreement in principle to open a branch in the Ho Chi Minh City in the south. Other companies represented included Costain and Balfour Beatty, which is looking at upgrading the dilapidated railway line linking the capital, Hanoi, with the northern port city of Haiphong.</p>

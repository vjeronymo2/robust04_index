			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> ITT Corp.'s 1988 profit fell 15% to $817 million from a restated $965 million  last year. Sales totaled $19.4 billion, up 6%. For the fourth quarter, earnings  totaled $180 million, down from a restated profit of $421 million, on revenue  of $5.2 billion, up 8%. The New York diversified firm said the annual results  were reduced by a $41-million after-tax provision primarily for several  environmental cleanup operations at its Southern Wood Piedmont unit as well as  reduced tax benefits. The firm noted that operating income at its nine business  segments and Alcatel N.V., a telecommunications joint venture with a European  firm, rose 36%.  </P></p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Perfume outcome surprises observers: A look at the reasons behind the MMC's decision on a sector with a 'complex monopoly' THE MONOPOLIES and Mergers Commission surprised many observers yesterday with its conclusion that while a 'complex monopoly' situation existed in favour of a number of perfume houses, this was not against the public interest. The commission accepted that 'fine fragrances are marketed as luxury products and suppliers need to be able to control their distribution in order to protect the brand images which consumers evidently value'. It concluded the market was competitive and the system whereby manufacturers were allowed to choose which retailers they supplied did not operate against the public interest. Its first task had been to decide whether a so-called 'scale monopoly' existed - under which a quarter of a particular type of goods are supplied by or to the same person, or members of the same group or corporate body. It found that no perfume house had a market share approaching 25 per cent, and Boots, the largest buyer and retailer, had only 17 per cent of the market, including duty-free and unofficial - or 'grey-market' - supplies. No scale monopoly therefore existed. It next had to establish whether a 'complex monopoly' existed, under which at least a quarter of all goods were supplied by or to a group which conducted its affairs in a way that restricted or distorted competition. The commission concluded such a situation did exist, since perfume houses refused to supply retailers they did not authorise themselves, and because they recommended re-sale prices to those retailers. The final stage was to decide whether this complex monopoly situation operated against the public interest. The commission concluded, contro-versially, that it did not. It took account of the fact that the European Commission had exempted two leading perfume manufacturers, Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy, from an article of the Treaty of Rome prohibiting anti-competitive agreements. The MMC decided the way the fragrance houses operated in the UK generally accorded with the EC's requirements. Moreover, it found that while perfume prices in the UK had been higher than in continental Europe until about three years ago, suppliers had since adopted a policy of harmonising wholesale prices in the European Union. That, together with the devaluation of sterling last year, had resulted in UK wholesale prices dropping below those in continental Europe. The commission said that while retailers had tended to compete on factors apart from price - such as service and shopping ambience - the situation was changing. This was due partly to the arrival in the market of large retailers obtaining their supplies from the grey market, and the increasing size of the grey market following the European Commission's efforts to ensure free trade across borders. Some observers suggested, however, that this argument was circular, as it was allegations that suppliers were trying to restrict the development of the grey market and of price competition which led to the referral in the first place. The commission had also been asked to examine claims by Superdrug that some magazines refused to carry advertising for its perfume sales after pressure from perfume houses. It found only one example of such a case, which occurred before the period specified by Superdrug. It was understandable that upmarket magazines might refuse advertising from the more downmarket Superdrug. Moreover, the commission said it was a matter of 'normal commercial judgment' that publishers should consider the possible reaction of other fragrance houses, whose advertising was vital to the existence of their magazines, if they accepted Superdrug's adverts. However, the commission made three specific proposals: Perfume houses should set up a system of independent arbitration of disputes over the authorisation of retailers. The Office of Fair Trading should monitor the effect of range-stocking and turnover requirements to ensure they did not exclude retailers unnecessarily and impair competition and choice. The OFT should also monitor retailers' complaints about perfume houses' selective distribution policies to enable the UK to make 'informed comments' in a review due to be carried out by the European Commission in May 1997.</p>

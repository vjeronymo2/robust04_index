			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week - Fuchsia Lady Thumb An upright yet dwarf hardy fuchsia which is specially suitable for window boxes and containers because of its compact growth. The neatly-formed flowers have carmine sepals and a white corolla, a very keen and distinctive contrast. This variety could be paired with Tom Thumb which is similar in height and habit and has scarlet and mauve flowers. All hardy fuchsias can be planted outdoors and if covered with two inches of soil for protection are unlikely to be killed by frost. In many winters stems may be killed to ground level but should be removed in spring when new growths will appear rapidly from the roots.</p>

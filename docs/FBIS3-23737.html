			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Rustam Usmanov, Uzbek entrepreneur, </F> president of the private Rustambank, and deputy chairman of the  Republic Commission on Control of Economic Reforms, by Vladimir  Polupanov under the rubric "Nations and Foreign Countries";  place and date not given: "Will Central Asia Enter the Market  Path? Uzbekistan at the Crossroads..."]    [Text] To criticize the actions of the government is  an ignoble deed, especially if the government is Central Asian.  Therefore one can only guess why Uzbek entrepreneur Rustam  Usmanov is forgiven for any negative statements he makes against  the government. Moreover, he is the president of the only  private bank in the republic (Rustambank) and also deputy  chairman of the Republic Commission on Control of Economic  Reforms, whose edict on conducting them was recently signed by  Islam Karimov.    [Polupanov] What does Uzbekistan's economic reform consist  of? They say that it is oriented toward the Turkish model.    [Usmanov] Since the first days of the republic's  independence  our president has been travelling through various countries. He  visited Turkey and then discussed the Turkish version. When he  arrived home from Germany he discussed the German model. But our  local journalists, not understanding that Karimov was simply  discussing the experience of these countries, decided that we  want to follow Turkey's path. As of today there are certain bad  subordinates in the president's inner circle and they are doing  him a disservice. In the autumn I travelled through the fields  of Andizhan, Fergana, and Namangan Oblasts. It was raining and  the children were picking cotton. They were experiencing  "percentomania" again. I spoke with the leaders of certain  oblasts. They said that Tashkent was forcing them to do this.  Nothing of the kind. Islam Karimov has said that the oblast  authorities should not intervene in the affairs of agricultural  workers. The economy stands only to lose when enterprises are  closed and the people are working in the fields. Losses will not  be covered from the sale of this costly cotton.    [Polupanov] The administrative-command system of management  is being retained in the republic as it was before. Under these  conditions, how is it possible to switch to the market?    [Usmanov] I agree, our system is authoritarian, but with a  human face. Today it is our only chance of preserving political  stability in the republic. We do not want a Karabakh and we do  not want a Dniester region. Conditions are not yet ripe for  transition to the market in Uzbekistan. Gradually a new  foundation will be placed under the old edifice of the economy.  Regardless of how much our friends and enemies may say that  Uzbekistan has no democracy, that will change nothing. Today we  have the kind of authority we need.    [Polupanov] The first thing that strikes a Muscovite  arriving  in Tashkent is the absence of a broad network of commercial  stores.    [Usmanov] All our goods used to be distributed through state  structures. And the people sitting there were able to line their  pockets fairly well from this. Therefore they first gave  permission for private entrepreneurial activity and then they  banned it, understanding that they were being deprived of easy  money. Today under the laws I have the right to open my own  commercial store. But at the same time there is in force a  telegram from the republic's deputy prime minister prohibiting  me from selling certain groups of goods that are produced in the  republic. There are certain other stores in Tashkent, but in the  rayons they have closed them down, blaming the telegram.  Therefore the commercial stores have lost their opportunity to  trade legally and have gone underground. Of course, nobody pays  taxes.    [Polupanov] And how are they now?    [Usmanov] Very high. Entrepreneurs have to pay a total of up  to 70 percent of their profit. But I know of merchants who  operate illegally whose monthly turnover reaches a billion  rubles. Many of our businessmen leave to do business in  neighboring republics and the majority of them are working in  Moscow. I am very sorry that the republic is losing these people  because today it is necessary to spend a considerable amount of  money on training personnel like them. But perhaps Karimov's  recently signed edict will motivate these people to work in the  republic. Until 1 July 1995 customs duties have been removed  from imports of all kinds of goods brought into Uzbekistan, and  the conditions for issuing licenses for trade have finally been  abolished.    [Polupanov] There has been a lot of discussion of the  sum-coupon recently. Among people there is the opinion that  Uzbekistan was forced to change over to its own currency and  that Russia is to blame for this. They say that anti-Russian  sentiments in Uzbekistan have grown stronger because of this.    [Usmanov] There can be no anti-Russian sentiments in the  republic. Because our people are international by nature.  Regardless of who our neighbor may be, the Uzbek will respect  him under the condition that he is a good neighbor.    Our republic uses somewhere around 50 percent of its  national  income for subsidies in order to maintain prices for gasoline,  bread, and so forth. That is why we held back for a certain  amount of time. After Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan introduced  their own money, all the mass of rubles rushed to us. These  monetary notes are the obligation of the Central Bank of Russia  to us. After issuing us this money, Russia received goods from  us. Therefore it was simply obligated to exchange this money for  new money. Or return our goods to us. But, on the other hand,  the requirements the Russian Government established for creating  a ruble zone I consider to be just.    [Polupanov] Are you speaking about the gold reserve?    [Usmanov] Both about the gold reserve and about the fact  that  our Central Bank must report to the Central Bank of Russia. But  the exchange rate of 1:3 at which Russia suggests we exchange  our money I consider to be illegal, there is no such exchange  rate.    Four months ago the buying power of the Uzbek ruble was much  greater than the Russian one. Today Russia is playing dirty. It  is giving 1993 Russian money to Tajikistan in order to pump out  our resources more cheaply through this republic. They want  Tajikistan's help in bringing the Asian republics to their knees  before Russia. It is not difficult to guess where the breaking  of ties among the republics will lead. Even today some of our  entrepreneurs are working three or four days a week. We are  losing Russia as a supplier of raw material and a market for  selling our goods. But Russia does not understand that its own  situation is getting worse too. The Central Asian region  includes about 60 million people. This is a large market for  selling Russian goods, which cannot compete in the West. But we  will not get down on our knees before Russia, we will find other  partners. Today this is Turkey, and tomorrow it could be China  and the Arab countries. But the Russian-speaking population in  Uzbekistan would be placed in a situation where they are cut off  from Russia. This cannot be allowed, because 50 percent of the  population in Kazakhstan is Russian-speaking, Uzbekistan--20  percent, Tajikistan--30 percent, and Kyrgyzstan--40 percent. If  all these people wanted to leave Central Asia for Russia,  imagine how much money it would take.    [Polupanov] Anyway, how did you manage to legalize your  capital (if this is not a trade secret, of course)?    [Usmanov] In 1987 I was one of the first people in  Uzbekistan  to open up my own cooperative, Mechta, after borrowing 500  rubles from my neighbor to invest in the authorized charter  capital. During the first year we received 18,000 in profit, and  the next year--200,000. Then, when our bureaucratic apparatus  began a mass attack on the cooperatives, I reorganized my  enterprise into a kolkhoz. But still I was having constant  conflicts with the banking system. I was forced to study the  instructions of the State Bank much more deeply than bank  employees do. At that time many of us were making money and  going underground. But I spent all my money on the development  of my own enterprise. Now I have more than 100 trucks, a whole  fleet of passenger cars, and several plants for processing  agricultural products. Therefore last year when the government  suggested that I open a bank there was no problem about where to  get the money. I put up all my property. The audit service came  and inspected it. And that made up the bank's authorized charter  capital.    Today I have an opportunity to help children's homes and  homes for the elderly. And the main thing is that I create all  the proper conditions for my workers to work. I read this  sentence about myself in a magazine: "The capitalist Usmanov has  created communism for his workers." There is a point in working  for this.</p>

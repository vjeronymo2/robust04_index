			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Global offerings meet demand for higher yields Global bond offerings in yen, Canadian dollars and Finnish markka yesterday reflected the growing trend for such offerings across a broader range of currencies, as investors become increasingly willing to buy foreign currency bonds in search of higher yields. Italy's Y300bn seven-year global bond met strong demand, particularly in Japan, where it can be placed with both retail and institutional investors following last month's easing of regulations. Although the whole deal could easily have been placed in Japan, according to lead manager Daiwa Europe, at least half of the issue will be sold elsewhere. Joint lead manager JP Morgan reported surprisingly strong sales to US investors, who are not usually buyers of yen bonds. They were said to be attracted by the liquidity of the deal, and are bullish on both Japanese interest rates and on the yen's performance against the dollar. The deal will be priced at 7am in London today, at a yield spread of 41 - 43 basis points above the seven-year Japanese government bond. Strong demand is likely to lead to a pricing at the tighter end of that range, representing a cost of funds for Italy of less than 20 basis points above dollar Libor, The Canadian dollar sector was dominated by a CDollars 1bn global bond offering by Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's largest power utilities, via Merrill Lynch and ScotiaMcLeod. The 10-year bonds, priced to yield 71 basis points over the new Canadian benchmark, got off to a slow start but eventually met broad-based demand, a syndicate official at one of the lead managers said. He estimated that some 20 per cent of the deal was bought by Far Eastern investors, with another 40 per cent flowing into European accounts and 40 per cent taken by North American investors. Finnish Export Credit launched the first ever global bond offering in the Finnish markka market. The FM2bn deal due 1999 will be priced today at 25 basis points over the comparable Finnish government bond. Although issuance in the Finnish markka sector is widely expected to increase this year - this deal alone exceeds last year's total - further global deals are unlikely, as no other Finnish borrowers (apart from the Republic) are registered with the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission and swap opportunities are meagre. In the sterling sector, the Halifax Building Society launched a Pounds 500m 10-year deal, priced to yield 32 basis points over the comparable gilt. The deal, which was unusually large for a building society issue, attracted strong demand, partly because of the lack of current coupon paper in the sector. Also in the sterling sector, the City of Salford and Leicester City Council launched the first local authority bonds since 1982, with deals totalling Pounds 100m and Pounds 80m respectively. Both issues were placed in the sterling domestic market by UBS. Meanwhile, Hongkong Land Holdings' first ever international bond issue met strong investor demand. The company issued Dollars 360m of convertible bonds to refinance its investment in Trafalgar House, the troubled conglomerate in which it holds a 25 per cent stake. According to an official at the lead manager, Jardine Fleming, the paper was snapped up by investors in Hong Kong, the UK, the US and Switzerland. 'It's the bluest of Hong Kong blue chips,' he said. Hongkong Land, which has a stranglehold on office space in the colony's central business sector, is set to benefit from this year's expected rise in property valuations and rental rates.</p>

Shakhray explained: "This year is likely to see ethnic  tensions and inter-regional conflicts and to become a serious  test of the federation's strength. To leave the government now  would be an easy solution. I think it is my duty to continue my  work of maintaining Russia's unity and integrity, to prevent or  at least minimize the dangerous consequences of such conflicts.  What is more, I think it would not be proper for me to leave  the government when its reform wing is weakened."    Shakhray said that he posed two conditions under which he  would become the minister: making the ministry report directly  to the prime minister and including him as minister into the  government presidium. In his words, this was necessary in order  to exert influence on regional policy. Shakhray was convinced  that ethnic and regional problems had to be handled by a vice  premier, "whatever his name is."    Shakhray noted that members of his parliamentary group had  become chairmen of State Duma regional policy, local self-  government, and CIS affairs committees. He also emphasized that  the group held "positions to be reckoned with" in the Federation  Council, the upper house, where Ramazan Abdulatipov, a  co-founder of the party, had been elected deputy chairman of the  upper house.    "Conditions have been created favoring constructive  cooperation of the executive and legislative branches in dealing  with regional matters," Shakhray emphasized.</p>

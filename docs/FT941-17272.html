			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel The market clearly believes all news is good news for Eurotunnel as opening day looms. Following a string of reassuring developments, yesterday's announcement that Eurotunnel's leading banks had approved its latest funding plan helped prompt a further 3 per cent rise in its sterling units. The official publication of Eurotunnel's fare structure next week will doubtless provoke a further bout of excitement. The resolution of the remaining worries surrounding the project's construction phase certainly provides an encouraging backdrop as Eurotunnel prepares to raise a further Pounds 1bn this spring. But the rights issue prospectus will make intriguing reading now that the scale of the operational challenges is becoming clearer. Ferry operators estimate the total revenues generated by freight and passenger services and duty free sales on the short ferry routes between the UK and mainland Europe amount to Pounds 600m a year. That is about equivalent to the annual interest payments Eurotunnel will have to make to service the debt it will have sunk into the project. Eurotunnel will thus have to rely on expanding the cross-Channel market by drawing business from longer ferry routes and airlines. To make a half-way decent return, its shareholders must be hoping that it will win traffic that no-one predicted.</p>

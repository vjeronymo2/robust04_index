			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (13): Survivors share the spoils  -Turbine makers cash in on gas revolution THE world's major suppliers of power generating equipment are emerging in better shape from the painful restructuring of the late 1980s, but the flow of deals in a complex industry has not yet been switched off. Over the past five years, there have been two important and partly overlapping corporate trends which have changed the face of the power equipment industry. The most obvious is the response of western, and especially European, suppliers to a long-standing problem of overcapacity and to the challenges of pan-Europe and global manufacturing. The result was the mergers of the power engineering businesses of the UK's GEC and Alsthom of France, and the creation of Asea Brown Boveri from Asea of Sweden and Switzerland's Brown Boveri. Subsequently ABB paid Dollars 1.6bn for Combustion Engineering, the big US boiler maker. Both ABB and GEC Alsthom have emerged stronger from the upheaval caused by these link-ups, through eliminating duplication and consolidating manufacturing to ensure they have the ability to withstand market downturns and still spend heavily on research and development. The second trend is based on technology, and especially the need for equipment suppliers to have access to the gas turbine technology that forms the basis for combined cycle power generation. Deals exemplifying this trend include the 1989 joint venture between the UK's Northern Engineering Industries, which lacked access to large gas turbines, and ABB, which needed a direct presence in the UK power station market; and the longstanding co-operation between General Electric of the US and Alsthom of France - and hence now between GE and GEC Alsthom. Most of these deals now look to be in place, and globally the industry has coalesced loosely around four gas-turbine technologies - a reflection of the high costs of staying in the combined cycle game. The leaders in developing gas turbine technology are, naturally, at the centre of these groupings: GE, which has gained leverage in power generation from its aero-engine technology, and its mutually beneficial arrangement with GEC Alsthom; ABB; Siemens of Germany; and the Mitsubishi/Westinghouse partnership. The two trends interlink because the strong growth of combined cycle has exacerbated the overcapacity at European plants producing equipment for large coal-fired stations and nuclear stations. In the 1990s, however, a third trend is developing strongly from roots in co-operation agreements struck on a one-off basis but now taking a more central role in suppliers' regional strategies. Mature Western markets, notwithstanding the importance for suppliers of combined cycle orders in countries such as the UK and Netherlands, are likely to grow only modestly, and attention is switching to the Far East - and especially south-east Asia - and eastern Europe. Western suppliers with finely-tuned political antennae have realised that exploiting many of these markets increasingly involves co-operation agreements, joint ventures, or technology transfers to partners or to local subsidiaries. The requirement can be mutually beneficial for client country and supplier - the former gets an enhanced manufacturing base and jobs, while the latter can produce many large parts more economically when closer to the end-user. Some such links are longstanding, such as the agreement between Siemens and India's Bharat Heavy Electrical (BHEL), but there have been a spate of recent deals involving technology transfer and/or manufacturing under licensing. In January GE, a past master at extending a helping hand via partnership and associate relationships in around 60 countries, agreed to transfer heavy duty gas turbine technology to Korea Heavy Industries (KHIC), building on a 17-year association in steam turbines. ABB, Siemens, and GEC Alsthom have also announced tie-ups in south-east Asia, with Korean companies the most favoured partners. In eastern Europe, another wave of takeovers and co-operation agreements has developed since the fall of the former communist regimes and the reunification of Europe. ABB and Siemens have been particularly active in eastern Germany with a string of electrical engineering acquisitions. Acquisitions have also taken place further east, notably ABB's takeover of Zamech in Poland, and Siemens' purchase late last year of a 67 per cent stake in the power engineering business of Skoda Pilsen in Czechoslovakia. Such deals are motivated as much by the western suppliers' wish for increased manufacturing flexibility, especially of low-value added equipment, as by the necessity of preparing the ground for winning business in markets with immense long-term power equipment needs. Overall, therefore, the web of inter-relationships between power equipment suppliers is increasing in geographical scope and complexity. Whether it continues extending, or begins to contract further at its centre, will depend on business trends. Some in the industry question whether four separate gas turbine technologies can survive long-term. But there is no sign that any of the main protagonists are losing interest, and all remain committed to spending heavily to increase still further combined cycle's thermal efficiency and environmental friendliness. Ultimately, the stability of the equipment supply industry's internal power structure will hang partly on the pace of orders in the Far East, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Another factor will be the market for plant specifically aimed at reducing emissions, such as flue gas desulphurisation for large coal-fired power stations. Here, suppliers rely on continuing popular and political pressure for tougher controls - in strict commercial terms, after all, there is no investment return from FGD. However, there are also hundreds of power equipment companies that do not fall into the web woven around the multinationals. Many of the small- and medium-sized companies exploiting niches in the developed world are benefiting from trends at the smaller end of power generation, such as combined heat and power (CHP). One such company is California-based Exergy, which is pioneering the commercial use of a family of power system designs known as the Kalina cycle technology. The company is controlled by Dr Alexander Kalina, a former Russian scientist in the Soviet space programme who emigrated to the US in 1978. Many such companies can retain their independence and still find the resources to develop internationally. Eventually, though, others form long-term agreements with larger suppliers, which draw them partially into the web.</p>

They  carried out a series of raids and encirclements that lasted more  than two hours. With the security forces completely surrounding  his hideout, the criminal opened fire on them. They responded  in kind, forced him to surrender, seized the weapon he used in  his crime, and transported him under armed guard to the Shtawrah  Police Station, where Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij was  supervising the pursuit along with the al-Biqa governor and  several security forces commanders.    The security forces handed the criminal over to Judge Khalid  Hammud, the government's assistant delegate to the Military  Tribunal. Judge Hammud immediately began interrogating the  suspect.    Minister Mirhij, meanwhile, left for the Sa'd Nayil township  to offer his condolences to the family of martyred Sergeant  Mustafa Faris.</p>

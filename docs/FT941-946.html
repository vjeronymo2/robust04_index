			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Clarke reforms 'heading for chaos' Reform of the tax system risked triggering 'unprecedented chaos', Mr Malcolm Gammie, president of the Institute of Taxation, warned on Saturday. Mr Gammie said there had been more tax legislation in his presidential year than in any previous year since the institute was founded in 1930. He said the latest finance bill was longer than any of its predecessors and the volume was likely to go on rising. He was speaking at a conference of the institute in Cambridge as it emerged that the institute, one of the leading bodies for tax practitioners in the country, had been granted a royal charter. Mr Gammie called for improvements in the way tax law was drafted, reviewed and approved by parliament in order to 'bring it into the 20th century'. He said the length was 'beyond the grasp of those that must handle it within the time allowed'. He criticised suggestions that lengthy laws were required because of tax avoidance, and said they reflected instead a policy to tax things which were difficult to tax. Mr Gammie said there had been little debate on whether the system was desirable. He called for a proper debate on tax policy and the resulting complexities and warned that otherwise there was a risk of growing executive power without effective scrutiny.</p>

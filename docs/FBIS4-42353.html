			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Smits and Mijla de Zwart: "Labor Party, </F> People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, and Democrats 66 Agree  on Social Security"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] "The party leaders of the PvdA  [Labor Party], the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy], and the D66 [Democrats 66], who are seeking to find  a basis for a `purple' coalition government, succeeded in  reaching `reasonable agreement' on Tuesday [31 May] on spending  cuts in the national budget," PvdA leader Kok stated following  the talks. "I believe we can go a long way if we continue in  this direction," he added.    Talks between the three party leaders, termed "lively" by a  spokesman for the politicians appointed to assess the  feasibility of the various coalitions, are concentrating mainly  on ways of cutting back public expenditure. The parties already  agreed on the extent to which it had to be reduced (with the  exception of social security).    In their election programs, the PvdA and the D66 planned to  reduce spending by 6 billion guilders [G], and the VVD by G5  billion, part of it through rationalization, allocating tasks to  local government, and having people contribute to the cost of  services provided by the state. But, whereas the PvdA wants  cutbacks on defense, the D66 and the VVD want some of the  spending cuts to bear on public housing and education.    The three party leaders completed the extensive talks on  social security cutbacks on Tuesday without having yet reached  an agreement. But their provisional agreement on a new  implementation of social security does give the parties room for  maneuvre in averting this stumbling block to a "purple"  coalition.    The negotiators believe that a new implementation structure  will help to sharply reduce the numbers of unemployed and those  registered as unfit for work. This could be so productive that  any substantial cuts in the actual amount of social security  payments, as sought by the VVD, will no longer be necessary. In  order to be sure that, whatever happens, there will be a  reduction in the social security budget during the next  government, the threat of a reduction in allowances is being  retained as the big stick.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of the 1994-95 budget speech by Makhdum Shahabuddin, </F> minister of state for economic affairs and finance, at the  National Assembly in Islamabad on 9 June]    [Text] Mr Speaker:    This day brings me great honours as I have the privilege of  presenting the Annual Budget 1994-95 before the nation. The  people of Pakistan blessed with this beloved motherland.    Sir:    The annual budget represents the aspirations of a nation and  a society. It holds the key to the realisation of its dreams  for a new future. Budget is like a prism, like a crystal ball  which shows to a discerning eye the mystiques of the past and  present.    Sir:    I can confidently say that his budget is truly reflective of  realities, I can only pray for those who do not accept this  truth.    This representatives House which has come into existence  after a very transparent, just and fair election, has a special  place in the history of democracy to forward and the democracy  of the country since it enabled democracy to forward and the  democratic process has gained greater credibility in the public.  [sentence as published] The complete neutrality of the Armed  Forces of Pakistan during the general elections have  strengthened the public confidence in their non-political role  and support for democracy in addition to their defence  responsibilities. The nation by electing a Lady as Head of the  government has also proved that we are also in the process of  building a modern Islamic social system based on tolerance,  justice, moderation, open mindedness and liberalism.    During the current year besides domestic factors our economy  has been affected by external factors. Due to International  recession, our exports have been somewhat lower. Besides this  some lasting changes have taken place. A new International  Trade Agency (WTO) [World Trade Organization] will make rules  for world trade replacing the international trade order managed  by GATT. This new world trade system will include additional  components concerning the agricultural commodities, intellectual  property rights, services and investments. There is talk of  doing away with multifibre agreement. One the other hand new  trade Blocks are developing. Amongst these, the latest in  NAFTA. This will reduce the access of developing countries to  the world Market.    During 1993 there have been extra-ordinary developments  within the country which mainly relate to domestic politics.  The government which had come into existence after a  controversial elections was replaced by a Care Taker Government.  This Care Taker Government undertook a number of important  reforms for the recovery of deteriorating economy and held  elections leading to the transfer of power to the present  Government. Election of a Prime Minister nominated by the  successful party and election of the President have brought  about a new era of political stability which had made it  possible for the Government to devote itself whole-heartedly to  improve the economic situation.    Mr Speaker:    These political developments did not remain confined to  politics but their pernicious influence also affected the  economy. Economic indiscretion and irresponsibility of the  previous Government was unparalleled. National resources were  carelessly wasted and projects like yellow taxes and motor way  were implemented which heavily damaged the economy and deeply  affected the banking system. Consequently we inherited inflation  and recession.    Mr Speaker:    GDP growth rate which during last 40 years maintained an  average of 6 per cent had fallen to 2.28 per cent in 1992-93.  In other words this was less than the population growth rate.  Consequently in real terms the per capita income fell by 0.8  per cent. Agriculture Sector which is the back bone of the  national economy and provides direct or indirect employment to  70 per cent of the rural population registered a fall of 5.3 per  cent. Virus attack on cotton crop 1992-93 led to a record fall  in cotton crop 1992-93 led to a record fall in cotton crop.  [sentence as published] The then Government did not give it any  attention. Cotton crop 1993-94 was again attacked by virus  which caused tremendous loss to the farmers. This affected  export and Textile industry faced a serious crisis. Stock  market went into a recession. Foreign investment fell.  Monetary and fiscal policies were being operated without any  coordination. During 1990-93 rate of monetary expansion went  beyond 20 per cent per annum, whereas GDP increased by 5.2 per  cent per annum. Generation of resources was in serious  difficulties while the taxation system was stagnant. Government  Receipts as percentage of GDP were far less than the public  expenditure. Overall fiscal deficit had risen to 7.9 per cent  of GDP during 1992-93. To finance the budgetary deficit, Rs  [rupees] 62.58 billion which was 4.7 billion had already been  borrowed from the banks to finance the budget in the preceding  year. [sentence as published] Foreign exchange reserves had  fallen to an alarming level. On 20th October, 1993, they stood  at dollars 326.3 million which were not enough for two weeks  imports. Balance of payment deficits had increased to dollars 3  billion. Economy had destabilised and major economic  indicators, for instance Fiscal deficits, monetary expansion,  trade deficit and inflation, were providing evidence of this  instability. During 1990-93, inflation rate had gone beyond 10  per cent which had badly affected the purchasing powers of the  general public. In the Energy Sector the gap between demand and  supply had increased. No meaningful plan was initiated to  increase the availability of power and thus we inherited long  duration load- shedding schedules. No meaningful progress was  made in the Social Sector, literacy remained low and the rural  population continued to be denied the basic amenities.    Mr Speaker:    Controlling the worsening economic situation and restoring  the economy to growth path constituted a great challenge for us.  Our manifesto contained a clear strategy to solve these  problems. The corner stone of our manifesto is the well being  of the people of Pakistan. We want to introduce a just social  order in the country where by exploitation is replaced by a  strong and stable system which is naturally beneficial for  employee and employer and provides for increased productivity.  We are taking steps to project the rights of farmers, women and  minorities and by increasing the pace of industrial growth we  want to make Pakistan a modern industrial centre of Asia so that  poverty is eliminated from the country and every citizen is  provides basic necessities of life. For this purpose we want to  increase the pace of economic growth so that Pakistan can as  quickly as possible enter an era of prosperity. We promise to  eliminate economic disparities from the country by an equitable  distribution of national income. A new tariff structure is  being introduced which is based on justice and which will  increase the government income and reduce the budget deficit.  Increased allocations will be provided for the growth of social  sectors. Further more, to encourage private investment  unnecessary controls and regulations are being removed from the  economy.    Immediately on assumption of power and seeking guidance  from Peoples Party's manifesto, the present Government started  implementation of a strategy for recovery of the country's  economy which should help in solving all the problems. Instead  to seeking cheap popularity, the Government wants the country to  move into 21st century honourably through revolutionary,  political social and economic reforms. Economic policy of the  present Government is based on the following principles:    (a) Macro-economic stability and reduction in inflation.    (b) consistent increase in the GDP.    (c) Development of social sector, human resource  development, increase in productivity, and elimination of  un-employment.    (d) Growth of energy and physical sectors.    (e) Establishment of free and open economy and defining of  a new public and private sector partnership.    (a) Economic Stability: For macro-economic stability, it is  absolutely essential that budget deficit should be reduced to a  level which should be consistent with the target of low  inflation and ability to service debt. Consequently monetary  expansion should be in line with the targets for growth rate of  GDP and price stability. The third element which is no less in  importance relates to international balance of payments. This  should be kept at appropriate level which should not adversely  affect the desirable level of foreign exchange reserves. In  other words we want to establish such a balance for monetary  fiscal and foreign trade politics which could help in the growth  domestic production, control inflation and provide a balance  between the two components of the economy viz. domestic and  external.    (b) Increasing growth in GDP: An increase in the gross  domestic product is un-avoidably for improving the standard of  living. Fundamental objective of our policy is to ensure a  minimum 7 per cent per annum growth of GDP in the future. It is  possible only if both agriculture and industry grow adequately.  Therefore, we are proposing a pricing policy along with  monetary structure which should make it possible to improve  performance of these sectors and provide for significant  increase in productivity.    (c) Development of Social Sectors and Elimination of  Unemployment: Compared to other developing countries, our  literacy rate is very low. Due to in-adequate health facilities  the average age longevity is also low. Pakistan has achieved  significant GDP growth rates but in the human resource  development indicators it stands at 120th position amongst the  countries of world. Unless we make significant improvement in  this, we cannot ensure continuous and durable progress for the  people. Therefore, an important element of our strategy is to  remove economic and social disparities as quickly as possible.  Besides our Manifesto the history and character of the People's  party demands this of us.    (d) development of Energy and Physical Infrastructure:    11. [number as published] In view of low priority given to  these sectors in development plans their present growth rate is  far less than the requirement. Growth of agriculture and  industrial sectors is dependent on the provision of these basic  facilities. A proper pricing policy and proper Fiscal and  Monetary investments are necessary for the growth of these  sectors.    (e) Establishment of open and free economy and defining of a  new public and private partnership:    12. Our government believes in a free and open economy. We  want to encourage free market policies. We are against control  and regulations. We emphasise dis-investment and privatisation  of public sectors since we originally introduced this policy.  Corner stone of our policy is to encourage domestic and foreign  investors. We have introduced a new concept of public and  private partnership. Under this the private sector in  partnership with the Government has to play a more effective  role in social sector and establishing labour intensive small  industries. It is also our policy that private sector has to  devise such economic policies which should provide guidance and  encouragement to the private sector. Basically public sector  has to provide national defence and ensure law and order.    13. During eight months of the present government much has  been achieved.     -  By 31st March, 1994 bank borrowing for budget deficit has  been contained to only Rs 10.34 billion. During the same period  last year the bank borrowing was Rs 61.87 billion.    -  Domestic credit expansion was kept at 5.3 per cent as against  19.6 per cent during the previous year.        14. A new policy has been introduced for Agriculture Sector  under which support prices for major crops have been adequately  increased. Recent increase in the support price of wheat is a  part of this policy. To increase the pace of foreign investment  and industrial growth an Investment Board under the Prime  Minister has been established. National Investment Council,  Pakistan Investment Board and Investment Promotion Bureau have  been merged into this new Board. A Data Bank will be  established under this board which will Provide basic  information for investment to the domestic and foreign  investors. A new Privatisation Policy has been formulated and  its process has been made more transparent and quicker. Thirty  one industrial units have been identified for privatisation and  some have already been sold.    15. Declining trend in production has been contained. There  has been a record production of Rice and Sugarcane. Similarly  Sugar and Nitrogenous Fertilizer Industries have achieved record  production levels. However, with fall in Cotton production and  its negative impact on Textile Industry, and the fall in Wheat  production due to drought have affected the growth rate of GDP  to some extent. During the current financial year considerable  increase has been achieved in the production capacity of some  important industries, like Textile, Chemical Fertilizer, cement  and Sugar. Nevertheless GDP has grown by 4 per cent during the  current year as against 2.3 per cent achieved during the  preceding year. Increase in agriculture production in estimated  at 2.6 per cent whereas it had recorded a fall of 5.3 per cent  during the preceding year. Overall industrial growth has  increased by 5.6 per cent which is higher than the preceding  year. Trade Deficit in the balance of payments has been reduced  by 35.3 per cent up to April, 1994. This was made possible by  lower imports as compared to exports.    16. During the period July-December in the current financial  year disbursement of industrial credit increased by 17 per cent.  Foreign investment up to 30th March, 1994 stood at $417.2  million which is 58.1 per cent higher than $263.9 million for  the same period during the preceding year.    17. During the first four months there as tremendous  pressure  on consumer prices on account of expansionary monetary and  fiscal policies of the past, increase in taxes in the Budget  1993-94, increase in Petroleum and Cement and Gas prices and  depreciation of the Rupee. Price Index for 20 consumer items  increased by 5.5 per cent during July-October. The present  Government introduced discipline in monetary and fiscal polices.  Import duties were adjusted to keep the domestic supply of  essential commodities at an appropriate level. Network of  Utility Stores was made more effective and Utility During Stores  were established. We expect the prices to stabilise as a result  of Fiscal and Monetary stability.    18. Comparatively low growth in our social sectors has been  caused by low literacy rate and falling educational standards.  Our Government has decided to increase the allocation for  education from 2.4 per cent of GDP to 3 per cent of GDP within  the next ten years. In addition an Advisory Council has been  established to introduce reforms in the Education Sector. Steps  are in hand to provide incentives to the private sector in the  Education Sector. A fifteen months' training programme for  10,000 un-trained and un-employed female teachers has been  started from February, 1994. This will cost Rs 25 million.    19. An integrated and large Social Action Programme [SAP]  was  implemented in 1992-93. We have expanded this programme. Under  this, expansion will be undertaken of all facilities in the  rural areas, for female education, primary education, basic  health, nutrition levels, population welfare, clean drinking  water supply and drainage.  <H5>  Under The Social Action Programme </H5>    -  Training of 10,000 Primary Teachers will be organised.    -  33000 Female Health workers will be trained to that birth and  infant mortality rates can be reduced.    -  Facilities of technical training of 50,000 persons will be  provided.    -  600,000 persons have been provided employment during 1993-94.        20. For the development of general health services 102 Basic  Health Units [BHU's] and 21 Rural Health Centres [RHC's] were  established during the current financial year while 2206 beds  were added in the Hospitals. In the Health Sector, Additional  3426 Doctors, beds were added in the Hospital. [sentence as  published] In the Health Sector, additional 3426 Doctors, 250  Dental Doctors, 1890 Nurses, 6800 TBAs [expansion unknown] and  4900 Paramedics were trained.    21. We are giving special attention to the welfare of Women.  Our last government established the First Women Bank. Now we  have started a programme for separate police stations for Women.  Women have been appointed judges during the current year.  Ministry of Women Development have provided Rs 48 million to  First Women Bank so that women can be provided loans for income  generating projects at 10 per cent mark-up.    22. A new policy at a cost of Rs 700 billion has been  announced for increased availability of energy. Besides the  public sector, private sector particularly Overseas Pakistanis  will be asked to assist in this effort. The present Government  have started many major projects. Most important project  amongst them is Ghazi Brotha Hydel Project. This project has a  production capacity of 1425 MW [megawatts] and will be completed  by the year 2000. This project has already been approved. The  second major project is the Hub Power Project. This project is  in the Thermal Power sector and the entire investment is being  provided by the private sector. This project will be completed  in 1996 at a cost of $1820 million. Its production capacity is  1292 MW. Besides this a new policy package for the private  sector participation in the Electric Power Sector was announced  in March, 1994. Import elements of this policy package include  product purchase price at internationally competitive rates,  soft terms for credit in the local currency and simplification  of procedures. It has also been decided that in future the  Government will only invest in Hydel Power Sector and Thermal  Power Sector will be fully reserved for private investment. In  this connection domestic and foreign investors including  Overseas Pakistanis investors will be provided same incentives.    23. We have provided full legal and operational autonomy to  the State Bank of Pakistan. Credit system and mark up structure  is being reformed to encourage savings. New financial  institutions for special purpose like Kisan Banking Windows in  public sector and Kisan Bank Scheme in private sector, are being  established. I am happy to announce that Kisan Bank Scheme will  be introduced from 1st July, 1994 and Kisan Banking Windows will  be open for business in the entire country. Lending procedure  will be appropriately devised to enable us to move forward to  meet the requirements of small farmers. This will lead to  growth in the agriculture sector. Separate allocation will be  made for Kisan Banking Windows.    24. Reform of taxation system is absolutely essential.  Without this objective of economic stability cannot be  achieved. For this purpose measures will be taken which will  bring about appropriate elasticity in the taxes. Taxes will be  reduced on production and investment and transferred to  consumption. I will be elaborating this later on.    25. Capital market has not fully developed in our country.  We are intruding reforms to improve its performance. Foreign  nationals and overseas Pakistanis have already been permitted to  invest on a repatriable basis in corporate debt instruments. As  a further step, trust money and employers provident funds are  now being allowed to be invested in all listed securities as  well as bonds, redeemable capital and instruments issued by the  Water and Power Development Authority [WAPDA]. The Companies  Ordinance and the Trust Act are being amended accordingly for  this purpose through the Finance Bill. Moreover, Foreign  Exchange Bonds will be floated in the International Market and  our Stock Exchanges will be linked with major Stock Exchanges of  the world.    26. We have devised an integrated and clear strategy to  enable us to begin the new year with fresh determination and  hopes. While increasing the pace of growth we will also rectify  our weakness and mistakes which have destabilised our economy.  Important requirements of our strategy are as follows:    (i) To re-invigorate the pace of economic growth and  increase  the rate of GDP growth from 4 per cent to 6.9 per cent. Major  contribution for this growth will be provided by Agriculture and  Industries Sector with a growth rates of 8 per cent and 7 per  cent respectively for which necessary policies are being  formulated.    (ii) The second element of our strategy is the establishment  of Fiscal and Monetary stability. We are reducing overall  fiscal deficit to less than 6 per cent in 1993-94 as compared to  7.9 per cent in 1992-93. This will be further reduced during  the next year. I will be giving the details later on. Monetary  expansion which had reached 18 per cent in 1992-93 has been  reduced to 14.1 per cent in 1993-94 and will be further reduced  to 11.8 per cent next year. This will not only have a positive  impact on inflation but also bring about fiscal stability. We  will maintain the current year's rising trend in Foreign  Exchange Reserves and further strengthen it by a 19 per cent  increase in Exports.    (iii) Rate of growth of infrastructure has been less than  increasing demand. Consequently we are facing loadshedding and  other problems. A fast increase in energy, water,  communications and other infrastructure is important component  of our strategy. Higher allocations have been made for these  sectors in the PSDP [Public Sector Development Program] for the  next year. Private sector is also being provided incentives and  facilities so that they can invest in these sectors.    (iv) Social Sectors have suffered from lack of attention and  increase in population has made the matters worse. In this  connection many actions have been taken which will be further  strengthened during the next year.    27. In addition, on the direction of the Prime Minister, a  programme to provide 33000 Village Health Workers has been  started who will help in providing better health services to  women and children in rural areas. These Female workers come  from the areas where the Basic Health Units are located.    Mr Speaker:    28. The size of budgeted PSDP for the next financial year  has been fixed at Rs 90 billion which is 20 per cent higher than  last year. Our Government had wished to increase it further but  due to resource constraints and requirement of fiscal discipline  it was not possible. Our effort is that this development  programme may be further strengthened for which public sector  agencies like WAPDA, PAO [expansion unknown], PTC [Pakistan  Television Corporation], and OGRC [expansion unknown] may  further invest with their own resources to carry our development  activities in their respective field.    Important feature of the PSDP are as follows:    (i) Allocations for educational training has been increased  by 45.2 per cent.    (ii) Funds for health sector has been increased by 191.3  per cent.    (iii) Rs 10 billion have been allocated to the Provinces  for SAP which is an increase of Rs 1.2 billion over the last  year. Besides this, Federal agencies are being provided Rs 2  billion of this programme.    (iv) Development budget for science and technology has  been increased by 97.9 per cent.    (v) 64.5 per cent increase has been provided to the  allocations for Women's Development.    (vi) Adequate allocations have been made to different  development schemes including Chashma Nuclear Project, Water  Resource Projects, Anti-Waterlogging and Salinity Projects,  Sainkdak Copper Project and Water Supply Schemes.    (vii) Rs 3 billion have been provided for Peoples  Programme.    (viii) Allocation for Tameer-e-Sindh Programme have been  raised from Rs 1.5 billion to Rs 2.5 billion.    (ix) Rs 3.6 billion have been provided for LBOD [expansion  unknown] and Rs 0.5 billion for RBOD [expansion unknown].    29. Irrigation water supply which was 127 MAF [expansion  unknown] in 1993-94 will be increased to 130 MAF in 1994-95.  Out of this 81 MAF in be provided from be On-going Irrigation  Schemes including Canal Rehabilitation Scheme and the remaining  49 MAF will be provided by new tube wells from the ground water  resource by SCARP [Salinity Control and Reclamation Project] and  private sector.     -  Approximately one hundred thousand hectare affected land  will be saved from water logging and salinity by installing 804  SCARP tube wells and more than 6000 private sector tube wells.  Left and right bank outfall Drains, Punjnad, Abbasia, Ford Wah  Sadiqua, Swabi SCARP and many other projects are included in  this programme.    -  First two phases of Chashma Canal Bank Project have been  completed and the third phase will be expedited.    -  Pat Feeder Canal Project which is under implementation  satisfactorily has been provided large allocation.    -  A number of Irrigation System Rehabilitation Schemes will be  completed in the next year. This includes renovation of 3435  water channels, land levelling of 19486 hectare and  establishment of Demonstration Centres. The expenditure on  these schemes is estimated at Rs 1068.5 million.        30. In the Power Sector 6097 villages will be provided power  during the next financial year. 570,000 new electric  connections will be made available. Ghazi Brotha Project will  also be started next year. It is expected the crude oil  production will be 56000 barrel per day whereas natural gas  production will rise to 1954 million cft [expansion unknown] per  day. Forty five (45) new oil and gas wells will be dug in the  public and private sectors and gas supply will be extended to  additional 41 towns.    31. Work for modernization of Railways will be continued.  Eighteen (18) new Engines will be purchased while 46 Diesel  Electric Engines will be recommissioned. Better facilities will  be provided for passengers.    32. In the Communications Sector, two hundred thousand  telephone lines will be laid. The old Gateway Exchange at  Karachi will be replaced with a new exchange and Islamabad will  be provided with another Gateway Exchange. Eighty five  thousands (85000) old EMS [expansion unknown] lines will be  changed into digital exchanges. Stations will be established at  85 different places for consumers and 36 new cities and towns  will be linked with NWD [expansion unknown] facilities.    33. To overcome the water scarcity in Islamabad, it has been  decided to increase to pace of work on Khanpur Dam to Islamabad  Water Supply Pipelines by providing Government resources. Water  supply to Islamabad from Simly Dam will also be continued.  Moreover, a project for installing new tube wells has also been  approved.    34. Provision of basic health services will be continued in  the Health Sector particularly disease prevention and control  measures and nutritional scheme will be continued in the rural  areas. Twenty four (24) new Basic Health Units and 6 new Rural  Health Centres will be established while 557 BHUs and 81 RHCs  will be upgraded. Ninety one (91) new Urban Rural Centres will  be established. In addition 3460 Doctors, 250 Dentists, 3600  Nurses, 9700 paramedics, 33000 Village Health Workers, 3740 TBAs  will be employed by the Health Department after completing  training.    35. 3.92 million infant children cover will be provided  under  the EPI [expansion unknown] during the next financial year. The  Prime Minister in this respect has inaugurated a new campaign on  27th April, 94.    36. Special allocations have been made for population  control  measures. Besides this a Population Day will be organised on  11th July, 1994 to highlight the different aspects of the  problems and people may be encouraged for Population Welfare.  <H5>  Socio-Economic Package for Karachi </H5>   37. Karachi is the nerve centre of industrial and commercial  activities in the country and it makes as sizeable contribution  to the overall economic growth. The development of civic  amenities has not received proper attention in the past. In  order to improve the situation, the Government has announced a  comprehensive package for the socio-economic improvement of the  city. This package will cost Rupees 121 billion and it will  primarily address problems on account of the shortage of  electrical power, water and mass transit. In the energy sector,  the power availability in Karahci would be enhanced from 1700 MW  to 4000 MW at a total Cost of Rs 88 billion. In addition, the  rehabilitation of KESC's [Karachi Electric Supply Corporation]  transmission and distribution system will also be undertaken at  a cost of Rs 6.2 billion. Further, a desalination plant will be  set up which would provide an additional 10 million gallon of  potable water per day at a projected cost of US $1.2 billion  with foreign funding. For better transportation, the project  for providing mass transit system for Karachi would be  undertaken on priority basis.  <H5>  Eighth Five Year Plan </H5>   Mr Speaker:    38. From next year, macro-economic targets at the major  elements of our integrated medium term plan. Our Government has  recently approved the Eighth Five Year Plan in the light of our  priorities and manifesto. Total outlay of this plan in 1992-93  prices is Rs 1701 billion which is 48 per cent higher than 7th  Five Year Plan. Rs 752 billion have been provided for the public  sector and Rs 949 billion have been kept for private sector.  Under the plan, target for GDP growth is 7 per cent consisting  of 4.9 per cent for agriculture, 9.9 per cent industry and 6.7  per cent for services. The Plan gives priority to social  sectors, physical infrastructure and development of energy and  water resources. Attainment of macro-economic stability has been  emphasised. Accordingly, fiscal deficit will be reduced from  7.9 per cent of GDP to 4 per cent of GDP. Current account  deficit in the balance of payment will be reduced from 7 per  cent of GDP to 2.4 per cent of GDP. Furthermore the Plan aims  at limiting the long-term foreign debt to 36 per cent of the GDP  and monetary expansion has been kept at below nominal growth  rate in current prices of GDP so that inflation can be reduced  from 10.6 per cent to 6 per cent. National savings will be  increased from 15.8 per cent to 19.9 per cent of national  income. Under the Plan 6.2 million new employment opportunities  will be created besides that domestic debt will be reduced. As  stated earlier legislation will be undertaken to limit the  budgetary deficit.  <H5>  Special programmes for Social Welfare </H5>   39. Rs 50 million were provided for the welfare of  minorities, reconstruction and development of their religious  places and the needy under the Minorities Affairs Division.  Another Rs 50 million are provided in the next year. Moreover,  the Minority Members of the Assembly were provided Rs 5 million  for educational scholarships for the students of minority  community. Another Rs 5 million have been provided for this  purpose during the next financial year. 4886 widows benefited  from the loan remission policy for HBFC [House Building Finance  Corporation] loans. In the new budget Rs 20 million under this  policy have been kept for HBFC.  <H5>  Zakat and Ushr </H5>   40. The Government has taken many steps to improve the  working of Zakat and Ushr [Islamic Tithe and Agricultural Tax  System] system so that their operations are transparent and  accountability of administration for indiscipline can be made  certain. During the current financial year approximately 1.1  million widows, orphans and handicapped persons were provided Rs  1440 million. In addition Rs 960 million were provided for  scholarships, medical treatment, technical and religious  education through schools, hospitals, religious maddrassas  [schools] and social welfare organisations. Mustehikeen [those  eligible to receive Zakat and Ushr assistance] of Northern Areas  are also being provided assistance. A target of Rs 2.5 billion  has been kept for assistance from the Central Zakat Fund for the  next financial year. Improved collection system under Ushr will  provide additional resources. The Government has provided Rs 1  billion during the next financial year for new agricultural  loans and interest free agricultural loans for Haris of Kacha  lands in Sindh. These loans will be provided through  Agricultural Development Bank, Federal Bank for Cooperatives and  Commercial Banks.    41. The former Government had kept no provision for Baitul  Mal [public welfare fund] in the Budget. We have provided Rs  1.02 billion in the next financial year for Baitul Mal Fund for  assistance to the poor and needy. This is a reflection of the  Prime Minister's deep concern for the welfare of the needy  persons of the society.  <H5>  Debt Burden </H5>   42. The Peoples Government wishes to take the nation into  confidence about our alarming debt burden. Past Government's  particularly that of Nawaz League did not meet their expenditure  by raising adequate revenues. They did not keep a balance  between income and expenditure.    43. They borrowed more in three years that all governments  from Quaid-e-Azam to the last Peoples Government. They chose to  borrow, and borrow heavily, and borrow expensively. This  unforgivable mismanagement sin increased our debt to such a high  level that Government's expenditure on payment of interest on  this debt is threatening the whole fiscal system. This problem  can be better viewed in a historical perspective.    44. When the first PPP [Pakistan People's Party] Government  of Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took over debt servicing  was 3 per cent of GDP. The PPP Government brought it down by  1976-77 to 2.7 per cent of the GDP. Then came the Zia years.  By the time the second PPP Government was sworn, in debt  servicing had risen to 6 per cent of the GDP. Then came Nawaz  League. By 1993-94 the estimate was 8.15 per cent GDP. This  alarming growth of debt cannot continue. If it does, the  government will have to tax people heavily every year only to  meet its obligations towards debt servicing. The choice before  us is either adhocism or long-term solution. We can borrow  heavily to pay our debts and thus compound the problem for the  future. Or we can raise enough revenues to meet expenditure.  We are thinking of the future. The future of our children. Of  our coming generations. Therefore, we have chosen the second  course, because we do not believe in cheap popularity. We  believe in lasting recognition and redemption in the eyes of  those who voted us in -- the poor and oppressed, the middle  classes and working classes whose standard of living has  continued to deteriorate. Today, we adopt policies for  long-term stability of the economy so that Pakistan grows strong.    Mr Speaker Sir:    45. I will now take up the Budget Estimates. Revenue  receipts were initially estimated at Rs 217 billion in the  Budget Estimates for the current financial year. The Revised  Estimates stand at Rs 211 billion. This reduction is due to 12  per cent fall in the imports. The initial estimates for current  expenditure were Rs 258 billion. The Revised Estimates now  stand at Rs 272 billion. The increase is due to ad-hoc Relief  for Government servants and debt servicing.    46. Net capital receipts were estimated at Rs 40 billion.  This estimate is being maintained.    47. Overall fiscal deficit was estimated at Rs 85 billion  which was to be financed by Rs 23 billion from external  resources, Rs 49 billion from non-bank borrowing and Rs 13  billion from bank borrowing. According to revised estimates  overall fiscal deficit will be Rs 91 billion while bank  borrowing will be limited to Rs 20 billion.    48. National Economic Council has fixed 4 per cent as the  target for overall fiscal deficit. The limit for bank borrowing  for the budget had been fixed at Rs 15 billion. In view of  these targets receipt and expenditure estimates for the next  financial year are proposed as follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(i) Revenue Receipts                  |Rs 238 Billion                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(ii) Current Expenditure              |Rs 295 Billion                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(iii) Public Sector Development Progr-|Rs 90 Billion                         |  |am                                    |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(iv) Self-Generation                  |Rs 10 Billion                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(v) Overall Fiscal Deficit (at 4 per  |Rs 72 Billion                         |  |cent of GDP)                          |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(vi) Net External Resources           |Rs 31 Billion                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(vii) Non-Bank Borrowing              |Rs 26 Billion                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(viii) Bank Borrowing                 |Rs 15 Billion                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(ix) Resource Gap                     |Rs 30 Billion                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

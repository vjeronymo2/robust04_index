			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Thorntons drops to Pounds 7m LAUNCH COSTS for two lines of chocolates slimmed profit margins at Thorntons, the chocolate maker and retailer. The shares fell 10p to 200p as the group announced pre-tax profits down 2 per cent, from Pounds 7.16m to Pounds 7.02m, for the half year to January 9. Operating margins were eroded from 15 per cent to 14.1 per cent, mainly because of the launch of the Select range and the relaunch of the Continental products in the UK. The group's UK retail operations achieved sales of Pounds 39.3m, up 9.6 per cent on the previous year. Mr John Thornton, chairman and chief executive, whose family owns 48 per cent of the shares, said profits were slightly under expectations. In the four weeks to Christmas, UK retail sales grew 8.3 per cent on the previous year. The group said it was Pounds 750,000 short of stock. The group's French subsidiary continued to make losses, although he said the full-year figure might be less than last year's Pounds 750,000 deficit, partly depending on currency fluctuations. Sales in France rose to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 4.6m). Interest payments increased to Pounds 650,000 (Pounds 478,000) with net borrowings at the half year of Pounds 4.8m. The group has suffered because of relatively high French interest rates. Thorntons has between Pounds 7m and Pounds 8m in French franc long term loans. Capital spending increased to Pounds 5m (Pounds 3.7m). The group spent Pounds 1m on shops, opening 30 more outlets in the UK bringing the total to 442. It opened two more shops in France. The group spent Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 1.4m) on plant. Earnings per share slipped to 7.38p (7.53p). The interim dividend is maintained at 1.25p.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Japanese in Hungary car deal Suzuki Motors of Japan is to add four-wheel-drive cars to the range produced at its plant in Hungary, under an agreement with the rival Fuji Heavy Industries, which will sell them in Europe badged as Subarus. Up to 12,000 a year will be supplied to FHI from next year under an original equipment manufacture deal. The versions of the Suzuki Cultus, currently produced in two-wheel-drive form, will replace a Subaru Justy model which FHI had previously shipped from Japan. Sales of the model have already been discontinued in the domestic market. The two companies agreed in June to co-operate in developing automatic transmissions, and yesterday's disclosure prompted speculation that they could move to joint development of cars as part of cost-cutting efforts.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (4): Scars that will not heal easily - A look at the rift between the government and the central bank It was always on the cards that the Bank of Italy would enjoy an uneasy relationship with the inexperienced right-wing coalition headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi. Yet no one foresaw the degree to which the central bank and the government have fallen out. On occasions, the two have scarcely been on speaking terms as the bank has fought a rearguard action to protect its autonomy - an almost unprecedented situation in a G-7 country. Even if now both sides are making a determined effort to establish a proper working relationship, the scars left by these scraps will not heal easily. The bank will also continue to find itself in a difficult position regarding monetary policy and interest rates, where it risks being on the opposite side of the fence. The government wants interest rates to go down to lower the cost of servicing Italy's huge debt stock and so keep the 1995 budget deficit projections on course. Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, believes once the 1995 budget is approved by parliament, then interest rates should go down. The bank, on the other hand, is far more cautious. On the other hand, Mr Antonio Fazio, the governor, has repeatedly said his priority is to protect the currency and ensure that inflation does not return as the domestic recovery strengthens. This led him to raise the discount rate in mid-August by half a percentage point to 7.5 percent, and he has warned that he will not hesitate to do so again if the circumstances require. Indeed, in the bank's latest quarterly bulletin, it politely told the government that the 1995 budget projections for the cost of debt service were too low and the deficit consequently greater. The bulletin also doubted the feasibility of achieving a 2.5 per cent annualised inflation target next year. The problematic relationship began from the very start of the new administration in May, when Mr Dini was recruited to the treasury from being the bank's director-general - the number-two job in the bank's four-man executive directorate. As treasury minister, he immediately became the single most important government figure determining economic and financial policy. The Bank of Italy has always enjoyed a good and close relationship with the treasury, with the central bank often supplying the latter's best technicians. However, in this case matters were clouded by personal sentiment. By seniority, Mr Dini had been the natural candidate to become governor when, the previous year, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was called from near retirement to become prime minister. However, on that occasion Mr Dini was passed over in favour of Mr Fazio, then the number three in rank in the directorate. The friction resulting from this promotion complicated the choice of a successor to Mr Dini. The members of the four-man directorate at the bank are chosen by the institution's governing council (composed of the chairman of the Bank of Italy's regional offices), and the appointment is then approved by the cabinet and the head of state. Traditionally this has been a consensual process between the various actors. But the Berlusconi government was heavy-handed in trying to influence the choice of candidates - imposing a veto on Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, the senior of the two deputy directors, because he was considered too close to Mr Ciampi. Instead the right-wing coalition insisted on an outsider, which the bank resisted. As a result, the stand-off lasted from June until mid-October when the bank named Mr Vincenzo Desario, the junior of the two deputy directors, as a compromise candidate. Even then the government demurred in accepting the outcome, and delayed approval for almost three weeks to make its displeasure plain. No one has emerged unscathed from this affair. By waiting so long to name a Dini successor, the bank appeared undecided and therefore subject to political pressure. The bank's governing council also found itself in the embarrassing position of choosing Mr Desario, whose career in the bank has been essentially confined to supervision of the banking system, over a more experienced and internationally recognised central banker, Mr Padoa Schioppa. As further evidence of sensitivities, the bank decided not to name a successor to Mr Desario in the directorate until the latter's appointment had been digested. The government still wants a say in who takes his job, and thus it may not go to the next in line within the bank. The coalition's desire to interfere in the activities of the central bank has dragged the institution into the political arena in a way not seen 1979 over the affairs of Banco Ambrosiano and the late banker Roberto Calvi. Members of the coalition have gratuitously attacked Mr Ciampi for his role as honorary governor, arguing that it is unacceptable that, having been prime minister, he should be allowed to retain this position with an office available at the bank. It is is nevertheless bank tradition that former governors have this honorary role. The bank has also been criticised for the way it continues to exclude politicians from the invitation to attend the governor's annual message on the economy on the occasion of the annual meeting at the end of May. Coalition members argue the governor's message is often 'political' and that therefore it is undiplomatic to exclude the politicians. What is more important, members of the coalition have been muttering darkly of the need to re-examine the central bank's statutes. The aim of this would be to regulate the governor's currently unlimited tenure to a fixed term. Another suggestion, vigorously rejected by the bank, is that its supervision functions be hived off. With the banking system now undergoing radical transformation in the wake of privatisation, the supervision side of the bank acquires heightened significance. For instance, the bank now finds itself in a highly visible role as arbiter of the merits of a hostile take-over by Credito Italiano of Credito Romagnolo. With many competing banking - plus political and socio-economic - considerations at stake, the last thing the bank needs in these circumstances is a tense relationship with the government. Perhaps the final casualty of the row over Mr Dini's replacement has been rational discussion of the future role of the bank, 100 years old last year. It is the one Italian institution to have preserved its dignity and respect during the past two years of tumultuous political change. Nevertheless, as the banking system is privatised and the state retreats from its dominant role in the economy, it is an opportune moment to reassess the size and precise function of the central bank. Unfortunately, tempers are too heated and the bank has been placed too much on the defensive for a proper discussion.</p>

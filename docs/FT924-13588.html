			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / People: Ogilvy steps up at Hypo F&amp;C Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial Group is reshuffling its top management to reflect the change in composition of its business. But the moves give no clue as to who will take over at the top of one of the UK's faster growing fund management companies when the current team bows out. The changes, in the spirit of a company that has always been run along collegiate lines, are prompted by the retirement of Oliver Dawson, on reaching 61, from the double role as chairman of the holding company Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial Management and the management company Foreign &amp; Colonial Management (FCM). James Ogilvy (right), 58, chief executive of the holding company, takes on the role of its chairman as well. Michael Hart, 59, who manages the Pounds 1.1bn F&amp;C investment trust, and who has indicated he wishes to continue until he is 65, tops off his 37-year career at the company by stepping up from deputy chairman to chairman of the management company. 'This gives him far greater authority to hold sway on decisions that affect FCM,' according to Ogilvy. Dawson meanwhile continues as chief investment officer of FCM, and as a director of the investment trust. Ogilvy, who points out that he has not managed money for 15 years, says his experience is in running and building the business, in contrast to Hart who is seen as the investment guru. Group funds under management in the past five years have nearly trebled to Pounds 6bn and Ogilvy believes the bulk of growth prospects also lies outside the UK; he therefore wants to devote more of his time to developing that side of the group. Having put together the 50/50 joint venture with Hypo Bank in Munich shortly after he arrived from Mercury Asset Management, Ogilvy has created a partnership that is working well, with Hypo Bank, for instance, giving F&amp;C more than DM5bn of funds to manage. This is in marked contrast to many of the foreign bank involvements with UK fund managers, notably the Societe Generale purchase of Touche Remnant which is now unravelling. As for the succession, Ogvilvy admits that 'I think I know what is going to happen five years down the line,' but he will give away nothing. 'I don't think even in an industrial company you would get indications of the succession yet.' ***** David Triesman has been appointed general secretary of the 31,000-strong Association of University Teachers. Triesman's new job will not be a radical departure for him, since he has spent nearly 12 years working for Natfhe, the public sector lecturers' union, most recently as national negotiating secretary. Besides, Triesman put aside radical departures when the 1968 student revolution came to an end. Rumoured to have been a student leader, he is a little evasive about his precise role in events, although he admits to prominence. He took part in a bid to stop a government recruitment drive for biological warfare scientists at Essex University, where he read social science. Following a postgraduate degree, he embarked on a career as an academic, but has eschewed the sandals-with-socks-and-brown-rice style of boffin in favour of what colleagues describe as sartorial elegance. For instance, when some years ago, national negotiations were on the point of breaking down, a pink-pullovered Triesman took time out to change into a grey suit. He told fellow negotiators he did not think pink suitable attire for collapsing talks. Triesman combines a love of football - he is a Spurs fan and was once a semi-professional player - with an extensive art collection. He believes he owns the largest collection of works by marine and river artist William Wyllie. He replaces Diana Warwick who resigned to become the first chief executive of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy.</p>

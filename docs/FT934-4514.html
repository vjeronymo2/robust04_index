			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Software that addresses the issue Typing letters is time-consuming and typing out the envelope can take as long. Now Japanese manufacturer Seiko Instruments has produced a tiny machine which sits beside a PC and prints out an address label every time a letter is written. The sophisticated software in the Smart Label Printer Plus recognises the combination of letters and numbers which make up the local postcodes or zip codes. Once a postcode is typed at the end of the recipient's address at the top of the letter, the label is automatically printed. Seiko: UK, 0628 770001.</p>

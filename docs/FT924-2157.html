			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Major expects EC to gain three more states by 1995 MR JOHN MAJOR predicted yesterday that the Edinburgh summit would lead to a decisive shift in the direction of the European Community with its enlargement to at least 15 members by the beginning of 1995. As the successful outcome of the summit won a warm reception from most Conservative MPs at Westminster, Mr Major said he expected Sweden, Finland, Austria, and possibly, Norway, to join the EC in the near future. Seizing the opportunity to undercut Tory critics of the Maastricht treaty, he said the agreement to pledge eventual membership to Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak Republics would allow also the boundaries of the Community to be moved across eastern Europe. Tory Euro-sceptic MPs pledged to continue their fight against British ratification of Maastricht, but the view at Westminster was that the summit had significantly weakened their chances of wrecking the legislation. In a confident mood after what even some opposition MPs conceded had been a considerable negotiating success, Mr Major emphasised that the Community would now move towards enlargement and decentralisation, both long favoured by Britain. By setting out procedures to enforce the concept of subsidiarity EC leaders had agreed that 'national decisions should be the rule and Brussels action the exception', he said. Resolution of Denmark's demands for exemptions from the treaty and settlement of the EC budget for the rest of the decade meant that the Community had now 'come together again as 12 member states with a common purpose'. However, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, sharply criticised the failure of the summit to agree an emergency package of measures to reverse the rising tide of unemployment throughout Europe. Attacking the UK presidency's 'deplorable neglect' of the social dimension of the Community, he said the economic package agreed had failed to meet the appalling prospect of further large increases in unemployment.

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT DECIDES NOT TO CONSIDER MUSEUM MERGER;  </P> <P> ART: DECISION COMES AFTER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT FORMING A CLOSER WORKING  RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LAGUNA INSTITUTION.  </P> <P> Board members of the Newport Harbor Art Museum notified officials at the Laguna  Art Museum on Friday that, for various reasons, "it is not an appropriate time  to consider a merger of the two museums."  </P> <P> The statement came after recent discussions at the two facilities about forming  a closer working relationship, including the possibility of a merger.  </P> <P> Charles Desmarais, director of the Laguna museum, said talk of a merger was  strictly speculative to begin with and that the Newport museum's stance "makes  a lot of sense."  </P> <P> The Laguna museum in September established a committee to explore the  possibility of a merger with the Newport museum, which later formed a similar  committee. The committees have not met jointly, both museums reported.  </P> <P> After the Newport museum's merger committee discussed the issue and conferred  with the museum board's executive committee, the entire board on Thursday  approved a "statement regarding Laguna Art Museum merger inquiry."  </P> <P> That statement, later delivered to Laguna museum officials, said: "In view of  the activities under way at the (Newport) museum, including the search for a  new director, the resolution of the building program for the new museum  building, and the initiation of the Museum Building and Endowment Fund  Campaign, it is not an appropriate time to consider a merger of the two  museums."  </P> <P> The search for a replacement for director Kevin E. Consey was started when he  announced his resignation in August to take a similar post at the Chicago  Museum of Contemporary Art. The Newport museum also is refining design details  for a new facility and has raised about $10 million toward a $50-million drive  for the new building and an endowment, a museum spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Newport trustee Jay M. Young, merger committee chairman, said, "We wish to  remain good neighbors with the Laguna Art Museum and continue to cooperate with  the museum and other museums in Orange County."  </P> <P> Desmarais said Laguna officials established a merger committee in reaction to  suggestions by some Laguna museum members for a closer cooperation with Newport  Harbor.  </P> <P> "It is obvious they feel the need to focus on their capital campaign and their  (search for a new) director, and that seems to be a perfectly resonable  approach to museum business," he said.  </P> <P> He added: "We already do cooperate better than we have in the past and that's  going to be a natural continuing progression. When I say cooperation, I am  certainly not talking about a merger, but there are a lot of ways we can work  together."  </P> <P> As an example, Desmarais noted that two Newport museum staff members are on the  Committee for an Orange County Arts Council that he chairs. The ad-hoc group of  local arts community members is working to establish a countywide arts service  organization.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The UN special envoy for Afghan affairs, Mr. Mahmoud  Mestiri, met Foreign Affairs Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, this  evening. Mestiri conveyed a report on the outcome of his  negotiations with the officials of Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and  Afghanistan and said: The United Nations is seeking to find a  way to end the current crisis in Afghanistan. He also stressed  the use of the Islamic Republic of Iran's experiences in solving  the Afghan crisis.    Mr. Velayati referred to the Islamic Republic of Iran's  efforts to return peace to Afghanistan and said: All of that  country's neighbors stress the establishment of peace and  stability in Kabul because internal situation in Afghanistan  also affects its neighbors.    The special UN envoy for Afghan affair also spoke to our  correspondent describing the existing unrest in Kabul as the  main obstacle on the way to achieve a fundamental solution and  the return of Afghan refugees to their country. Mr. Mestiri  agreed that the help provided by the United Nations to the  Afghan refugees who live in Iran is very little and expressed  the hope that the UNHCR would pay attention to that matter.    On the basis of the same report, the Afghan High  Coordination  Council envoys also met and conferred with Mr Velayati this  evening. Recent developments in Afghanistan were reviewed during  that meeting.</p>

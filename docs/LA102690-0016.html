			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP VOLLEYBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EL TORO GETS REVENGE BY SWEEPING CAPISTRANO VALLEY  </P> <P> El Toro High School suffered its only loss in the South Coast League girls'  volleyball race three weeks ago when the Chargers were swept in three games by  Capistrano Valley.  </P> <P> The Chargers returned the favor Thursday.  </P> <P> El Toro, ranked fifth in Orange County, pulled into a tie for the league lead  with a 15-0, 17-15, 15-9 victory over fourth-ranked Capistrano Valley at El  Toro.  </P> <P> The victory gave the Chargers (12-3, 7-1 in league) a shot at the league title  with two games remaining. Capistrano Valley dropped to 13-5, 7-1.  </P> <P> Marta Bickert had 12 kills, Michelle Mauney 10 and Jamie Smith added nine in a  balanced El Toro attack.  </P> <P> "Today we had six girls kick some serious (butt)," El Toro Coach Mike Jagd  said. "Everything we've been working on the last few weeks came together."  </P> <P> After sweeping the first game, El Toro fought back from game point, 15-14, to  win the second game. Smith and Wendy Bault each had a kill as El Toro pulled  ahead by one, and the game ended on a Capistrano Valley hitting error.  </P> <P> El Toro took control early in the third game, building a 7-2 lead behind the  hitting of Bickert and Smith.  </P> <P> Jagd said he was at fault in El Toro's earlier loss to Capistrano Valley.  </P> <P> "I screwed up because I went with a different rotation every game," he said.  "That confused us and we went out hesitant.  </P> <P> "But right now, we're playing as well as can be expected. We have beaten Mira  Costa, Laguna Beach and lost to Corona del Mar in five games."  </P> <P> Tobi Roquemore and Tanya Mitchell each had nine kills and Allyson Carpenter  added eight for Capistrano Valley.

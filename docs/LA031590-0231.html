			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> WHERE TO GO  </P> <P> FRIDAY  </P> <P> The Lion I's (Charlie's, 362 California St., Ventura, 648-6688). Original  rockin' reggae that'll pack the place.  </P> <P> SATURDAY  </P> <P> Raging Arb &amp; The Redheads (Charlie's).  </P> <P> If these electric blues rockers don't make you dance, you're asleep or you're  dead. Tippa Irie (Caribbean Cuisine, 5838 Hollister, Goleta, 967-7265). He's a  toaster and has nothing whatever to do with breakfast. Toasting is part reggae  and part rap, all the way from England.  </P> <P> SUNDAY  </P> <P> Rickie Lee Jones (Ventura Theatre, 26 S. Chestnut St., Ventura, 648-1936). But  will she still drink a quart of Jack Daniels during her show like she did in  Santa Barbara a few years back?  </P> <P> MONDAY  </P> <P> Michael on Fire (Charlie's). Original rock by a man with a voice as big as all  outdoors, plus a repertoire of 4,000 songs.  </P> <P> TUESDAY  </P> <P> I-Rails, The Regulars (Alex's Cantina, 5918 Hollister, Goleta, 683-2577). The  I-Rails offer intense pop rock by a tight trio that was smart enough to move  here from Visalia.  </P></p>

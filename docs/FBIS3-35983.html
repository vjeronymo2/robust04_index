			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Irina Shchegoleva] </F>   [Text] Sochi, 1 Feb -- "We are against the signing of a  treaty on friendship and cooperation between Russia and Georgia,  planned for 3 February," said Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, chairman of  the Abkhaz Council of Ministers, on behalf of the Abkhaz  government to an ITAR-TASS correspondent this morning. He  believes this treaty "will enable Georgia to have access to  Russian weapons." Sokrat Dzhindzholiya believes the treaty on  friendship and cooperation between Russia and Georgia can only  be signed after a comprehensive settlement of the  Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, which is impossible without defining  Abkhazia's political status.    "During the recent talks in Geneva, only a first step was  made toward the settlement of the conflict," underlined Sokrat  Dzhindzholiya. "The threat of renewed fighting still exists,  and the question of peacekeeping forces for the conflict zone  has been raised. In such conditions, the signing of a treaty  with Georgia is fraught with very serious consequences."    The chairman of the Abkhaz Council of Ministers said leaders  of North Caucasian republics within Russia share his point of  view.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Ageing Europe ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOCIAL EXPENDITURE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Burden per person aged 15-64 years 1980=100               2000     2010     2020     2030     2040  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- France                  101      105      117      129      133 Germany                 112      119      131      157      162 Italy                   102      109      120      135      143 UK                       98      101      106      118      117  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Japan                   112      133      138      136      150 US                       97      100      118      133      132  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW TO ADVERTISE TO OLDER PEOPLE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Don't use models that are too young (not credible) or too old - people   see themselves as 10-15 years younger than they are.  -Show older people interacting with younger generations in real   situations, active and enjoying what they are doing.  -Information and facts are appreciated: cute puns and obscure   abstractions are not.  -No hype, no loud music, no quick cuts - but don't cut out genuine   emotions and feelings.  -Adopt an adult-to-adult tone of voice - people tend to acquire   wisdom with age, not lose it.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 20 POINTS ABOUT AGEING IN EUROPE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   1.  Two out of three over-65s who have ever lived are alive today.   2.  There are around 330m people aged 65 or over alive today. By 2050       there will be 1.4bn.   3.  The world's oldest country is Sweden: 18 per cent of Swedes are       65 or over.   4.  The average European woman of child-bearing age produces 1.7       children. Around 2.1 children are required to replace the       population.   5.  If Germany's fertility rate remains at its current level (1.3)       its native population will be extinct within 300 years.   6.  Ireland and Iceland are the only western European countries with       fertility rates high enough to sustain their populations.   7.  The country with the lowest fertility rate in western Europe is       Italy.   8.  Europeans currently account for almost a tenth of the world's       population. In 2050 they will be less than a fifth.   9.  The number of over-65s in Europe will outstrip the number of       children aged 14 and under around 2020.  10.  More than 50m western Europeans are aged 65 or over - almost 15       per cent of the population.  11.  Of these, almost a quarter are aged 80 or over and 1 1/3m are       90-plus.  12.  By 2050 there will be 70m western European aget 65-plus - over 20       per cent of the population.  13.  A man living in the European Union aged 60 can expect to live       until 78; a woman until 82 1/2.  14.  Almost half the over-80s in the EU live alone.  15.  There are roughly equal numbers of men and women aged 60 in       western Europe. But women outnumber men two-to-one between 80 and       84 and three-to-one between 90 and 94.  16.  Less than 5 per cent of EU people in their sixties are severly       incapacitated. Almost one in three in their eighties is       incapacitated.  17.  Over-60s in the EU would prefer to be called 'senior citizens' or       'older people', according to a Eurobarmeter survey. They do not       like to be called 'elderly', 'pensioners' or 'golden oldies'.  18.  Real economic growth rates of up to 1.5 per cent a year are needed       to pay the increasing bill for pensions over the next 15 years -       more if pensions are to rise with earnings.  19.  Public health spending for people aged 65 and over is more than       four times higher per capita than for the under-65s.  20.  Almost 80 per cent of EU citizens believe that that those in       employment have a duty to ensure, through contributions or taxes,       that older people have a decent standard of living.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: OECD, UN, 3rd Age Marketing  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message to the nation by President Ramiro De Leon Carpio in </F> Guatemala City on 11 April -- live or recorded]    [Text] Dear Guatemalans: Accompanied by the government and  national defense ministers, tonight I must announce to the  Guatemalan people that public security is one of the country's  main problems. Regardless of the solutions that may be found, it  is necessary to guarantee full observance of the law and  compliance with legal norms as fundamental principles in  preserving the state of law.    I have therefore decided that the Government Ministry will  have the support of the Defense Ministry in an effort to provide  honest citizens with the security they have previously lacked so  they can achieve their personal aspirations. I reaffirm the  government's commitment to consolidate democracy and the state  of law. I have ordered an immediate budget allocation for the  civilian security forces that will allow them to readily acquire  the necessary resources to fulfill their duty of safeguarding  the lives, property, and interests of the Guatemalan people.    My government believes the security issue is critical. It is  necessary for the Guatemalan people to support all initiatives  to attain peace and security, especially by filing charges in a  due and timely manner with the state's security organizations  according to the procedure set forth by the Republic's laws.    It has never been so important for the people to regain  their  hopes of achieving real paths toward security. We must end the  unfortunate tradition of police forces being incapable of  resolving the problems that generate uncertainty and  helplessness among citizens.    The current government is promoting these changes and it  will  not rest until they have been made. The authorities, however,  cannot be left alone to achieve this national objective. All  sectors must play their proper role. In this sense I want to ask  for the media's cooperation to help us face this problem  objectively by not listening to the sectors that are trying to  destroy Guatemala's international image. It is also important to  note, without trying to justify our current conditions, that  another one of our unfortunate inheritances from previous  administrations is the abandonment of the civilian security  forces. Previous governments stripped them of vital resources  and passively allowed their moral deterioration by condoning  corruption.    I must also note a paradox. Now that we have a government  that truly respects human rights, our opportunities to purchase  equipment for the security forces have been limited abroad under  the argument that the current government does not respect these  human rights. That is obviously not true because we are  frequently accused of being extremely tolerant and of not taking  the severe actions that some would like.    To return to the central part of my message, which is the  decision to have the national defense minister support the  government minister in providing public security, I must inform  the national and international public that such a decision will  be carried out according to the objectives of the Guatemalan  Army as established in Article 244 of our political  Constitution, which are to preserve national peace and security.    Continuous evaluation and analysis of the results will  provide the necessary criterion on which to base the decision,  in an extreme case, to establish a state of emergency and  enforce public order controls. Army participation in the  security plan does not imply that the country will be placed  under military control, as certain persons or groups might  think. It simply means that the efforts of all the state's  institutions are being brought together to provide maximum  security for the people and their property.    The Army and the various police bodies will work with full  force, but within the law, against those groups that have  perpetrated acts of violence and created an atmosphere of  insecurity and uncertainty among the population. The government  has maintained full respect for the law and will continue its  policy of absolute legality, but it will not hesitate to take  drastic action against criminals.    In conclusion, I wish to express my horror at the recent  attacks against U.S. citizens. Such acts are instigated by  groups harboring individual interests and are part of an  organized strategy to harm the good relations that fortunately  exist between our two countries. As part of the new security  plans, we will act with full force against the groups that are  instigating this violence against U.S. citizens. As a part of  its new public security plan, the Government of the Republic  hereby reiterates its determination to implement whatever  actions are necessary to safeguard the lives, safety, and  property not only of Guatemalans but of the foreigners living  among us or visiting us for business or pleasure.    I have said that I received a nation at war and that I hope  to hand it over in peace. To do so, however, I need everyone's  help. I ask you all to report any act against defenseless  citizens, Guatemalans or otherwise, to the security authorities.  In most cases there has not been such assistance. We are all  responsible for security. We will enforce order with the law in  our hands. No more anarchy. Thank you for your attention and  good night.</p>

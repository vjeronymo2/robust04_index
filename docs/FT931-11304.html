			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / World Trade News: IBM fights for copyright IBM, the US computer group, has joined other US high-technology companies waging an intellectual property war with Japan by filing suit against Kyocera, the bioceramics and electronics company, for alleged copyright infringement. IBM claims Kyocera infringed its copyright covering its basic input/output system (PC BIOS) and is demanding Y18.7bn (Pounds 103.3m) damages. Kyocera responded by stating that the BIOS it uses in its machines is a programme that the company developed independently of IBM's programme. IBM's move comes after nearly three years' negotiations between the two companies. IBM said it was bringing the court action in Tokyo partly to counter possible criticism in Japan of a biased judgment if it should win its case in a US court.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Gieves Gieves Group, the retailer and publisher, may have to make a provision in its results for the year to January 31 because Redwood Press, a former subsidiary, has been placed in administration. Within the sale agreement terms of March last year, under which Gieves sold Redwood to BPMG, Gieves continued to provide guarantees on certain outstanding leasing and hire purchase obligations relating to printing equipment used by Redwood. The amounts outstanding at January 31 were Pounds 3.5m, of which BPMG provided counter indemnities to Gieves in respect of 42 per cent of the outstanding amount. Gieves' directors believe there is a likelihood its contingent liabilities under the guarantees will crystallise and a provision will have to be made. The results will also contain a substantial provision in respect of the write-down of assets employed after closing the Milan store.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arkadiy Zheludkov: "Weekend Explosions in </F> Central Moscow"]    [Text] Explosions are becoming increasingly common in the  capital, which will not please Moscow Criminal Investigation  Department No. 6, which investigates these crimes. The two  latest "firework displays" took place in central Moscow, not far  from IZVESTIYA.    Both explosions occurred at night, which, according to the  experts, rules out the possibility of an attempted killing.  More than likely, specialists from the Main Internal Affairs  Administration say, they were warnings or attempts to  intimidate. At the Main Internal Affairs Administration press  center information was extremely thin on the ground, as ever:  The first explosion took place in the early hours of Saturday  in the branch of the "Stolichnyy" bank that is being constructed  at 22/2 Chekhov Street: An explosive device of an unknown type  went off at 0245 hours. Three windows were shattered, but there  no casualties.    At 0125 hours on the next night, not far away, near 30/2  Tverskaya Street, a Mercedes 230 car exploded. The bomb, of an  unknown type, probably homemade, exploded under the rear right  wheel of the Mercedes and the car was turned over by the blast  onto the car next to it. The privately registered 6-series  Zhiguli was burned out as a result. All that is known about the  owner of the Mercedes is that he is 30, he does not work  anywhere, and he lives on Bolotnikovskaya Street in Moscow.    According to the established practice, there will be a long  search for the bombers, with special crime investigation centers  being set up at the Moscow militia's 108th and 64th stations.  For the time being Muscovites living in the center can only  pray at night or go to their dachas for the weekend.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Baltica chief executive dismissed MR PETER Christoffersen, chief executive of the Baltica Holding insurance group since 1987, was dismissed yesterday. He will leave on December 6. Mr Christoffersen, 46, was responsible for taking Baltica Holding into new areas of business, including banking, ambulances, vehicle recovery, property construction investments and real estate agencies. He also masterminded a strategic alliance with France's Suez group, which holds 23 per cent of the shares in Baltica Holding. This was a defensive measure against a hostile takeover by Danish rival Hafnia. A major reorganisation of Baltica was announced in October, when the company warned of a loss of DKr2.5bn to DKr2.8bn for 1992 and raised DKr2.5bn (Dollars 410m) by selling 32 per cent of Baltica Insurance. In the October reshuffle, Mr Christoffersen was named as prospective chief executive of Baltica Insurance, with Mr Steen Hemmingsen taking over the running of Baltica Holding. Yesterday, however, Mr Hemmingsen was made chief executive of both Baltica Insurance and Baltica Holding. The group's losses this year will reduce equity capital from DKr9bn to DKr4.5bn, the group said in October. The losses include large write-offs on property investments in Gibraltar, where Baltica has invested DKr1.8bn in property developments.</p>

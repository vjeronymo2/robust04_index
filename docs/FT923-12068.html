			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Boycott threat to finance watchdog: Life companies demand uniform stance by new SRO LIFE insurance companies are threatening to boycott a proposed self-regulatory body for retail financial services unless all other organisations that sell the products, such as banks and building societies, are also forced to join. The life companies argue that unless there is uniform regulation of the sale of all retail financial products - such as life insurance, unit trusts and personal pensions bought by individuals - some distributors will have advantages over others and consumers will suffer. The proposed regulator, the Private Investment Authority, is unlikely to succeed unless the leading life insurers agree to join it and support it financially. If regulators cannot find a suitable structure to regulate retail financial services, the government may have to review aspects of the Financial Services Act. Under the act, all financial service providers must belong to a self-regulatory organisation, but have the right to choose which one. They also have the option of being directly regulated by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. While life insurance companies belong to Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the insurance and unit trust industries, the independent advisory arms of building societies are regulated by SIB. The financial services arms of banks are typically members of Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry. The membership rules and fees of all three vary. The new authority was proposed by Sir Kenneth Clucas, a former senior civil servant who was commissioned by SIB to review the regulatory structure for retail financial services. Fimbra, the regulator for independent financial intermediaries, is not considered financially viable because its members, often small or one-person businesses, lack the resources to make substantial contributions. In 1991-92, life companies will have to pay Pounds 14m towards the Investors Compensation Scheme which should have been paid by Fimbra members. Hence Sir Kenneth proposed merging Fimbra with Lautro to form the Private Investment Authority. He also suggested that the large financial intermediaries, about a third of Imro's members, should join the proposed authority. The insurance companies say they want SIB to encourage banks and building societies to join the new authority by refusing to regulate any firm directly unless it has been refused membership of another self-regulatory body. They are also urging an increase in SIB membership fees. Mr Keith Bedell-Pearce, chief executive of Prudential Financial Services, said: 'We support the formation of the PIA but we regard it as absolutely essential that it covers all the financial services covered by the Financial Services Act.' Privately the SIB is reluctant to coerce companies to join any particular self-regulatory body because they have the right of choice and because a regulator with a reluctant membership is unlikely to work well.</p>

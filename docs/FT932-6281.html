			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (20): Time to sing the praises - Case Study: Texaco at Canary Wharf MOVING from the stylish environs of Knightsbridge to the brave new world of Canary Wharf was a big upheaval for the 1,000 employees of Texaco, the US-owned energy group. It was also something of a gamble for their employers. The latest, big arrival at Canary Wharf - the move was completed in March - has taken up residence at 1 Westferry Circus, from where it now operates its group headquarters. Texaco's move from offices close to Harrods was forced upon it by an expiring lease and a landlord who wanted to redevelop, but the choice of where to go next was its own. By 1987, it was clear to the company's executives that the business would have to move from several addresses in the area - held on highly beneficial, historic terms and conditions which it knew could not be repeated. The commercial property market was powering ahead, with West End rents escalating and landlords holding all of the cards. An analysis showed that, while some core personnel had to remain in the centre of London, the others did not. The decision was taken to look beyond the M25 motorway and, in all probability to the west of London. But the arrival of Mr Peter Bijur as chairman of the UK operations brought a change in strategy. Mr Bijur, who has since moved on within Texaco, was keen that Texaco operations should be integrated. He wanted a single site. A variety of options were considered but Canary Wharf, which had been considered at an earlier stage of the relocation exercise, emerged at the top of the list. The quality of office space was regarded as without equal and, despite some concerns over transport links, the comparative price of accommodation made a powerful argument for moving east. By mid-1989, Texaco had signed a commitment to lease floorspace not then completed and undertook an extensive operation, with the help of the London Docklands Development Corporation, to assist staff in calculating the impact on them of the change in address and in devising new routes to work. In early 1990, employees were taken down to docklands to see the development for themselves and to hear LDDC officials sing the praises of what was still largely a building site. There were obviously reservations but there was, also, some surprise at the quality of the working environment being built. Mr Roger Colombe, a Texaco managing director in charge of administration, says that transport links were the most obvious source of concern to staff but that detailed discussions took place to assess the problems and secure suitable travel arrangements. The company also negotiated a series of deals intended to ease the cost and complexity of the journey to work. 'The problem of getting to work is far less than many people originally believed. It will get even better now that some important links in the transport chain are being completed,' says Mr Colombe. Around a third of Texaco employees now drive to work, about 130 use the river bus service and the remainder use the docklands light railway, with its much-improved services. Despite the upheaval, Texaco says that the number of staff leaving as a result of the decision to move has been small. It reckons that, last year, fewer than half a dozen people departed because of the move, although it accepts that at a time of high unemployment, some people remain who might otherwise have been tempted to find more convenient employment. Texaco has not disclosed how much it is paying for its accommodation at Canary Wharf but says it is happy that the rent is highly competitive, relative to the market and to the sort of accommodation costs being paid by its competitors. In short, Texaco does not believe that it has, in any sense, placed itself at a commercial disadvantage. The move itself went smoothly and the business has not been disrupted. The company recognises that staff may not be entirely satisfied with the range of facilities on hand nearby to the office worker - 'more shops]' is a constant cry from people used to the rich, retailing facilities along the Brompton Road and Knightsbridge. But Texaco believes that the area will ultimately fulfil the vision of the developers and says that its move will have proved to be the right one. According to Jane Bentley, a Texaco secretary: 'The surroundings are delightful and the views are wonderful. We could do with more a 'community feel' around us, but that will come in time. Overall, I think most people are quite happy with the move.'</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS / TRADE DEFICIT;  </P> <P> NEW SCHOOL OF THINKING FINDS DOOMSDAY ON IMPORTS UNLIKELY  </P> <P> Remember the dire warnings that America's spree of import-buying would bring on  a "Day of Reckoning?" That the nation's mounting foreign debt -- needed to  finance the lingering trade deficit -- will end up mortgaging future  generations of Americans?  </P> <P> Well, tear up the doom manual: The huge global imbalances -- the United States'  deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan -- are beginning to shrink  and may even disappear before very long, according to a new school of thinking  that is beginning to catch Washington's eye.  </P> <P> As if to underscore this growing belief, the Commerce Department reported  Wednesday that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed dramatically in February to $6.4  billion, its best performance in six years.  </P> <P> Some economists now believe the trade deficit problem could fade in as little  as two or three years. "It's already under way," says Jerry L. Jordan, a former  member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and now at First  Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sharp Reversal  </P> <P> Indeed, new figures for Japan are breathtaking. By the fourth quarter of last  year, Tokyo's current account surplus -- a measure that includes both trade and  investment flows -- had plunged to half its 1987 average of $84.5 billion and  is still shrinking rapidly.  </P> <P> The Japanese turnaround reflects several factors: a sharp increase in imports  over the past few years, made even costlier by the recent decline in the value  of the yen; the increasing tendency of Japanese corporations to manufacture  their products in overseas plants instead of in Japan, and burgeoning tourism  by travel-starved Japanese.  </P> <P> West Germany's surplus is also about to shrivel rapidly, these economists say,  as Bonn channels its money into the rebuilding of East Germany and absorbs it  into a reunified German state. What little may be left could quickly be  invested elsewhere in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Jordan and others predict, the United States' current account  deficit -- again, encompassing both trade and investment flows -- also will  begin to shrink sharply within the next three or four years, as exports  continue to rise, particularly in high-value items such as computers and  aircraft.  </P> <P> "We're very very competitive in those sorts of things, and that's what people  are going to need," Jordan says. "Overall, you're going to see the trade  situation improve -- and fast."  </P> <P> If such optimism proves to be correct, it won't be the first time that the  economic doomsayers have wound up embarrassed about how deftly the economy has  been able to right itself.  </P> <P> Paul Krugman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, points out  that the economy is operating successfully today at a lower rate of growth, far  higher inflation and slower gains in productivity than was thought possible  just 25 years ago.  </P> <P> "American policy could continue more or less on its current course for many  years without any crisis," Krugman says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Advise Caution  </P> <P> Not everyone is convinced that the trade imbalances -- or the economic  situation -- will improve rapidly, as the optimists suggest.  </P> <P> C. Fred Bergsten, an analyst at the Institute for International Economics in  Washington, stands by his earlier forecast that the U.S. trade and current  account deficits will begin widening again in 1990 and 1991. "The situation  basically hasn't changed," he says.  </P> <P> J. Paul Horne, Paris-based international economist for Smith Barney, Harris  Upham Co. cautions that demands for rebuilding Eastern Europe and revitalizing  the European market generally may draw investment away from the United States.  </P> <P> "It would put a rising floor under U.S. interest rates," Horne says.  </P> <P> Finally, America's own internal financial problems are threatening to throw a  monkey wrench into the economic expansion here -- a development that could  rapidly degenerate into a full-fledged recession if the trade and current  account imbalances persist.  </P> <P> Moreover, some industries -- such as services and retailing -- may be  hard-pressed no matter what the situation. "It's not going to be a plus for  everyone," Jordan asserts.  </P> <P> Even so, for now, at least, the numbers are turning out to be far less scary  than predicted. By rights, the Day of Reckoning should have appeared by now. In  fact, it may never come.  </P> <P> Mild winter weather, declining oil prices and a strong dollar help improve  February trade balance.

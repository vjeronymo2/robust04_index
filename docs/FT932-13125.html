			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Affinity credit card fee - At a Glance Bank of Scotland is charging its Affinity credit card holders an annual fee of Pounds 7.50. The fee will appear on the May statements of existing customers and will be charged after six months to new customers. 'The point has come where we can no longer do it for free. We have to make it viable,' said Bank of Scotland, which launched its affinity card in 1990. Affinity cards allow the card holder to make donations to charities or professional associations on a give-as-you-spend basis.</p>

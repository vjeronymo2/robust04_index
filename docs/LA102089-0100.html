			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The Discovery Channel and the Smithsonian Institution are collaborating for the  first time to produce a 13-part science and technology series on "human  invention" that will range from the history behind inventions to segments for  the technically curious. (Just how does a jet engine work?) The magazine-format  programs are due to start airing next fall, and Discovery also will release the  series for the home video and educational markets.

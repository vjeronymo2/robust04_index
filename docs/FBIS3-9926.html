			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Ramiro De Leon Carpio by </F> unidentified reporter at the farewell ceremony for General Jose  Luis Quilo Ayuso, former chief of the general staff of national  defense, at the former Polytechnic School in Guatemala City on  25 February; broadcast in progress -- live or recorded]    [Text] [De Leon]...bureaucrats for a 40-percent increase  when 8 million Guatemalans have no job, nothing to eat, no  health care, and no education. That is why I listen to the  Guatemalan people. With the law in our hands, we are going to  continue working.    [Reporter] You said on one occasion that you were being  pressured into resigning?    [De Leon] No, no, no, I have never been pressured. I  sometimes have high blood pressure because of all the obstacles  I must face. There is no pressure. I cannot resign. How could  I resign a popular mandate? How would I stand? I have a huge  challenge ahead. I do not think it would be wrong for me to say  that I have been the Guatemalan president who came to the  presidency under the worst conditions in the country's history,  facing huge challenges, an economic crisis, and a political  crisis that we are now overcoming. We have also faced a social  crisis. I boarded a ship sailing rough waters in the middle of  a hurricane. We are now sailing away from the hurricane, and I  have to turn it over to my successor in peaceful waters or at a  safe port.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [De Leon] We are doing well at the international level. They  are aware of our efforts. They are aware of the political  commitment of the president and my administration. In that  regard, it is logical for this to happen. If the human rights  situation deteriorated, it would be logical for them to think  that way. We are going to wait for the Geneva resolution.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [De Leon] I prefer not to comment. Draw your own  conclusions.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] as for human rights violations  reported in Mexico [words indistinct].    [De Leon] Many things are said abroad. I would like them to  say those things here in Guatemala. Here is where we have to  rebuild Guatemala. Here is where we have to build peace. It is  not going to be done outside Guatemala. Those who are here,  those of us who have suffered the consequences of the armed  confrontation that has lasted over 30 years, we are the ones who  must truly assume that responsibility, and we have assumed it.  To be saying in Mexico that we are violating human  rights....[pauses] We must ask these people if they know where  Santiago Atitlan is. We must ask them how many years it has  been since they were here. I do not know, they may have been  here before but under different circumstances. Thank you.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [De Leon] We have already begun paying state workers  according to the schedule. Of course we are not going to pay  those who were involved in the (?strike), and there is proof of  that.</p>

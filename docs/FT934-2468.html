			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: Not a matter for national discretion - European Court The European Medicines Directive leaves no discretion to member countries when deciding whether to suspend or withdraw a particular product, the European Court of Justice ruled last week. The decision was made on a preliminary reference from the Italian State Council. The Italian health minister had declared authorisations for certain medicinal products invalid under an Italian law, which allowed him to do so when products authorised for sale were not put on the market within 18 months. Under European law, medicinal products are subject to a number of directives aimed at progressively establishing free movement of such goods throughout the European Community, while ensuring public health is protected. The directives lay down rules on public health grounds for the suspension or withdrawal of authorisations for such products. It is also clearly stated that such rules are exhaustive. The Court therefore had little difficulty in deciding that there was no discretion which could be exercised by the national authorities in this area. The Court was also asked to rule whether a national law which allowed authorisations to be declared invalid rather than suspended or withdrawn was also contrary to European law. The Italian government argued that declarations of invalidity were different from measures of withdrawal or suspension and thus member states were not limited in their use of the former by the terms of a directive which only dealt with the latter. The Court agreed that declarations of invalidity were different from measures of withdrawal but held that their effect was the same - to annul an existing authorisation. The Court also said that the present framework established by the relevant directives would be affected if member states were allowed to use ways of annulling authorisations other than those set out in the directives.

Initiation of dumping review requires sufficient evidence The European Commission must have sufficient evidence of the dumping of goods and the injury caused before initiating a review of anti-dumping measures, the European Court ruled last week. The case related to the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties on a Brazilian exporter at the conclusion of a review. The problem arose because in the original proceedings four years earlier, the Brazilian exporter had been cleared of dumping. The evidence which the Commission took into account when deciding to initiate the review did not include evidence of dumping by that exporter. The Commission argued that it was not necessary to adduce sufficient evidence of dumping and injury before initiating review proceedings as the original proceedings, for which such evidence was necessary, had not been closed. All that was necessary was evidence of changed circumstances to justify a review. The Court said procedural rules for reviews made it clear that sufficient evidence had to be adduced before initiating such proceedings. It then said, however, it was not necessary for the evidence to relate to dumping on the part of each of the undertakings concerned as anti-dumping proceedings relate in principle to all imports of a certain category of products from a third country, not to imports of products manufactured by specific companies. The Court said the Commission had relied on two pieces of evidence. First, evidence provided by exporters who had been subject to anti-dumping duties that their exports were no longer being dumped and that the Community industry therefore no longer suffered material injury. Second, evidence that there was overcapacity in the product market which had brought about a substantial fall in prices in the Community. The Court ruled that neither piece of evidence amounted to sufficient evidence of dumping to justify a review. C-216/91: Rima Electrometalurgia SA v Council and Commission, ECJ 5CH, December 7.

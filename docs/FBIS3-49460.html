[Dienstbierova] The DEMA joint-stock company has prepared a  series of questions concerning President Clinton's visit,  targeted at 300 respondents from all Prague districts.    Some 63 percent of Prague citizens are looking forward to  this visit, and 60 percent view it as an appreciation of current  developments in our country. Approximately 50 percent of the  respondents consider the visit by the U.S. President to be an  expression of appreciation for President Vaclav Havel.  Approximately the same percentage of the respondents consider  this event to be an important step that should lead to the  strengthening of trade and economic relations between the Czech  Republic and the United States. It is interesting to note that  approximately half of the respondents were unable to answer the  questions.    The DEMA company was also interested in President Clinton's  popularity among Prague citizens. According to the survey, the  pattern of his popularity is relatively the same in all age  groups. However, women are looking forward to his visit to a  greater extent than men, by 67 percent to 59 percent.</p>

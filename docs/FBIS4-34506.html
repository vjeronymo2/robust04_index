			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for  21 August.    Tens of thousands of National Autonomous University of  Mexico  students and faculty members cheered Party of the Democratic  Revolution [PRD] presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas  during a 6 June campus rally. Cardenas warned students that  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has "set up the mechanisms  to commit electoral fraud" and called for a "deluge of  democratic votes" to overcome the stumbling blocks, traps, and  fraud. Cardenas said the three essential conditions for  transition toward democracy are: 1) support for an active and  involved civilian society; 2) following Cardenas' victory, the  beginning of a transition toward democracy; and 3) a complete  revision of constitutional bases and an open debate on a new  constitution. (Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish  7 Jun 94 p 1A)    According to a survey published today in VOZ Y VOTO  magazine,  the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] has lost 13 percent  of its voter support in three years and now registers only 48  percent voter support. The PRI received 61.47 percent of the  votes in the 1991 Federal District election. The poll was  conducted between 13 and 17 May following the public debate  between presidential candidates Zedillo, Fernandez de Cevallos,  and Cardenas. Results show the PRI would get 48 percent of the  votes; the National Action Party [PAN], 26 percent; the PRD, 9  percent; the Labor Party [PT], 1.48 percent; the Mexican Green  Ecologist Party [PVEM], 0.84 percent; the Popular Socialist  Party [PPS], 0.71 percent; the Cardenist Front for National  Reconstruction Party [PFCRN], 0.32 percent; and the Authentic  Party of the Mexican Revolution [PARM] and the National  Opposition Union [UNO], 0.26 percent each. Only 2 percent of  those polled indicated they would not vote, and 11 percent  declined to respond. Polled on personal versus party appeal,  the results varied slightly: PRI presidential candidate Ernesto  Zedillo would get 49 percent of the votes; PAN candidate Diego  Fernandez de Cevallos, 26 percent; PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc  Cardenas, 11 percent; PFCRN candidate Rafael Aguilar Talamantes  and PT candidate Cecilia Soto, 2 percent each; and UNO candidate  Pablo Emilio Madero, 1 percent. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1816 GMT  9 Jun 94)    PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo visited a Mexico City railroad  station and received an enthusiastic welcome from workers, whom  he promised he would give an unprecedented boost to rail  transportation and improve living conditions for railroad  workers. Zedillo said the only acceptable government is that  which is based on valid elections, adding that he was sure "the  people would disregard any call to attack institutional rule and  the social tranquillity and unity of Mexicans." Zedillo later  met with small and medium business representatives, who listened  with interest to the PRI economic platform. (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94)    Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, PAN presidential candidate,  said  that although the failure to reach a peace agreement in Chiapas  is disturbing, it is important that the cease-fire be maintained  and that the two parties remain willing to continue talks.  (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun  94)    Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, PRD presidential candidate,  said in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua State, that the failure of the  government and of the armed groups in Chiapas to reach a peace  agreement should not affect the 21 August elections, nor should  it create an atmosphere of instability in the country. Cardenas  later met with businessmen in Ciudad Juarez and told them it was  necessary to broaden the jurisdiction of state and national  human rights groups by extending "their purview to political and  labor rights to give greater protection to the rights of all  citizens according to the Constitution and the laws." (Mexico  City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94)    PARM presidential candidate Alvaro Perez Trevino said  during the second day of a campaign tour through Zacatecas that  a 70-percent voter turnout would be a genuine representation of  Mexican citizens in the presidential elections. Trevino was to  meet with the university's law school students, but the meeting  was canceled due to poor attendance. (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94)    Referring to the Zapatist National Liberation Army's (EZLN)  rejection of the Chiapas peace proposal in Veracruz, PT  presidential candidate Cecilia Soto said that "a more precarious  peace now exists." She proposed the creation of a secretariat  for women to protect women in the labor and legal fields. Soto  met with PT party leaders and supporters in Veracruz. (Mexico  City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94)    Jorge Gonzalez Torres, PVEM presidential candidate, arrived  in Oaxaca on 13 June to begin a 10-day tour of Indian  communities in the Mizteca and coastal areas and on the Isthmus  of Tehuantepec. Speaking of his commitment to the  underprivileged classes in Mexico, Gonzales Torres said the  issue is not just "drug trafficking but also includes poverty  and the abandonment of peasants and the poor." (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94)    Asked about the recent events in Chiapas, PAN presidential  candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos said the least the  presidential candidates can do is show prudence and not assume  opportunistic positions. He said he was not surprised by the  EZLN's rejection of the proposal because it was obvious when the  document was released that it would be rejected by the guerrilla  group. The government's reply to the EZLN was not clear,  Fernandez de Cevallos said. He recalled that Subcommander  Marcos recently said that EZLN members felt deceived, "but  fortunately they said they will not renew the violence."  Fernandez de Cevallos said the EZLN insists on further  negotiations and wants a new, prudent, and honest effort. He  added that the candidates must assume "very delicate" positions.  Fernandez de Cevallos said candidates could and should express  their opinions on the issue, but warned that any proposal urging  the EZLN or the government to take specific action could easily  be viewed as opportunistic. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish  14 Jun 94 p 5)    Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, National Democratic Alliance (ADN)  presidential candidate, told those who favor the postponement or  cancellation of the elections that he will demand that the  elections be held on 21 August as scheduled. During a visit to  the Autonomous University of Ciudad Juarez (UACJ), Cardenas also  asked the government and the EZLN to renew negotiations and  establish conditions for a lasting peace as soon as possible.    Cardenas added that the ADN would work within the law and  also demand that the law be respected and that the votes be  counted fairly. During a morning news conference, he said he  did not believe the EZLN announcement rejecting the government  offer would affect the upcoming elections. He said the  government must seek solutions to local, state, and national  issues raised by the EZLN, such as how the government can  guarantee clean elections and improve health and education.  Cardenas said PRI candidate Zedillo's question to Peace  Commissioner Manuel Luis Camacho -- Why has the peace effort  failed? -- was directed at the wrong person. "The question  should be asked of President Salinas de Gortari," Cardenas said,  adding that the recent car bombing incident in Guadalajara "is  evidence of the social disintegration caused by the current  government."

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Observer: Hood-lum A colleague on holiday in France reports the loss of a prized possession. Or should that read 'prised'? An unknown trophy hunter has walked off with the emblem from his car's bonnet. No Rolls-Royce Flying Lady this, nor even a rare Wartburg, but the rather more humble Vauxhall 'griffin' badge. The various Mercs, BMWs and Saabs in the same car park had not been touched, so maybe Vauxhall badges have now become collector's items, rather as VW emblems were a few years ago. Perhaps there is a certain cachet on the Continent in having an English badge in your collection. If so, there is a certain irony: the replacement 'griffin' was made in Germany.</p>

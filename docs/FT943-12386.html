			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / House poised to probe Whitewater The US Congress today is to have its first formal crack at the Whitewater affair, with Mr Lloyd Cutler, the White House legal counsel, leading a parade of administration officials testifying to the House of Representatives banking committee. The remit of the congressional hearings - the counterpart committe in the Senate is due to begin its work later this week - is limited but could embarrass the administration and might further damage some prominent careers. The sessions will be televised. By agreement with Mr Robert Fiske, the special counsel on Whitewater, the committees are to confine themselves to the 'Washington end' of the complex tale of land and financial dealings of President Bill Clinton and his wife in Arkansas in the late-1970s and the 1980s. In a preliminary report last month, Mr Fiske cleared White House and Treasury officials of any criminal wrongdoing. But witnesses will be questioned on their knowledge of contacts between the Clinton White House and regulatory agencies with responsibility for investigating the Whitewater affair. In a weekend TV interview, Mr Cutler said there had been 'some regrettable errors of judgment' by some officials and that contacts should have been limited to White House and Treasury legal counsels. But, he said, his own internal review had found 'no violation of any ethical legal standard.' Most under the gun appears to be Mr Roger Altman, deputy Treasury secretary and former acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency set up to clear up the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. Madison Guaranty, a now defunct Arkansas savings and loan body, is at the heart of the Whitewater affair. Mr Altman is suspected of concealing to Congress, in testimony last February, his full knowledge of contacts with the White House about criminal investigations of Madison. Yesterday, the New York Times reported that the diaries of Mr Joshua Steiner, chief of staff to Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, had included notes that Mr Clinton himself was irate when Mr Altman decided to excuse himself from the Madison probe in February. Mr Clinton has denied any such intervention. Mr Bentsen also faces questions about his knowledge of inter-agency contacts. Ms Jean Hanson, Treasury legal counsel, is reported to have told Senate investigators that she had attended a meeting on February, with Mr Bentsen and Mr Altman, about Madison, which preceded a briefing by Ms Hanson and Mr Altman of White House officials. The Treasury secretary issued a statement on March 3 to say he was never informed of any such meetings. Over the weekend, Mr Altman's lawyer said his client had 'no recollection' of the meeting described by Ms Hanson. The conduct of the House committee hearings will depend in good measure on the chairmanship of Mr Henry Gonzalez, a venerable Democrat from Texas. He was long opposed to any such hearings and has been portrayed by Republicans as a staunch defender of the president. But his record for rooting out presumed malfeasance is long and impressive. His investigations of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and of the Keating five - payments by a former savings and loan official to senators - head the list.</p>

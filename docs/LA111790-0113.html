Daub told jurors in U.S. District Court  in Los Angeles that the narcotics officer won the money at the blackjack tables  in 1988 as Daub's attorney sought to explain how Daub accumulated tens of  thousands of dollars beyond his sheriff's salary.  </P> <P> Government prosecutors contend that Daub purchased a boat, automobiles and a  vacation home during 1988 and 1989 with some of the $1.4 million allegedly  stolen by narcotics deputies during drug raids.  </P> <P> Daub's brother and mother, however, testified that Daub not only won money  gambling but also received a sizable cash inheritance from his late father. The  relatives also said they contributed money toward the purchase of the vacation  home in Arizona.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Florida's Largest S&amp;L Seized: Federal regulators seized Florida's largest  thrift, CenTrust Bank, blaming its failure on junk bond investing and on lavish  spending on art, a company yacht and high salaries. The Treasury's Office of  Thrift Supervision declared that the Miami-based S&amp;L was operating in an  unsafe and unsound condition and turned it over to the Resolution Trust Corp.  for sale or liquidation. Centrust, with $8.2 billion in assets, is the nation's  23rd-largest thrift.  </P></p>

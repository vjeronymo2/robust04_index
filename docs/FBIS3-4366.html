Explaining how her family spent Lunar  New Year, Deng said: "During his stay in Shanghai, my father  played bridge with his colleagues." In the interview, she also  revealed that she has devoted herself to writing after resigning  from a research office.    She is in Japan to attend a commemoration of the publication  of the Japanese edition of her book My Father, Deng  Xiaoping which has been published in China and Hong Kong.    Touching on her father's health, she said: "My father quit  smoking New Year's Day 1989 at the urging of doctors. He drinks  two small glasses of Shawxing liquor at meals and takes  medicine. Although I do not know what kind of medicine he takes  unless I ask the doctors about it, I assume the medicine is a  vitamin."    In the interview, the Chinese leader's daughter added: "My  father stayed in Shanghai from mid-December last year to  February this year during this Lunar New Year. He enjoyed his  stay in the city, dining with his grandchildren. He played  bridge three times with his colleagues. He appeared to have won  only one game."    She raised the subject of dancing while speaking of the  Lunar  New Year, saying: "I am very good at dancing. Will you dance  with me?"    Asked to comment on reports that she works as "secretary to  her father," she said with a sweet smile: "The reports are  incorrect."    In the interview, she stated: "My father's hearing is very  poor, and it is my duty to translate what he speaks in the  Sichuan dialect into Mandarin. Another duty is to record my  father's remarks." During the interview, she also said: "I am  my father's hearing aid." She went on to say that she hands  over records to her father's secretaries, and therefore she is  the "secretary to my father's secretaries."</p>

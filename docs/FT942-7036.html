			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / BBC TV in Hong Kong deal BBC World Service Television will return next month to Hong Kong on a limited basis. The BBC last month lost its ability to reach the region after the corporation agreed to take its channel off the Star Television satellite system, now controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Wharf Cable, Hong Kong's cable network, will carry four hours a day of BBC World Service Television news and information programming, with six hours daily at the weekend. Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director-general and chairman of BBC Worldwide, which oversees the corporation's international activity, said yesterday in Hong Kong that the deal was only a beginning: 'This is the first step towards our goal of resuming 24-hour transmission of BBC World Service Television to the peoples of the Far East.' He said the BBC knew many Star viewers had been disappointed when the BBC agreed to go off the northern beam of the Star satellite system before the end of its contract in a deal to extend its time on the southern beam, which covers the Indian subcontinent.</p>

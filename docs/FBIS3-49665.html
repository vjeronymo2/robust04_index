			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prior to the Prague summit, Geza Jeszenszky held the  regular weekly foreign affairs' spokesman press briefing. Then  the foreign minister answered the question of Jozsef Barath:    [begin recording] [Barath] Mr. Minister, at your press  briefing you welcomed the results of the NATO summit. Did  anything happen there which could not have been expected or  taken for granted in advance?    [Jeszenszky] There were worries and hopes in connection with  the summit. In my view, the latest developments, the Brussels  NATO summit, and the statement and document adopted there made  the hopes come true. It is certain that more could have been  envisaged and there were many who expected more. However,  realistically, nobody expected that Hungary or a few other  countries would be admitted to NATO in January. For that one  has to be prepared; among other things, an appropriately trained  army is necessary both professionally and in language,  competible weaponry is needed, etc., thus this is a process.    I think that in the present international situation, NATO  gave an appropriate answer. It tried to give an encouraging  answer to the peoples of Central Europe for their worries, it  offers a prospect for them regarding their membership and at the  same time, it is trying to tackle a bigger question, namely, how  to avoid new conflict between the superpowers, how to avoid  Russia becoming a new danger for Europe or for us.    So it is quite clear to me that the Partnership for Peace  program tries to influence the world developments to follow a  favorable direction. Thus, in the case of Russia, it tries to  support democracy by this means, and to ensure that Russia  should not consider NATO an enemy, or should not consider NATO's  expansion as a provocation, but to make Russia see that a road  is open for cooperation here.

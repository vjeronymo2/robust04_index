			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Emerging Markets: Possible renewed pressure on D-Mark - Currencies After weakening early last week on a larger-than-expected drop in the German repo rate, the D-Mark won a reprieve late in the week on Bundesbank signals that it will not accelerate the pace of monetary easing, writes Conner Middelmann. However, this week's German inflation and money- supply data could exert renewed pressure on the D-Mark by fuelling more talk of near-term rate cuts. 'As the Bundesbank continues easing short-term rates, we expect the US dollar and most European currencies to firm against the D-Mark,' said Mr Thorsten Neufeld, economist at DB Research, Deutsche Bank's research subsidiary in Frankfurt. Germany's two-week repo rate fell by nine basis points to 6.29 per cent last Tuesday, prompting talk that the Bundesbank was shifting into a more aggressive easing gear to revive the flagging economy. Two days later the Bundesbank announced a fixed-rate repo at 6.25 per cent, indicating that while it continues to loosen its monetary reins, it will only do so very gradually. However, October M3 money supply - expected to come in around the top of the Bundesbank's 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent target range - and November inflation, expected to have slowed to about 3.7 per cent year-on-year from 3.9 per cent in October, may revive easing speculation. Amid the accelerating recovery in the US economy and OECD calls for increases in the rate there, this means the D-Mark is set to weaken further against the US dollar. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, expects the dollar to reach DM1.75 by year-end and to climb to around DM1.85 on a six-month view. The D-Mark also looks set to weaken against some of the core currencies in Europe's exchange rate mechanism. 'Some of these currencies - notably the French and Belgian francs and the Danish krone - are headed back towards their old ERM trading bands' against the D-Mark, said Mr Neufeld. Despite last week's aggressive rate cuts, the Belgian franc briefly breached the BFr21.0950 floor of its former 2 1/4 per cent trading band against the D-Mark. France is one of the few European countries not to have cut short-term rates last week and is expected to continue tracking the Bundesbank's cautious easing course, although many are calling for a cut in its 6.45 per cent intervention rate on the back of the currency's strength. The franc closed at FFr3.4690 on Friday.</p>

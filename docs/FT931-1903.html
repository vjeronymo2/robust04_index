			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Hopes dim for Bosnia peace accord PROSPECTS for peace in Bosnia receded further yesterday. 'The feeling is that time is running out on these (New York peace) talks,' said Mr Fred Eckhard, the conference spokesman, in an unusually pessimistic statement. 'There is a question as to how many more days they can keep a negotiating process going that seems to be getting nowhere.' At the same time, the United Nations Security Council put off adoption of a resolution enforcing a ban on flights over Bosnia, if necessary by shooting down offending aircraft. The council had been due to vote last night but agreed to a delay at the request of the Russians. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has intimated that he might break off the peace talks if the ban is enforced. An enforcement vote by the Security Council would be the first time that the UN has authorised military intervention against one of the parties in the Bosnian conflict, namely the Bosnian Serbs. The Council was due to act after bombing raids last week by aircraft believed to be Serbian on mainly Moslem villages in Bosnia. But the resolution will not go into effect until the Council, the enforcing countries and the UN peacekeeping forces agree on a date. A grace period of two to three weeks may be given to the Serbs before the resolution is implemented. The Bosnian Serbs have largely respected the original ban, adopted last November, at least as far as fixed wing combat aircraft are concerned. However, they have continued to fly helicopters to transport personnel, the wounded and war supplies. Last week's bombing is reported to have been carried out by crop-sprayers. In Sarajevo, UN officers said that General Philippe Morillon, the UN military commander who last Friday led the first relief convoy into the besieged town of Srebrenica since the Bosnian civil war began last April, had struck a deal to evacuate Serbs from the Moslem-dominated town of Tuzla. Mr Karadzic was quoted as having ordered his forces to open an air corridor for UN helicopters.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Daimler discloses DM4bn of reserves DAIMLER-Benz, Germany's larg-est industrial company, yesterday disclosed 'hidden reserves' of about DM4bn (Pounds 1.66bn) while announcing its plan to obtain a share listing on the New York stock exchange. Daimler will become the first German company to obtain a listing on the exchange and is likely to lead the way for others as they attempt to strengthen their ability to raise capital. The company said yesterday that it had reached a compromise with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulatory body for securities markets, which would allow it to list its shares on Wall Street this year. The compromise would include the German company giving increased financial details to meet US investors' expectations, Daimler said. The refusal of the SEC and German groups to compromise on disclosure rules has for long been an obstacle to the companies gaining access to the world's biggest capital market. Daimler said that it would change its accounting for the 1992 financial year. This would disclose extraordinary profits of about DM4bn, more than twice the expected net profits of between DM1.4bn and DM1.5bn. The profit in 1991 was DM1.9bn. A Daimler-Benz listing would boost the New York Stock Exchange, which faces increasing competition for business from electronic, regional and international exchanges, notably London. The NYSE exchange has been trying to promote itself as the leading international stock market, but the SEC's strict disclosure rules have discouraged some large foreign companies from listing in the US. Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the SEC, said yesterday that there had been give on both sides and he thought the result would be a ' win-win' for the two parties. Mr William Donaldson, chairman of the NYSE, who has long campaigned for a relaxation of SEC rules on foreign companies, said Daimler's announcement stemmed from a 'breakthrough compromise that we have sought for a long time.' Daimler is undergoing a restructuring at Mercedes-Benz, its core car subsidiary. It planned to hold a DM2bn rights issue last autumn but this was postponed because of poor conditions on the German stock market.</p>

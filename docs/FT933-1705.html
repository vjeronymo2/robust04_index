			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Concerns start to surface over Brazil's equity rally - But foreigners stay buyers The Sao Paulo stock market may not be the best barometer for measuring the Brazilian economy given that equities have been accelerating even as inflation climbs by more than 30 per cent a month. Last Friday the Bovespa index put on a further 7 per cent in dollar terms following an announcement by the government that it intended to deregulate exchange rate policy. This would mean that the three exchange rates currently in operation - the commercial, tourist and parallel rates - would be reduced to just a single US dollar exchange rate. Having lost 2 per cent in dollar terms on Monday as investors took profits, the Bovespa index ended a further 331 points off at 13,474 yesterday. Nevertheless, there are clear reasons to explain why the market's performance in dollar terms this year - a rise of more than 100 per cent - is second only to Turkey among the 18 countries listed in the IFC's investable price indices. For all its economic and political uncertainty, Brazil remains Latin America's most important economy. 'Brazil is not a small country; no matter who the president is, foreign investors have got to be there,' says Mr George Rexing, director of foreign banking services for Banco de Boston, the First National Bank of Boston's subsidiary. Long term foreign investors are adding exposure to Brazilian equities as part of a global emerging markets strategy, he believes. New portfolio investment totalled Dollars 1.4bn during the first six months of this year, compared with Dollars 1.7bn for all of 1992. Foreign capital market investment was hampered during the second half of 1992 due to the corruption scandal leading to the impeachment of President Fernando Collor de Mello. Overall flow into capital markets might be slowed by a government decision in August to restrict foreign access to fixed rate instruments; but the move may help equities as foreigners shift funds into shares. Local bonds had become increasingly popular as real interest rates pushed annualised yields (in dollar terms) up to 16 to 17 per cent. As a result Salomon Brothers identified important shifts in volume in many 'second tier' stocks immediately after the change was announced. Leading the market's gains have been state-owned electrical utilities, propelled by real increases in tariffs and signals from the government that privatisation of the sector is likely. Shares in companies sold off by the government, especially in the steel sector, have fared well under private ownership. Usiminas, the steel group which was sold in October 1991, has, since then, climbed more than 150 per cent in dollar terms. Telebras, the state-owned holding company for the telecommunications sector, remains the market leader, often responsible for more than half the market's daily volume, while representing 60 per cent of the market index. The shares appeared immune to recent difficulties, including the resignation of the company's finance director, subsequent newspaper reports of alleged corruption, and the resulting indefinite delay in planned international capital market deals. One reason for its continued strong performance is, according to a recent Salomon Brothers report, hopes that the recent difficulties may boost the likelihood of privatisation. The report goes on to say: 'The current situation at Telebras also bodes well for the major operating subsidiaries of the company, particularly Telesp (which operates in Sao Paulo state) and Embratel (the long-distance operator) which have longed to escape from the control of the holding company.' These factors have combined to push daily turnover on the Bovespa index to unprecedented levels, consistently in excess of Dollars 200m a day this month, against levels averaging Dollars 100m a day a year ago. Most observers believe that Brazilian shares remain a bargain, but some warn that the lustre may be coming off as the Bovespa index continues to climb, outdistancing other markets in the region. Although share bargains in good companies continue to be an attraction, a recent report by First Boston concludes: 'In Brazil's stock markets, politics have become far more important than fundamental company analysis.'</p>

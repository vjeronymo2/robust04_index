			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DID REFEREE STEELE HAVE THE RIGHT STUFF?  </P> <P> Replaying the Chavez-Taylor fight on tape, I saw the intense single-minded  concentration of an example of how good a referee can be.  </P> <P> The questioning of Taylor immediately after the count was over and the  incredible compassion on Steele's face as he wrapped his arms around Taylor  gave me insight into the best referee I have ever seen. What showed on Steele's  face was care, love and sorrow that he had to stop the fight, but he had to  stop it.  </P> <P> I wish the rest of the governing parts of the sport acted with the integrity of  Richard Steele.  </P> <P> JIM BRIT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

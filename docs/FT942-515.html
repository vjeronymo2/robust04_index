			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Jack's jolly green giants squeak home - Patrick Harverson in New York watches the curtain come down on the Group of Death Ireland advanced into the second round of the World Cup yesterday after earning a scoreless draw against Norway in an engrossing match at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. The Irish fully deserved to progress, their passion and sense of purpose more than making up for lack of goals. With a win and a draw, and four points, Ireland finished second in Group E behind Mexico, who secured the top spot after drawing with Italy 1-1 in Washington. Now, the Irish move back to Orlando, where they will play the winner of Group F - probably Belgium - next Monday. An exultant cigar-chomping Jack Charlton, Ireland's manager, asked if his team looked forward to returning to Florida's heat and humidity, said Belgium or the Netherlands 'are having as many problems with the heat as we are.' Norway, meanwhile, headed for home, unlucky to go out of the World Cup after winning four points from three games. Against a confident Ireland, however, they finished a clear second-best. As for the Ireland-Italy game on June 17, the stadium was a cauldron of noise draped in the tricolour of green, white and orange. The 76,000 crowd was overwhelmingly Irish, with only the occasional red shirt and Viking helmet, and the rare chime of clanking cow bells, to suggest that Norway had brought some supporters along, too. The weather remained Ireland's worst enemy as the game kicked off, but at 'only' 80'F it must have felt to the Irish players like a cool day in Killarney, compared to the energy-sapping sauna of Orlando, where Ireland played Mexico last week. Ireland started with determination, skill and patience. Norway responded to early Irish thrusts by bringing all but striker Sorloth back into their own half. The Irish midfield of Keane, Townsend and Sheridan played short, deliberate passes in front of the Norwegian back four, but rarely found an opening. Aldridge, the Tranmere centre-forward who played alone up front, struggled throughout against the towering Norwegian centre-half Bratseth. Yet Ireland so thoroughly dominated the first half that the Norwegians did not get a shot at goal. The Irish centre-halves, Babb and McGrath - he of the countless knee operations - patrolled the centre of defence with now-familiar poise and muscular aplomb. After half-time, Norway emerged with more purpose, and an extra player in attack. Bonner, the Irish goalkeeper, was forced to make his first save of the game after 49 minutes from Leonhardsen's well-directed but under-powered drive. Ireland responded with several sweeping attacks on the flanks, one of which led to a header from Aldridge which spun wide of the Norwegian post. After 57 minutes, Aldridge was replaced with the pacier David Kelly, who immediately enlivened things with a speedy chase down the left wing. Soon after, Charlton moved to bolster his side further by adding the Liverpool veteran Whelan, who came on for the ailing Townsend. Whelan's first touch nearly proved fatal, his mis-cue in front of the Irish goal allowing Sorloth an opportunity which he booted over the bar from a couple of yards. In spite of his shaky start, Whelan's arrival breathed fresh life into tired Irish lungs. The team's best move of the game came with just 10 minutes to go: a cross from McAteer - who tormented the Norwegian full-backs all afternoon - was nodded back by David Kelly but Keane, racing in from mid-field, blasted the ball high over Thorstvedt in the Norwegian goal. A minute later, another swift Irish break from defence ended in Sheridan lofting a delicate chip over the bar. As news of Mexico's equaliser came in, Irish reporters in the press box began feverishly working out the implications of both games ending in a draw. The news was good - Ireland would finish second - but it also meant that any score in the last few minutes in New York would put the other team out of the World Cup. The Group of Death was living up to its name. With barely a minute to go, Norway earned a free kick wide on the right, but their skyscraper forwards failed to capitalise on the cross. Ireland responded with vigour, forcing several half-chances in the dying moments. When the referee ended the game, the sound of the throaty Gaelic roar that greeted the final whistle made it clear that Big Jack's green-and-white army were heading into the second round.</p>

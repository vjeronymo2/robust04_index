Kumgang. North Korea is  currently reviewing the project in detail to attract foreign  capital, according to a well-informed source in Tokyo.    The source said: "North Korea has already started  consultations with the U.S. State Department on receiving  capital, technology, and experience necessary for the  introduction of the market economic system into the economic  zones by joining the Asian Development Bank and the  International Monetary Fund."    The source also disclosed that North Korea's former Vice  Premier Kim Tal-hyon (currently a manager of the Sunchon Vinalon  plant), who was previously removed from North Korea's power  circle, is in charge of the project and is secretly serving as a  dialogue channel with the United States.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl has blamed  Spain and Great Britain for the preliminary failure of Norway's  negotiations for membership in the European Union [EU]. It is  "completely inexplicable" for the Federal Government and him  personally that, in view of the outstanding political importance  of this question for Europe, member countries have not endorsed  the consensus, the chancellor stated in Bonn on Wednesday [9  March].    In the question of fishery, a package that had exactly taken  Madrid's interests into account was presented. "I hope that  Spain will endorse this balanced proposal." In the controversy  over the blocking minority, the EU presidency presented a  "reasonable proposal." He hopes that Great Britain will still  agree to it. According to Kohl, the Federal Government sticks to  the objective of admiting all four countries -- Austria, Sweden,  Finland, and Norway -- to the European Union in January 1995.  He appealed to the still hesitant member countries to clear the  road for the conclusion of the negotiations for membership now.</p>

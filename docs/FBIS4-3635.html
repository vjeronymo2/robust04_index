			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Jiang Zemin Orders Heavy Sentence for Xi Yang, </F> Rejects Lenient Treatment Proposed by the Ministry of State  Security"]    [Text] It is reportedly said that Jiang Zemin, state  president of China, rejected three proposals from the Ministry  of State Security on what sentence should be given to MING PAO  reporter Xi Yang, and held that only by giving a heavy sentence  of 12 years' imprisonment could Hong Kong and overseas reporters  be effectively controlled while gathering news on the mainland.  According to a report in EASTERN EXPRESS today, the three  proposals on sentencing Xi made by the Ministry of State  Security included: 1) giving a strong warning to Xi Yang and  sending him back to Hong Kong; 2) taking KUAI PAO [EXPRESS]  reporter Leung Wai-man's case as a precedent and banning Xi Yang  from entering the mainland for three years; and 3) handing the  case over to the Ministry of Justice for trial with the  instruction that Xi should be "heavily sentenced" to two years  in prison with eligibility for parole.    The Ministry of State Security's proposals were sent to  Jiang  Zemin for consideration, and Jiang is in charge of state  security and the administration of justice in the Political  Bureau. At the same time, it was disclosed to MING PAO through  XINHUA Hong Kong Branch and the State Council's Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office that so long as MING PAO handled the case  with a low profile and admitted their guilt, Xi Yang would be  treated leniently. Yu Pun-hai, chairman of the MING PAO Group,  once sought help from Bo Yibo and was told about the three  proposals made by the Ministry of State Security. It is  reportedly said that State Security Minister Jia Chunwang told  Xu Simin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, in November last  year that the Ministry of State Security would give lenient  treatment to Xi Yang according to the laws of China.    However, Xi Yang's case took an abrupt turn in March this  year. After the National People's Congress, Jiang Zemin handled  the case personally, rejected the three proposals from the  Ministry of State Security, and held that the punishment was not  heavy enough.    In particular, Leung Wai-man of KUAI PAO, who published a  leaked advance copy of the full text of a speech by Jiang Zemin  in 1992, was only sent back to Hong Kong immediately and banned  from entering the mainland for two years. The punishment was  too light; therefore, it was decided to punish Xi Yang heavily  to serve as a warning.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: International Paper hit by higher taxes INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US forest products group, yesterday posted third-quarter net income of Dollars 48m, or 39 cents a share, including charges of Dollars 28m, or 23 cents, reflecting a higher federal income tax rate. Sales slid to Dollars 3.4bn from Dollars 3.5bn. Stripping out the tax adjustment, net income was Dollars 76m, or 62 cents, in the quarter. In the same period of 1992, International Paper earned Dollars 98m, or 81 cents. Mr John Georges, chairman and chief executive, said that depressed pricing levels for paper and packaging products in the US and abroad had dampened the cyclical rebound that the company had been expecting. Earnings before interest and taxes fell 6.5 per cent from the previous year reflecting higher interest costs in 1993. For the first nine months, International Paper had net earnings of Dollars 189m, or Dollars 1.53 per share, on sales of Dollars 10.3bn against income of Dollars 282m, or Dollars 2.17 on sales of Dollars 10.2bn last year. The 1992 figures include charges of 41 cents a share for accounting changes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 15 June -- The Armed Forces have been a part  of the state defense policy, but they should preserve their  apolitical nature, Jerzy Milewski, secretary of state in the  Ministry of National Defense said today, while summing up the  proceedings of an international seminar, "Civilian and  Democratic Control of the Armed Forces," organized in Warsaw at  Poland's initiative and with cooperation from NATO Headquarters.    The seminar was attended by representatives of 38 states of  the former Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Alliance.    Milewski emphasized that the most important decisions on  defense policy should be made by the authorities coming from  "free and general elections." Civilian control over the Army  should not be identified with restrictions, but public  acceptance is necessary for the principles of the defense  policy, the functioning of the armed forces, and defense  spending.</p>

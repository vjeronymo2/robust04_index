			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Phillips Petroleum to sell share in Japanese venture PHILLIPS Petroleum of the US is to sell its half share in a plastics joint venture in Japan to Toray Industries, the fibres group which has been its local partner in the six-year-old operation. The venture, Phillips Petroleum Toray, operates a 7,500 tonne-a-year plant making polyphenylene sulphide (PPS) resin, an engineering plastic used in the automotive and electronics industries. No value was disclosed on the deal, but the unit has paid-in capital of Y6bn (Dollars 47m) and represents 30 per cent of Phillips' business in Japan, where it also has activities in liquefied natural gas, specialty chemicals and other plastics. Phillips said it was quitting the venture as part of a reorganisation initiated in the US this year. Included in the disposal is Phillips' Japanese operations in PPS compound, where the plastic is combined with fibre glass or other materials. Toray said the move to full control was aimed at improving efficiency by integrating management amid what it described as excessive competition. The two will retain marketing links which according to Toray would establish a global supply system for the plastic, and will continue their mutual supply arrangements and technology exchanges.</p>

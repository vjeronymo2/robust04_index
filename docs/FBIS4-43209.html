			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Professor Mumtaz Soysal: "A Slap for a Slap"] </F>   [Text] Attention should be focused on one of the sentences  in UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's latest report so  that the plan for Cyprus and the effort made to involve Turkey  in it can be better understood. Following his misleading  information and unfounded assessment of the "virtues" of the  confidence-building measures, Butrus-Ghali stressed that several  options can be considered for Cyprus. He said that the island  can be abandoned to deal with its own problem, sanctions can be  adopted, talks on the essence of the problem can be resumed, and  the UN Security Council members can hold talks with the  concerned sides. Butrus-Ghali noted after his so-called options  that: "Considering the fact that the two sides have agreed in  principle to the package of confidence-building measures, the  international effort to reach an agreement can be resumed."  Yes, that is the sentence that should be considered. Looking  at the matter, an outsider may ask: "Since the hope that an  agreement can be reached on the implementation of the package  still exists, then why has the UN secretary general criticized  the Turkish Cypriot side to such an extent in his report,  particularly after Rauf Denktas made two important concessions  at the last moment?" One of those concessions was the  acceptance of the map on Maras [Varosha] and the other was the  acceptance of the lifting of the Turkish Cypriot side's  objection to that area's access road.    The map undermined the agreement on the "fenced area" in  Maras and supported the Greek Cypriot demand on "municipal  boundaries." Consequently, it allowed the Greek Cypriot side to  acquire an additional one and a half square km of valuable land.  However, what is more important than the value of the land the  Greek Cypriot side has acquired was the mistake that was made in  the negotiating process. The Turkish Cypriot side has had to  put up with UN officials' changing approaches.    Butrus-Ghali initially commented on the access road as  follows: "The Turkish Cypriot side must not worry about holding  on to the northern part of Dhimokratias Avenue if it keeps the  access road under its control. You may block the access road to  paralyze Maras if necessary." That meant that the access road  was a trump card. However, it has been given away in the Vienna  talks. That was later confirmed in writing in Nicosia.    The plan was to force the Turkish Cypriot side to make  concessions by convincing it that the UN secretary general's  report would accuse it of maintaining an intransigent approach.  That created a wave of fear on the Turkish Cypriot side. The  approach was successfully applied. However, it seems that there  is more to the matter. That state of affairs will not end as  long as the fear exists on the Turkish Cypriot side.    A number of officials have expressed the view that "the  Turkish Cypriot side was late in responding and the situation  would have been different if Rauf Denktas had agreed earlier."  That is meaningless. The Turkish Cypriot side would have been  accused of maintaining an irreconcilable approach even if it had  agreed to every demand in the hope that the promises that were  reluctantly made to it in Vienna would be kept.    Nothing can be achieved through expecting the UN officials  to  force the Greek Cypriot side to make concessions in return for  those made by the Turkish Cypriot side. It is common knowledge  that talks are resumed from the point at which they are broken  off and that the concessions made remain in effect.    Yes, that scenario has to end. Considering the point which  has been reached in the Cyprus problem, the Turkish and Turkish  Cypriot diplomats will make a very serious mistake if they agree  to resuming the talks on the confidence-building measures.    Considering the "injustice" that has been done, the Turkish  Cypriot side should not attend the talks in which more injustice  will be done. Instead, those who have acted in an unjust way  must be forced to regret what they have done. For example, the  Turkish Cypriot side can inform the world that it will no longer  "wait" for the Greek Cypriot side to agree to a reconciliation  and move to convert several buildings in Maras, which were used  as hotels in the past, into boarding houses for the Eastern  Mediterranean University students.    Unfortunately, the new world order has given into unjust and  tyrannical behavior. Christ said that "anyone who is slapped in  the face should not retaliate but turn the other cheek." The  Western countries have retained that teaching as a legend but  have forced the other countries in the world to comply with it.  Obviously, Turkish and Turkish Cypriot diplomacy will be  exalted not through appreciative remarks by foreign countries  but through reacting to an attack in a similar way.</p>

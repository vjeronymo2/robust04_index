			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Craxi's gold hoard confirmed The Swiss government confirmed yesterday that 15kg of gold it confiscated from a Geneva safe after an Italian request belonged to former Italian prime minister Bettino Craxi, who was sentenced in absentia earlier this year in Italy to 8 1/2 years in prison for corruption. Mr Craxi, who has refused to return from his villa in Tunisia citing health problems, has consistently denied any links with the gold and said it was part of a politically-motivated vendetta. In a written statement issued through his lawyer in Italy, he reiterated those denials. He is the highest-ranked official charged so far in connection with the corruption scandals. A former friend of Craxi's, Mr Giorgio Tradati, a businessman, said last month that he transferred about SFr20m (Pounds 9m) into banks in Switzerland. Mr Tradati claimed that once the corruption inquiry started, Craxi used some of the money to buy the gold upon the advice of an American Express Bank official, to try to cover the trail.</p>

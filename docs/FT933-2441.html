			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities It is too early to conclude that the positive factors which have propelled UK equities are fading, but the market has lost its easy confidence. The proximate cause is economic data suggesting that inflation is, if not resurgent, at least reluctant to lie down and die. One month's figures do not constitute a trend, but gilts tumbled nonetheless. With the equity market already backpedalling after making strong gains last month, the FT-SE 100 index fell below 3,000 for the first time since August 11. While both the equity and bond markets have regained a measure of composure, there are good reasons to be cautious about gilts in particular. The auction announced yesterday is the first hurdle. A maturity of around 10 years is pitched to attract overseas interest, but it remains to be seen whether foreign buyers come forward in any numbers. Gilts no longer offer such an attractive yield premium over French or German government bonds. Neither does sterling offer much prospect of a currency gain. Either way, the run-up to the auction on September 29 will do nothing for frayed nerves. In theory, the yield gap is sufficiently comfortable to allow equities to progress even if gilts are becalmed. In practice, that will require inspiration from company results, which has been lacking so far. With the big food retailers starting to report figures and President Clinton's healthcare reforms due to be announced next week, there is scope for more disappointment in some of the least popular sectors.</p>

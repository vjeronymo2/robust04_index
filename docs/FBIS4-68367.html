			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Kislov (Republic of Mordvinia): </F> "People in Moscow Are Talking About the New Russia, but People  in Mordvinia Are Restoring the Soviet Regime"]    [Text] The Presidium of the Mordvinian Supreme Soviet  has decided to revive Soviet power in its cities and rayons. A  provisional statute on so-called local deputy conventions has  been approved. These conventions, consisting of at least 25  former people's deputies, have been endowed with the same powers  as the local soviets that were abolished by Presidential Edict  No 1617. Now we can expect the Republic of Mordvinia to become  part of the "red belt" around Moscow.    The republic Supreme Soviet, which survived the events of  last October, used its prerogative to frame the republic  constitution to acquire unprecedented power and to strike a blow  at President Yeltsin's edict. Incidentally, this is not the  first time the Mordvinian members of parliament, headed by  Nikolay Biryukov, have thumbed their noses at the federal  government. The readers of IZVESTIYA will recall when the  Supreme Soviet abolished the office of republic president,  rescinding the will of the people, who had elected democrat  Vasiliy Guslyannikov to this office. After some minor  altercations with the obstinate Mordvinian people's deputies,  the Yeltsin administration "gave up" Guslyannikov and thereby  encouraged Biryukov to continue his audacious behavior.    One of the ideologists of neo-Sovietism, Professor Viktor  Veshnyakov, who is now a State Duma deputy representing  Zhirinovskiy's party, declared during a recent visit to  Mordvinia that the representative branch of government in the  republic should be the supreme and sole authority. This idea was  echoed in different keys by Sergey Baburin and Vladimir Isakov,  who also visited Mordvinia at the height of the Soviet's  confrontation with the local and federal presidents. To be fair,  we have to admit that many government officials representing the  president also came to Saransk. There was the recent landing  party, for example, at the time of the turbulent Supreme Soviet  session deciding the future structure of the republic  government. Saransk was then visited by Sergey Filatov, the  president's administration chief, and Yuriy Yarov, deputy  chairman of the government. Understandably, they did not approve  of the Supreme Soviet's claims to supremacy, justifiably citing  the federal constitution. They promised the tormented government  of Valeriy Shvetsov, the fourth of this convocation, that Moscow  officials would take political action in the event of  undesirable developments.    Regrettably, the winter session of the Supreme Soviet wiped  out the powers of the executive branch, subordinating it  completely to the representative branch and burying all hope of  restoring the status quo of the Russian Constitution by  parliamentary means. There was no reaction from Moscow, although  Article 72 of the federal Basic Law stipulates that one of the  areas under the joint jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and  its members is the "establishment of common principles of the  organization of government agencies and local self-rule."    Now the Mordvinian members of parliament have gone even  further. A day before the deadline for the registration of  candidates for the State Assembly that was supposed to replace  the Supreme Soviet, they suddenly cancelled the election  scheduled for 5 June and rescheduled it for 27 November. They  also issued a resolution which effectively restored the Soviet  regime throughout the republic. All that was left was the  trivial act of raising the red flag over the Palace of Soviets.    The Council of Ministers is still resisting, but these  forces  are clearly unequal. The republic Constitutional Court could  have acted as the arbiter, but it was abolished by the Supreme  Soviet a couple of months ago for its autonomous behavior.  According to Shvetsov and Valentin Konakov, the president's  representative in the republic, it is time for the federal  government to finally keep its promise. Otherwise, the "red  noose" around Moscow will be pulled even tighter.</p>

Foreign Exchange Market Is Not Unified, Local Divisions  Are Serious    Since reform and opening up, the traditional system of  highly  centralized foreign exchange control has been broken up and a  crisscross foreign exchange distribution system has been  established. Vertical distribution is restricted mainly by the  ratio of foreign exchange withholding and the state foreign  exchange utilization plan. Horizontal flow is restricted mainly  by the economic returns of foreign exchange utilization of local  departments. The former is less flexible as compared to the  latter. Enterprises and local departments receive foreign  exchange supply through vertical distribution and rely on the  regulatory foreign exchange market for regulating their foreign  exchange surplus and shortage. The vertical foreign exchange  distribution plan is linked to the national plan, stressing the  consideration of national interests, whereas local and  departmental foreign exchange utilization considers mainly local  and departmental interests. As a result, there are conflicts  between vertical foreign exchange supply and horizontal flow.  For instance, the special economic zones (SEZ) of China have a  greater demand for foreign exchange due to their rapid  development. This has caused a large amount of foreign exchange  to flow into the SEZs. In the meantime, areas losing foreign  exchange do not get timely compensation for such spontaneous  outflow of foreign exchange. As a result, out of the  consideration of regional and local interests, local governments  often adopt means of administrative intervention to control the  outflow of foreign exchange, creating man-made obstacles to  horizontal flow of foreign exchange.    2. The Existence of Three Foreign Exchange Rates Affects  Investment Environment    Currently there are mainly three foreign exchange rates: 1)  Official exchange rate; 2) market exchange rate, referring  mainly to exchange rate on the regulatory market which is  determined by the supply and demand situation of foreign  exchange market and the goal of government intervention; 3)  black market exchange rate, referring to non-public transactions  outside the foreign exchange market. The existence of three  exchange rates has distorted the price of foreign exchange  market, adversely affected the optimum distribution of foreign  exchange resources, influenced the environment of foreign  investment, and hindered to a certain extent the development of  foreign contacts.    3. Foreign Exchange Shortage Makes Reluctance To Sell a  Common Phenomenon    Foreign exchange shortage can be divided into two types:  actual and psychological. Actual shortage is caused by either  insufficient supply or excessive demand of foreign exchange or a  combination of the two. In recent years, China's import and  export trade has developed rapidly, causing demand for use of  foreign exchange to skyrocket. Especially since 1991, along with  the high speed growth of the economy, the growth of import has  far exceeded the growth of export, creating a shortage of supply  on the foreign exchange market. A direct consequence of the  shortage is increasingly tightened control of foreign exchange  and the prevailing mentality of reluctance to sell. The  appearance of psychological shortage is caused by strict foreign  exchange control, complicated screening and approval procedures,  and anticipation for the depreciation of renminbi. Since 1992,  the mentality of reluctance to sell has been very common on the  foreign exchange market. This has caused a very unfavorable  effect on the regulatory functions of the foreign exchange  market.    4. Foreign Exchange Withholding Quota Creates More Harm Than  Good and Is Unfavorable to the Formation of Foreign Exchange  Market    Beginning 1979, the traditional unified foreign exchange  collection and distribution system was replaced with the foreign  exchange withholding quota system. We should say that this  special system has played a positive role in increasing the  efficiency of production and management of export enterprises  and raising the enthusiasm of enterprises. However, as the  reform and opening up further deepened and objective economic  conditions changed, some problems have been exposed in the  foreign exchange withholding quota system. Their main  expressions are as follows: 1) Foreign exchange quota is  separated from the actual amount of foreign exchange, causing  over-distribution of foreign exchange resources, which tend to  result in the phenomenon of "marrying one girl to two men." 2)  The existence of both quota price and current exchange price has  distorted market exchange rate. 3) Withholding quota cannot  accurately reflect the actual income and expenditure of foreign  exchange, causing confusion in management. 4) Quota withholding  is not an international practice. Abolishing the quota  withholding system and permitting cash foreign exchange  withholding is an inevitable demand for deepening the reform of  foreign exchange management system.    5. Many Problems Still Exist in the Current Structure and  Management Method of National Foreign Exchange Reserves    First of all, national foreign exchange reserve that the  state can actually draw on is fairly limited. This is because  the state cannot transfer or use for free the portion of the  balance of foreign exchange operational funds of the National  Bank of China, which constitutes the difference between the  bank's own foreign exchange funds and routine foreign exchange  lending. And, localities and enterprises have the actual right  to use and control their share of the withholdings from national  foreign exchange balance. Local and enterprise withholdings  account for a fairly large portion of national foreign exchange  balance. Secondly, the Central Bank of China cannot function  effectively to manage foreign exchange reserves, adversely  affecting the enforcement of the monetary policy. Under the  current foreign exchange settlement system, the Central Bank of  China is responsible for supplying renminbi needed for all  foreign exchange settlements. As a passive supplier of renminbi,  it is difficult for the Central Bank to take the initiative in  regulating and controlling the supply according to different  monetary policies in different periods. More often than not, the  supply of renminbi by the Central Bank conflicts with the bank's  monetary policy, reducing the effect of the monetary policy.  Third, the readjustment of the scale of foreign exchange reserve  is inflexible and is carried out at a fairly great price. When  foreign exchange reserve declines and in serious shortage, the  state often puts various restrictions on the use of foreign  exchange. When foreign exchange reserve becomes excessive, the  state often relaxes control in various manners regarding the use  of foreign exchange and indiscriminately expands the use of  foreign exchange, eventually resulting in the abrupt and  excessive reduction of foreign exchange scale.    Proposals for Reform of Foreign Exchange System in the Near  Future    The basic solution for the abovementioned problems in the  current foreign exchange control system is to deepen and speed  up the reform of the foreign exchange control system. Through  the reform, we should establish an overall regulation and  control mechanism for the Central Bank, speed up the formation  of a unified national foreign exchange market, strengthen the  control of foreign exchange reserve by the Central Bank, and  gradually promote free conversion of renminbi. In the near  future, we should adopt the following measures:    1. Strengthen the control of foreign exchange reserve and  increase the ability of the Central Bank to regulate and control  foreign exchange market. The key is to establish a foreign  exchange reserve control system centered around the Central  Bank, maintain a rational scale of foreign exchange reserve, and  change the past situation where the foreign exchange funds of  the bank were not separated from the foreign exchange balance of  the state and where central foreign exchange was confused with  foreign exchange withholdings. At the same time, we should  establish the foreign exchange leverage fund for the Central  Bank to ensure its ability to adjust to market changes.    As China opens its door wider and wider to the outside and  as  the domestic economy of China develops, the overall balance of  the national economy depends on internal and foreign exchange  balance to maintain, and doing a good job in coordinating the  relations between domestic monetary and foreign exchange  policies is extremely important. Judging from the experience of  various nations, foreign exchange policy is an important  component of the monetary policy of the Central Bank. When the  economy of a nation is affected by external factors, causing  serious fluctuation of foreign exchange market, the central bank  will openly buy and sell foreign exchange on foreign exchange  market to suppress exchange prices. This important task cannot  be accomplished if the central bank does not have enough foreign  exchange on hand. Because of this, China should speed up the  reform of foreign exchange transfer and deposit system, change  the current situation of decentralized foreign exchange control,  and establish as soon as possible a powerful reserve control  system.    2. Establish a foreign exchange market of effective  operation. First, we should create a "market starter" to  facilitate the circulation of foreign exchange funds between  financial organizations, especially between banks and other  financial organizations. At the same time, we should expand the  right and ability of all financial organizations to manage  foreign exchange and enable them to actively participate in the  market and create a market amidst fair competition. Second, we  should further expand the scale of foreign exchange regulation  to increase the coverage of market. Third, we should accelerate  the reform of the current foreign exchange withholding system,  abolish as soon as possible withholding quotas, and smooth out  foriegn exchang price. Fourth, we should improve the  administrative divisions of current foreign exchange market,  establish unified tangible foreign exchange markets based in  large open cities, and gradually transfer to an invisible  unified national market. Fifth, we should abolish the  multi-track foreign exchange rate systems and merge them into  one. Sixth, we should experiment with free conversion of  renminbi in nontrade and border-trade areas and gradually make  it possible to convert renminbi without any restrictions.  Through the above reforms, we should establish an open, unified,  and highly effective foreign exchange market.    3. Establish an effective foreign exchange statistics  monitoring system to provide a basis for strengthening the  overall regulation and control of the Central Bank.    Judged from the current situation, international payments  have a growing impact on the credit income and expenditure of  the state. Inaccurate statistics of international payments will  affect the accuracy of policies. Because of this, we should  seize the golden opportunity created by the International  Currency Foundation helping us strengthen our foreign exchange  statistics and build a complete foreign exchange statistics  system to create conditions for timely understanding, mastering,  and study of foreign economic activities and for making correct  policy decisions.</p>

Shcherbachev; UDC </F> 621.391]    [Abstract]Algorithms are build to evaluate the location of  a radiation source which is stationary relative to the surface  of the Earth by using the results of combined measurements of  differences in distance and their derivatives. Based on the  least-squares technique, expressions are obtained for evaluating  the coordinates of the source of radiation in the form of  explicit functions of the initial measurements. Properties of  the evaluations which are obtained and their precision  characteristics are studied by using modelling. Figures 2;  references 7.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Arts: Your starter for ten - Radio FOR THOSE still able to get a laugh out of finance, Radio 4 has devised The Board Game, Mondays, repeated late the following Sunday - a quiz like the sports quizzes, where players are more likely to score with an able memory than an ace service. Here are some sample questions. To what financial figure would you ascribe this extract (actual) from a speech? What is meant by red bits, me-too products, PIMS? How do you interpret the body-language of applicants for jobs? How will you explain your apparently disloyal behaviour? Neil Koenig, the producer, knows what he is about, and the players are quick on the ball. On Thursday Radio 4 gave us Blood Sports for Girls, about the games they play at school. Girls between 12 and 16 were quite honest with reporter Sara Parker about their uncharming acts, which were not to do with sex. Gangs would pick on special victims and accuse them of some nasty, or silly, quality, real or imaginary. Friendships or dislikes might be virtually enforced. The object in every case was the frank wish for power. The programme, cleverly produced by Tessa Watt, struck me as a nature programme as much as a social comment. But on the previous day, the front page of our local paper was given over to the case of a girl so badly bullied at her school she had to be taken away. She had suffered blood sports as beastly - worse even - as those in the programme. It is not for me to comment on such things. I leave it to Esther Rantzen. Does Radio 3 want to counter the weight of the Proms with extra light drama? The last two weeks have been awfully trivial. I wrote last week about the Sunday play, Burn the Aeneid. This week we had Antrobus and the Lion by David Stafford, one of a pair of 'Unmade Movies' - another next week. It is unmade because David Selznick, wanting a star writer to do his script for Gone with the Wind, bets Sam Goldwyn he will get Bernard Shaw. What is more, Hazel Antrobus, the cat-burglar caught in his house, will get him to do it. So indeed she does, as a parody of Liza from Pygmalion, supported by Loewe's music from My Fair Lady. It was well played, but even Jeremy Howe's direction could not make it bearable. The previous evening we had Two into Three, wrapped around the Prom. In the first 20 minutes, Tudor,a fat retired policeman, goes to the Prom to pick up a woman. Silly Pamela, who has had trouble arriving, sits by him and agrees to have a drink in the interval (another 30 minutes). He tells her about having accidentally arrested Sir Adrian Boult; she tells him about her creative writing course and her preference for boxing over music. They hear RVW's Sea Symphony and go to supper in a local restaurant (a final 40 minutes). Their talk lapses increasingly into fantasy, often BBC-based, sometimes sexual but not mutual. The writer is Peter Tinniswood, whose talent is to invent amusing characters and find things for them to do. He has hung a load of potential comedy on Tudor and Pamela (Richard Griffiths and Elizabeth Spriggs) but given them nothing funny to say. John Tydeman directed. The quarterly complaints bulletin from the Radio Authority is interesting. Of 31 complaints against independent stations, only five were upheld, two of them with reservation, and seven out of 18 complaints against advertisers. Five listeners complained that Sunrise FM (Bradford) broadcast in Urdu, not in other Indian dialects; 960 listeners signed an identical complaint. Spectrum Radio (Greater London) had dropped a programme on Afro-Caribbean matters, and appalled one listener with an 'occult' programme in Arabic. An LBC presenter had imitated an Asian accent. Every ethnic community must have its own station everywhere.</p>

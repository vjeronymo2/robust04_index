			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Carlos Menem said that he was "in complete  agreement" with a document released on Wednesday [9 March] by  the Catholic Church that outlined its recommendations for the  reformed Constitution including a guarantee of greater  separation of the three branches of government.    The President also said during a press conference at  Government House that "nothing could be decided" about Raul  Matera, the number two candidate on the ruling Justicialist  Party's Federal Capital slate of potential delegates to the  Constituent Assembly, until a complete diagnosis was made.    Matera was admitted to the Otamendi Clinic on Wednesday with  pneumonia. Menem added he had tried to visit Matera, who is also  science and technology secretary and serves as the head of the  city Peronist Party.    At the same time the President said he supported the concept  of a separation of powers but did not directly respond to the  Episcopal Conference of bishops' assertion that the executive  branch had experienced "uncontrolled growth" during his term.    However, he said, any final decision "depends fundamentally  on what the people say through the reform process under way." He  added that Church-state relations were "normal."    In their statement the bishops left open the possibility  that  future presidents might be of different religions -- currently  the head of state is required under the Constitution to be a  practicing Catholic -- but rejected the possibility of an  atheist leading the country.    Reacting to that last statement Lomas de Zamora Suffragan  Bishop Juan Carlos Maccarone yesterday [10 March] stated that  the Church had in fact "left open" the issue of the head of  state's religion because it was not a priority and did not have  a mandate from the Episcopal Conference.    Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf meanwhile declined to  comment on the Church statement, saying that was the duty of the  Foreign Ministry's religion department.    Legal and Technical Secretary Carlos Corach, the leading  candidate on the ruling Justicialist Party's slate of potential  delegates to the Constituent Assembly, took issue with the  bishop's statement on the separation of powers.    "The executive branch has not increased its powers," he  said.    Among the opposition the Radical National Committee, in a  statement signed by party Chairman Raul Alfonsin, said the  bishops' declaration "contributes to the general consensus"  required for reform.    Alfonsin added that the Church's concern for the growth in  the executive branch's powers "without a doubt coincides" with  his own party's worries.    Differing with the Church was the Argentine Society for  Gay-Lesbian Integration [SIGLA], which warned that the Catholic  Church's stance "puts the civil rights and the rights of  minorities at risk."    SIGLA noted in a statement issued yesterday that "the  Catholic Church is endowed with privileges that the other  religions lack."    In other political news:    -- Dario Cipollini, the former secretary for ex-Radical  Deputy Luis Medina Allende, was summoned to testify yesterday in  court on charges he bribed Peronist legislators during Cordoba's  1986 Constituent Assembly.    -- The Trotskyist Left Socialist Front (FIS) yesterday  presented its list of candidates for the April 10 Constituent  Assembly election. The coalition, which opposes constitutional  reform, will be led by Movement Toward Socialism's Nora Ciappone  and former Socialist Workers Movement Deputy Luis Zamora.</p>

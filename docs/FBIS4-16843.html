			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "Territories" rubric: </F> "Urals Republic Idea Was Interesting. Center Fails To  Appreciate Eduard Rossel's Good Intentions"]    [Text] The State Duma hearings on the Urals Republic that  never materialized reminds one of a discussion about the rise  and fall of an ancient state. Deputy Vladimir Lysenko outlined  five conceptual models of Russia's administrative system. The  first one calls for making all the current Federation components  guberniyas (that is, for lowering the republics' status). The  second, on the contrary, calls for the raising of the status of  krays and oblasts to that of the republics. The third one calls  for creating lands, letting the republics be. The fourth one is  about creating lands all over Russia. And finally, the fifth  one calls for a development of regional economic associations.    Eduard Rossel, current member of the Federation Council and  recent head of the administration of Sverdlovsk Oblast and  chairman of its soviet, and who was discharged from his position  by the president precisely for the idea of a Urals Republic,  complained about overcentralization of the economy; he was  trying to prove that the people of Yekaterinburg had no  separatist goals in mind and were simply trying to shift the  burden of reforms into the regions. At first the republic was  seen as an association of six territories. Mr. Rossel had taken  this idea for equal rights for Federation components to 18  ministries in Moscow and received 18 rejections. After that the  oblast held a referendum where the idea of a republic obtained  84 percent of the votes. On 27 October, a session of the oblast  soviet passed the constitution of a Urals Republic (so far to be  comprised of Sverdlovsk Oblast). The same day regulations for  the elections of a legislative assembly were confirmed, with the  president dissolving the Sverdlovsk soviet two weeks after. The  heads of the contiguous territories, naturally, feared the same  fate as Mr. Rossel's, and the Urals republic did not materialize  after all.    Speaking next, Emil Pain, member of the Presidential  Council,  agreed that the architects of a Urals Republic had not been  separatist-minded, and put the spotlight on an important mistake  made at the time of organizing the new administrative entity, a  mistake that largely contributed to the initiative's failure.  Public opinion, hence of those in power at various levels, took  the Urals Republic idea precisely as separatist. This attests  not only to an inadequately analytical perception of the  described idea at the federative level, but also to the fact  that those who elaborated the social project may have supposed  that no public opinion was going to be formed, or they ignored  it, or they hoped for the common sense of average Russians and  those in executive positions. Which is, as usual, a pity.</p>

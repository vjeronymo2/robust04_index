			<p>BFN     [Text] The number of cases of so-called nonregulation  relations between servicemen in the Belarus Army is growing at a  threatening rate. Procurator General Vasil Shaladonaw was  forced to state this sad fact at the latest meeting of the  republican procuracy collegium. Over the past year alone the  number of fights between soldiers increased by 47 percent and  the number of servicemen involved in these obscene acts by 55  percent. Two servicemen have been killed.</p>

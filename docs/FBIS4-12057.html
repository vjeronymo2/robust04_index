			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report followed by 'Imanu'el Rosen video </F> report]    [Excerpt] The representatives of the Foreign and Defense  ministries of the three countries which are contributing  personnel to the international force in Hebron will arrive in  Israel tomorrow. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres today promised  the Norwegian, Danish, and Italian ambassadors in Israel that  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will guarantee the safety of the  international force. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el  Rosen reports:    [Begin recording] [Rosen] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  today sought to assuage the concern of the ambassadors of the  three countries which agreed to send observers to Hebron. For  this reason he also summoned Major General Dani Yatom, the  officer who will be in charge of the safety of the 160  international observers as of next week. The complicated  problems of coordination will be tackled, among other ways, by  special uniforms and easily identified vehicles. Peres believes  that the headache is not too bad:    [Peres] In English we refer to the temporary international  presence in Hebron as TIPH, Temporary International Presence in  Hebron [preceding five words in English]. In Hebrew we can  refer to it as tipa [meaning one drop in Hebrew]. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

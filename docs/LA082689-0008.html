			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGOLA'S TRUCE COLLAPSES  </P> <P> Heavy fighting was reported in Angola last week between government troops and  the rebel forces of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi. What caused the collapse of a  truce that was painstakingly stitched together in June by heads of neighboring  African states is not precisely clear. But President Bush's refusal, in  deference to his party's right wing, to stop sending $15 million to $18 million  worth of arms a year to Savimbi certainly is a factor to be regretted.  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of Angolans have died in what now approaches a 30-year war,  half of it fought to oust Portugal from its colony, the other half to drive out  the self-proclaimed Marxists who snatched the government from the Portuguese 14  years ago.  </P> <P> The supply of American arms not only helps prolong the agony of Angola's  people, it threatens still another agreement -- one brokered last year by the  United States -- under which Cuba agreed to withdraw troops that were helping  the Angola government fight off Savimbi. The withdrawal, already under way, was  in response to South Africa's promise under the U.S.-sponsored agreement to  relinquish control over Namibia on Angola's southern border. Cuba's President  Fidel Castro said a day after reports of heavy fighting that it could lead to a  halt or a slowdown in the withdrawal of Cubans from Angola.  </P> <P> All of this follows not from any conflict between America's interests and those  of Angola, but from a domestic political decision to oblige the President's  right-wing supporters who see Angola's leadership as part of a Soviet threat in  the Third World.  </P> <P> The irony is that Angola's leaders themselves are beginning to back away from  Marxism, as are other former followers of Moscow, and to grope for closer ties  with the West. During all 14 years of the UNITA campaign against Angola, the  country has continued to be a reliable supplier of oil to the West. Time has  made it clear that Savimbi himself is as much outlaw as resistance hero.  </P> <P> Bush has been urged before to think carefully about the consequences of  continued support for Savimbi, not just for Angola but for Namibia. With the  truce falling apart and the prospect for more slaughter very real, the warnings  about arms shipments no longer involve possible consequences. They are a matter  of life and death. The President must act soon.  </P></p>

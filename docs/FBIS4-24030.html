			<p>BFN     [Text] Addis Ababa, 21 Jun (AFP) -- The Organisation of  African Unity (OAU) on Tuesday [21 June] warned of the "dangers"  of a French military intervention in Rwanda and called instead  for more African UN troops. The pan-African body supported the  principle of a French proposal to send troops to Rwanda to  staunch a 10-week bloodbath, but said that African UN  peacekeepers would be better because Rwandan rebels opposed the  French plan.    "While the OAU fully understands and appreciates the concern  of the international community, including France, over the  carnage that continues to be perpetrated in Rwanda, it is at the  same time concerned that given the expressed opposition by one  of the parties to the conflict, there are fears of possible  complications and indeed dangers of such an action," the  organisation said in a statement.    It said a number of African countries were willing to send  4,000 troops to reinforce the 495 UN peacekeepers in Rwanda and  blamed rich nations for failing "to provide the required  logistical and financial support to enable the troops to be  quickly deployed in Rwanda." "Any and all actions by an  individual country or group of countries should consequently be  undertaken within the scope of that international consensus, and  of the framework of the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR  II)," the statement said. "Given Africa's expressed commitment  to support the efforts of the world body (UN), it is the view of  the OAU that the best way was to ensure the deployment of these  (4,000 African) troops under UNAMIR II," the statement said.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 26% growth at Prospect PROSPECT Industries reported a 26 per cent increase in pre-tax profit from Pounds 3.53m to Pounds 4.44m in the year to September 30. Prospect's shares climbed 10 per cent from 14 3/4 p to 16 1/2 p. Mr Philip Wilbraham, chairman, said the group, formerly an engineering components supplier, had completed its transition 'from a company to being a group serving the power generation and process industries'. He noted that year-on-year comparisons were difficult because the results included a 12-month contribution from its core operation Dunn International bought for Pounds 13.4m in May last year; six months from Greenbank, a pipeworks supplier, bought for Pounds 2.4m in March, and two months from Davenport, acquired for Pounds 10.1m. Turnover jumped to Pounds 52.5m (Pounds 30m), to which engineering services contributed Pounds 34.4m and manufacturing Pounds 18m. Operating profit increased to Pounds 5.03m (Pounds 4m). A final dividend of 0.5p makes a total of 0.75p. Earnings per share were 2p (2.68p).</p>

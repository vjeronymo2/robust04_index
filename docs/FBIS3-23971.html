The  Pace of Inflation Will Increase in Coming Months"]    [Text] For 2.5 hours on 3 February the members of the  government's presidium discussed the draft, "Economic Conditions  for the Operation of the Agricultural Complex in 1994."    Since it is traditional to make up subtitles to government  documents, in my opinion this one could be called the classic  manual to branch lobbying.    The 24 points contain almost everything against which the  reform government struggled for 2 years, as, for example,  government subsidies for the procurement from abroad of agents  to protect vegetation and raw materials for the food industry,  and the cancellation of duties on imported spare parts and  equipment for some branches of industry. These are seemingly  innocuous points, but they radically undermine domestic  industry, especially the chemical industry, machine building and  the military industrial complex. With government protection of  the domestic market they would be able to supply the  agroindustrial complex with all it needed, but without it the  domestic industry will not be able to withstand competition with  foreign suppliers.    Let us say that the procurement of sugar from abroad  requires  a 20-percent duty. Even without this, our sugar prices are the  highest in the world. Now the sugar barons, protected from  competition, will be able to do with us what they will.    It is possible to analyze every point of the document, but  it  is better to provide summary figures. In the course of this year  direct subsidies from budget allocations will equal 14.1  trillion rubles; the creation of a federal food fund will  require 14.5 trillion; and special-purpose preferential credit  for spring field work - 6 trillion. Add some other benefits to  this and you will have a total of 34.7 trillion.    From past experience we know that ultimately almost half of  preferential credit is transformed into cash and appears on the  market. The reaction to this will be unequivocal -- first there  will be an increase in the cost of durable goods because they  are purchased in expectation of inflation. We can assume that in  the coming 2-3 months there will be a sharp increase in the cost  of televisions, refrigerators, VCR's and other embellishments of  our lives.    We cannot avoid price fixing on the hard currency market,  which is completely understandable because people prefer to  exchange "mad money" for something more dependable, i.e., hard  currency. During the January panic about 2 trillion rubles were  thrown into the currency market. What if several times more  rubles follow this route? In such a case we cannot rule out that  B. Fedorov's prediction that by year's end $1 will be equivalent  to 10,000 rubles might come to pass even sooner.    Everything taken together -- the sugar, meat, flour and milk  monopolies, their protection from competition with cheap foreign  products, and the growing pace of inflation -- will result in  price increases. I think that very soon we will be paying 10,000  rubles for a kilogram of meat and 20,000 for a kilogram of  butter.    The government has already corrected its goals for the end  of  the year several times. First there was talk of 4-5 percent  inflation in December, then 7-9 percent and then 15-16 percent.  But independent experts feel that the upheavals arising from the  implementation of "economic conditions" will be so painful that  already in April inflation may exceed 30 percent, and in July --  50 percent. Why should millions of Russians suffer new  deprivations and difficulties?    The attack on the state treasury proceeded under the pretext  that it is essential to rescue the village and to save the  peasant from death by starvation. But is the situation within  the branch all that tragic? In the course of 2 years production  volume decreased within the branch at the slowest pace -- by 4-5  percent as compared to 16-19 percent in industry and 24-27  percent in transportation. Last year there was an increase in  the consumption of almost all types of food products except fish  and vegetables. Especially great was increased consumption of  sugar, confectionery goods, fruit and citrus products -- by 21  percent.    The average wage within the agroindustrial complex is 80,000  rubles. At the same time, if we take into consideration income  from private plots, then peasants receive more than the workers  of half of the sectors of our economy. Perhaps it is not a  matter of poverty?    Everyone who lives in this country realizes that the entire  society is in debt to the village. We would not begrudge any  amount of money if it were directed into solving the most acute  social problems and into structural reorganization.  Unfortunately, there is no talk of this.    The people's money will be used according to former methods  -- to support that which exists, and not for a structural  transformation of the village. This is a guarantee that these  tens of trillions will not be enough. They, like previous credit  infusions, will disappear into the black hole of ineffective  agricultural production.    On 3 February the draft was not passed. But we can assume  that the basic numbers will not change because the only voices  of opposition were those of A. Chubays, S. Dubinin and V.  Mashits.    At the meeting one of the representatives of the  agroindustrial complex said: "The Russian people must feed their  peasants." It cannot be said any better.    So, fellow countrymen, get out your wallets.</p>

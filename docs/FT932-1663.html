			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Treuhand set to tighten controls THE Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern German industry, is setting up a department aimed at tightening control and supervision over the implementation of purchase contracts. Mr Hero Brahms, vice-president of the Treuhand, who will oversee a department of 350 to 550 accountants and lawyers, said it was crucial to introduce greater accountability into contracts signed between the Treuhand and investors since it was set up in late 1990. 'We have to make sure that the investments the Treuhand have earmarked for environment clean-up, for instance, are honoured by these enterprises,' he said at a press conference in Berlin yesterday. 'Moreover, we have to monitor that investment commitments and job guarantees undertaken by purchasers are also implemented.' Since late 1990, the Treuhand has signed more than 40,000 contracts, including sales of real estate. Most of the contracts are anchored on two principles: guaranteeing a certain number of jobs coupled with investment programmes spread over several years by the purchaser. Under these contracts, the Treuhand has secured DM179bn (Pounds 71.8bn) investment commitments, and 1.46m job guarantees. Privatisation receipts are less than DM50bn. Few Treuhand officials, however, are prepared to forecast how many workers will lose their jobs in these privatised industries once the contracts end. The proportion of unemployed, including those in part-time work, or on job creation and training schemes is more than 30 per cent in each of the five east German states.</p>

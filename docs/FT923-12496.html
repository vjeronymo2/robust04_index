			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: M and S promises a better first-half performance SIR RICHARD Greenbury, chairman of Marks and Spencer, promised shareholders an improved first half performance in spite of low consumer confidence and a 'very difficult' past three months. Speaking yesterday at a packed annual meeting, he said the company had maintained growth through the most severe recession since the war and would be able to take advantage of the recovery the moment it arrived - even though, he suggested, this would still take some time. He vowed that Marks would sharpen prices but would not be sucked into a discount war. 'The vast majority of selling prices this autumn will be the same as and, in many cases, lower than last year,' he said. Sir Richard sadly conceded that the company's range of dresses was indeed below par this year and that one of its stores was 'abysmal' but he vigorously defended the decision not to open on Sundays. 'We will not be party to breaking the law of the land,' he said, although adding it would not be in the company's commercial interest to open anyway. Sir Richard also deplored the growing threat of violence. The company had prosecuted 15,000 people for theft last year and had increased its security budget from Pounds 15m to Pounds 21m. Much of this money was spent on security guards. 'They're six foot four ex-marines. I can tell you I wouldn't take them on,' he said. But he nearly found an alternative use for them after one shareholder provoked his ire. Losing patience after a string of highly critical questions, Sir Richard threatened to throw the persistent shareholder out of the meeting. But he sharply desisted  .. just as a burly security guard strode into view.</p>

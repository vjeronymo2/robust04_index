			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ROLE IN MIDEAST HELPED TO PUT A LID ON DEFENSE CUTS, STRATEGISTS SAY;  </P> <P> MILITARY: OPERATION DESERT SHIELD ALTERED THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IN THE  NEGOTIATIONS, AIDES CONTEND. LAWMAKERS WHO HAD CALLED FOR DEEP CUTBACKS WERE  FORCED ON THE DEFENSIVE.  </P> <P> The political backdrop of the U.S. military deployment in Saudi Arabia played a  significant role in limiting defense cuts in Sunday's budget agreement, halting  the military spending "free fall" that some analysts had predicted two months  ago, budget aides said Monday.  </P> <P> Capitol Hill strategists said that Operation Desert Shield forged a major  change in the political climate of the negotiations, forcing lawmakers who had  been advocating deep cuts on the defensive.  </P> <P> While many Democrats were eager to cut more deeply, a Democratic strategist  said: "It was just not something they wanted to campaign on a week later. The  politics shifted in favor of those who wanted to cut less."  </P> <P> The defense budget compromise struck by negotiators Sunday would leave not only  funding for Operation Desert Shield intact but would spare much of the funding  that has been spent each year to prepare for a major Soviet onslaught on  Western Europe.  </P> <P> While as much as 60% of the annual defense budget in recent decades has gone  toward preparations for a large-scale war in Europe, military spending would  shrink by less than 20% by 1995 under the new plan.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in January proposed to trim defense spending by  10% over the five years ending in fiscal 1995.  </P> <P> Meeting that target has forced the Pentagon to consider cutting two Navy  aircraft carriers, scrapping its nuclear missile modernization plans and  reducing the military's rolls of uniformed personnel -- about 2.1 million  servicemen and women -- by 25%.  </P> <P> By contrast, the accord forged by the White House and congressional leaders  would cut the Pentagon budget almost 20% over the next five years.  </P> <P> But while many analysts had called for reductions of 25% and more -- and  appeared likely to see their recommendations become policy -- the crisis in the  Middle East has changed that, at least for now.  </P> <P> "Psychologically, (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein helped build a floor into  the defense budget," said Gordon Adams, director of the Washington-based  Defense Budget Project.  </P> <P> "It turned the House of Representatives' number from a guess to an absolute  bottom. Not because the money had anything to do with Desert Shield, but  numbers in this town become symbols.  </P> <P> "Politically, it became difficult for people to say, 'my symbol for my  commitment to national defense is a very deep cut.' The impact was one of  political psychology," Adams said.  </P> <P> Cheney, normally an outspoken critic of such congressional deals, stayed silent  on Monday about the plan.  </P> <P> A senior Pentagon official said that Cheney had been involved in drafting the  accord and would be "actively working the phones" with lawmakers this week.  </P> <P> But he stopped short of saying that Cheney would lobby in support of the  compromise, implying that the defense secretary has reservations about the  plan.  </P> <P> As a result of the political impact of the U.S. Middle East deployment, defense  negotiators decided to separate funding for Operation Desert Shield from the  budget agreement.  </P> <P> By doing so, lawmakers hope to avoid the appearance that their insistence on  defense cuts has imposed any further hardship on U.S. troops in and around  Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> But the tactic achieved another purpose, welcomed by lawmakers intent on  limiting Pentagon budgets.  </P> <P> By separating $15-billion worth of Middle East operating costs from the 1990  budget, the lawmakers denied the Pentagon the opportunity to "pad" the 1990  budget, which will become the base line against which future growth or  shrinkage in defense budgets would be compared.  </P> <P> If the defense budget were $15-billion larger in its base year, then in each  subsequent year, the Pentagon would have to ask for more money just to stay  even with its last year's budget.  </P> <P> The larger base would also have made it easier for the Pentagon to claim to  have made deeper cuts in subsequent years because of the inflated budget of the  base year.  </P> <P> That move, Adams said, will prevent the Pentagon from using Operation Desert  Shield to inflate future defense budgets and "throw every weapon under Saddam  Hussein's Christmas tree."  </P></p>

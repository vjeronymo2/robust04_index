			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A large deal in the traded options sector was the only outstanding feature in an otherwise dull day in the derivatives, writes Joel Kibazo. In traded options, the day's big trade was carried out in BAT Industries stock options. Kleinwort Benson was said to have sold 9,500 of the August 550 puts to Smith New Court at 116p. Dealers suggested that the deal had been timed to coincide with next week's dividend payout in BAT. That trade helped to raise total volume in the sector to 27,320 contracts by the close. Some 5,378 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,595 in the Euro FT-SE option. Among the other stock options, RTZ saw business of 1,279 lots and 1,078 were traded in Asda. In futures, dealers also reported a cautious session, with few of the big institutions willing to deal. Having opened at 3,090, the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 moved forward on sporadic buying by independent(local) traders and some buying from UBS. It reached the day's high of 3,119 at mid-morning, before profit-taking left it trading around the 3,100 over the next few hours. A firm opening on Wall Street brought a renewed advance for the contract and it finished at 3,108, up 13 from its previous close and at a good premium to cash of 11 points. Volume, at 7,398 lots, was poor.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / S Korean economy likely to grow 6% THE South Korean economy is expected to improve this year, with the current account deficit shrinking and prices stabilising. Government agencies and private institutes predict that gross national product growth will be around 6 per cent in 1993 against last year's 4.9 per cent, the worst economic performance since the country's 1980 recession. The Economic Planning Board, (EPB), the government's senior economic agency, estimates that 7 per cent is the optimal growth rate for South Korea. Higher growth would trigger excessive inflationary pressure. The expected acceleration in this year's growth will depend on increased industrial investments and growing exports as the global economy recovers. The growth in industrial investment slowed to 0.8 per cent in 1992, reflecting weaker business confidence, after averaging more than 15 per cent annually during the previous two years. The government recently announced measures to stimulate investment, including lifting the ceiling on foreign currency loans for the purchase of imported machinery and providing state loans of Dollars 6.3bn (Pounds 4.2bn) for domestic machinery and plant construction. 'The currently flat investment situation, if prolonged, is expected to seriously threaten the nation's economic growth potential in the next couple of years,' said Mr Choi Gak-kyu, the deputy prime minister and EPB director. He estimated that industrial investment could increase by 5 per cent in 1993 as a result of the new measures. A recent survey of the country's big industrial groups found that most are planning to boost investment in the belief that export demand will improve. The election last month of Mr Kim Young-sam as Korea's next president also restored business confidence by removing the political uncertainty that had dampened capital spending. Increased investments will be primarily directed to the electronic, automotive and semiconductor industries. Restrictions on construction, which were imposed last year to curb inflation, have also been recently lifted. Exports are expected to increase by 8 per cent as Korean companies expand markets in developing countries, particularly China and South-East Asia, to compensate for slower demand in the US, Japan and the EC. The rise in exports, combined with lower imports, should almost eliminate the trade deficit on a balance of payments basis, although it will amount to Dollars 3.5bn on a customs clearance basis compared with Dollars 4.9bn last year, said the ministry of trade and industry. This should help reduce the current account deficit to Dollars 3bn against Dollars 4.5bn in 1992. Concerns remain about inflation, although the 1992 rate of 4.5 per cent was the lowest since 1986, when prices rose 1.3 per cent. It remains unclear whether President-elect Kim will agree to the present tight monetary policy or instead ease credit controls in response to business demands. Most forecasts estimate an inflation rate of around 5 per cent if the stable growth policy continues. The EPB wants to slow expansion of the money supply to between 13 per cent and 17 per cent from last year's 18.5 per cent. It plans to mollify business worries about a possible recession by lowering interest rates to a target rate of 12 per cent from last year's peak of 19 per cent through deregulation and more loans for industrial investment.</p>

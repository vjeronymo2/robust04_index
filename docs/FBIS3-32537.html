Alexandre  Garcia now reports live from the Congress plenary session.    [Begin Garcia recording] Despite a protest by the minority,  the majority of lawmakers approved a request for an overall vote  on all the individual topics on which separate voting had been  requested. This means that a majority vote will defeat the  requests for separate voting on individual topics, in order to  let the original text of the bill -- which has already been  approved -- remain unchanged.    Today's congressional agenda also includes a vote on the  reduction of the presidential term from five to four years. [end  recording]    We remind you that a second voting is due on the emergency  social fund before it is published by the official gazette.</p>

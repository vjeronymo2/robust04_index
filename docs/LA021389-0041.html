			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NICKLAUS' PUTTING PUTS HIM ON TOP IN SKINS  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus putted superbly Sunday against younger rivals Curtis Strange,  Greg Norman and Isao Aoki and earned $254,250 in the inaugural Australian Super  Skins golf tournament at Port Douglas, Australia.  </P> <P> Nicklaus, 49, birdied three of the first nine holes Sunday to win $126,000 and  received an additional $33,250 when the final five holes and two playoff holes  all were halved.  </P> <P> Strange, the U.S. Open champion, won $173,250 to finish second. Norman, of  Australia, won $132,750 with a strong finish, and Aoki, of Japan, collected  $47,250.  </P> <P> Nicklaus and Strange each won $94,500 Saturday, the opening day of the 36-hole  event over the par-72 Mirage Country Club course.  </P> <P> The total purse was $607,500, plus hole-in-one bonuses worth $1.4 million.  </P> <P> Under the skins format, prize money for each hole increases unless the hole is  won outright.  </P> <P> Nicklaus began Sunday superbly, earning $18,000 for a birdie at the par-four  first hole, where he sank a three-foot putt, and $18,000 for a birdie at the  par-four No. 4, where all three of his rivals squandered birdie opportunities.  </P> <P> Nicklaus then thrilled the gallery by making a 12-foot putt on No. 9 for his  second straight birdie at the hole and $90,000.  </P> <P> Larry Mowry made a five-foot par-saving putt on the 18th hole to edge Al  Geiberger and Miller Barber by one stroke and win the 50th PGA Seniors  Championship at Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.  </P> <P> Mowry, who posted a final-round 73, overcame a poor start and played the back  nine at PGA National in one under par. He earned $72,000 for his fourth victory  since joining the Senior tour in 1986.  </P> <P> Mowry finished with a 72-hole total of seven-under-par 281 on the 6,530-yard  Champion course. Geiberger and Barber, who shot 71s Sunday, were tied at 282.  </P> <P> Gene Sauers chipped in for birdie on the final hole to win the  weather-shortened Hawaiian Open golf tournament at Honolulu.  </P> <P> Sauers took the lead with a 12-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole, then finished  off a final-round 65 by chipping in from just off the back fringe of the green  for the second victory in his six-year PGA career.  </P> <P> He finished the rain-abbreviated 54-hole event in 19-under-par 197, the best  three-round score on the tour this season. The tournament was shortened because  of heavy rains that disrupted play Friday and Saturday.  </P></p>

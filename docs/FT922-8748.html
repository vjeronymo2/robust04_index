			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / British Coal to improve pensions TRUSTEES of British Coal's pension fund are to use Pounds 1bn of a surplus of nearly Pounds 1.5bn to improve pensions to mineworkers before privatisation. The move would ensure that the increases could not be reduced by any new owner of British Coal. A plan backed by the mining unions involves 70 per cent of the surplus being used to improve the scheme and 30 per cent allowing British Coal to extend its contributions holiday from 1994 until the year 2000. The company announced in December that the trustees of the Mineworkers Pension Scheme were considering how to share out a Pounds 1.491bn surplus. Benefits to members include a 25 per cent service credit for contributors, and an increase in the accruals rate - the fraction of final salary used to determine pensions - from 80ths to 60ths for those who opt to forgo a lump sum. The normal pension age will be reduced from 62 to 60.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Albanian diaspora boosts economy: The desperate boat people of a few years ago are now the country's saviours Fidel Castro called those who fled his dictatorship 'worms', and was deeply embarrassed when they returned to Cuba as mariposas - well dressed capitalist butterflies laden with gifts for their families. A similar transformation is under way for the desperate boat people who in 1990 and 1991 fled Albania on board ancient ships or across mountain paths after the collapse of the hated regime established by Enver Hoxha, the communist dictator. Many are still living miserably and working illegally at humble jobs in Greece, Italy and further afield. But remittances sent back home at great personal sacrifice from the more than 300,000 who fled what was once Europe's most isolated country have become Albania's largest source of foreign exchange, underpinning an extraordinary 11 per cent growth in gross domestic product last year after an officially calculated 35 per cent accumulated decline since 1989. Remittances rose from virtually zero in 1991 to Dollars 150m (Pounds 99m) in 1992 and more than doubled to Dollars 335m last year. This was three times the value of exports, at Dollars 112m, and 10 per cent higher than short-term foreign aid, which declined to Dollars 303m from its 1992 peak of Dollars 374m. The experience of earlier south European migrations to the richer parts of Europe indicates that such flows are likely to diminish as emigres either settle down in their new homes or return. But in the meantime the physical exodus of a tenth of the population of 3.2m, and much higher percentage of the economically active, has played a crucial role both in reducing unemployment and in kick-starting a vibrant free market of small traders and pavement cafes and financing the importation of more than 40,000 mainly second-hand cars, vans and trucks over the past two years. Many of the vehicles are of dubious provenance. And much of the luxury foods and consumer goods are smuggled by fast boat from Italy or from Greece, avoiding taxes and stimulating crime and corruption. But for most Albanians the important thing is that the last two years have brought the first taste of a banana or decent coffee as well as a cornucopia of other western consumer goods from TV satellite dishes to Coca-Cola. The wild west atmosphere is calming down as the government introduces customs duties and new personal taxes - and recruits a small army of tax officials and financial police to enforce the will of a Democratic party-led government elected in March 1992. President Sali Berisha, a former heart specialist who has become the increasingly powerful head of state, is regarded by western embassies in Tirana as a leader capable of persuading Albanians to concentrate on rebuilding their state and economy rather than dreaming of reunification with some 3m ethnic Albanians who live in neighbouring former Yugoslav regions of Montenegro, Kosovo and Macedonia. With more than Dollars 1.5bn pumped into the country over the last three years, Albania is by far the biggest recipient of western aid and soft loans per capita in post-communist Europe. A three-year, Dollars 720m public investment programme for 1994-96 depends largely on the flow continuing at the current rate of about Dollars 300m a year over this period. The aim is to make up for five decades of infrastructural neglect and build a new economic base after the virtual destruction of the old industrial economy which was based on obsolete Soviet and Chinese technology. The start of the investment programme essentially marks the beginning of the second stage of Albania's economic reconstruction. It builds on the successful economic stabilisation policies of 1991-93 during which prices were liberalised, subsidies virtually eliminated and inflation reduced from more than 230 per cent in January 1993 to an expected 20-22 per cent average for 1994. At the same time the collective farms were abolished and land was redistributed in small 3.5-acre plots to the 65 per cent of the population who live and work in the rural areas. The combination of closing loss-making plants, freeing trade and dissolving the collectives ensured that the surge in incomes from remittances and higher farm output sparked off a big increase in the domestic food supply as well as an import-led consumer boom. Independent economists say the main challenge facing the government, and especially the revamped central bank and Finance Ministry, is to resist the temptation to tax the emerging private sector too harshly. The alternative, they say, is to focus on encouraging the fledgling banks to improve their lending capacity. This would help the thousands of Albanians who have already made small fortunes in trade to move into construction, food processing and other industrial production, or tourism, which many see as one of the keys to Albania's re-emergence as a balanced industrial, agricultural and service-based economy.

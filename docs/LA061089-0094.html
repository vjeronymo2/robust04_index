			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH REFLECTS GROWING KOREAN ACTIVITY  </P> <P> One of the biggest Korean-American congregations in Los Angeles will move into  a newly constructed church complex next weekend -- a $9-million symbol of the  robust church activity among Korean-heritage Christians.  </P> <P> Despite inconvenient parking and makeshift classrooms at their old Koreatown  facility, the Young-Nak Presbyterian Church was ranked last year as the fourth  fastest-growing U.S. church in attendance.  </P> <P> Attendance at Young-Nak services and religious education classes grew to more  than 4,600 churchgoers on the average Sunday in 1987, according to the latest  survey by the Church Growth Research Center in Bolivar, Mo.  </P> <P> "But we know many people stopped coming because of lack of parking and  educational programs," an assistant pastor at the church said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seating for 1,200  </P> <P> However, with an opening ceremony on June 17 and three morning services on June  18, the congregation will find a new sanctuary seating 1,200 instead 850 and  parking for more than 500 cars.  </P> <P> The 4.7-acre site, which once accommodated an auto dealership, is on Broadway,  east of Chinatown and not far from the intersection of the Pasadena and Golden  State freeways.  </P> <P> "We were considering moving to the suburbs, but we decided to stay in the  city," said the Rev. Paul Chang, an associate pastor. "We will have members  coming from all directions."  </P> <P> A fourth service, the church's first one in English, will be added to the  schedule next month to serve second- and third-generation Korean-Americans.  </P> <P> Christian missionaries, mostly Presbyterian and Methodist, began work in Korea  a century ago but it has not been until the last few decades that churches have  shown remarkable growth. Buddhism and shamanistic beliefs still predominate,  but a majority of Korean immigrants to the United States tend to be Christian  or gravitate quickly to the community-serving Korean churches in this country.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Large Membership  </P> <P> An estimated 70% of the Korean-descent population in Southern California belong  to churches, predominantly Protestant, according to Myung K. Kim, publisher of  the Korean-language Church Herald. Nearly 700 churches have formed in the Los  Angeles-Orange County region, he said.  </P> <P> Young-Nak Presbyterian Church, whose senior pastor since 1974 has been the Rev.  Keyong Kim, has been worshiping in a building originally built as a synagogue  in Koreatown. Little more than street parking is available nearby. Most church  classes met in a nearby public school.  </P> <P> Its namesake church in Seoul, South Korea, is one of the nation's  "super-churches" with membership in the tens of thousands. In this country,  Young-Nak is the largest congregation of the Korean Presbyterian Church in  America, which will hold its national convention June 20-22 in Chicago.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the independent Oriental Mission Church and Young-Nak Church  are considered the two largest Korean-language congregations with about 6,000  and 5,000 members, respectively.  </P></p>

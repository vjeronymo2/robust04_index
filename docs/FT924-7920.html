			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Staveley edges ahead and expects better second half STAVELEY Industries, the measuring and mechanical engineering company which also owns British Salt, yesterday reported a slight increase in interim profits and said the second half should be stronger. Pre-tax profits edged up from Pounds 9m in the 27 weeks to October 5 last year to Pounds 9.1m in the slightly shorter 26 week period to October 3. Mr Brian Kent, chairman, said he expected second half gains from higher salt prices, and a return to profit at the measurement division's new German factory. But overall the mood remained cautious, he said. Turnover increased by 5.8 per cent to Pounds 156m, helped by a stronger than expected performance from mechanical and electrical services. Orders increased by 2.5 per cent to Pounds 162m and the company said export orders, especially to China and eastern Europe, showed gains. British Salt saw a slight fall in profits because of a shorter reporting period and a delayed 5 per cent price increase. Mr Kent said a cold winter usually added Pounds 500,000 to profits because salt was used to clear frozen pavements. Mechanical and electrical engineering, which mainly sells to the recession affected construction industry, increased orders but margins were affected. Mr Roy Hitchens, who joined as chief executive last month, said bad debts were not significant. The measurement division, which includes Salter, Weigh-Tronix and Chronos Richardson, was helped by an improvement in the US market. Interest costs fell to Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 700,000) due to low US interest rates. The company did not reveal its level of borrowings but Mr Kent did say gearing was 'in the low 20s' and would end the year 'in the mid 20s' compared with 12 per cent at its last year-end. Earnings fell to 6p (6.3p) while an unchanged dividend of 2.3p is declared. The shares, which have risen from 162p in July, fell 8p to 207p. COMMENT Staveley may be slightly disappointed that its upbeat presentation to analysts failed to lift the shares. Mounting order levels, and the company's apparent ability to weather recession in the construction industry, should have impressed. News that Germany must be nearly back to break-even was also promising. But analysts were caught off guard by a higher-than-expected rise in gearing. After the shares' recent rise, the market was probably also looking for a chance to take profits. Full-year forecasts of Pounds 25m put the shares on a p/e of 12.5, which does not look too demanding. But there are lingering concerns about the outlook for construction. And with new arrival Mr Hitchens still something of an unknown quantity, the shares could go sideways awhile yet.</p>

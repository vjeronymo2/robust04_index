			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 2 Jun Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] Having been informed on 1 June that the DPRK (North  Korea) could have layed sea mines off the east coast of that  country, the Defense Agency [DA] is trying to verify the  information and has begun collecting related details.    Information on the laying of sea mines was reported by the  U.S. ABC television network. According to DA officials  concerned, when a U.S. reconnaissance satellite witnessed North  Korea conducting launch tests for its "Silkworm" anti-ship  missile on 31 May, the satellite witnessed the presence of what  looked like mine-laying vessels within North Korea's territorial  waters off its east coast. The satellite also witnessed the  frequent flight of airplanes around the vessels. Consequently,  the possibility that sea mines have been laid was pointed out.    The DA said: "We cannot verify the information on the laying  of sea mines on our own. But, if it turns out to be true, then  we have no choice but to be gravely concerned." The agency is  thought to have obtained copies of satellite pictures of the  scene from U.S. military authorities and to be analyzing them at  present. The agency is also believed to be hurrying with  analysis of communications information collected from radar  sites.</p>

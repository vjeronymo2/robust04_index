			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE PUT ENGLISH ON BALL;  </P> <P> WORLD CUP: BELGIUM DOMINATES PLAY, BUT PLATT SCORES IN 119TH MINUTE FOR 1-0  VICTORY. CAMEROON NEXT IN QUARTERFINALS.  </P> <P> Just as Argentina stole a game from Brazil on Sunday in Turin, so England stole  one from Belgium here Tuesday night.  </P> <P> The final score showed the English winning, 1-0, on a goal by David Platt in  the next-to-last minute of overtime, but the winners were booed off the field  by many in the crowd of 34,520.  </P> <P> The reason was not hard to understand: Belgium played far more creative,  imaginative and positive soccer. Its attacking moves flowed, and it did not  resort to brute force, as England often did, when the pressure was on.  </P> <P> Belgian midfielder Vincenzo Scifo was clearly the best player on the field, but  Scifo is heading home today, and the English players will be traveling south to  Naples for what promises to be an intriguing quarterfinal clash with Cameroon  on Sunday.  </P> <P> English Coach Bobby Robson refused to admit, though, that his team was  second-best on this night.  </P> <P> "Belgium had a bit more of the play in the second half," he said. "But we were  always dangerous on the break. It was a very brave performance, with lots of  fighting spirit and quality."  </P> <P> That view was not widely held, but Belgian Coach Guy Thys, who led many of  these same players to a fourth-place finish in Mexico four years ago, was  gracious in defeat.  </P> <P> Asked if it might not be better to play an unimaginative, physical game and win  rather than an entertaining style and lose, Thys replied: "I think the winner  is always right (but) if the match had to be replayed, I'd do it the same way.  </P> <P> "We dominated for three-quarters of the match and hit the post (with shots)  twice. Luck was not with us today. It was one of the best of our matches, but  that's the way it goes."  </P> <P> Both teams were unlucky not to score in the regulation 90 minutes, and, until  Platt's game-winner, it looked as if the game might be decided on penalty  kicks.  </P> <P> But, in the 119th minute, Danish referee Peter Mikkelsen, who officiated well  throughout the game, awarded England a free kick directly in front of the goal  but about 40 yards out. Paul Gascoigne floated a high ball into the penalty  area and Platt, taking a swing at it before it hit the ground, was almost as  astonished as the Belgian goalkeeper to see the ball fly into the net.  </P> <P> Platt was immediately mobbed, while Gascoigne ran to the English bench and was  lifted off his feet.  </P> <P> The Belgians, meanwhile, were shattered. The game had no sooner restarted when  Mikkelsen blew the final whistle and their World Cup was over.  </P> <P> How different it might have been had Scifo's shot in the 49th minute been a  foot or so to the right instead of crashing into the left post -- just as Jan  Ceulemans' shot had done in the 15th minute. Other Belgian chances went just  wide or were saved by England's goalkeeper, Peter Shilton.  </P> <P> For its part, England was unlucky to have an apparent goal by winger John  Barnes disallowed in the 40th minute. Barnes took a pass from Gary Lineker and  drove the ball into the net, but Austrian linesman Helmuth Kohl ruled that  Barnes had been offside.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen the replay but my immediate thought was that it was a perfectly  good goal," Robson said.  </P> <P> Asked about Scifo's shot that hit the post, Robson said: "It was a remarkable  shot; he was desperately unlucky.  </P> <P> "We've earned a very good victory against a pretty solid team. I thought we  showed great ability and spirit. The team didn't die tonight. We're in the last  eight, with Cameroon to play.  </P> <P> "It's very cruel for Belgium. I know how Guy Thys feels."  </P> <P> History suggested that one team or the other would score before the final  whistle. Belgium had never been involved in a 0-0 tie in its 24 previous World  Cup matches.  </P> <P> Before the match, the coaches had sparred verbally, each playing a different  hand. Robson chose to praise Belgium, while Thys' strategy was to be blunt  about England's shortcomings.  </P> <P> "If the defense does its job, especially against Paul Gascoigne who is powerful  and fast, Scifo, Ceulemans and (Marc) Degryse will easily manage to slip  through the holes in the English defense," Thys had said.  </P> <P> "England holds no secrets for me; it plays a game that is pretty easy to  decipher and applies tactics that are certainly not inspired by the  imagination."  </P> <P> The quote might have spurred England, but Robson did not rise to the bait.  </P> <P> "Belgium is a marvelous team, with one top footballer more than us -- Vincenzo  Scifo," he said. "But it is also the team that plays football in the way most  like us."  </P> <P> Not the way the game was played Tuesday night, however. Then, Belgium was in a  class by itself. But, as Argentina had shown by beating a far superior Brazil,  1-0, on Sunday, it is not always the better team that wins.  </P> <P> The winner of Sunday's England-Cameroon game will play either West Germany or  Czechoslovakia in the semifinals in Milan on July 4.  </P></p>

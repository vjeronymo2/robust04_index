			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Hill Samuel to halve stake in Macquarie Bank in ADollars 53m sale HILL SAMUEL the UK merch-ant bank owned by TSB Group, will halve its stake in Macquarie Bank, the Australian financial services group, to 15 per cent in a deal worth almost ADollars 53m (Pounds 24m). The sell down, in line with an undertaking to the Australian government in 1985 when Macquarie was granted a banking licence, would involve 16.3m shares at ADollars 3.25 each. Macquarie plans to buy back 7.7m of the shares with the remaining 8.6m going to Australian institutions which have already expressed interest in the deal. The proposal is subject to approval by Macquarie shareholders but has already been the go ahead by the Reserve Bank After the deal Macquarie will no longer be classified in Australia as a foreign bank. Macquarie said Hill Samuel had confirmed its intention to retain a 15 per cent shareholding 'for the foreseeable future subject to price.' A Hill Samuel representative will join the Macquarie board. Mr David Clarke, executive chairman of Macquarie, said his bank's equity base of ADollars 300m exceeded present requirements or likely future needs, and the timing of the buy-back was appropriate. He said Macquarie's overall capital adequacy ratio at September 30 was 12.57 per cent, and would have reduced to 11.69 per cent had the buy-back been implemented at that date; the Tier I capital ratio would have been reduced to 9.62 per cent. These ratios compared with a Reserve Bank minimum requirement of 8 per cent adequacy overall and 4 per cent for Tier 1 capital.</p>

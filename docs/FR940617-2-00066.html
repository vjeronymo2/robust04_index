Most of the other tasks in this phase are also extensions of work previously begun by UPVG, such as information dissemination and PV market analysis. The techniques required for successful completion of the proposed tasks are available at UPVG and have already been demonstrated in the previous activities. Thus, the probability of success is high. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Quality of the Applicant's Personnel and Facilities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed efforts by UPVG do not require unique facilities or equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The team proposed by UPVG has significant experience in the development and deployment of PV systems, and should be capable of successfully implementing the proposed PV program. The team includes senior personnel from several different organizations, including private consultants with experience in utility projects, the Electric Power Research Institute, and several electric utilities. The UPVG Executive Director has significant experience in technology transfer and the management of associations since, in addition to UPVG, he also provides management and staff support to the Fuel Cell Commercialization Group, the National Hydrogen Association, and the Utility Biomass Energy Technology Association. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a UPVG Board of Directors was previously established to assist in management, financial, technical, and other issues. The Board is composed of personnel from member utilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> D. Appropriateness and Adequacy of the Proposed Budget <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate. A total of $1,209,000 will be required for the program, with $1,000,000 provided by DOE for the period of February 15, 1994 to March 31, 1995. Cost sharing will be provided by UPVG in the amount of $209,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The UPVG program represents a unique approach to achieving utility involvement with PV. The program has potential to result in near-term utility applications of PV technology and is consistent with DOE objectives. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Competition for the effort would have a significant adverse impact on the continuity and completion of the proposed activity. The UPVG is the only organization whose sole purpose is the advancement and development of cost-effective utility applications of PV. UPVG has established relationships with all the utility participants and has developed an understanding of the technical and management issues required for successful and timely accomplishment of program objectives. Therefore, recompetition would cause a time delay of numerous months in task completion and would require a significant duplication of costs to enable a new awardee to perform the proposed tasks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John W.

The statement asked for severe, deterrent punitive measures  against the aggressive Serbs and immediately lifting the siege  of the city of Sarajevo and all other Islamic cities in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It also urged supplying the Bosnians with  arms, equipment, food, and medicine, and allowing them to defend  themselves by lifting the arms embargo, if the international  forces do not immediately oppose the aggression against land,  man, and human values.    The statement asserted that the painful, brutal massacre  against Sarajevo by the shells of the Serbs, which killed or  injured hundreds of people and targeted defenseless civilians --  elderly, women, and children -- is a link in the brutal  aggression against innocent Muslims. The massacre took place  amid international silence and mere verbal decisions.</p>

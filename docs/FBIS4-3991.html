			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Wu Yi Briefs Hong Kong Businessmen on Results of </F> Her Visit to the United States, Is Optimistic About MFN Issue"]    [Text] Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation, who is paying an unofficial visit to Hong Kong,  briefed Hong Kong industrialists and businessmen yesterday (25  April) on the results of her visit to the United States. She  was optimistic about the most-favored-nation [MFN] issue, saying  that "no matter how Sino-American economic and trade relations  develop in the future, the Chinese Government will try every  possible means to maintain the prosperity and stability of the  Hong Kong economy."    Herbert Liang Hin--ying, president of the Chinese  Manufacturer's Association, gave a banquet for Wu Yi, PRC  minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, and her  party of six at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Central District  yesterday. Wu Yi also listened to their views on trade issues,  about which the attendees were concerned.    Wu Yi pointed out at the banquet that she had met U.S.  Government officials, Senators, Congressmen, and entrepreneurs  during her visit to the United States. U.S. Government  officials still stressed that a precondition for renewing  China's MFN status was to improve its human rights situation.  However, over 30 Senators, Congressmen, and entrepreneurs  unanimously extended their support for the unconditional renewal  of MFN. She said that during her visit to the United States,  she found that most of the Senators and Congressmen had changed  their stand on the issue of renewing China's MFN status, which  was largely attributed to the policy of inviting U.S. Senators  and Congressmen to visit China to observe the development  situation there personally. She stressed that to settle trade  problems between China and the United States, it is very  important to enhance understanding between the two countries in  all respects.    Wu Yi stressed that no matter how the MFN issue develops,  China will try every possible means to maintain Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability, because this is the Chinese  Government's paramount policy. She said: "After its return to  China in 1997, we believe that Hong Kong's economy will achieve  greater development than at present."    Wu Yi said: "MFN treatment is the most appropriate agreement  on developing trade relations reached between China and the  United States since the establishment of diplomatic relations,  as well as the foundation of economic and trade development  between our two countries. It has never been a favor bestowed  by one side on the other, but a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Hence, I hope that the United States can handle this issue  properly. It will be to the detriment of both China and the  United States if our two countries confront each other on the  issue of MFN treatment."    As far as the United States is concerned, 200,000 people  will  become unemployed if China's MFN treatment is revoked,  enterprises specializing in Sino-American trade will face severe  damage, the competitive power of U.S. commodities in the China  market will be greatly weakened, U.S. consumers will have to pay  $14 billion more to buy commodities to replace Chinese products,  and U.S. investment in China will be severely damaged. At  present, there are over 12,000 U.S.-invested projects in China,  and the total amount of investment agreements signed between the  two countries exceeds $14.4 billion, while over $5.2 billion of  capital has been invested.    Not long ago, Paul Cheng Ming-fun, chairman of the Hong Kong  General Chamber of Commerce, led a delegation to Washington to  lobby for the renewal of China's MFN treatment. He pointed out  at the banquet that there should not be any problem in renewing  China's MFN treatment this year, but whether or not renewal will  include conditions depends on the development of events.  Raymond Chien Kuo-fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of  Industries, also went to Washington to lobby for renewal. He  pointed out that after his visit to the United States, he felt  that the U.S. Government intends to separate human rights from  the MFN issue, but the key to the solution lies in how the U.S.  Government devises an appropriate justification.    Wu Yi said that Sino-American trade relations have always  made progress along with friction. She said that although the  two countries often squabbled with each other, Sino-American  trade has still grown at an annual rate of 20 percent over the  past few years. Hence, she believes that both sides will finally  reach an agreement and join hands with each other in economic  development and trade. However, she stressed that China would  not be afraid even if the United States, due to certain  political needs, confronted China on the MFN issue. She said:  "The door of China is open wide to the whole world. At  present, China has established economic and trade relations with  228 countries in the world, and we will unswervingly pursue the  line of reform and opening up. The sky will not fall even  without MFN."    During her visit to the United States, Wu Yi also conveyed  to  U.S. officials and concerned figures China's stand on its  reentry to the GATT. She pointed out that most of the 118 GATT  members supported the resumption of China's membership of the  GATT, but the United States had erected obstacles by saying that  it did not recognize China as a developing country.    Wu Yi said she could not accept the U.S. attitude of going  back on its word. She said that as far as the current economic  strength of China was concerned, it was unacceptable that China  was considered as a developed country in the GATT talks. She  said: "China has made a lot of efforts in applying to re-enter  the GATT, and the central leadership is very enthusiastic about  it, but we will not accept excessive demands at any cost."    Among those invited to attend yesterday's banquet were  Ulanmulun, deputy director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, Chen  Keqiang, director of the economic department of XINHUA Hong Kong  Branch, and Hong Kong industrialists and businessmen, such as  Sir Quo-wei Lee, Paul Cheng Ming-fun, Raymond Chien Kuo-fung,  Ngai Shiu-kit, Wu Man-han, Fang Heng, Lo Wing-chan, Yip  Hing-chung, Wong Ka-chit, Ding Hok-shou, Shao Yan-chung, Chau  Man, Yeung Sun-sai, Lo Man-sui, Luk Tsang-yong, and Ding Ng-shou.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARTOON MOONSHINE  </P> <P> I recently took my young son to see the Walt Disney movie, "The Rescuers," and  I was extremely disturbed by one aspect of it.  </P> <P> A character in the film (whose name I believe is Barnaby) is very attached to  his jug of moonshine. Barnaby repeatedly offers moonshine to characters who  have become tired or despondent. Each time he exhorts, "It'll make a new man of  ya!" or words to that effect. And each time the potion seems to have an  energizing effect.  </P> <P> Parents, schools, law enforcement, the government, children's television  programmers and others are struggling to teach our young that drugs are not the  answer to problems. I am at a loss for words to express my anger,  disappointment and sorrow that a company such as Walt Disney Productions  apparently is not sensitive to the importance that its messages and images can  carry for young children.  </P> <P> GILA JONES  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

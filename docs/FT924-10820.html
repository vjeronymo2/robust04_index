			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Low margins, high returns: How the group made more money from level sales The most striking aspect of Marks and Spencer's interim results yesterday was its ability to raise profits on a static sales base. Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman and chief executive of Marks and Spencer, gave four reasons: Lower operating costs largely as a result of last year's redundancy programme. Substantial investments in information and operational systems resulting in higher staff productivity. Improved information systems giving the company better stock control, thereby reducing the number of goods to be sold cheaper in end-of-season sales. Emphasis on everyday low prices, generating consistent sales and helping to ensure that a 'dramatically higher' proportion of goods was sold at full price. These greater operating efficiencies have enabled M and S to hold, and in some cases reduce, the prices of its autumn clothing range without sacrificing net profit. 'We are not conducting a once-and-for-all promotion. We intend to carry on with it. We can run the business on this new lower gross margin and continue to make a satisfactory profit,' Sir Richard said. However, although the company's 18 per cent share of the clothing market allows it to benefit from enormous economies of scale, it is not able to repeat the trick to the same extent in foods where it only has a 3.5 per cent market share and is coming under increasing pressure from highly aggressive competitors. 'We cannot compete with Sainsbury's and Tesco. We are nothing more than a large niche food retailer. Our foods business continues to be profitable and more than pays its way. But where we are dominant in prepared and high-quality fresh foods we are still doing very well,' Sir Richard said. M and S's results provoked a mixed response in the City. Ms Kimlan Cook, at County NatWest, said the company's share price had had a strong run over the past year and at a 45 per cent premium to the market was 'starting to look rather full'. 'Even quality has its price,' she said. However, Mr Quintin Price, retailing analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, said: 'I am amazed that the market has marked the shares down so far. In an incredibly hostile environment M and S has raised earnings per share by more than 20 per cent. It is a back-handed compliment that people expected more.'</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Setback for private claimants in the EU - Legal Briefs Private claims brought by individuals in the European Union cannot rely directly on EC directives where member states have not passed implementing legislation, the European Court of Justice has reaffirmed. In Faccini Dori v Recreb, the Court upheld the current position that only public sector employees can rely directly on EC directives where national legislation has yet to be passed. The case concerned a Miss Faccini Dori, of Milan, who cancelled a language course contract. She claimed protection under the EC's directive 85/577 concerning consumer rights over contracts. No legislation has been passed in Italy to implement this directive. The Court ruled that consumers such as Miss Dori could not rely on directives, but added that, in the application of national laws, these have to be interpreted in the light of the directives. However, the court also reaffirmed the principle established in 'Francovich' that individuals could seek damages from national governments for breaches of a state's obligations. The case had been watched by UK employment lawyers concerned that, had the Court supported Miss Dori's application, it could have prompted changes in employment law where implementing legislation differs from directives.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Former chief executive sues NFC for Pounds 1.3m Mr Peter Sherlock, former chief executive of NFC, the transport and logistics group, is suing the company for Pounds 1.3m compensation for loss of office. Mr Sherlock left the group in August after only 18 months in the job, apparently because of a clash of management style with the 'old guard' of management. He was on a three-year rolling contract which included a salary payment of Pounds 254,000 in 1993 and a pension contribution of Pounds 82,000. The claim for Pounds 1.3m is understood to be higher than he could have expected under his contract. NFC confirmed that it had received a writ from Mr Sherlock. This followed unsuccessful negotiations over the level of compensation and an offer which was rejected. Mr Sherlock was the first outsider to be brought into NFC at top management level. He instigated a strategic review, merging two of its largest subsidiaries and announcing plans to focus on more profitable lines of business. But investors were disappointed at the pace of change.</p>

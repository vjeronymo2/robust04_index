			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Expenditures on health care dropped in 1992 for the  first time in 30 years. Total spending on health care amounted  to 44.6 billion markkas, which was 200 million less than what  was spent in 1991.    Based on GNP, health care spending was 9.4 percent more than  the OECD average. The share for health care had grown because  GNP dropped in 1992 by 4 percent, and since GNP continued  dropping last year, the share for health care expenditures  apparently grew again in 1993. In 1991, the average for OECD  countries was 8 percent; the figure has not yet been calculated  for 1992.    Hospital care was cut most. The reason for this was  increased  outpatient care and reductions in capacity. There was also a  drop in the number of health care workers. Seventy percent of  inpatient costs go for personnel items.    Forty-four percent of health care costs, or 19.5 billion  markkas, went for inpatient care, and 15.6 billion on outpatient  care. A total of 4.8 billion was spent on medicines, and 2.14  billion was paid out through the health insurance scheme as  medicine reimbursements.    Investments in health care dropped by 20 percent.    The state paid 35 percent of health care costs,  municipalities 33 percent, and 11 percent by the National  Pension System. Households, or services users, paid only 17  percent.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Acquittal in LA beating trial TWO black men were yesterday convicted on some charges stemming from the beating of a white truck driver during last year's Los Angeles riots, but a jury acquitted one defendant of attempted murder and deadlocked on the same count against the other, Reuter reports from Los Angeles. As police mounted a show of force on the streets to prevent any violent reaction, Superior Court Judge John Ouderkirk ordered the jury to resume deliberations on unresolved charges. The most serious guilty verdict was against Damian Williams, 20, who was convicted of causing mayhem in the assault on Reginald Denny. But the jury were deadlocked on the attempted murder charge against him. Henry Watson, 29, was acquitted of attempted murder but found guilty on a count of assault. He was found guilty of the lesser crime of assaulting several other motorists but acquitted on robbery charges stemming from those attacks. The defendants were thus spared from being sentenced to life in prison, the mandatory sentence for attempted murder. 'We are elated that the jury came back and did not find guilt on the most serious charges,' said Mr Don Jackson, a spokesman for the defendants' families.</p>

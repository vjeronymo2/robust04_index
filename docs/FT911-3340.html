			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: ADT reveals Dollars 96m provisions against sold Sechura businesses ADT, the Bermuda-based car auction and security group, has made provisions of Dollars 95.7m (Pounds 56m), against businesses recently sold by Sechura, a Canadian former associated company in which Mr Michael Ashcroft, ADT's chairman and chief executive, has revealed an interest. In a footnote to its annual report, filed with the Stock Exchange yesterday, ADT revealed that last year Sechura disposed of a string of loss-making businesses, and reorganised its capital structure. As a result of that restructuring, ADT's former 47.8 per cent interest was eliminated. Consequent on Sechura's restructuring, said the annual report, and 'given the uncertainty with respect to the future value' of the businesses Sechura has disposed of, ADT recorded 'provisions totalling Dollars 95.7m against the carrying value of amounts owed by and investments made in these operating businesses'. The ADT report added: 'While the company may recover a portion of this sum, the amount and timing is uncertain.' The businesses Sechura disposed of had been sold to it by ADT in 1987. Documents issued in December 1990 as part of Sechura's restructuring said that Mr Michael Ashcroft and his wife, Susan, between them owned 29.1 per cent of voting shares in Sechura. Earlier this month Laidlaw, a Canadian waste management group which owns 28.4 per cent of ADT, sued the Bermuda-based group in a New York court, alleging that transactions between ADT and Sechura had led to an 'illusory profits stream' for ADT. The allegations were rejected by ADT, which threatened a counter-suit for defamation. Laidlaw withdrew its suit last week following an agreement that gives it four seats on the ADT board and ensures that outsiders outnumber executive directors there. Laidlaw insisted, however, that it had only withdrawn, not dropped, its case against ADT and said that investigations into its allegations would continue through an audit committee set up by the new independent directors. The ADT annual report makes no mention of Mr and Mrs Ashcroft's stake in Sechura, and says: 'There were no contracts of significance during or at the end of the year in which a director of the company is, or was, materially interested.' ADT shares closed 3p lower yesterday, at 86p. See Lex</p>

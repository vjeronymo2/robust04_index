The purpose of this cooperative agreement program is to promote the improvement of traffic safety for the public through the support of research studies designed to evaluate the biomechanical response of human surrogates to impact as a means of expanding the base of scientific knowledge in this field and to provide for the coordinated exchange of scientific information collected as a result of the studies conducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impact trauma research employs the principles of mechanics to discover the physical response and physiological results of impacts to the human body. Generally, the teams doing the research are comprised of individuals from different disciplines: engineering, physiology, medicine, biology, and anatomy. The team studies the physical response of the body to impact by measuring and recording engineering parameters defining the event, such as force, accelerations, displacements, surface contours, strains, pressure, etc., and observing the physiological consequences in terms of physical or functional alterations to the body.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the major research materials used to simulate injury to the living human is the human cadaver (hereinafter referred to as a human surrogate) exposed to impact and detailed response measurement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The focus of this cooperative research effort is the study of human surrogate response and injury to physical impacts simulating some significant aspect of automotive impact injury,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , head, neck, torso, or lower extremity injury produced in drivers and passengers, restrained by various safety devices and exposed to either a frontal, lateral, or rear impact. The specific objectives of this cooperative research effort are to: (1) Delineate the mechanism of injury, (2) develop functional relationships between the measurable engineering parameters and the extent and severity of injury, and (3) quantify the impact response of the body in such a way as to allow the development of mechanical analogs of the human body.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA Involvement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NHTSA, Biomechanics Division, will be involved in all activities undertaken as part of the cooperative agreement program and will:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Provide, on an as-needed basis, one professional staff person, to be designated as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), to participate in the planning and management of the cooperative agreement and coordinate activities between the organization and the NHTSA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Make available information and technical assistance from government sources, within available resources and as determined appropriate by the COTR;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Provide liaison with other government agencies and organizations as appropriate; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Stimulate the exchange of ideas and problems among cooperative agreement recipients, and, if appropriate, NHTSA contractors and other interested parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Involvement for Recipient of an Award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

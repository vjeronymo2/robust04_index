			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDEPENDENT OPPOSITION PARTIES FORMED IN YUGOSLAVIA  </P> <P> Two independent opposition parties Tuesday announced their formation in Serbia,  defying hard-line Communist policies in the largest Yugoslav republic.  </P> <P> Also Tuesday, the national Communist Party called for reconciliation between  Serbia and the reformist Slovenian republic. The party's ruling Politburo also  said the situation in the country is "characterized by strained ethnic  relations and tendencies toward the country's disintegration."  </P> <P> Thirteen prominent Belgrade intellectuals announced that they are forming the  Democratic Party, while a group within the official Serbian Socialist Youth  Organization is establishing the Movement for Democratic Renewal.  </P> <P> Serbia's Communist authorities, headed by President Slobodan Milosevic, have in  the past vehemently opposed introduction of Western-style political pluralism  in the southern republic.  </P> <P> Several independent political and human rights groups have been banned in  Serbia, and some of the activists are being prosecuted for taking part in the  groups' work.  </P> <P> Snezana Aleksic, an ideologist for Serbia's Communists, said Monday that the  formation of independent political parties will lead to the breakup of  Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> In contrast, the authorities in the northern republics of Slovenia and Croatia  have lent their support to the establishment of opposition parties that are to  take part in the first-ever multi-party elections early next year.  </P> <P> Croatia's Communist leadership, at its congress in Zagreb, for the first time  openly urged the establishment of a parliamentary democracy in Yugoslavia.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Guwahati, May 2--The Bodo Peoples' Party has finally  split. The president of the party, Mr Sansuma Khungur  Bwismutiary, has been removed.    The 75-member Central Working Committee elected at the  political conference of the All Bodo Students' Union at  Debergaon near Kokrajhar in last July has been dissolved.    Mr Prem Singh Brahma, general secretary and the chairman of  the Bodoland Autonomous Council has taken over the leadership of  the party at a special conference held at Tamulpur on April 30.    A new Central Working Committee was constituted and the  office bearers were named there. Expectedly, Mr Bwismutiary  challenged the validity of these steps.    He described the whole exercise as "a conspiracy" hatched by  the Assam Chief Minister, Mr Hiteswar Saikia, in collusion with  his agents in the Bodo movement.    According to sources, Mr Bwismutiary will continue to lead a  rival faction of the Bodo People's Party with the old guard, Mr  Rabiram Brahma, as general secretary.    However, his position has definitely weakened since he quit  the post of chairman of the BAC [expansion not given]. Mr  Bwismutiary's deputy, Mr Brahma, was elevated to the post of  chairman.    The power to distribute resources coupled with the backing  of  the Chief Minister, helped him win over support from unexpected  quarters.    The split in the leadership was expected to percolate in the  organizational spheres.</p>

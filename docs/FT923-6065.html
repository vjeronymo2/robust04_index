			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Yugoslavia - The Search for Peace: Minorities plan starts to run into opposition A PLAN by the London conference to tackle the crucial question of minorities in the former Yugoslavia yesterday ran into opposition from countries fearful that it might set a precedent for ethnic rights on their own territory. The difficulties were revealed when Ambassador Peter Hall, the EC's conference co-ordinator, submitted a memorandum to all participants. It spelled out the role of the Minorities Task Force (MTF), one of six special steering committees which will start work once this week's conference is over. The task force will try to establish a 'consistent approach' to minorities throughout the former Yugoslavia. In particular, it will look at the status of ethnic Albanian minorities in the Serb-controlled province of Kosovo, ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina, Moslems in Sandjak, and ethnic Albanians in Macedonia. However, Romanian Foreign Minister Adrian Nastase warned of any 'separate international law for Yugoslavia'. Arrangements might be proposed for the specific situation of Yugoslavia which were acceptable to all parties. Western diplomats said that Romania, as well as France, Spain, Russia and Turkey among others, are increasingly concerned that if a blueprint for ethnic minorities of the former Yugoslavia is agreed by the MTF, those principles could eventually be applied to other countries. 'Romania will never give the ethnic Hungarian minority special status, even though in parts of Transylvania, Hungarians are clearly in the majority. Instead, they will say ethnic minority rights come under the umbrella of human rights,' a UN diplomat said. 'It is not only Romania which is reluctant do tackle head on the problem of ethnic rights, which is one of the crucial elements of the Yugoslav problem. If we talk about special status for Corsica, Paris would block it, or minorities in Turkey, or Bratislava (the capital of Slovakia) could block special status for the Ruthenes if they were in a majority in some region or other. 'These special committees will first have to agree among each other about the status of ethnic minorities in the former Yugoslavia because they know it will eventually affect their own countries. This is going to be a long haul.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Grozny [Groznyy] June 14 ITAR-TASS--The situation  remains tense in Chechnya, where several people were killed and  injured on Monday in fighting between police and an armed group  led by Ruslan Labazanov. The precise amount of victims from  both sides has not been reported. Practically none of the  political parties and movements in opposition to Dzhokhar  Dudayev claimed responsibility for the clash.    The Labazanov group has been acting openly on the territory  of Chechnya for nearly a year and declared in the official media  its claims to be regarded as a political party.    The location of the leader of the group who managed to  escape  on Monday with several of his supporters has not been identified  yet. The police admits the fact that he is now particularly  dangerous as a source and instigator of terror.    Russia's plenipotentiary envoy Schmidt Zablayev is expected  to arrive in Chechen capital on Tuesday where he will try to  re-establish dialogue between Moscow and Grozny, but few people  believe his mission will be effective.</p>

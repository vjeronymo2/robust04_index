			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mr. (Bel Lel), former secretary general of Ayanya  Two and a returnee from the ranks of the rebels, has condemend  Riak Machar's dismissal of Dr. Lam Akol, who is in charge of the  United faction of the rebel movement's foreign relations. (Lel)  stated that Akol was dismissed because of intensive pressure  brought to bear by foreign forces and the so-called alliance  against Lam Akol's opposition to a reunion with rebel Garang.  He pointed out that Machar was not empowered to dismiss Lam  Akol by himself. (Lel) attacked Garang, describing him as a  criminal and a double-crosser.    Machar and Akol had led the faction that split from Garang  in  August 1991. They formed the Nasir group, which fought in  fierce battles against Garang in some areas, with both sides  incurring heavy loses. The conflict then turned into mutual  retaliatory campaigns and attempts at tribal revenge, the last  of which took place last week when tribes from upper Nile and  Bahr al-Ghazal attacked a camp west of Nimule housing the  families of combatants of the Garang faction, many of whom fled  to Uganda.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Belgium vows to defend franc amid new ERM jitters BELGIUM said yesterday it would use 'all possible means' to defend its currency, as the Belgian franc was caught up in the latest bout of nervousness in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The Belgian National Bank raised its end-of-day interest rates - applied to primary dealers and banks' daily currency investments - from 8.8 per cent to 9.3 per cent to help protect the currency. The step helped the Belgian franc to strengthen within the ERM, after several days of weakness. Belgium's interest rate action, countering the recent trend of lower European credit costs, came as the German Bundesbank yesterday fractionally cut its money market rates. In its first money market operations since it cut the Lombard and discount rates last Thursday, the Bundesbank reduced its securities repurchase rate from 8.57-8.58 per cent to 8.50-8.51 per cent. The cut was smaller than expected after the Bundesbank cut the Lombard rate by 0.5 of a point and the discount rate by 0.25 of a point. In a move related to last week's heavy ERM intervention to support the Danish krone, Denmark's central bank yesterday borrowed Dollars 1bn in the international bond market to strengthen its foreign exchange reserves. Mr Niels Sorensen, a senior official at Denmark's National Bank, said the central bank's reserves had fallen considerably in February. 'When the speculation subsides, money usually flows back (into the krone), but since we are not sure when that will be, we thought it would be a good idea to do some borrowing,' Mr Sorensen said. In Brussels, Mr Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian central bank, said: 'I'm convinced that right now there is no speculation going on against the Belgian franc. 'It's true to say that the currency markets are very nervous, but whatever the nature of this nervousness one can't say that we (only) defend the Belgian franc when things are going smoothly.' Mr Verplaetse added that he was sure the French franc was 'a solid currency'. He said he could not envisage a situation in which the German and French central banks would collaborate to support the French franc and the D-Mark, leaving the Benelux currencies undefended. Analysts say the Belgian franc - one of the strongest ERM currencies during the last few months - is being hit by doubts about Belgium's slowing economy and growing budget deficit. It is also being affected by uncertainty about the political future of the country after Saturday's vote to transform Belgium into a federal state. Dealers believe the Belgian central bank last week widened slightly the narrow ERM band within which it has held the franc steady against the D-Mark since 1990.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Banking on a change in the climate: A wary optimism is taking hold at hard-hit US financial institutions - How US banks are coping in lean times The biggest US banks are slowly - though not yet very surely - moving away from the storm which only a few months ago threatened to engulf some of them. While earnings of most of the banks continued to slide in the first quarter, largely due to big jumps in loan write-offs and bad debt provisions, the reports published over the past week or two contain a few glimmers of light. Lower interest rates have pushed down funding costs, paving the way for wider lending margins. Citicorp, for instance, which reported a 70 per cent plunge in earnings, has seen its interest margin rise from 3.49 per cent in the third quarter of last year, to 3.5 per cent in the fourth and 3.67 per cent in the last three months. At the same time, capital ratios are generally improving and operating expenses are under better control than they have been for some time. Job cuts, consolidation of operations and disposal of unprofitable businesses have become the order of the day in the US banking industry. Concern over the banks is now centred on the quality of their assets. Non-performing loans and loan losses continue to spiral, reflecting fears about the world economy in general and the US property market in particular. Noting that city centre office vacancy rates are now double what they were in the early 1980s, Mr Tom Labrecque, Chase Manhattan chairman warned at the bank's annual meeting earlier this week that the property headache was likely to persist for between three to eight years, depending on the location. Mr Labrecque, said that Chase was not counting on any improvement in the market for the remainder of 1991. The bank has seen its non-accrual commercial property portfolio - those loans which are far in arrears - balloon from Dollars 884m (Pounds 496.6m) to Dollars 2.1bn in the past year. The banks with the largest property portfolios, especially those with a heavy exposure to undeveloped land, thus remain the most vulnerable. Atlanta-based CAS/Sovran, for instance, has seen its ratio of non-performing assets to total loans soar in the past year from 1.15 per cent to 3.25 per cent. The sharp rise is largely due to its heavy commitment to land and other property in the Washington DC area. The bank's first-quarter net income of Dollars 30.8m was less than a third of the figure a year ago. None the less, there is a bright side to the banks' swelling bad-debt portfolios. The first-quarter results contained few unpleasant surprises, which is a change from recent experience. In some cases, such as Chase Manhattan, where net write-offs in the latest quarter fell slightly on the previous three months, there were even some morsels of good news. Ms Helen Rowan, vice-president for finance and investor relations at the Florida-based Barnett Banks, predicts that the momentum of increase in non-performing loans will start to slow over the next few quarters. 'We're probably not far from the peak,' she says. This wary optimism is reflected in the lusty performance by US bank stocks over the past few months, as well as a willingness by investors to inject sizeable amounts of new capital into the industry. Citicorp's share price has zoomed up by more than 50 per cent since last October, and continued rising this week to Dollars 16 1/4 , even after its announcement of a 70 per cent plunge in first-quarter earnings. NCNB, the North Carolina-based bank, has seen its share price more than double from last year's low of Dollars 16 7/8 . Citicorp, Security Pacific and, most recently, Bank of Boston and Chase Manhattan are among the institutions which have tapped outside investors for new capital since the beginning of the year. The investors are demanding their pound of flesh, however, in the form of high yields. Barnett Banks offered a relatively generous yield of 9 per cent on its Dollars 100m cumulative convertible preferred share issue last month. Targets set by the Bank for International Settlements require banks to have Tier 1 capital - equity and retained earnings - equal to 4 per cent of assets and total capital equal to 8 per cent of assets by the end of 1992. Most of the big banks are likely to meet those goals with a combination of new share issues, retained earnings and shrinking assets. But regulators are firmly telling some of them that the BIS guidelines are only the minimum, and not necessarily the desirable, ratios. Observers see it as no accident that JP Morgan, one of the most strongly-capitalised banks with a total capital ratio of 10.3 per cent, was among the first to be allowed into the securities business. Conversely, a much weaker Florida bank withdrew a planned acquisition of a local savings and loan institution late last year, apparently under pressure from the regulators who would have had to approve the deal. The move to toughen capital requirements is not universally welcomed, however. Mr Robert Smith, chairman of Los Angeles-based Security Pacific, noted at his group's annual meeting this week that the largest US banks have roughly doubled their capital ratios in the past decade. They have also set aside reserves covering two-thirds of all non-performing assets. The problem, Mr Smith observed, is that 'if our leverage is reduced, our profitability is reduced. And our profitability determines the costs and availability of additional capital. It becomes a vicious circle, and the short-term solutions being applied now will not work in the long-term interests of the industry, its customers or the nation'.</p>

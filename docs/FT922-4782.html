			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Gencor unit to close gold mine GENGOLD, the gold arm of the Gencor group, is to cease underground operations at its West Rand Consolidated gold mine, in a move which will cost 1,100 workers their jobs. The announcement provides further evidence of the straitened circumstances of the local gold industry. For years profitability has been squeezed by escalating costs, while revenues have remained flat due to a weak gold price and firm rand/dollar exchange rate. Last year, Gengold announced the closure ofthe Stilfontein mine. A number of other marginal mines in the industry are threatened. The largest of these is Harmony, where up to 8,000 workers are threatened with retrenchment. The National Union of Mineworkers and Rand Mines, which manages Harmony, plan to ask the government next week for state aid for the mine. At current gold prices, about 12 per cent of South Africa's 600 tonnes per annum gold production is unprofitable. Approximately 15 per cent of the 400,000 miners in the industry work on these mines. Mr Gary Maude, managing director of Gengold, said everything possible had been done to keep the mine profitable. He said half the mine's skilled employees had been offered employment at other operations. During the life of the mine, to the end of 1991, it produced 614 tonnes of gold. Total pre-tax income was R202m (Dollars 71.4m), of which R65m was paid in taxes and R71m in dividends. Mr Maude said if the gold price recovered to make some of the reserves payable again, mining could be restarted.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Limelight strikes usually low profile When Sir Nicholas Lyell gives evidence to the Scott inquiry later this month, it will be the stiffest challenge so far in a testing year for the government's quintessentially patrician senior legal adviser. Appointed attorney-general after the last general election two years ago, the Mid Bedfordshire MP kept a pretty low profile until last February. Then the Maastricht soap opera intervened. His unexpected advice that the government could ratify Maastricht even if was defeated in parliament on the treaty's social chapter helped get ministers out of a fix - at the cost of the embarrassing admission that an interpretation by Foreign Office lawyers had been mistaken. It also thrust Sir Nicholas - who has spent 14 of his 15 years as an MP as a law officer or a law officer's assistant - into the limelight. In particular, the episode revived questions over whether it is any longer appropriate to have someone elected on a party label who is also on hand to provide crucial legal advice. Some four months later, his name hit the headlines again in connection with the Asil Nadir affair, which precipitated the resignation of Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister. This time, Sir Nicholas's task was to pour cold water over MPs excited by Mr Mates's extraordinary attack on the Serious Fraud Office - a role for which his calm, sometimes stilted, public demeanour made him ideally suited. His performance backfired in December, when he was forced to admit that one of Mr Mates's key allegations against the SFO was justified. The admission left him open to the charge that he had misled the Commons over the affair in his original statement. Sir Nicholas's present post is the culmination of a steady but unspectacular ascent beginning in 1979 with seven years as parliamentary private secretary to the attorney-general. Conspiracy theorists note that this period included Westland, the imbroglio which triggered the resignation from cabinet of Mr Michael Heseltine, his current tormentor. This is not the first time Sir Nicholas's resignation has been called for: in 1989, Lord Rawlinson, a former attorney-general, urged him to resign as solicitor-general over Lord Mackay's legal reforms. Though some feel he is acquiring an accident-prone reputation, Sir Nicholas  -a Lloyd's Name with membership of many syndicates - will probably react to this latest question mark over his career with customary sang froid.</p>

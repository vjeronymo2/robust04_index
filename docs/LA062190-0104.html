			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> SCOUTS TO ATTEND CAMP  </P> <P> Hollywood youngsters from low-income families will have a chance to attend  Scout camp for a week this summer as part of a program sponsored by the  Hollywood Sentinels Neighborhood Watch organization.  </P> <P> The Sentinels, a crime watch group since 1988, sponsor a local Boy Scout and  Girl Scout troop to provide area children with activities designed to keep them  out of trouble and away from gangs.  </P> <P> Both troops feature weekly meetings and monthly outings for all Scouts, who  come from the DeLongpre Park area.  </P> <P> This summer, the Sentinels have planned two outings for the Scouts. The Boy  Scouts will participate in a one-week session at the Los Angeles Council Boy  Scouts' Lake Arrowhead camps.  </P> <P> Also, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts will participate in a one-week excursion  to the Los Angeles Area Council's Cabrillo Beach Youth Waterfront Sports  Center.  </P> <P> To help offset the cost of sending children from low-income families, the  Sentinels are having a rummage sale Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. at  DeLongpre Park. From 1 to 2 p.m., the Los Angeles Jazz Society will present its  Jazz Caravan Concert Series.  </P> <P> For more information, call Fares Wehbe at (213) 465-6503 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  weekdays.  </P></p>

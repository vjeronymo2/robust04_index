			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Legislators hasten on healthcare bills Senate and House committees, spurred on by a tour of Capitol Hill by Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, yesterday scrambled to wrap up work on healthcare reform legislation before Congress goes into recess at the end of the week for the Independence Day holiday. Administration officials are no longer worrying about the details of the bills emerging from the five main committees with jurisdiction over healthcare; they just want the committee phase finished, so that they can move on to hammering out a bill on the floor of the two chambers. The labour committees in both House and Senate have marked up bills closely resembling the plan presented by President Bill Clinton. A third, Congressman John Dingell's House energy and commerce committee, has given up trying to reach agreement. The House Ways and Means Committee, which holds sway over taxation and is thus critically important to the financing mechanisms of any reform bill, is expected to produce its version with a final vote today. Congressman Sam Gibbons, who took over the chairmanship of Ways and Means after the indictment of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, has succeeded in holding together a Democratic majority on his committee, thanks in part to resentment at the Republicans' tactical decision to oppose everything. Mr Gibbons' bill would achieve Mr Clinton's goal of universal coverage by expanding the existing Medicare programme to cover the unemployed and employees of small businesses. It would also retain Mr Clinton's requirement that employers pay 80 per cent of their workers' insurance costs - the most controversial element of the reform and the issue on which Mr Dingell was unable to reach an agreement. That leaves the Senate finance committee which, as the last to mark up the bill, is seen as holding the key to the ultimate passage of the reform. The committee began detailed drafting yesterday on the basis of an outline produced by its chairman, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Mr Moynihan's draft would only require employers to pay for health insurance if other reforms to the insurance market failed to expand coverage to 96 per cent of the population over the next five years. Even that delayed mandate, however, is expected to be defeated when the committee votes. Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, was yesterday due to unveil his own modest reform proposal, in an effort to divert criticism of his party's lack of constructive involvement.</p>

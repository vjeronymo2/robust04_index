			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Optometry, a  traditional technique passed on from generation to generation in  China, now has become an applied major subject in universities  here.    In co-operation with a Japanese vocational school, Tianjin  Medical University started its first optometry course in 1991,  and it is still the only one in China.    The course covers medical and optical knowledge, and  materials science.    Other subjects urgently needed as the Chinese economy  expands  have also entered the ivory tower, such as toy engineering,  fashion design, advertising, appraisal and marketing of jewelry,  indoor decoration and gardening.    Toy engineering is offered by the Tianjin Light Industry  Institute. Associate Professor Wang Yuliang said that the  evolution of toys is closely linked with human progress and  scientific development.    Wang noted that the toy industry in China can only match the  1960s level of the advanced countries. At present, China  produces 7,000 kinds of toys, a fraction of the world total.    China now has more than 1,000 toy makers, but only one such  major in institutes of higher learning. So it is no wonder that  all students are snapped up every year upon graduation, Wang  said.</p>

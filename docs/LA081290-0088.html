			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REASONS FOR RECALL  </P> <P> The alleged effort to "recall" Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt because of her vote  on redistricting is a lame excuse for big-money development interests to  attempt to discredit a woman who has taken a brilliant leadership role on the  council.  </P> <P> Linda Bernhardt has challenged and rankled the pro-growth, anti-environmental  members of the council.  </P> <P> She has worked tirelessly to visualize and introduce proposals to better manage  growth in this city, and she has been a staunch defender of environmental  protection. The wealthy special interests don't like the fact that she was  elected, or that she has become an effective leader.  </P> <P> If there are any "community leaders" who are supposedly organizing a recall (it  looks to me like a well-financed effort by builders and pro-growth political  consultants), they should understand that they are lining up with  anti-environmental bigwigs who are miffed because they can't control the  council as they have in the past.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the redistricting issue is a deception not just to attack Linda  Bernhardt, but the first salvo in a crusade by the megabucks developers against  district elections. I appeal to the voters in the 5th District NOT to sign  petitions against Linda Bernhardt.  </P> <P> JIM JACOBSON  </P> <P> Director  </P> <P> Alliance for Survival  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

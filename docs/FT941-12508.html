			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow hits fresh high on inflation cheer Wall Street A tame reading on fourth-quarter inflation pushed US stocks further into uncharted territory yesterday, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19.13 ahead at 3,945.43, well above the short-lived record of 3,926.30 set the previous session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 improved 1.65 at 478.70. In secondary markets, the American SE composite was 1.36 better at 483.22, and the Nasdaq composite added 3.65 to 796.53. NYSE activity was heavy, with 314m shares exchanged. Advances led declines, 1,300 to 756. After a surprising rally in bond prices the previous session, stocks were poised for their fourth record-breaking Friday in a row. Investors were not disappointed, as the Dow blue-chip barometer opened more than 25 points higher after the Commerce Department released its initial estimate for gross domestic product in the final three months of 1993. The data were better than expected on two counts. First, the economy expanded by a robust 5.9 per cent, higher than the consensus forecast of 5.2 per cent but not entirely surprising given recent statements by senior government officials. The most welcome news concerned inflation, with the price deflator inching up only 1.3 per cent, well below expectations of 2.5 per cent. In reaction, the long end of the US Treasury market, which is especially vulnerable to inflationary pressures, registered fresh gains. By midday, the benchmark 30-year note was up  21/32 to 100 1/2, and the yield dropped to 6.208 per cent. The prospect of lower interest rates helped bank issues in general. Bankers Trust, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 82 1/4, and JP Morgan, Dollars 3/4 ahead at Dollars 71 1/8, received an extra boost from SG Warburg, which upgraded the stocks. But it was Continental Bank that stood out from the rest of the sector. It jumped Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 34 1/2 after the announcement of its acquisition by BankAmerica for Dollars 1.9bn in cash and stock. BankAmerica, which said it would buy back Dollars 500m in its shares before completing the deal, dipped Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 45 3/8. The agreement lifted some regional banks, which are potential takeover targets. Wells Fargo climbed Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 138 7/8 and First Interstate Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 71 1/2. The week's stream of corporate earnings news slowed to a trickle yesterday. One of those reporting was Scientific-Atlanta, a supplier of satellite, cable television and data transmission equipment. It plunged Dollars 4 to Dollars 27 5/8 after the company revealed sharply lower net income and revenues. US Surgical was Dollars 1 5/8 higher at Dollars 31 1/4.</p>

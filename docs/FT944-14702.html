			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: ENI lifts pay-out English National Investment, which seeks dividend income from a portfolio of UK companies and property, announced increased interim distributions in both classes of its shares - the first rise since 1990. The payment for preferred ordinary shares is raised from 5p to 5.4p while the dividend on deferred ordinary shares is 2.95p (2.55p). Directors of the trust, part of the Henderson Touche Remnant stable, said they expect to pay at least a maintained final for the year. Net asset value, however, showed a marginal decline. At September 30, the value per preferred was 356.4p per share, down from 374.4p at the trust's March year-end and 364.8p at end-September 1993. The deferred shares had a value of 281.4p per share at September 30, against 299.4p and 289.8p respectively. Net revenue for the six month period improved to Pounds 292,000 (Pounds 265,000) resulting in earnings of 9.1p (8.4p) per preferred and 6.6p (5.9p) per deferred.</p>

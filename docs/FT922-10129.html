			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Books on CGT IS THERE a book which explains how to calculate capital gains? I have Inland Revenue booklet CGT 16, which does say how to deal with scrip or split issues. Ask your tax office for booklet CGT13 (1991) - the indexation allowance for quoted shares. Tolley's Capital Gains Tax may meet your needs: the 1991-92 edition costs Pounds 22.95. It is published by Tolley Publishing, 2 Addiscombe Rd, Croydon, CR9 5AF. Tel: 081-686-9141. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

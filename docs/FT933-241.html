			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Devaluation call undermines peso THE PHILIPPINE peso has dropped sharply on foreign exchange markets this week as government officials debate a devaluation of the currency. The peso rate against the US dollar has fallen by up to 9.2 per cent since the start of this week, or 21 per cent since January. Towards the close of banking hours yesterday, traders were quoting the Philippine currency at around 30.50 pesos to the US dollar. Bankers say that although economic fundamentals favour the peso, the drop has been induced by official debate on a call to allow the currency to fall to 35 pesos to the dollar. The proposal further calls for a second rate of 28 pesos per dollar to support imports of essential items such as crude oil. The call was submitted by Mr Edgardo Angara, the Senate president, at a recent economic summit of Philippine officials. He says a sharp depreciation in the peso rate would boost exports and 'restore the nation's international competitiveness'. The Senate head also proposed imposition of a 5 per cent surcharge on three sectors likely to benefit from such a devaluation: exporters, depositors in dollars, and Filipinos employed abroad. The levy, he said, would be used to fund power generation and reforestation projects, along with schemes (such as food subsidies and emergency loans) to cushion the inflationary effect of a devaluation among low-income groups. Even as officials of the Central Bank and of the House of Representatives, the other chamber in the bicameral legislature, dismissed the proposal, support for it came from leading economists. Mr Benjamin Diokno, former budget undersecretary and currently a professor at the University of the Philippines School of Economics, urged in a paper that a devaluation now could become an 'offensive tool' that could be used to restructure the economy. But he said a devaluation could only be effective if accompanied by improved tax collection, speedier privatisation of state assets, and a streamlining of the bureaucracy.</p>

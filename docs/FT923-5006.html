			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Unipart in manufacturing venture after 42% rise UNIPART, the manufacturer and distributor of motor vehicle components and accessories, increased pre-tax profit by 42 per cent from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 9.5m in the first half of 1992. The company is expanding its UK manufacturing operations through a joint venture with Beans Industries, a former Rover Group engineering subsidiary, in which it will hold an 80 per cent stake. Advanced Engineering Systems will supply machined components such as flywheels, axle housings and shafts to Toyota and Honda, the Japanese car makers. The venture will create about 100 jobs in the next two to three years. Mr John Neill, chief executive, said the group owed much of its 'growing strength' to its decision to invest in manufacturing in the UK. Moves by Japanese vehicle makers to establish a growing manufacturing presence meant that 'Britain was now one of the most attractive places in Europe for component makers to set up operations.' Despite 'very difficult and deeply depressed trading in the motor industry' Unipart increased turnover in the six months to Pounds 335m (Pounds 292m). Profit before interest rose to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 7.2m). The company said important improvements had been made in quality and productivity 'as a result of the new style of working, where trade unions no longer have any influence over working practices.' Unipart ended trade union recognition for its 4,000 workers in April. It said that quality circles, in which employees developed their own initiatives for improving efficiency, had saved the company more than Pounds 2m in the last 12 months. The company, formerly part of British Leyland, is 42 per cent owned by management and employees, 38 per cent by institutional investors and 20 per cent by Rover.</p>

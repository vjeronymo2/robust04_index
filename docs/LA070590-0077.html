			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S SURPRISE, SURPRISE FOR PARENTS OF TWIN BOYS;  </P> <P> BIRTHS: RITA AND BILL WILLIAMSON EXPECTED BIG BABIES, BUT ONE WEIGHED MORE THAN  11 POUNDS, THE OTHER MORE THAN 9 POUNDS.  </P> <P> Big babies run in the Williamson family. But nobody was prepared for twin boys  -- one 11 pounds, 8 ounces, the other, 9 pounds, 10 ounces -- least of all mom  Rita Williamson.  </P> <P> "I was all baby," said Rita Williamson, 27, who was resting Wednesday at the  Los Alamitos Hospital birthing center. "I'm kind of tired now, so I'm glad it's  over."  </P> <P> Craig Allen and Thomas Arthur were born Monday by Cesarean section. Craig, the  biggest, was first at 8:21 a.m. A minute later, little brother Thomas followed.  Both measured more than 21 inches.  </P> <P> "They're the largest twins the hospital has ever had," nursing supervisor  Josephine Vantrees said. "They were pretty enormous."  </P> <P> Twins usually average about six pounds. But the Williamson twins are bigger  than most single-birth babies, which average around seven pounds. A single  birth baby weighing more than nine pounds is considered large, Vantrees said.  </P> <P> The twins and mom will join their sister, Tanya, 2, and dad, Bill, at home in  Cerritos once Williamson recovers, which is expected to be within a few days.  </P> <P> Rita Williamson said she tried to stay cool during the past two months, despite  having to carry around 56 extra pounds. "I'm a pretty big woman to start with,"  she said, "but the babies added more around the tummy."  </P> <P> She said the hardest part of her pregnancy came during the wave of triple-digit  temperatures last month. She coped by wearing loose clothing, staying in  air-conditioned rooms and doing as little as possible. Even just walking seemed  like strenuous exercise.  </P> <P> The couple discovered that two very big boys were on the way Friday, when Rita  had an ultrasound test.  </P> <P> "We expected them to be little guys 'cause, you know, they're twins," said Bill  Williamson, a computer programmer. "But I guess we were more than lucky."  </P> <P> By delivery time, the Williamsons were "geared for big babies." Rita had had  some experience with an unusual birth -- Tanya had been 9 pounds, 12 ounces and  in the breech position.  </P> <P> "The two of them have already beaten me in a way," says Bill, who was 8 pounds,  7 ounces at birth. "They got me by a couple of ounces.  </P> <P> Bill already foresees a great future in football for his sons. Craig, the  bigger one, is going to be a linebacker, and Thomas, no small potato himself,  is going to be a lineman, he predicts.  </P> <P> "We're waiting for USC to call," Williamson quipped. "I bet they can take  crawlers for the next season."  </P></p>

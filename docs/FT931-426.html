			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Murdoch returns to favour in the Big Apple: The billionaire media owner's latest paperchase HOW times change. When Mr Rupert Murdoch last owned The New York Post from 1976 to 1988 he was vilified and lampooned as a peddler of smut. But over the past few days - as he has executed a rescue of The Post - Mr Murdoch has been getting a strikingly warmer reception in the Big Apple. In fact Mr Murdoch's News Corporation is being feted by everyone, from the paper's 700 long-suffering employees to New York Governor Mario Cuomo, a political opponent who nonetheless has worked tirelessly to pave the way for his return. So close to death is the bankrupt New York newspaper that even Senator Edward Kennedy - who in 1988 helped engineer legislation which forced Mr Murdoch to sell The Post because of his cross-ownership of both a local paper and television station - is now among those willing to look the other way. Mr Cuomo, Mr Kennedy and a handful of other influential Senators are supporting Mr Murdoch's request for a waiver of the Federal Communication Commission's cross-ownership rules because none of them wish to be blamed for letting the paper die. Yesterday, a bankruptcy judge approved the transfer of The Post from Mr Abe Hirschfeld, an eccentric local car parks magnate, to a subsidiary of News Corporation. . Mr Murdoch, having cut a deal with Mr Hirschfeld at the weekend, last night took control and was set to name an executive at his Fox Broadcasting television network as the new editor. The FCC will still have to rule on the waiver, and the deal would give Mr Murdoch control for 60 days while the application is formalised. But that is likely to be a technical detail. The real issue for Murdoch-watchers is why this Australian-born billionaire media owner should wish to bother himself with editorial headaches and almost certain losses at The Post, while he builds a global film, television, cable and print empire. The answer, according to close associates of Mr Murdoch, is not simply financial. As one knowledgeable adviser to Mr Murdoch put it: 'He loves it. He has printers' ink in his veins. And he has an ego too. He is savouring every minute of this, and he finds the prospect of jumping back into the fray of the New York newspaper world irresistible.' For a mere mortal the financial aspects of the detail do not look attractive. The paper has fewer advertisers and fewer readers than the other two tabloids - The Daily News and New York Newsday. In the dozen years he previously owned The Post it cost Mr Murdoch a total of Dollars 150m (Pounds 105m) in losses. Annual losses are now between Dollars 5m and Dollars 10m. Mr Murdoch's entry fee includes reimbursing Mr Hirschfeld about Dollars 3m, providing an estimated Dollars 8m to cover creditors and operating costs over the next 60 days and then covering the full-year deficit. That Mr Murdoch is an extremely shrewd businessman is not in doubt, but he is unlikely ever to make much money from The Post. He would, however, wield political clout by virtue of owning the paper. The only other plausible reason for owning The Post would be if it offered some synergies with the rest of the News Corp stable of holdings. About a third of the group's Dollars 10bn of 1992 revenues were in film and television, and it could be argued that The Post can push Fox television programmes or television can carry advertising for the paper. Mr Murdoch says he is spending about 50 per cent of his time on Fox right now, having taken a very hands-on role in Hollywood since the departure a year ago of Mr Barry Diller, the Fox chairman. In a recent conversation he sketched out a strategy in which the Fox film studio could generate products for both theatres and for showing on Fox television as well as on British Sky Broadcasting, the European satellite service that is 50 per cent owned by News Corp. Most Wall Street analysts say Mr Murdoch is among the world's media tycoons who best understand the coming integration of electronic and print media as what he calls 'distribution' vehicles. But that equation does not require ownership of The Post. The real logic behind this deal may be that moguls are also allowed to have fun.</p>

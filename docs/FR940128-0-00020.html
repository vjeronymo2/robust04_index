The title of part 266 is also changed from ``Incompetence'' to ``Representative Payment'' which better describes the contents of part 266. These revisions are being made to improve the administration of the Board's representative payee program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  January 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Secretary to the Board, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Thomas W. Sadler, Assistant General Counsel, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611 (312) 751&hyph;4513; TDD (312) 751&hyph;4701.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (45 U.S.C. 231  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ) provides a system of retirement and disability benefits for railroad employees, their spouses, children, and survivors who meet certain eligibility requirements under that Act. Section 12 of the Act (45 U.S.C. 231k) contains the same provisions as section 19 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, the predecessor of the present Act, regarding the competence of an annuitant and the Board's authority in cases where an annuitant is incompetent. Under these provisions, any claimant or annuitant is presumed to be competent until the Board receives written notice to the contrary. If a claimant or annuitant is incompetent, the Board may make payments to, or conduct transactions with, any legally appointed guardian on behalf of the claimant or annuitant. Furthermore, section 12(a) expressly authorizes the Board to make payments, or conduct transactions, directly with the claimant or annuitant, or with any other person on his or her behalf, even though he or she is an incompetent for whom a guardian is acting. The provisions of section 12 are applicable to benefits claimed or paid under any Act administered in whole or in part by the Board, including any claim for or payment of social security benefits administered by the Board pursuant to section 7(b)(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act (45 U.S.C. 231f(b)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There has been growing concern in the Congress to assure that surrogate decision making services, including representative-payee services, are provided in a uniform, high quality manner which maximizes the potential of every individual for self-reliance and independence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the Board is currently in the process of a comprehensive review, revision, and amendment of its regulations, part 266 is revised at this time to address concerns that adequate safeguards be provided where payment of an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act is made to a representative payee rather than directly to the annuitant. Thus, the revised part 266 expands, as well as revises, the present regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A brief summary of the disposition of the various section of the present part 266 under the proposed regulation is set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present &sect;266.1 simply sets forth the statutory provisions of section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) (45 U.S.C. 231k), and because of this redundancy, is removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present &sect;266.2 has been incorporated into &sect;266.1(b) of the revised regulation. The new &sect;266.1 sets forth an introduction, consisting of an explanation of representative payment and the law and policy used to determine whether to make representative payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present &sect;266.3 has been incorporated into &sect;266.3(a) of the revised regulation. The new &sect;266.3 sets forth information which the Board will consider in determining whether to make representative payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present &sect;266.4 has been redesignated as &sect;266.12. New &sect;266.4 sets forth what information the Board will use in selecting a representative payee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the present &sect;266.5 have been redesignated as &sect;266.2, and the term ``beneficiary'' has been removed and the term ``annuitant'' has been added in its place throughout the new part 266. New &sect;266.5 describes the order of preference the Board will generally use in selecting representative payees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present &sect;266.6 has been incorporated into the new &sect;266.9(a). The new &sect;266.9 sets forth general responsibilities of a representative payee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present &sect;&sect;266.7, 266.9, 266.10, and 266.11 have been revised and incorporated into a single section, &sect;266.10, which details how a representative payee is to use benefit payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present &sect;266.8, ``Conservation and investment of benefit payments,'' has been revised and incorporated into the new &sect;266.11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections &sect;&sect;266.6, 266.7, and 266.8 are new. Section 266.6 provides that a representative payee applicant must provide the Board with the information listed in &sect;266.4 and will generally be required to undergo a face-to-face interview with a field representative of the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section &sect;266.7 provides that the representative payee make an accounting to the Board for the use of benefits he or she  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives as payee and sets forth what information will satisfy the requirement of an accounting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section &sect;266.8 provides that an annuitant may challenge the appointment or selection of a representative payee. However, an individual who requests to be made a representative payee for an annuitant has no standing to challenge the Board's refusal to make the appointment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

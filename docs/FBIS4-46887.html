			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Vyacheslav Krygin, chief designer of the Design </F> Bureau imeni N.I. Kamov: "The Pilotless Ka-37"]    [Text] The idea of developing a pilotless helicopter began  at our design bureau in the early 1970's. Its use in various  sectors of the economy can be feasible and advantageous for  economic and ecological reasons. For example, for aerial  photography, the transmission and relay of television signals,  patrolling oil and gas pipelines, monitoring the radiation level  at nuclear power plants, and determining the pollution of  chemical enterprises. Recently, the equipment and methods for  using pilotless helicopters in agriculture were developed  effectively. Our Ka-37 was adapted to operate with a sprayer to  atomize small amounts of toxic chemicals. The tests conducted  showed that 50 kilograms is the optimum payload for this version.    The helicopter has the coaxial configuration which is  traditional for the KB [Design Bureau] imeni N.I. Kamov. As  applied to the pilotless version, it has a number of advantages  over the single-rotor configuration. Primarily because the  coaxial arrangement rules out a loss of power to the drive for  the tail rotor. This makes it possible to use full engine power  to develop thrust for the main rotor. In addition, the coaxial  arrangement makes it possible to build an aircraft with smaller  dimensions. And the airflow from the coaxial rotors ensures high  quality in the application of chemicals to agricultural crops.  Incidentally, the two-bladed main rotors, each 4.8 meters in  diameter, are made of light but very strong composition  materials.    The aircraft is controlled by commands from the autopilot.  This is done with the aid of electrical steering mechanisms  installed in the collective-pitch channels--for longitudinal,  lateral, and yaw control. The engines' throttle butterflies are  also controlled by an electrical steering mechanism.  Technically, the helicopter may be controlled by an operator  with a specially-equipped console on the ground. In this case, a  person controls the position of the helicopter visually or in  accordance with information displayed on the monitor of a  personal computer. In addition to flight control information,  the display shows certain parameters which indicate the  efficiency of the basic systems.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Basic Performance of the Helicopter                                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Normal takeoff mass, in kilograms     |250                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Payload, in kg                        |50                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Engine                                |two P-037 piston engines              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Horsepower                            |33                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Developer                             |Samara Engine Building KB             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maximum speed, in kilometers per hour |110                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Static ceiling, in meters             |1,000                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Flight endurance, in minutes          |45                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H8>  Structural Features </H8>   The helicopter's fuselage consists of three compartments;  electronic equipment is positioned in two of them, fore and aft,  and all the main units and systems are in the central  compartment. The central compartment is the principal  load-carrying member which accommodates internal loads. It  consists of two metal frames, a reinforced floor, nonremovable  side panels and removable upper panels. When the upper panels of  the central compartment are removed, the load-carrying unit,  which is assembled separately and consists of the gearbox and  two engines, may be installed in the helicopter. In order to  facilitate installation of this unit, the forward frame is  tilted to the front to increase space in the upper part of the  central compartment. The load-bearing floor was built as a  three-layer panel with a honeycomb filler and skin made of  composition material. There are two wide-diameter openings in  the floor for cooling air to reach the engine fans. Four  brackets for the gearbox mount are installed in the floor's  upper surface. Underneath four attachment points are installed  in the floor for the sprayer tank and the skid-type landing gear.    The aft compartment consists of a frame and the tail boom.  It  is attached with fittings and four bolts. A duralumin bulkhead  is attached to the frame which separates the hot compartment for  the power plant from the tail compartment. The tail boom has a  cone-shaped load-bearing skin made of fiber glass, reinforced  with metal diaphragms and a frame at the point where it is  attached. Fiber glass stringers have been glued to the cone  portion of the tail boom to provide the rigidity needed. There  are brackets in the tail compartment for installation of a radio  altimeter and the transmitter-receiver unit for the Doppler  sensor of slipping speed. The empennage, consisting of a fixed  stabilizer with an adjustable elevator and two fixed vertical  fins positioned at the end of the stabilizer, is attached to the  end of the tail boom. There is a small hatch in the lower part  of the tail boom through which the magnetic plug of the gearbox  can be inspected.  <H8>  The Power Plant </H8>   The power plant consists of two P-037 piston engines, the  gearbox, the gearbox mount, and the fuel system. The engine and  gearbox were developed at the Samara Engine Building Design  Bureau under the supervision of Chief Designer N. Trofimov. The  engines, gearbox, and gearbox mount form a single unit. The  gearbox is attached to the frame by seven bolts. Each engine is  installed directly on the gearbox by two studs and two bolts.    The piston engine is a two-cycle, two-cylinder engine with  cylinders in opposing configuration, carburetor mixing and  forced-air cooling. Air for cooling the hot parts of the engine  is supplied by a centrifugal fan installed on the crankshaft.  Air is taken from the fan for the needs of the helicopter's  systems and to cool the muffler. The torque is transmitted from  the other side of the crankshaft through a spring damper to the  intake for the main gearbox. The fuel-air mixture is transferred  from the carubretor to the manifold though a laminated-type pipe  and valve. Ignition of the combustible mixture in both cylinders  is produced by sparkplugs. Lubrication of all bearings is  provided by the combustible mixture.    The resonator-type muffler has three chambers to ensure  adequate efficiency. Air comes out of the muffler sufficiently  cooled and slowed down significantly, which substantially  reduces the overall noise level of the helicopter.    In order to warm the air in the carburetor when the  temperature of the outside air is not favorable, the engine is  equipped with an electric heater in the form of a gasket. It is  installed at the point where the carburetor is connected to the  branch pipe. Each engine is supplied with independent fuel  supply, ignition, and cooling systems. The carburetor, which is  the main unit in the fuel supply system, has a built-in  diaphragm pump. Fuel flows to the carburetors by gravity feed  through pipes from the tank. The welded 13-liter aluminum tank  is located above the engines in the upper part of the central  compartment. The tank rests on four supports and is attached to  them by tension clamps. The upper part of the tank has a filler  with a cap and measuring stick. The fuel glass is attached to  the gearbox mount by two bolts. It contains a sensor to indicate  the remaining emergency fuel. The fuel is drained through an  opened valve in the lower part of the glass.    The gearbox is designed to transfer power from the engine to  the two coaxial two-bladed main rotors, as well as to their  revolution sensors and the drives for oil pumps and brake  shafts. It consists of a casing containing geared wheels, two  clutches, and brakes for the main rotors.    The gearbox contains two-stage reduction gear. The first  cylindrical stage provides the cumulative power from the two  engines, and the second stage provides for distribution of power  in four flows to the two output shafts turning at identical  revolutions in different directions. For the engines to operate  steadily during startup and when idling, automatic clutches,  which also perform the functions of overriding clutches, are  installed in the gearbox. The clutch is a friction clutch of the  centrifugal type; it transmits torque to the main rotors when  the engine is idling. When one engine fails or its revolutions  are decreased, it is automatically disconnected from the  gearbox. The latter has an independent lubrication and cooling  system. Lubricant is provided by a pump for the gears and  bearings and is fed through them to the gearbox oil reservoir by  gravity. The oil reservoir is cooled by air from the axial-flow  fan (mounted on the oil reservoir shaft) through ducts inside  the gearbox. In low temperatures, the gearbox and its oil  reservoir are warmed before startup through a connecting pipe by  hot air from a ground-based source.  <H8>  The Lifting System </H8>   As already stated, the lifting system of the Ka-37  helicopter  is coaxial in configuration, with the blades attached flexibly  to the hubs of the upper and lower rotors. The aircraft does not  have the traditional horizontal, vertical, and axial hinges.  Their functions are performed by a flexible torsion bar made of  reglued rubber and composition material. Because it has no  lubrication points, this construction simplifies operation of  the lifting system and increases its reliability. The bodies of  the hubs are made of steel forgings and are linked by hinges  with the shafts of the upper and lower rotors of the gearbox. In  order to avoid whipping of the rotors during runup, centrifugal  limiters are installed on the output shafts of the gearbox.  These limiters prevent the hinges of the hubs from operating  when the rotors are turning at slow speed. The internal rings  of the wobble plates are installed on ball supports to reduce  the size of the column. The slide bars of the upper and lower  rotors make use of sliding bearings.    The blades of both main rotors are made entirely of  composition materials. Each blade is trapezoidal in shape; they  are manufactured in a special device with the shape of its  external surface. The mounting point of the blade is attached to  it by four bolts. The blade itself is connected with the  flexible hub by one special bolt. This makes it possible for one  individual to remove all the blades from the helicopter when  necessary within a few seconds and without the use of a tool. In  order to simplify construction, the antiflutter weight is  fastened to the outside of the blade.    The blades are controlled by four electrical devices. The  output shafts of these devices rotate in one direction or  another in accordance with electrical signals from the automatic  control system. Actuators for the longitudinal and lateral  control channel are positioned on the lower slide bar of the  main rotor column. But the actuator for collective pitch is  installed on the upper lid of the gearbox casing. The rotor  pitch is increased or reduced by shifting the slide bar up or  down on the gearbox shafts by the collective pitch mechanism.  The actuator for directional control is mounted on the lower  casing of the gearbox. This device increases or reduces the  pitch only on the upper rotor. At the same time, so that there  is no change in the helicopter's altitude, the autopilot gives  the command to reduce or increase collective pitch, maintaining  constant rotor thrust.    The actuator for engine control is located on the  load-bearing floor of the central compartment. The throttle  butterflies are opened or closed by a progressive-action device  with the thrust system. The main rotors' brake is controlled  through an electrical device installed on the first frame of the  central compartment.    The skid-type landing gear consists of two titanium springs  and two skids made of duralumin tubing. It is attached with  bolts to four points on the lower surface of the load-bearing  floor.    A sprayer is installed on the helicopter for agricultural  work involving chemical applications. It consists of a 50-liter  welded tank and a centrifugal pump with an electric motor, which  feeds the liquid through an overlapping valve to two booms with  nozzles. The tank is attached by tension clamps to points on the  lower part of the load-bearing floor in the central compartment.  The tank has a filler with a cap on the left. There is an  opening in its center through which an electric harness is  passed--to connect with the ground-based system for supplying  the helicopter on the parking ramp. The harness ends with a  contact-breaking electric plug and socket unit, which enables it  to be disconnected automatically from the ground-based source  when the helicopter takes off. Antennas for the automatic  control system are located on the lower part of the tank.    A 27-volt direct-current system provides electricity for the  helicopter's units and apparatus in flight. Its source is a  direct-current generator driven by the gearbox. Operation of the  ignition system for the two engines, the electrical pump, the  overlapping valve for the sprayer, and the automatic control  system depend on the on-board electrical supply. In addition to  the generator, a control and warning unit, an electrical filter,  a junction box, and engine ignition units are included in the  power supply. A secondary (reserve) source of power is provided  in the automatic control system for reliability.    The automatic control system (SAU) was developed by us  jointly with specialists from the "Kulon" firm (General Designer  A. Novoselov). Together with the radio link and the transmitting  and receiving unit on board, the automatic control system makes  it possible to provide for automated flight as well as with the  help of an operator through a control panel at some point on the  ground.    Pre-startup preparation of the helicopter begins by  connecting it to a ground-based power source. After starting the  engines manually and adjusting them from idle to low power, the  revolutions are stabilized and the automatic control system is  shifted to power from the on-board generator. The program  developed makes it possible to have the helicopter take off and  hover against the wind at an altitude of 3 meters, accelerate  and climb to the altitude needed for the path assigned, turn on  the course needed, arrive at the point assigned, and fly on a  standard path with the sprayer turned on. Upon completion of the  spraying, the electric pump is turned off and the helicopter  returns for a landing.    The entire cycle of flight may also be carried out under the  control of an operator through commands transmitted on the radio  link from the point on the ground. Flight control is either  visual or by means of the control panel display. Computers with  a unit of damping gyroscopes, sensors of angular accelerations,  a system of air warnings, barometric and radio altimeters, and a  Doppler sensor of slipping speed have been installed in the  helicopter.    The control panel consists of a working position for the  operator with levers for collective and cyclic pitch, as well as  pedals for directional control. Everything needed for the  pre-runup preparation of the helicopter's systems has been  provided for here. The system for displaying information is  based on the PC-AT-486 personal computer. The control panel is  equipped with a power supply and communications. Before takeoff,  the operator controls the helicopter by wire, and afterward by  radio link commands.    A little over a year ago (3 March 1993), the Ka-37 took off  on its first flight. Tests of this helicopter are now under way  at our base.    Taking into account the experience accumulated, we propose  that an entire family of pilotless helicopters for different  purposes be developed in the future. The possibility of  equipping them with engines of different power--both domestic  and foreign engines--is being examined. It would be interesting  to find out the opinion of GRAZHDANSKAYA AVIATSIYA readers and  specialists who operate aviation equipment regarding the  requirements for this kind of helicopter. We would appreciate  receiving all suggestions which make it possible to expand the  area of application of pilotless aircraft.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   Our address: Russia, 14007, Lyubertsy, Moscow Oblast, 8  March  Street, Building 8, the Kamov Firm.

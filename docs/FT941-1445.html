			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Whitewater hearings 'to begin by May' Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, yesterday predicted the US Congress could begin its investigation into the Whitewater affair by May 1. He foresaw separate hearings by both House and Senate. The prospect of congressional hearings was certain to be raised at last night's prime time televised press conference, which President Bill Clinton called to lay before a national audience his explanation of his past investments in Arkansas and the many offshoots from it. Polls yesterday indicated the Whitewater affair is eating into Mr Clinton's popularity rating. The Washington Post-ABC poll recorded a drop in approval to 47 per cent, 11 points below last month's levels. Other surveys have also shown an erosion in support to around 50 per cent. According to the poll, which surveyed 1,004 adults between last Friday and Tuesday, 47 per cent of Americans approve of Mr Clinton's handling of the presidency while 45 per cent disapprove and 7 per cent have no opinion. Most polls show a public generally unpersuaded that Whitewater entails serious wrongdoing on the part of the president or his wife. But each day seems to bring some new reported allegation or distracting event. Yesterday, for example, two senior White House aides, Mr George Stephanopoulos and Mr Bruce Lindsey, told a federal grand jury what they knew about meetings at which the state of regulatory investigations into a failed Arkansas savings and loan company were discussed. The White House has also been obliged to reassign internally one of its top lawyers, Mr William Kennedy, after it was revealed he had failed to pay social security taxes for a household employee. Mr Kennedy used to work for the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas, where Mrs Hillary Clinton was a partner. Some Republicans have demanded his dismissal.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Presidential election campaign address by Leonid Kuchma </F> from the Kiev studio -- live]    [Text] Esteemed electors. Every presidential candidate  toured virtually all the regions of Ukraine and had many  meetings with our electors. I was doing the same thing, which I  am going to tell you about, about something I am today, as they  say, deeply convinced of.    First. People want to have hope. They want to have hope in  the future. Unfortunately, they do not have it today. People  want to live so that there is order in the country and decency  in all the echelons of power. Today, this is unavailable.    And, second, which is most important, actually everybody  wants to live in an independent, sovereign and democratic  Ukraine. But what is needed for this? For this we must create  a strong economy. Because all issues dealing with science,  culture and spirituality can only be solved if a strong economy  is created.    If one looks today at every candidate's program, they are  virtually [word indistinct]; the difference is very slight. The  algorithms, as they say, of getting out of this protracted  crisis are virtually the same. And I am very glad that my views  one year ago and today are that the future way of our state  toward a strong economy lies through a single economic space  with all the republics of the former Soviet Union, including  Russia. And our relations with Russia should not be maintained  at the expense of our relations with other states.    In truth, our economy was developing in the former Soviet  Union as a single organism, and it is from there that we receive  virtually all our raw materials, and the markets for our goods  are, as a matter of fact, in Russia and other republics of the  former Soviet Union, and if we want to be civilized in the  world, among the civilized countries of the world, then, really,  our state should become a civilized bridge between the countries  of the West and the countries of the former Soviet Union,  between the latest Western technologies and what we have today.  Our economy today, as a matter of fact, cannot live in the  world economic space due to our technological backwardness.    Actually, the views of all the candidates have become more  or  less uniform from the point of view of solving the Crimea issue,  and from the point of view of the Black Sea Fleet and from the  point of view of bilingualism.    I would really like us to have a conversation today in terms  of concepts so that we would also have an opportunity to look at  these years of our [word indistinct], of our independence and,  really, to determine, at least strategically, the main thing --  the way our state develops. I am convinced that we are all  similar in respect to this.    Thank you. I am ready for cooperation.</p>

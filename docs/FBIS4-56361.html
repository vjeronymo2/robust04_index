			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Susana del Calvo from Pinar del Rio; from the </F> "Evening Information Review" newscast]    [Text] We toured Cuba's westernmost province, Pinar del  Rio, whose capital city has become the seat of the region's  International Labor Day festivities. The traditional joyful  spirit of the Cuban people was present at the parade staged by  thousands of workers, representing the many production sectors  of Pinar del Rio. The younger generations were also present at  this honorable function of the nation to reaffirm our  revolutionary conviction.    In an opening speech, Bernardo Oliva, secretary general of  the Pinar del Rio chapter of the Cuban Workers Federation, said  more than 40,000 people from Pinar del Rio were doing voluntary  agricultural work. Pinar del Rio has recently shown a certain  degree of improvement, as manufacturing increased by 26.2  percent and services grew by 35 percent in comparison with the  first quarter of 1993. Local industry, in accordance with the  current trend, has grown by more than 92 percent and the child  mortality rate has been lowered to 8.8 deaths per 1,000 live  births. The Pinar del Rio workers movement has donated more  than 1 million pesos in aid for financing of territorial  militias. This again demonstrates the Cuban workers'  determination to defend their achievements with their own blood,  if necessary.    The weather on this beautiful, tropical day was kind to the  men and women who marked International Labor Day on 30 April, so  they can follow the sessions of the National Assembly of the  People's Government on 1 May via the local radio and television  stations. Workers from other parts of the world also marched in  Pinar del Rio to celebrate their day with us today. One such  group is the U.S.-based Venceremos Brigade, which is working on  the tobacco harvest in protest of the embargo against our  country.    In conclusion, I would like to say the most significant  thing  here is the contagious, joyful spirit of the Pinar del Rio  workers as they celebrate 1 May.</p>

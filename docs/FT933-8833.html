			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / People: Rouse puts his toe in the water Michael Rouse, who has spent the past 20 years at the Water Research Centre (WRc), has been headhunted as the next boss of the Drinking Water Inspectorate for England and Wales. He succeeds Michael Healey, a Department of the Environment civil servant responsible for water quality in the run-up to water privatisation who became the first head when the inspectorate was created at the beginning of 1990. Healey is now retiring at the age of 60. Part of the DoE, the inspectorate, which has just 30 staff, monitors the quality of drinking water supplied by the privatised utilities - by audits rather than by independent testing - and can take enforcement action if legal requirements are not being met. A mechanical engineer by training, Rouse, 53, has been chief executive of the WRc since 1984, presiding over the 1989 staff buy-out of the centre, which is now a private company, owned 57 per cent by staff and 43 per cent by the water companies. He says he is attracted by the 'public service element' of his next job, as well as by 'the intellectual challenge' of influencing the debate in Brussels so that the EC as a whole comes out with realistic standards for water purity. Before joining the WRc in 1974, Rouse had been at British Gas, working on various aspects of high pressure pipelines when gas was first discovered in the North Sea. From pipelines, it was but a small step to an interest in water, he explains.</p>

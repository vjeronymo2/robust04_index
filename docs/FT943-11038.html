			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Commercial stations win more Radio 1 listeners Commercial radio is continuing to eat into the BBC's audiences and now accounts for 47.4 per cent of all radio listening in the UK. The latest figures announced yesterday by Rajar, the official audience research body for radio, compare with a share of 38.9 per cent for the commercial sector in the same quarter a year ago. The main factor in the change, apart from new commercial stations, has been the drop in the audience for Radio 1. In the quarter to June 19, average weekly listenership for the station fell to 12.2m compared with 15.6m a year ago. The loss of more than 3m listeners has followed the decision to 'reposition' Radio 1 and concentrate more on public-service aims. This has involved adding more speech, including poetry, drama, new comedy and current affairs to the pop music mix. At the same time commercial radio has attracted 2.9m new listeners - a 39 per cent swing to commercial radio in share of listening. Ms Liz Forgan, managing director of BBC network radio, yesterday noted Radio 1's 'progress towards stabilisation by the end of the year'. She added: 'We expect to see a continued slowdown in the rate of decline.' In the past three quarters the rate of loss of regular listeners has come down from 1.5m in the fourth quarter of last year to 880,000 in the quarter to June. Ms Forgan also warned yesterday that the competitive pressures for radio audiences will increase. The third national commercial station, Talk Radio UK, is due on air in February; five new regional stations will start broadcasting this autumn, and further commercial stations are planned. Between April and June gross advertising revenue for radio was Pounds 52.6m  -a year-on-year-growth of 23.1 per cent. Mr Douglas McArthur, chief executive of the Radio Advertising Bureau, which promotes commercial radio, said that radio, once scorned as the '2 per cent medium' had over the past year taken 4 per cent of all advertising. However, over the past 12 months the overall reach of radio - those listening at least at least once a week - dropped from 88 per cent to 87 per cent, and average listening hours also declined.</p>

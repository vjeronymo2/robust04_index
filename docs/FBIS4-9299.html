			<p>BFN     [Text] A communique by the government of republic of  Kosova states that an international summit on Bosnia, proposed  by Russian President Yeltsin and agreed upon by U.S. President  Clinton, must include the Kosova question. The communique  further states that peace can never be achieved in the Balkans  as long as the Serbian repression against 2 million Albanians of  Kosova is not stopped and the independence of the republic of  Kosova is not ensured. The government of the republic of Kosova  asks the United Nations, the United States, the European Union,  and Russia to earnestly include the question of Kosova in the  peace process.</p>

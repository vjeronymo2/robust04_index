			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: HK plan to ban kickbacks stirs up a hornets nest - Fund managers in Hong Kong are divided on cash commission rebates Hong Kong fund managers are putting the finishing touches to their submissions on an issue that has stirred up a hornets' nest: proposals to ban fund managers' from keeping cash commission rebates. The Security and Futures Commission (SFC), the watchdog for the colony's financial markets, circulated its proposals last month, prompted by developments overseas and domestic concern. It is believed that less than half of the colony's fund managers accept cash commission rebates - the portion of broker's commission which is sometimes refunded to the fund manager. The SFC says that in the US, UK and most continental European markets these rebates - or kickbacks - are effectively barred from winding up in managers' coffers; instead, they are channelled back to the fund to benefit investors. Jardine Fleming, the loudest dissenting voice and a recipient of rebates, disputes this, saying it is market practice instead of regulation which has dictated the end of rebates in the UK and Australia. Mr Chris Russell, director of Jardine Fleming Holdings, which has USDollars 4.5bn under management in Hong Kong authorised funds, quotes sections from the rulebook of the UK Investment Management Regulatory Organisation which, he says, show that rebates retained by fund managers in the UK - so long as they are disclosed - are not banned. 'Chapter 2 rule 1.6 talks about inducements, which are basically illegal,' he says. 'That chapter specifically excludes disclosed commissions from being an inducement. It is fair to say in that case, these things are generally allowed rather than disallowed so long as they are disclosed.' Jardine itself is in favour of fuller disclosure. For fund managers who receive rebates, the stakes involved in losing them are high. After canvassing portfolio managers, the SFC found certain managers receive rebates ranging from 25 per cent to well over 100 per cent of management fee revenues. Managers of units trusts who are authorised to retain cash commission rebates will usually receive a rebate of between 0.125 per cent and 0.25 per cent of the transaction value in cash and will be separately invoiced, by the broker, for a 0.50 per cent commission. Brokerage commission rates for institutional-size transactions in Hong Kong stocks usually range from 0.25 per cent to 0.50 per cent of transaction value. In contrast, unit trusts that do not accept cash rebates can usually negotiate in Hong Kong full-service brokerage rates from 0.25 per cent to 0.35 per cent of transaction value. According to a survey commissioned by the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association which boasts 42 fund management companies as full/overseas members, 65 per cent of respondents support the proposal to ban rebates while 21 per cent oppose it and 14 per cent are indifferent. There was more support for the SFC's related proposals, which advocate greater disclosure and stricter rules to govern the acceptance of 'soft dollar' benefits, goods or services received from brokers in return for business. News screens, software and research fall into this category. Fund houses hold differing standpoints on soft commission, but it is the rebate issue which has most sharply polarised the HKDollars 350bn (USDollars 45bn) industry (the value of funds managed in over 900 SFC authorised vehicles; however, the SFC reckons an additional HKDollars 1,000bn in other institutional portfolios is managed from Hong Kong). In the opposite corner from Jardine Fleming stands Fidelity Investments, which has more than USDollars 2bn in its Hong Kong authorised mutual funds. Fidelity is firmly opposed to these kickbacks. It argues that a fund manager who receives additional cash every time he trades suffers a conflict of interest since frequent buying and selling, or 'churning', raises his own monetary rewards. Moreover, brokers may not always be selected on the basis of his service, but the size of his commission, which is detrimental to the interests of the investor. While Fidelity can be accused of making a virtue out of necessity - being prohibited from retaining rebates in the majority of big markets where it operates - their argument is winning altogether more sympathy than that of Jardine Fleming. Brokers generally believe Jardine is whistling in the wind, and that the SFC will proceed to ban rebates. Jardine Fleming says if it were to take this route the SFC would build a stricter regime in Hong Kong than that which operates in the UK and Australia and jeopardise the colony's competitive edge.</p>

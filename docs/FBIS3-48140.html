Vice Finance  Minister Jiro Saito told a regular press meeting that it is the  common view that the package would be in place before the  summit, referring to early comments by Vice Trade Minister  Hideaki Kumano calling for the launching by the summit.    Saito brushed aside the income tax cut issue, saying, "it  will be decided by the economic problem forum" of the government  and coalition parties.    Noting that the third extra budget for fiscal 1993 and the  fiscal 1994 budget are to follow the package, Saito said he  hopes the political turmoil would subside to allow "various  measures as soon as possible."    Saito said the plunge in stock prices "stems from political  uncertainties and other factors." But he rejected any effects  from a possible delay in the economic package and budget.    "We have never mentioned a date to compile the budget," he  said, adding the package was not slated for release on the day  and the failure of the political reform bills to pass the upper  house of the Diet came only last Friday.    Economic Planning Agency head Manae Kubota also said the  implementation of economic stimulus measures by the government  may be delayed until next month due to political uncertainty.    Kubota told a news conference that parties in the ruling  coalition have already reached a broad agreement on the contents  of the economic package, except income tax cuts. The income tax  reduction, however, is an important pillar of the package and it  should not be excluded from the program, she said.    She said political reforms must be implemented at all costs  because the issue will be a major driving force for economic  recovery.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLDWELL UNIT GIVES GREY ITS AD BUSINESS  </P> <P> The soft real estate market has caused a Southland scramble among real estate  firms looking for new ad agencies.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, yet another change was made when Coldwell Banker Residential Real  Estate handed its $15-million annual ad business to the Los Angeles office of  Grey Advertising. BBDO/Los Angeles created ads for the Mission Viejo-based  Coldwell Banker until January when it parted with the firm.  </P> <P> But that was just the beginning of the ongoing real estate shuffle.  </P> <P> Coldwell Banker's Commercial Group switched agencies earlier this month,  handing its $5-million business to the Los Angeles office of Della Femina,  McNamee WCRS after J. Walter Thompson/Los Angeles resigned it. In mid-March,  Century 21 put its $30-million ad business up for review. Current agency  McCann-Erickson/Los Angeles is still among the contenders for the business.  </P> <P> As the real estate market continues to deteriorate nationally, ad executives  speculate that other real estate firms may eventually shift accounts too.  </P> <P> "When the business environment gets soft -- and I'm not just talking about real  estate -- people tend to look for new agencies," said Jack Roth, president of  the Los Angeles agency Admarketing.  </P> <P> "It's a dog-eat-dog world out there when it comes to real estate," said Sherri  Sprecher, national director of advertising for Coldwell Banker. "Grey gives us  our first opportunity to establish a marketing partnership." Beyond that, said  Lane Barnett, director of marketing at Coldwell Banker, the aim is to  "transcend good solid (creativity) and focus on increasing our business."  </P> <P> Coldwell Banker ranks as one of the nation's largest real estate firms, with  nearly 1,900 residential real estate offices in North America. The agency  declined a request to release sales figures.  </P> <P> For Grey Advertising's Los Angeles office, the win represents its first chance  to create and place ads for a major real estate client. "This is not a  shoot-from-the-hip reaction to a soft market," said Miles J. Turpin, chairman  of the western division of Grey Advertising. "It was careful, strategic  planning by the client."  </P> <P> Turpin, whose Los Angeles office now posts annual billings of about $208  million, said his office will probably hire about a dozen new employees to help  with the business.  </P> <P> "In a tough market, the guy with the best products and services will finish  first," said Turpin. "Coldwell Banker is well-positioned to do just that."  </P></p>

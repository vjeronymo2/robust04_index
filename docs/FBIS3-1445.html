			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan was present  this morning before the deputies at the National Assembly, where  he presented the guidelines for the government's economic  policy. Lazare Aka Saye has the details:    [Begin recording] [Saye] [passage omitted] The National  Assembly's second extraordinary session for 1994 began this  morning in Abidjan. The session was summoned by its speaker,  Charles Boza Donwahi, at President Henri Konan Bedie's request.  Three main items are among those on the agenda for the session:  A bill amending the 1993 budget bill, the 1994 general  operating budget bill, and the 1994 Special Investment and  Equipment Budget Bill. These three bills will be examined by  the institution's economic and financial commission on 24 March.  [passage omitted]    In his address, the speaker called on the government to  reflect and act pragmatically, taking into account the present  situation. According to him, the current situation is marked by,  among other things, the CFA franc devaluation, a thorough  revision of the tax system, rigorous management of state's  affairs as a good head of family, and a reduction in  unemployment through the reactivation of small- and medium-scale  enterprises. It is also marked by the insertion of youth into  the economy and the need to implement social measures to  alleviate the concerns of workers, households, and the neediest  in the social strata. These are the many real concerns to which  the prime minister responded this morning in his statement on  government economic policy for the years ahead. Let us listen  to him:    [Begin Duncan recording] I will not forget the support  brought by the National Assembly to the major economic and  financial reforms which I presented on behalf of the government  as minister in charge of economy, finance, and planning. By  passing the bills related to these reforms, the National  Assembly demonstrated its willingness to support our country's  recovery efforts. Once again, I thank it for its support. It  is in my capacity as prime minister and head of government that  I am making today's policy statement to the National Assembly.  On this occasion, I would once again like to say how honored I  feel in assuming this responsibility, which was entrusted to me  by President Henri Konan Bedie. It is under his highly  enlightened leadership that the government's action was  initiated, and it is already marking the country's life and  giving a new impetus to our national policy. The change in the  CFA franc exchange rate, the backup measures that have been  taken, and the signing of the treaty creating the West African  Economic and Monetary Union have deeply influenced our country's  economic environment.    The government has adopted guidelines for the policy it is  implementing, and I propose to explain the highlights of this  policy to the deputies who, in fact, represent our compatriots  at the National Assembly. Our policy is based on the  reinforcement of national cohesion through solidarity and  security, the continuation of a foreign policy whose uniqueness  lies in seeking solutions through dialogue, in the  implementation of a liberal economic policy which is resolutely  aimed at restoring balance and sound, lasting growth. Peace,  dialogue, fraternity, tolerance, solidarity, security, and  balanced, lasting growth are in short the watchwords of our  policy, the implementation of which I will strive to explain.    I will cover four sections concerning the consolidation of  our economic and financial situation. The first section deals  with our economic situation -- the change in the CFA franc  exchange rate and the restoration of our economy's  competitiveness, the restoration of public finance, the  regularization of payments for domestic and external debts, and  the resumption of investments. In order to make you understand  the true importance of such a substantial change, I would like  to briefly recall our past economic situation. What kind of  economic situation have we had in the past? After years of  progress, our economy, as each of us knows, was seriously  disrupted -- important reforms were initiated to correct the  situation. Cote d'Ivoire has been going through a difficult  economic situation since the end of the 1980's, for reasons  which are well known. Those reasons are: Deteriorating terms  of trade, unstable exchange and interest rates, and internal  management shortcomings which came to light after the economic  boom was over.    The economic crisis was marked by a halt in growth, a sharp  decline in state finances, dwindling revenues, a reduction in  remunerated employment, a fall in public and private investments  -- which accelerated the downward trend in economic activities  -- and our economy's lack of competitiveness. The imbalances in  our foreign accounts and in our state revenues prompted the  drawing up of adjustment programs aimed at putting an end to  this situation and correcting our structural shortcomings.  These programs, initiated as early as 1981, involved the  reorganization of the public sector, which underwent a shakeup;  and the capital budget, which was drastically reduced.  Unfortunately, as the world economic situation continued to  deteriorate, we were obliged to pursue and expand our adjustment  policy.    The program implemented in 1990 as part of the renovated  institutions strove to reinforce the adjustment measures already  taken and to widen the scope of reform. That program was  comprised of two aspects. The first one was the stabilization  of state revenues, which has almost been achieved as the budget,  which showed a 224-billion-CFA franc deficit in 1989, was  balanced in 1992. The second aspect comprised significant  structural reforms aimed at favoring the return of growth. This  is a very important element, because it enables our country to  benefit rapidly from the new exchange rate of the CFA franc,  coupled with comprehensive reforms in our economy and  institutions.    Let me mention rapidly the main programs which were  affected.  They are the energy program, whose management was reorganized to  create conditions for its development; the water system; the  financial sector, which restored the solvency of our banks, put  our insurance companies into order, and gave new impetus to the  Abidjan Stock Exchange. Other programs initiated include human  resources, which we are promoting by providing considerable  support for the rehabilitation of the health and education  sectors; the restoration of economic competitiveness, mainly on  the basis of market rather than controlled prices; the  liberalization of domestic and international trade; the easing  up of labor laws, the granting of a more flexible tax package  with a reduction from 50 to 35 percent in taxes on profit  margins; the extension of the scope of the value- added tax with  the abolition of taxes on services -- except those affecting  bank interests; and a reduction from 11.5 to 2.5 percent in 1993  in the taxes on salaries paid to Ivorian workers.    Under the 1994 draft budget, we are proposing that these  taxes be completely abolished. Also abolished are other taxes  such as the tourism development tax and a number of registration  fees. Our relentless efforts to harmonize the tariff system by  reducing the rates or streamlining docking duties has thus  specifically benefited the importation of inputs for agriculture  and textile industry, as well as for the chemical and metal  industries. All these tax measures represent a revenue loss of  more than 70 billion CFA francs, which demonstrates the  significant support given to the manufacturing sector, and the  sizable efforts required to offset the loss to state revenues.

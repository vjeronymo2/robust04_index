			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our commentator, Lidiya Padulina, suggests that we  should touch upon a theme which is very topical at the present  time -- relations between Russia and the Baltic countries.    [Padulina] It is not a secret that Russian-Baltic dialogue  is  difficult. This is how ambassador (Vasiliy Svirin), the head of  the Russian delegation, estimates negotiations with Estonia.    [Begin (Svirin) recording] It is difficult for me to speak  about the prospects of the negotiating process in 1994 because I  am a head of the state delegation of Russia at the negotiations  with the Republic of Estonia. The fact is that recently the  Estonian side has been aiming to protract the negotiating  process. Thus, a question is arising whether the Estonian  delegation is going to stop the negotiations. We have the basis  for such thoughts. On 17 November the Russian delegation made a  proposal to hold the next round of negotiations in Moscow in the  middle of December 1993. December is over but we have no answer  despite our reminders. Thus, at the Russian-Estonian  negotiations we have the same situation as at sport  competitions: The ball is in the court of the Estonian team; we  are waiting for its response. [end recording]    [Padulina] There is no such tension with Latvia as with  Estonia. But there are the same issues at the agenda of  negotiations. Ambassador (Aleksey Zotov) comments on them.    [Begin (Zotov) recording] The state delegation of Russia  believes that the main issues of the negotiating process with  Latvia are to complete the coordination of all documents which  will determine the legal basis for the withdrawal of Russian  troops. And the second series of problems is connected with the  protection of rights of the Russian-speaking population. The  Latvian leadership did not want to speak about this at our  negotiations. They explained this by the fact that they did not  have a law on the citizenship. Now this law has been introduced  and is under discussion. We would like to hope that the fate of  more than 1,000,000 Russian-speaking people who are permanent  residents in this country will be decided according to the  standards which Latvia has undertaken to respect when it joined  the United Nations and the Conference of Security and  Cooperation in Europe. [end recording]    [Padulina] As far as the most difficult question -- the  withdrawal of Russian troops -- is concerned, we managed to  reach agreement with Lithuania on this issue. Ambassador  (Viktor Isakov) comments on the priorities in the  Russian-Lithuanian relations now.    [Begin (Isakov) recording] I think that the negotiating  process with the Lithuanian republic is going on normally. We  have reached certain results. However, despite the signing of a  trade and economic agreement with the Lithuanian Republic and an  agreement on vehicle transport, our citizens and our  organizations still have some difficulties in Kaliningrad when  they cross Lithuanian territory. Because of this, the main  problem will be to elaborate and sign an agreement on mutual  visits and an agreement on transit which would replace  provisional rules which exist now. We hope that the  negotiations will be resumed in the near future. [end  recording]    [Padulina] I spoke with these three Russian diplomats on  telephone and asked them the same question: What do you expect  in the new year? And I received rather different answers. As a  whole they reflect the difficulties in relations between Russian  and the Baltic countries. But all the same, I believe that the  main reason is the accumulated estrangement and mistrust toward  each other. Will we be able to have normal inter-governmental  relations? In spite of everything the new year gives us such  hopes.</p>

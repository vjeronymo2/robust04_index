			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Hungary targets secret agents The Hungarian parliament yesterday voted to force secret police agents and informers to retire from public life, with the threat of exposure if they do not. The move is part of a 'justice' campaign by the right-wing government, designed to focus attention on the Socialists' past wrongdoings, ahead of elections on May 8. Mr Gyula Horn (left) the Socialist leader, has a commanding personal lead over Prime Minister Peter Boross in the opinion polls. However, Mr Horn served in the workers' militia that helped Soviet troops put down the 1956 uprising against communist rule. The new legislation targets members of this organisation as well as the secret police. The government has also begun arresting people accused of war crimes during the uprising and is to vet newspaper editors, believing the media to be 'dominated' by former communists.</p>

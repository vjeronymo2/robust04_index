			<p>BFN     [Text] Max van der Stoel, CSCE high commissioner for  minorities, has been visiting Ukraine since 31 May until 4 June.  The aim of his visit was to study the situation in the Republic  of Crimea, which took shape after its Supreme Council adopted a  decision on restoring the 6 May 1992 wording of the Crimean  constitution and also to work out recommendations concerning the  participation of the CSCE in its settlement.    During the visit, Mr. Max van der Stoel had meetings with  President Leonid Kravchuk, high-level officials of Ukraine and  Crimea, and representatives of public organizations. The high  commissioner highly assessed the balanced stand of Ukraine's  leadership, based exceptionally on the provisions of the  Constitution of Ukraine in its approaches to the solution of the  Crimean issue.    Max van der Stoel emphasized the necessity of abiding by the  fundamental principles of the CSCE, especially such principles  as ensuring territorial integrity and inviolability of borders  and also the necessity of the soonest possible settlement of the  situation on legal principles.    The issue on the situation that took shape as a result of  the  actions by the Crimean leadership and the possible promotion of  its solution on the part of CSCE is to be considered at a  sitting of the CSCE committee of Senior officials, which will  take place in Prague on 13-16 June.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 20 SAPA -- Land Affairs Minister  Derek Hanekom met President Nelson Mandela on Friday morning to  discuss the KwaZulu land deal that handed all tribal land in  KwaZulu to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini before the April  elections. Mr Hanekom said Mr Mandela had undertaken to raise  the matter with former President F W de Klerk on Monday.    Mr Hanekom said: "I am not in a position to confirm or deny  that we knew about this."    The WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN reported on Friday that the  Ingonyama [King's] Land Trust Act transferred KwaZulu tribal  land to the king in return for the Inkatha Freedom Party's  participation in the elections.    Senior officials of the Department of Regional and Land  Affairs told SAPA on Friday it was widely understood that the  land deal involving three million hectares was linked to a  constitutional settlement whose effect was to end the Inkatha  Freedom Party's elections boycott. One official who did not want  to be named said KwaZulu government officials made several  approaches to the department's legal advisers for assistance in  drawing up the legislation.    They had been refused on the grounds that the self-governing  territories drafted their own legislation for the final approval  of the state president.    However, their approaches eventually resulted in the  department's legal advisers going to Ulundi on April 21 to draw  up the law in conjunction with the KwaZulu government's legal  advisers.    The official said the impression he had gained was that the  deal had been decided in talks between Mr de Klerk, Mr Mandela  and IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi  several days earlier.    The law was passed by the KwaZulu legislative assembly on  April 22 and was approved by Mr de Klerk on April 25 when  Parliament sat to pass constitutional amendments whose effect  was to draw the IFP into the elections. The amendments conferred  greater powers on provincial structures and secured the position  of King Zwelithini in Natal/KwaZulu's executive structures.    The effect of the land legislation was to exempt KwaZulu  tribal land from the provision that all self-governing  territories' land was to become the property of central  government under the new constitution.    The WEEKLY MAIL reported that the deal took ANC chief  negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa and Mr Hanekom by surprise. The story  claimed the deal left little land for redistribution under the  new government's land redistribution policies.    In a statement, Mr Hanekom said he became aware of the land  deal only after enquiries by the media. It has been ascertained  that senior leaders of both the IFP and the ANC in Natal had no  knowledge of the passage of this act.    "The Ministry of Land Affairs is deeply concerned about this  issue and is at the moment investigating both the process that  led to the passage of this act as well as its legal  implications," he said.    He said any further information would be released as soon as  it became available.</p>

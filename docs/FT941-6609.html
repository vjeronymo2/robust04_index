			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Heseltine questions legal advice on arms-to-Iraq: Lyell defends position on immunity certificates Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday publicly questioned the legal advice given to ministers in the Matrix Churchill case. Mr Heseltine told the Scott arms for Iraq inquiry he had been offered contradictory advice by Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, on whether he should sign public immunity (PII) certificates preventing disclosure of Whitehall documents. Last night Sir Nicholas issued a short statement saying his advice on PII 'has remained consistent'. He is planning to give evidence to the Scott inquiry in three weeks time. Earlier Mr Heseltine told the Scott inquiry that he had signed a PII certificate extremely reluctantly, only after being advised by Sir Nicholas that it was his duty to do so. He had also been reassured that his concerns would be conveyed to the judge. But following the collapse of the Matrix Churchill trial, Mr Heseltine received further advice from Sir Nicholas that he was not duty-bound to sign a PII in cases where revealing documents 'might be essential to ensure a fair trial'. Mr Heseltine said he found the apparent contradiction 'incredible' given his strong reservations about not making documents available to the defence in the Matrix Churchill case. In the Matrix Churchill trial, counsel for the prosecution, Mr Alan Moses QC, made no reference to Mr Heseltine's worries and argued that the documents were not relevant to the defence. Mr Heseltine said he was in principle in favour of the need for confidentiality to preserve working relationships between officials and ministers and to protect intelligence services. But he had at first refused to sign a PII certificate in the Matrix Churchill case after a close examination of the documents involved. These showed links between the intelligence services and Matrix Churchill executives, and official approval of the export of machine tools to Iraq known to be of military use. The prosecution said the businessmen had lied to the government, and that the documents were not relevant to the defence even though they showed the executives exporting defence-related equipment with full government knowledge. Mr Heseltine said: 'It became apparent to me that if this series of events were known at any stage, I would have to become engaged in a process of non-communication. This I was not prepared to do.' He signed the PII certificate only after insisting it was phrased in such a way as to protect him from any allegation that he had been engaged in a cover-up. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'It is hard to see how the attorney-general can now survive. His role appears to have been to protect the government rather than the course of justice.' The inquiry was adjourned until tomorrow when evidence will be taken from Mr Gerald Hosker, Treasury solicitor.</p>

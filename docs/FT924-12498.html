			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Storehouse/Ikea Mr David Dworkin, chief executive of Storehouse, must have his fingers crossed. A deal to sell Habitat to Ikea would suit Storehouse nicely even though the company does not particularly need the cash. Selling the British and French chains at anything like the mooted Pounds 50m would easily fund closure of Habitat in the US, which lost Pounds 8m last year. And though the French business is profitable, the UK has long been a headache the company could live without. By the same token it is difficult to see what Ikea sees in Habitat. There are superficial similarities between the two chains, but they hide more than they reveal. Ikea's vast furniture barns contrast with Habitat's mix of high street and edge-of-town locations. The logistics of handling a pan-European chain with half a dozen UK outlets are also very different to managing some 70 Habitat stores. While the worst may be over at Habitat, this could be a deal which Ikea lives to regret. If a contract is signed, Mr Dworkin can concentrate on wringing profits out of Mothercare in the no-holds-barred manner which proved so successful at BhS. Better buying, distribution, pricing, layout, management and marketing would transform Mothercare's prospects. Yet with the shares on a multiple of 27 times this year's estimated earnings, plenty of recovery is already in the price. And investors may wonder how Marks and Spencer intends to respond to the revival of BhS.</p>

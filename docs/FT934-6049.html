			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Prospects of Volvo merger boosted by large shareholders The proposal to merge Volvo's car and truck operations with Renault of France was boosted yesterday when two large shareholders in the Swedish group announced their backing for the deal. The prospects for approval of the merger at a special shareholders meeting on December 7 were transformed by the decision by the Fourth Fund state pension fund, which with 7.5 per cent of Volvo's voting capital is the biggest shareholder after Renault, and the Folksam Insurance group, which holds 3.6 per cent of votes. The Fourth Fund's board said it would support the merger unless significant new information emerged to cause it to change its mind. 'I hope that this is a turning point,' said Mr Per Lo jdquist, head of investor relations at Volvo. Volvo hopes the decision will set a trend for other large shareholders. With secured support from Renault - which holds 10 per cent of Volvo - the Fourth Fund and Folksam, and further backing assured, Volvo can now depend on about 31 per cent of the votes. The 'no' camp, led by Aktiespararna, the small shareholders' association, and the Fifth Fund state pension fund, is certain of only about 10 per cent. Folksam, which three weeks ago was against the merger, said it was swayed by French government assurances that Renault would be privatised, if market conditions allow, by the end of next year and that a state golden share would not be used to dilute Volvo's 35 per cent share in the merged company. Both issues have been at the heart of Swedish criticism of the agreement. A key factor in both decisions yesterday was the acceptance that Volvo could not continue in the motor industry alone and had to deepen its alliance with Renault to survive. Volvo share price fluctuated wildly yesterday. The most-traded B share rose from SKr410 to SKr431 on early expections that the merger would be rejected, then closed at SKr407 on news of the Fourth Fund and Folksam decisions.

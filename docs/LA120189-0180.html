			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL-RIGHTS ACTIVISTS LOCK HORNS WITH HUNTERS AT PARTY  </P> <P> A black-tie banquet for big-game stalkers at the Four Seasons Hotel turned ugly  Thursday night when hunters ripped up a banner carried by animal-rights  activists and physically threw them out of the hotel.  </P> <P> A small scuffle ensued as some guests dressed in tuxedos threw their drinks on  some of the 11 animal-rights activists who had infiltrated the "Big Game Trophy  Banquet" to protest the killing of animals. The banquet is an annual event  hosted by the Roy E. Weatherby Foundation of South Gate.  </P> <P> No one was injured and no arrests were made, although police were summoned to  break up the disturbance at the ceremony, where Jack Youngblood, a former Los  Angeles Rams player, was scheduled to present awards.  </P> <P> Ava Park, founder of the Costa Mesa-based Orange County People for Animals,  said her members had carefully mapped out the hotel during the last week to  ensure access for the activists who had not made dinner reservations.  </P> <P> Making an entryway into the hotel through a side door, Park and other activists  quietly entered the banquet room undetected since they too wore tuxedos,  business suits and evening dresses.  </P> <P> With stuffed animals in the background, about five female activists held aloft  a banner declaring "Hunting -- Killing for the Fun of It."  </P> <P> Taken by surprise, about four hunters ran to the protesters and quickly ripped  up the sign.  </P> <P> Jack Carone, a member of Los Angeles-based Last Chance for Animals, sought to  present the group's own award -- that of "Coward of the Year Award." The award  stemmed from what the activists said was the killing of defenseless animals by  hunters with high-powered rifles and other technological advantages.  </P> <P> But a few more hunters surrounded Carone. As they ripped up the certificate, at  least two guests threw their drinks on him as he was shoved him out of the  hotel.  </P> <P> As the activists were jostled out of the hotel by guests and hotel security,  they yelled chants of "Cowards, Cowards!" at the hunters. Some of the hunters  responded by swearing and screaming at them to "get out." An unidentified guest  spat in the face of activist Mary McDonald-Lewis as she was led outside.  </P> <P> "Now I'm scarred for life," joked McDonald-Lewis a few minutes later. "Now I  have to go home and scour my face."  </P> <P> Newport Beach police who were summoned to the hotel told about four activists  that they should leave peacefully or face trespassing charges. The activists  opted to leave.  </P></p>

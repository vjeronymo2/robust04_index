			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Sony and Thames join bid for Channel 5 THAMES Television and Sony Pictures International have joined the Five TV consortium to bid for the Channel 5 licence. The agreement, about to be announced, means that there are now two powerful, potentially well funded groups competing for the new national channel capable of reaching about three quarters of the population. Last month TV-am, Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group and Time Warner, the world's largest media group, signed an agreement in principle to bid for the new channel. Last week another announced bidder, Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group, decided not to go ahead. In addition to Thames and Sony Pictures, the parent group of the Columbia and Tristar Hollywood studios, Canwest Global Communications, a Canadian-based international broadcaster, has signed heads of agreement to join Five TV. Canwest's interests include a stake in TV3, the new television channel in New Zealand. The Five TV consortium was founded by Mr Chris Rowley, a former IBA executive, Primetime the independent production and distribution group, and Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City TV in Toronto, who will be chief executive. The decision by Thames Television to take a stake in a Channel 5 bidder is a further sign of the company's desire to remain a broadcaster. The company, which was outbid in last year's competitive tenders for new ITV franchises, ceases to be an ITV broadcaster at the end of December. It has already announced the setting up of a satellite channel in a joint venture with the BBC. Thames is likely to take only a 15 per cent stake in Five TV, the maximum allowed to retain its independent producer status. Channel 5 will be an expensive project to get off the ground because the winner of the licence will have to pay for its own transmitters and the cost of retuning 3m video recorders, which will suffer interference from the Channel 5 signal.</p>

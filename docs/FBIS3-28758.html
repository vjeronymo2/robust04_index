			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 9 February commentary: "Impudent Outbursts </F> for Aggression"]    [Text] The Japanese reactionaries, who have adhered to the  hostile policy against our Republic, are openly revealing their  ambition for reaggression on the Korean peninsula. Ichiro  Ozawa, representative of the Japan Renewal Party, who is known  to be a behind-the-scenes coordinator of the Japanese coalition  government, raved in an interview with Japanese FUJI Television  on 6 February, which will serve as actual evidence. While  saying that our Republic might take military action, he stressed  that Japan should examine countermeasures to cope with an  emergency situation on the Korean peninsula.    In addition, he did not hesitate to utter outbursts  slandering our system. Ozawa's utterances are an impudent  challenge to our Republic's dignity and authority and a  dangerous aggressive outburst that betrays the heinous intention  of the Japanese reactionaries by playing the role of a shock  brigade for the imperialists in isolating and crushing our  socialism. In addition, his utterances are premeditated  strategic moves to find a pretext for reinforcement of the  Japanese Armed Forces, the conversion of Japan into a military  power, and the promotion of nuclear armament in particular.    Now, going against the global trends of disarmament and  detente since the Cold War collapsed, Japan has increased  military expenditures and has taken to the road to convert Japan  into a military power. The Japanese people raise their voices  against such a plan. The Japanese reactionaries, by kicking up  further clamorous commotions about our threat, are trying to  influence social opinion into supporting the conversion of Japan  into a military power and its nuclear armament.    Ozawa talked about our military action. This can be termed a  shock propaganda [chunggyok sonjon] to accomplish their purpose.  However clamorously Ozawa may make jargon about our threat, the  people who judge things correctly will not believe the jargon.    The Japanese moves to become a military power and attain  nuclear armament, in particular, give rise to the serious  apprehension of the Asian people and the people of the world.    Sam Nunn, chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Forces  Committee,  said that Japan can develop nuclear weapons at any moment. The  British paper, SUNDAY TIMES, reported that Japan might have  already produced atomic bombs. The world believes that Japan,  with its huge stockpile of plutonium, can become a nuclear power  in a short time, if it decides to.    Japan has already opened the way for dispatching troops  overseas. Japan is going to embark upon reinvasion of Asia, with  Korea as the first target. It is Ozawa who claimed that if a  war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, the Japanese  Self-Defense Forces should be sent there as a member of the UN  forces.    Ozawa's call for examining countermeasures to cope with the  event of an emergency on the Korean peninsula revealed Japan's  intention to complete preparations for aggression on Korea and  expedite the date of military action. Ozawa's outbursts are  graver, because the United States and the South Korean puppets  are babbling about our threat and strengthening the moves for a  northward invasion.    The Japanese reactionaries' belligerent utterances and  movements show that Japan has become a hotbed of dangerous  aggression and nuclear war. Thus the world people should  enhance vigilance against this. Our people will never allow  anyone to infringe upon the dignity and sovereignty of our  Republic and hurl mud at our socialism.    The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, mindful  that the conversion of Japan into a military power, its nuclear  armament, and a war of aggression would lead them to destruction.</p>

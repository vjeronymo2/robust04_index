			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Trade News: VW set for windfall after China ruling - Tony Walker on a freeze on new players in the market that will benefit the German car maker Mr Peter Loew, chief executive of Shanghai Volkswagen, China's largest manufacturer of passenger cars, wears the smile of a man who knows that he is on to a good thing. China's new automotive industry policy, which has been widely leaked to the Chinese press, specifies a freeze on new participants in vehicle assembly plants until 1996. This could hardly have provided a more satisfactory windfall for Volkswagen which is rapidly expanding its manufacturing and assembly facilities near Shanghai and at Changchun in northern China. 'The policy will give existing joint ventures time to improve their products and introduce new models to reach world standards,' Mr Loew said. He could have added that the moratorium will stretch Volkswagen's lead in the world's fastest-growing vehicle market. Demand is expected to soar in the next few years as more Chinese are able to afford their own cars. In 1993, China produced 234,000 passenger cars of a total 1.3m vehicles manufactured locally. By the year 2000 demand is expected to exceed 2m passenger cars with local production accounting for about 1.8m of the total, according to the Chinese plan. This figure presupposes a sevenfold increase in production of passenger vehicles by the turn of the century. Such growth would be impossible without the entry of additional foreign manufacturers. Shanghai Volkswagen, which was established in 1985 as a joint venture (VW has 50 per cent) with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, Bank of China and China National Automotive Industry Corporation, produced 100,000 Santanas (a variation of the Brazilian-designed Passat) in 1993. It plans to raise output to 150,000 a year by next year with a second car plant at Shanghai, due to be finished later this year. At the same time Volkswagen is increasing engine production to 150,000 at its Shanghai plant with plans for further expansion. It is also increasing capacity at its Changchun facility where it is in partnership with the First Auto Works, producing Audi 100s and Jetta cars. Combined production of the Audi and Jetta exceeded 30,000 last year. Output is expected to increase this year to more than 40,000 and in 1995 to 60,000. Mr Loew said Volkswagen, whose production of passenger cars accounts for about 60 per cent of China's total sedan output, hoped to be producing 600,000 vehicles in China by the year 2000, but this would require additional plants. In the past year Volkswagen achieved a breakthrough when it lifted local content in its Santanas to more than 80 per cent, thereby earning a reduction from 48 to 32 per cent in duties on imported items. Some 82.2 per cent of Santanas are now sourced locally and Mr Loew says Volkswagen has no plans to raise local content further at this stage since the company is now paying the lowest rate of duty on imported items; but there is scope for further increases in the 60 per cent local content of the Audis. Among the difficulties in raising local content levels has been an under-developed components industry. Volkswagen relies on some 160 local suppliers, but quality is a frequent problem. Mr Loew said he hoped there would be more competition in the components sector under the new policy. Beijing has also declared that attracting foreign investment in the components sector was a key element of its automotive policy and that companies wishing to assemble cars in China would first have to demonstrate their good faith by investing in the manufacture of components and spare parts. Japanese and US car companies, which have been comparatively slow to respond to the opportunities in China, are planning Chinese components ventures as a means of positioning themselves for the end of the moratorium on new participants in car manufacture and assembly. Mr Loew said that VW's equity had 'increased tremendously' since the company's initial investment of Yn350m (Pounds 26.7m). Shanghai Volkswagen repatriated profits last year for the first time, making a modest contribution to the balance sheet of its troubled parent. Mr Loew is confident that sales of the Santana, Audi and Jetta will continue to be buoyant. Volkswagen would seem to have reason to be quietly satisfied with its 1984 decision to proceed in China while its competitors were standing on the sidelines.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Chinese vehicle assembly joint ventures  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Marques          1993 output Shanghai Volkswagen           VW Santana           100,000 Beijing Jeep/Chrysler         Jeep/Cherokee         60,000 Tianjin Auto Works/Daihatsu   Charade/Minibus       50,000 First Auto Works Changchun    Audi 100/Jetta        30,000 Jin Bei, Shenyang             Toyota Minibus/       30,000 (Liaoning Province)           GM Light Truck Guangzhou Auto/Peugeot        Peugeot 504           20,000 Second Auto Works, Shiyan     Citroen ZX            13,000 (Hubei Province)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: South China Morning Post/FT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

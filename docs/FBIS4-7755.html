			<p>BFN     [Text] Representatives of the Israeli Knesset and the  Paramilitary and Security Committee of our Chamber of Deputies  had talks in Prague today on parliamentary control of  intelligence services.    According to the chairman of the Israeli committee, the  Knesset is informed every month about the activity of the  Israeli intelligence service Mossad. The guests were also  interested in the change of the structure of our Army. Chairman  of the Committee Vladimir Suman said about this, among other  things, that the reason for the existence of the Czech Army is  the uncertain development in the countries of the former USSR,  organized crime, and aggressive nationalism, especially on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia.</p>

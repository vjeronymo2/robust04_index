			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Joker in the pack for Labour's contest / A look at the impact union members not belonging to the party will have on the vote for John Smith's successor - Leadership Contest None of the postal workers questioned at London's Mount Pleasant sorting office yesterday knew it, but they are about to have the chance of electing the next leader of the Labour party. Their union - the Union of Communication Workers - is affiliated to Labour and its members who pay the political levy form part of the affiliated organisation section of the electoral college that contains a third of the votes. Only a few of the Mount Pleasant workers said they might vote if they received a ballot paper from the union. Most were indifferent to the suggestion. 'I doubt if one in 10 here will vote,' said one worker. Another said he would vote but was not interested in actually joining the Labour party. 'I like the idea of voting for the leader but I don't want to get involved in party politics.' He added: 'I will back John Prescott. He's a strong character. The Tories would blow Tony Blair away.' It has been estimated there are up to 4.5m levy-payers in the 30 trade unions affiliated to Labour who will be eligible to vote in the leadership election. The overwhelming majority are manual workers. But private opinion surveys carried out inside the unions suggest that while they may be instinctively Labour supporters and even prepared to give money to the party, they do not want to get involved in party activities. 'Our levy-payers are ordinary, decent people who think party political work is done by eccentrics, extremists and the lonely,' said one union official. Initially John Smith was sceptical as to whether it made sense to have such a large input of votes into the leadership election, almost entirely from people who did not belong to the Labour party. But Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, convinced him last year that it would provide Labour with a splendid opportunity to mobilise sympathisers to actually join the party. 'Our election would be like a US Democratic party primary,' enthused the converted Mr Smith. The logistics of the levy-payers' vote have not yet been finalised but union leaders estimate it could cost them as much as Pounds 1.35m. The unions are already holding postal ballots of their entire memberships this year as required by law to secure agreement for their political funds. This has to be kept as a separate exercise, not the least because having a political fund is not the same as being affiliated to the Labour party. With 21 unions not affiliated to Labour, about 1m political-fund contributors will not be involved in the leadership election. Labour's head office wants next Wednesday's National Executive Committee meeting to endorse guidelines for the leadership contest which encourage trade unions to delegate administration of the election to Unity Trust Bank's electoral services to ensure efficiency and minimise costs. The 30 unions involved will send out ballot papers (mostly by post, although workplace ballots are acceptable) to their levy-payers whose names and addresses they have at head office. Each will receive two papers. The first will ask whether he or she is a Labour party sympathiser. If the answer is yes, they can then fill in the second ballot paper on who they want to elect as party leader in order of preference. The completed ballot papers would then be returned to Unity Trust and a computer will be programmed to distribute them under the single transferable vote principle. One union official said: 'This is not going to be an election dominated by the trade union barons but by the media barons. The levy-payers are going to be swayed by what they read in the Daily Mirror or The Sun or what they see on television, not what John Edmonds or Bill Morris (TGWU general secretary) suggests they should do.' Some unions are hopeful that 25 per cent to 30 per cent of levy-payers will vote, drawing confidence from the political fund ballots. Privately many union activists say they want either Mr Prescott or Mr Gordon Brown as leader but they admit the outcome will be uncertain under the levy-paying vote. One thing is certain. The election is going to cost the trade unions a great deal of money without much of an obvious dividend.</p>

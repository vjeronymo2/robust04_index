			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT exemption on BES schemes I FIRST invested in Business Expansion Scheme companies in 1984/85 and have made further investments every year since. The earlier schemes were not exempt from taxes on dividends or capital gains. Can you tell me: (1) With effect from which tax year were these exemptions introduced; (2) With regard to those BES investments which are exempt from Capital Gains Tax, will it be possible to claim CGT relief again the loss suffered in the event of a company failing and being wound up, or in the event of the shares eventually being sold at a loss? (1) The exemption applies to shares issued after March 18 1986. (2) No. Section 149C of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979, as amended, (which is now being re-enacted as clause 150 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Bill) says: '(2) A gain or loss which accrues to an individual on the disposal of any shares issues after 18 March 1986 in respect of which relief has been given to him and not withdrawn shall not be a chargeable gain or allowable loss for the purpose of Capital Gains Tax.' No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

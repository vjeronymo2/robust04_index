			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bengali </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Pulling the United States"] </F>   [Text] There was a time when European rulers frequently  used to refer to the phrase "the white man's burden." Those  were the days of imperialism. By this burden they meant the  black people of Africa and Asia. These colonial rulers  considered themselves the guardian of the black people. It is  true that these blacks were a cause of anxiety for their white  masters. Although those days are gone, there is no reason to  heave a sigh of relief. At present, the two neighboring  countries in the Indian subcontinent, which have become engaged  in a dispute over the Kashmir issue, are willing to accept the  United States as a mediator to resolve the discord. This  reminds us of the bygone days of imperialism. Benazir Bhutto is  pulling one hand of President Clinton while the other is being  pulled by Narasimha Rao. This is a matter of great delight for  President Clinton as the United States wants to be the only  protector of the world. What consolation or satisfaction does  Islamabad or New Delhi gain by doing all this? What special  gains do they expect by calling upon the United States to  mediate their dispute? The finance committee chairman of the  U.S. Senate and former U.S. ambassador to India, Daniel Patrick  Moynihan, was told by Prime Minister Narasimha Rao that all  bilateral disputes between India and Pakistan should be resolved  in accordance with the Shimla Agreement. He also urged the  United States compel Pakistan to sit down for a dialogue to  resolve this issue. On the other hand, Pakistan is saying that  the situation in Kashmir is gradually becoming explosive. It  wants the United States to exert pressure upon India so that an  early settlement is reached on this issue.    It must be said that a big game is being played with the  Kashmir issue. If New Delhi wants to inform the world community  about the involvement of Pakistan in the militancy in Kashmir,  it should do this work properly and stop issuing contradictory  statements. Otherwise, this country will have to face a lot of  miseries. It should be admitted that Indian diplomacy has  failed to deal properly with the Kashmir issue and Pakistan is  taking advantage of this situation. Pakistan is using the  United Nations and the Islamic Conference Organization to  achieve their designs. It is also approaching anti-Indian  officials in the U.S. administration and pleading for the  protection of human rights in Kashmir. India has done the right  thing by rejecting the offer given by the Islamic Conference  Organization to mediate in this issue. As Jammu and Kashmir is  a state of India, the sovereignty of the country would have been  violated had India accepted this proposal. It should also be  realized by India that this is not the proper time to take a  stubborn attitude on this issue. India should soften its stand  and see whether the allegations of human rights violations is  true or not. It would be wise to soften the Indian stand under  international or U.S. pressure. There is nothing wrong in  saying that India will not accept the illegal demands and evil  designs of Pakistan. At the same time no one should be allowed  to think that the attitude of India is self-contradictory.  *</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: KOP slips as loan losses increase KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, has reported a group loss before taxes and provisions of FM626m (Dollars 116m) in the first four months as loan losses grew to FM933m. But the bank said it still intended to achieve its target this year of halving its FM3.7bn 1992 loss. The figures showed a sharp deterioration compared with the same period in 1992, when losses were FM527m. However, KOP said the results were not directly comparable because the 1992 figures did not include the acquisition late last year of STS-Bank and because the one third share of full-year loan losses then estimated at FM728m fell well short of the actual FM1.42bn. The estimated full loan loss figure for 1993 is FM2.8bn, compared with FM4.27bn in 1992. Mr Pertti Voutilainen, chairman, said the goal of cutting the 1992 overall loss in half this year was 'a demanding target, but our recent performance suggests that it is not beyond reach'. The portfolio of non-performing loans held by KOP grew to FM8.2bn at the end of April from FM7.1bn at the end of 1992 - in spite of the exclusion of FM2.8bn in non-performing loans in a STS-Bank unit for which the government has assumed 90 per cent of the risk. However, Mr Voutilainen said non-performing loans appeared to be reaching a plateau. 'The improvement in the bank's performance in the current year is based largely on this assumption,' he added.</p>

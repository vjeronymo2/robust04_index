Telephone 202&hyph;219&hyph;9174, Extension 109 (this is not a toll free number).  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OMB published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 39018) on August 27, 1992, requesting comments on proposed revisions to OMB Circular A&hyph;110. Interested parties were invited to submit comments. OMB received over 200 comments from Federal agencies, non-profit organizations, professional organizations and others. All comments were considered in developing this final revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 29, 1993, at 58 FR 62992, OMB published a notice containing its final revision to Circular A&hyph;110. In that publication, OMB presented a summary of the major comments, grouped by subject, and a response to each comment. Other changes were made to increase clarity and readability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Omitted from part 95 are requirements which DOL must meet pursuant to the Circular. Those requirements deal with the relationship between DOL and OMB and are not necessary to this rulemaking. OMB Circular A&hyph;110 gives Federal agencies the discretion to make these regulations applicable to grants and agreements awarded to commercial organizations, foreign governments, organizations under the jurisdiction of foreign governments, and international organizations. The Department of Labor has chosen to do so. As permitted by OMB Circular A&hyph;110, the Department has made a few changes to the language of the Circular to fit the particular circumstances of the DOL programs. The Department has added a definition of ``commercial organizations'' and revised the definition of ``program income'' for clarification purposes. The Department also has revised the language in &sect;95.25(e)(2), dealing with extensions, for editorial purposes. The Department has deleted the words ``at least'' from &sect;95.22(e)(2) to enhance administrative efficiency by limiting invoicing to once a month. Other minor editorial, technical, and clarifying changes are made as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Publication in Final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Labor has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that good cause exists for waiving public comment on this procedural amendment to the regulation because such comment is unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest. This finding is made because all executive agencies are required to follow OMB directives with respect to grants or assistance of property. See 41 U.S.C. &sect;405 (The Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has determined that good cause exists for waiving the customary requirement for delay in the effective date of a final rule for 30 days following its publication. Therefore, this rule shall be effective July 27, 1994. See 5 U.S.C. 553.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> D. Procedural Matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined by section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. Since this rule was not preceded by a proposed rule, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. See 5 U.S.C. 601(2). Further, the Department of Labor certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because it does not affect the amount of funds provided in the covered programs, but, rather, modifies and updates administrative and procedural requirements. The recordkeeping requirements in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, Approval Number 1225&hyph;0017.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

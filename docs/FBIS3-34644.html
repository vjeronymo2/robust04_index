Marzouki, who is an independent candidate in the presidential  elections and former chairman of the Tunisian League for the  Defense of Human Rights, was held for two hours at a police  station. Marzouki wanted to explain to reporters the reasons  for his presidential candidacy.    His candidacy needs sponsorship by 30 mayors or deputies.  With one single exception, all Tunisian mayors and deputies  belong to the Democratic Constitutional Assembly, the party in  power. This is why Marzouki wrote to President Ben Ali, who is  an official presidential candidate himself, to ask him to  intervene to help him overcome the legal obstacle that is  hindering his candidacy.</p>

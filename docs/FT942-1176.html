			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Part-time workers need to avoid benefits trap Sir, It Is encouraging to learn that the UK chancellor is investigating ideas for 'improving the workings of the labour market in a humane way' (Economic Viewpoint, June 23). May one therefore ask that he address head-on the fact that registered unemployed people are, in effect, excluded by the benefit system from the main growth sector in the economy: part-time working. Nowadays, many unemployed people say that they probably have a better chance of finding two part-time jobs, which together would offer an adequate overall income, than one full-time job. The problem is, however, that under the current rules they need to find both part-time jobs simultaneously if they are to be able to leave the register without falling straight into the 'benefit trap'. The best way of helping them avoid this would be to offer to pay the long-term unemployed a 'portfolio worker's allowance' for, say, a period of six months, once they have accepted one part-time job. This would give them a proper breathing space to find a second source of part-time income that fits comfortably alongside the first - or, maybe, persuade their employer to convert the part-time job into a full-time one. The idea is being piloted by Training and Enterprise Councils in Lincolnshire and south London, and the results are encouraging. To make a significant impact, however, there would need to be a national initiative, with national marketing to the unemployed. The idea of a portfolio worker's allowance is probably the best, and simplest, idea that has been developed for some years to help the long-term unemployed. It would also be cost-effective for the Treasury. If the chancellor adopted this idea, many thousands of unemployed adults could use it to gain access to real jobs.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Costa Rican President-Elect Jose Maria Figueres was  received yesterday at the presidential house by President Ramiro  de Leon Carpio. The two men held a private meeting before  attending a dinner hosted by the Guatemalan president.    The two presidents also held a news conference in the Maya  Room surrounded by their highest-ranking officials, including  the foreign, finance, and commerce ministers of the two  countries. Figueres announced his government's decision to  improve political, trade, and economic relations with Guatemala.    The visitor insisted on praising the peace process and  voicing his support for the process which, he said, is led by  President de Leon Carpio. He also said he respects Guatemala's  internal affairs.    He also talked about subjects of special interest -- such as  coffee, bananas, and exports to the European Union -- and the  challenge that the free trade agreement represents for Central  America. However, he said the most important thing at this  moment is the country's efforts to achieve peace, and he argued  that economic and social matters were useless without peace.    Figueres ended by referring to the possibility that Costa  Ricans will join the Central American Parliament, but he said he  respects those people in his country who oppose joining the  organization. He stressed that a debate on this issue is not  imperative at this time, only discussions about more urgent and  positive issues.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hewitt A provision for the reorganisation of its German operations and increased interest payments resulted in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.34m at Hewitt Group in the half-year to June 30. Continuing German losses prompted a review which resulted in a write-down of assets and other costs amounting to Pounds 2.02m. In addition, Hewitt's share of profits at Sphinx Technical came to Pounds 111,000 but after providing for Hewitt's Pounds 444,000 share of restructuring costs, a loss of Pounds 333,000 resulted. The manufacturer of industrial ceramics and refractories paid increased interest of Pounds 196,000 (Pounds 34,000). There is no interim dividend (1.5p) and the final will be considered in relation to the annual results. The share price yesterday fell 5p to 125p. Sales in the first half rose to Pounds 6.16m (Pounds 4.36m) and there was an operating profit of Pounds 168,000 (Pounds 273,000). Losses per share were 71.4p (6.4p earnings).</p>

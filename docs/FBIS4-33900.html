			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barbara Betancur on statements by Miguel Alfonso, </F> spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry; from the "Evening  Information Review" newscast; passages within quotation marks  recorded]    [Text] Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the Cuban Foreign  Ministry, reported on the letter Cuban President Fidel Castro  sent to Colombian President Cesar Gaviria.    [Alfonso] "He expressed our solidarity and said we share in  their sorrow at this sad and difficult moment that Central  America [as heard] is experiencing following the (?tragedy) in  Huila and Cauca. As you know, a series of tremors have rocked  that area and have resulted in heavy damage. In his letter, the  commander in chief expresses to President Gaviria our feelings  of fraternal understanding and adds that we share in their  sorrow. At the same time, he says the Cuban Government is ready  to send, at a moment's notice, an 18-person unit including  doctors and technicians who are trained in this type of  situation. The commander in chief has placed this unit at the  disposal of the Colombian authorities should they need it."    I must add that the Cuban Public Health Ministry has formed  the unit. Through its spokesman, the Cuban Foreign Ministry  also expressed its pleasure with the recent statements by  various international organizations regarding the lifting of the  U.S. blockade against Cuba. Miguel Alfonso spoke, in  particular, of Resolution 356 approved by the SELA [Latin  American Economic System] Council.    [Alfonso] "This resolution is significant because it is the  first time that SELA has approved a resolution directly  rejecting something. As you know, SELA is an economic  organization and all Latin American countries are members of  this organization which Cuba helped found in 1970. This  resolution, a copy of which you will receive shortly, not only  supports the recent resolution issued by the UN General Assembly  [UNGA] -- as you know, the UNGA approved its resolution in  November -- but it also strongly urges the United States to lift  the economic, commercial, and financial blockade on Cuba."    Likewise, Miguel Alfonso talked about the two paragraphs of  the final declaration issued by the Nonaligned Movement's [NAM]  ministerial meeting held in Cairo, Egypt.    [Alfonso] "Paragraph 161 strongly urges the expeditious and  efficient implementation of the resolution that was approved not  only in [words indistinct] but also in 1992 by the UNGA  regarding the U.S. blockade of Cuba.    ``There is another paragraph [words indistinct] in which the  NAM foreign ministers call on the developed countries to put an  end to the generic implementation of all the unilateral coercive  measures against developing countries.    ``I believe it is important we view this within a single  context. These are not isolated things. The Cuban Foreign  Ministry has observed that the international community is more  frequently repudiating this measure which for more than 30 years  has been affecting not only the economy but also the human  rights of the Cuban people.''    Alfonso also talked about the various lobbying actions  conducted on Thursday by several U.S. congressmen, academicians,  politicians, and members of nongovernmental organizations in  favor of the lifting of the blockade.    [Alfonso] "I believe that the most important of these  actions  was the discussion of Cuba held in the U.S. Congress, specially  in the U.S. Senate amphitheater. They talked about the  situation the blockade creates for Cuba. The people who  organized the day for lobbying in the United States had planned  to hold approximately 35 meetings with U.S. congressmen,  senators and members of the House of Representatives, to explain  to them the impact the blockade has on Cuba and the need to  adopt legislative and other measures to ensure that the blockade  becomes something of the past."    In responding to several questions asked by reporters,  Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, talked  about recent statements made by the Honduran foreign minister,  which were favorable for Cuba.    [Alfonso] "We have been seeing a series of reactions lately  and it has become evident that it is no longer true that Cuba is  isolated or that it is a country that cannot muster support and  understanding from other countries. These reactions are coming  not only from countries in the area, but from outside the  continent as well."    Alfonso was also asked to appraise the meaning of the  possibility that the Canadian Government will lift its embargo  on Cuba.    [Alfonso] "We have learned that the Canadian Government will  formally announce it will renew the aid it stopped a few years  ago. This is significant because Cuba is confronting an  economic situation and it does not take a genius to see that it  is a difficult economic situation. This decision will  contribute to improving the standard of living of the Cuban  people. All aid to Cuba is very welcome."    These were some of the statements made by Miguel Alfonso,  spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, during a meeting with  the local and foreign media.</p>

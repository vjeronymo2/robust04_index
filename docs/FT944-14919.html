			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (4): Trading approaches - Creating a UK spot market The prospect of almost half of the UK's daily gas supply requirements being turned over on a traded market or even the introduction of a gas futures contract is still some way from reality in Britain. But this is just what happened in the US where gas supply was deregulated just over 10 years ago. Now, shippers are confident they can turn to a well-established spot market for daily sales and purchases. Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, is keen to see the creation of an efficient spot market in the UK to assist the development of competition when British Gas's monopoly over household supply is abolished in 1996. Earlier this month , the regulator published a discussion document on a spot market, calling for views from the industry by early November on what steps should be taken to set it up. 'In order to secure the successful introduction of sustainable competition in gas supply, a daily market for gas has to evolve which is fully effective and efficient,' said Mark Higson, director of network operations at Ofgas. 'We want participants to tell us the type of market that they would like to see evolve and what steps should be taken to develop a market.' The need to establish a spot market arises from the daily balancing requirements of the gas supply network. Once British Gas's monopoly over household supply is removed in April 1996, many of the independent shippers will be pumping gas into homes through the company's pipelines network which is run by its TransCo division. These shippers will be required to balance their customer requirements on a daily basis - matching supply and demand which can fluctuate wildly, for example, when the weather turns suddenly colder. The debate over a spot market centres around how sophisticated this balancing system should be - whether it should be just that: a way to square up companies' needs on a daily basis or a fully-fledged marketplace with posted bids and offers for gas. In its discussion document, Ofgas has laid out proposals by British Gas for a balancing system as well as a model for gas trading developed by the gas supply arms of two regional electricity companies: Eastern Natural Gas and Manweb Gas with Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, among other suggestions. The regulator wants to answer several questions surrounding spot sales and purchases. For example, it asks whether deliberate attempts should be made to create a 'liquid and transparent on-the-day operational gas market', or whether the market should be left to evolve without such intervention. The document also asks the industry: 'Is it necessary or desirable to take a view now on whether or not to proceed with a deeper market or can that wait until later?' British Gas is eager to see the development of some sort of marketplace in order to encourage competition. The company needs a flexibility mechanism to balance the network - but this doesn't have to be a spot market. 'It's important for us to have something that moves us forward,' one official said. But some independent industry players are sceptical about the view that a marketplace can be imposed on gas trading, and many believe that spot sales and purchases should be left to develop organically into a larger market. 'There is a certain amount of trading that goes on now at the gas terminals: more of this is on a daily basis in winter,' said Roger Turner, managing director at Utilicorp UK. 'When the need for daily balancing comes in, the commercial and market pressures for daily trading will increase and spot markets will develop in their own time.' Mr Turner believes that spot markets will develop at the gas hubs where supply from the North Sea is brought on shore rather than in a central marketplace. This means that daily trading will be closely linked to the physical market supply. Some sort of clearing house or market agent may need to be provided by a separate company such as an investment bank. 'I'm sure that after a year or two, we'll all have screens on our desks with daily and more long-term prices quoted from the terminals around the country,' he said. Since the government has not yet produced legislation to open up the household supply market, some independent operators believe that it may be too soon to be deciding the details of how the market may work. Alan Marshall, managing director at Agas, believes a spot market will develop if there is a real need for one. 'There may well be a need for some sort of clearing house arrangement which allows requirements to be balanced on the day, but that depends on how many players there are in the market,' he said. One of Ofgas's fears and a concern for some in the gas business is that a spot market which develops gradually may not be as transparent as a formal trading arena.  If gas is bought and sold in smoke-filled rooms where private deals are done it will be hard to establish market prices applicable to all participants. Ofgas's document says: 'Confidence that economic pricing signals are being generated transparently would be a key factor in encouraging reliance on the market and hence enabling the industry to add short term supplies to existing long term contract arrangements.' This is why proposals by Morgan Stanley and the two regional electricity companies include the setting up of a commodity market with screen-based trading.  Shippers hope that a mix of proposals will be adopted from the varying suggestions in Ofgas's paper, but are not looking for any rigid market proscriptions.</p>

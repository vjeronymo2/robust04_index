A. (6-7) break a six-game losing streak.  </P> <P> "(Eproson) was just amazing," Cal Lutheran Coach Norm Chung said.  </P> <P> "We couldn't stop her. We didn't let her get any shots simply standing  stationary. We made her work for her shots. She just didn't miss."  </P> <P> Not exactly, but pretty close.  </P> <P> Eproson made 10 of 18 field-goal attempts, mostly on long-distance bombs, and  she sank five of six free throws.  </P> <P> The Regals (9-3) led, 46-45, with 12 minutes, 46 seconds to play before Eproson  went to work.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-7 junior guard scored the Eagles' next 10 points in a 4:26 span, all  on outside shooting to give Cal State L. A. a 55-50 advantage.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran pulled to within a point, 61-60, with 4:16 to play when Joy Fuller  made a layup. But Cal State L. A. went on a 14-1 blitz with Eproson scoring 10  of the 14 to seal the win.  </P> <P> Lori Thompson scored 16 points and Kelly O'Brien added 12 and 15 rebounds for  Cal State L. A.  </P> <P> Brenda Lee led Cal Lutheran with 16 points, 12 rebounds and five steals. Leslie  Stevens chipped in with 12.  </P> <P> In the first half, Cal State L. A. led, 20-9, but Cal Lutheran closed to 34-32  by halftime.  </P> <P> Cal State L. A. hit 52% from the field in the second half on 16-of-31 shooting  while limiting Cal Lutheran to 34% (13 of 31). KIRBY LEE In another women's  game: Antelope Valley 63, Citrus 49 -- Antelope Valley improved to 2-0 in the  Foothill Conference with a victory at Citrus.

A. 89, Canyons 88 -- Holding a one-point  lead with 12 seconds remaining, West L.

Larry Allbritton led Canyons (7-12, 0-2) with 26  points and fellow forward Aaron Clark scored 20. Canyons' Nick Sanderson scored  21.

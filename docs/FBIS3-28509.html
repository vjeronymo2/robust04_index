In the first five days of this month the Sunchon and Anju  District coal mining complexes increased coal output  respectively 11 and 8 percent as against the like period of the  previous month.    The Tokchon District coal mining complex is carrying out its  daily plans at more than 130 percent by introducing new blasting  methods and improving the operation rate of cutting faces.    The Kangso District general coal mining enterprise which had  hit the January coal target over ten days ahead of schedule is  now producing daily several hundred more tons of coal than  planned this month by giving precedence to tunneling and well  managing coal-cutting faces.    The Kangdong, Pukchang and Myongchon District coal mining  complexes have lifted the daily coal output 20 percent above  that in the corresponding period of last month by scrupulously  organizing and directing production.</p>

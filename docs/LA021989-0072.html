			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STRANGE DAYS;  </P> <P> CALL IT A PRIVATE OBSESSION, BUT JEANNIE CROMIE SAYS HER TIME SPENT COLLECTING  ARTIFACTS OF JIM MORRISON IS A LOVING TRIBUTE TO THE DOORS' LONG-DEAD LEAD  SINGER  </P> <P> Jeannie Cromie of North Hollywood.  </P> <P> She wears garter belts around her wrist.  </P> <P> She has a pet turtle that sleeps in her hair.  </P> <P> Pictures of a dead rock 'n' roll singer, Jim Morrison, cover her bedroom walls.  </P> <P> "Some people think it's really weird," she says.  </P> <P> Jeannie thinks it's normal. She's been collecting garter belts for years and  likes to show them off. Lots of people collect things, she says. And lots of  people have pets they love.  </P> <P> The Morrison obsession, however, has earned Jeannie a measure of distinction.  She has scavenged rare records, magazine interviews and photographs of Morrison  and his band, the Doors. At age 33, Jeannie has become queen of the Doors fans,  king of the hill perched atop a mountain of aging LPs and teen tabloids.  </P> <P> "Some people call it an obsession," she says.  </P> <P> And some people are stunned when they see what she's got packed into her  condominium.  </P> <P> "In the past 20 years, I've seen most of that stuff in different places around  the world, but to see it all in one woman's apartment in the Valley is  amazing," says Danny Sugerman, a longtime friend of the Doors who co-wrote the  best-selling Morrison biography "No One Here Gets Out Alive."  </P> <P> Tenacity, Sugerman says. Jeannie's got tenacity and that's what it took to  track down all these bits of history of a rock star who died mysteriously  almost two decades ago.  </P> <P> "She's testament to the fact that Jim is dead because if he was alive, she'd  have found him by now."  </P> <P> Ray Manzarek, the Doors' keyboard player, has his own theory about Jeannie. He  too has stopped by to see her collection.  </P> <P> "She's very devoted. Ultimately, I think, it stems from a love for the music  and a love for Jim. He was a Greek god. He was Dionysus and Jeannie is playing  the role of the maenad, a female follower of Dionysus.  </P> <P> "This is a Greek myth come to life. Seriously, these are psychological  archetypes."  </P> <P> Jeannie insists that she has a life away from Jim Morrison. She works as a  secretary and she writes poetry. Some of her friends aren't even Doors fans.  </P> <P> She can't quite explain her hobby. She says the more you know about Morrison,  the more you understand that her interest in him is "a beautiful thing."  Anyway, Jeannie doesn't want to talk about Jeannie. She wants to talk about  Jim.  </P> <P> Everyone knows the bad things about Jim, she says. The alcohol and drugs.  Getting arrested in Las Vegas for fighting a cop. Getting arrested in Phoenix  for roughhousing on an airplane. Getting arrested in Miami, where the police  said he exposed himself on stage.  </P> <P> Finally, of course, his death at age 27 in a bathtub in Paris.  </P> <P> People, she says, don't know the good things. How he and Manzarek and Robby  Krieger and John Densmore were college-educated, having gone to UCLA. How  Morrison grew disenchanted with rock 'n' roll and spent his final days devoted  to poetry and film making.  </P> <P> And the songs he left behind: "L.A. Woman," "Crystal Ship," "Strange Days." The  Doors disbanded in 1973, two years after Morrison died, yet their music still  plays over the radio and their albums sell 100,000 copies a year.  </P> <P> People, she says, don't give Jim Morrison the credit he deserves because they  don't know him.  </P> <P> "Nobody knows him better than I do. I mean, I know he's dead and all. But I  know where his head was at, his sadness."  </P> <P> Not that Jeannie ever met Morrison. She didn't even like the Doors back then.  </P> <P> "Whenever 'Light My Fire' came on the radio," she says of the Doors' 1967 hit,  "I hated it."  </P> <P> But three years ago, while Jeannie was vacationing in Palm Springs, she found a  paperback by the Jacuzzi. It was "The Lords and the New Creatures," a  collection of Morrison's poetry published before his death.  </P> <P> "I just fell in love with his writing," she recalls. "Then I fell in love with  his face. I thought, 'This guy is cute. Who is he?' "  </P> <P> Jeannie didn't realize that poet and rock star were the same man. Five months  later, she saw a Doors video -- "Love Me Two Times" -- on MTV and made the  connection. She fell in love with Morrison's music.  </P> <P> From that point began a journey. At night and on weekends, Jeannie went  anywhere she could forage Morrison artifacts. She picked through record bins at  swap meets and sat on the floors of a hundred bookstores sifting through old  magazines. She telephoned and wrote to surviving band members, record company  executives and Doors fan clubs around the world.  </P> <P> These people sent her records and posters and photographs. The collection grew  to include a Russian copy of "Light My Fire" and a Japanese single of "Hello, I  Love You" with a drawing on the sleeve that depicts the Doors with  almond-shaped eyes. Jeannie found Morrison articles in old copies of such  magazines as Teen Set, Crawdaddy and Trouser Press.  </P> <P> Such items are worth money to Doors collectors, but Jeannie accumulated them at  little cost. She bought rare 45s for $2 from flea market vendors who didn't  know their value. She paid 25 cents for out-of-print magazines at bookstores.  </P> <P> And she got technical. Using the Freedom of Information Act, Jeannie obtained  an FBI file on Morrison's Phoenix arrest. She got hold of a photocopy of the  fingerprint sheet from his Las Vegas arrest.  </P> <P> In just three years, the collection has outgrown Jeannie's condominium. Most of  it is packed into a nearby storage locker.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of intense Doors fans around, but nobody with the thoroughness  and largeness of Jeannie," Sugerman says. "Her devotion to the band is  impressive."  </P> <P> The story of Jeannie and other devoted fans has a flip side.  </P> <P> It comes from the people who are the objects of their obsession -- Manzarek,  Krieger and Densmore. Manzarek said Jeannie becomes overenthusiastic at times,  but most often is polite. Not all fans are so restrained; there are endless  letters, phone calls and intrusions by adoring followers.  </P> <P> And some of these people weren't even born in the late 1960s and early '70s  when the Doors were big. The band lasted just five years, Sugerman says, and  its members have spent 18 years answering for all they accomplished in that  short time.  </P> <P> "This kind of thing doesn't happen to most people in their lives," Manzarek  says. "The point is, it did happen to me and I have to deal with it. If you're  going to play a game in public, you'd better be ready to deal with the public,  and be gentle with them.  </P> <P> "You must understand, most of the fans are good people," he says. "This is  love. Jeannie loves the Doors. These people love the Doors.  </P> <P> "They're as in love with the Doors as I am and John is and Robby is. Talk about  obsessed. . . . John and Robby and Danny and I are obsessed. We're obsessed  with the Doors. We're the biggest fans."  </P> <P> But there is a distinct difference between fans and people who exhibit what  psychologists call obsessive behavior.  </P> <P> "In a general sense . . . if you are a fan of Shakespeare, you read his plays.  If you are a fan of Jim Morrison, you listen to his music," psychologist Rex  Beaber says. "The persons who are obsessive go beyond the artist's creations.  They want to know the artist; they want to possess the artist.  </P> <P> "Everyone does that to a degree, like wanting to read about their favorite star  in People magazine, wanting to know more about that person," Beaber says. "But  for most people, the fantasy is just a temporary pleasure. For obsessive  people, it's a permanent solution."  </P> <P> Sugerman, as manager of the band's affairs, receives mail from these people,  letters that range from harmless to threatening to strange -- a psychiatrist  once wrote that his patient thought she was demonically possessed by Morrison.  And eight years ago, Sugerman returned from vacation to find a 20-year-old fan  in his apartment, wearing his John Lennon T-shirt and rummaging through his  belongings.  </P> <P> Jeannie isn't that way, he says. Besides, like Manzarek, Sugerman is tolerant.  As a 13-year-old, he hung around the Doors' business office until he got hired  to answer the band's fan mail. He has been with them ever since.  </P> <P> "To an extent, I can sympathize with the fans," he says. "I can understand the  excitement of being close to the Doors."  </P> <P> The difference between then and now, he says, is that the Doors don't exist  anymore.  </P> <P> Jeannie is glad that Morrison isn't around.  </P> <P> "It's safer that way," she says, but she can't explain what she means by that.  </P> <P> Rumors persist that the rock singer faked his death and has been living in  seclusion. Jeannie doesn't believe that. Neither does she believe the official  report that he died of a heart attack.  </P> <P> "I prefer to say it was a broken heart."  </P> <P> You see, Morrison's legend can't disappoint Jeannie. He won't grow old or fat  or come out with a mediocre album. Best of all, Jeannie can take part in  keeping his legend alive. A film production company is working on a movie about  the singer's life, so it comes to her for information. A radio producer puts  together a six-hour Doors special, so he comes to Jeannie for some of her  records.  </P> <P> "Nobody knows him better than I do," she says.  </P> <P> Every morning when she gets up, Jeannie sees photographs of Morrison hanging in  her bathroom. Small notes are pasted beneath the pictures: "Scrub Back," "Wash  Hair." Some nights, Jeannie watches videos of the Doors in concert. Sometimes  she mimics Morrison.  </P> <P> "I can walk and talk just like him."  </P></p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Rebate rise will offset personal pension charges The government intends to increase the rebate it will pay after 1997 to people who take out private pensions, to compensate for the high commission and charges levied by insurance companies. While the move will benefit personal pension holders, it is bound to be controversial because it protects insurance companies at the expense of the taxpayer. The rebate returns to personal pension holders a portion of the national insurance contribution they currently pay. But because the government is eager to encourage contracting-out through personal pensions, it is determined to press ahead with additional payments to cover providers' costs. The government Actuary's Department is working out how much additional rebate will be paid. 'The problem is that unless a rebate incorporates the costs of the provider, it will never be 'best advice' to urge someone to contract out of the state earnings-related pension scheme through a personal pension,' said one government official familiar with the discussions. The social security department said yesterday it had decided not to use its powers under personal pensions legislation to cap insurance company charges. Instead, it intends to rely on the regime due to be introduced in January, which will disclose to customers how much they are paying in charges and commissions when they take out a personal pension. Actuaries at William M. Mercer and Co estimate that people who make no contribution to their personal pension other than the national insurance rebate pay between 4 per cent and 13 per cent of it to the insurance company in costs. However, some life insurers also impose a flat-rate monthly charge of Pounds 2 to Pounds 4 - revised upwards annually, usually according to inflation. The roughly 40 per cent of personal pension holders who make additional contributions to their fund have such monthly charges levied automatically. In addition, they pay annual fund management fees. A personal pension holder earning a rebate of Pounds 100 per year could lose Pounds 61 in charges. Money Management magazine reports this month that 15 leading life insurers levy flat rate charges and, even assuming investment returns of 10 per cent per year, several companies will have exhausted the entire pension through charges well before retirement age. The increased subsidy is part of a system of age-related rebates on the national insurance contributions of workers with personal pension plans.</p>

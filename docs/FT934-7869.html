			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Technology: Russians show their mathematical might Virtual reality can be bad for you. It can disorientate the brain and make it hard to readjust to the real world. This is the view of Bill O'Riordan, a professor at Imperial College, London, and head of advanced research at ICL, the UK computer group owned by Fujitsu of Japan. He believes the creators of virtual reality have made a fundamental error by failing to base their world on the laws of physics. Yet he is confident a solution can be found - in Russia, where software experts bring a mathematical scrutiny to bear on computing problems that contrasts with the west's more pragmatic approach. Central to O'Riordan's concern about VR's dangers is the belief that inaccurate representations of the real thing can retune people's minds to a false set of rules. Those who spend too long immersed in a computer environment - especially with a headset - can emerge confused. They may not realise it, but their brain may have been reprogrammed. What happens when they are behind a car wheel? How do they know their reaction times have not been subtly altered? O'Riordan's conclusion is that the laws of physics and mathematics are being simplified, even ignored. He has several criticisms: if VR objects move at all, they follow pre-determined paths; their interaction with other objects is often not taken into account; scaling is inaccurate; and the use of shading often bears little relationship to the light source. 'The west is making a big mistake in failing to base much of its technology on sound mathematical principles. VR is perhaps the most serious example.' To help put this right, he has organised talks between ICL and top scientists from the former Soviet bloc. Because it was isolated by the iron curtain, Soviet computing followed a different path of evolution - one firmly rooted in mathematics - from that of the west. The result was highly developed skills in programming and algorithms, the building blocks of computer language. Western computer companies, by contrast, were able to throw money and sophisticated hardware at problems, and became 'seduced by graphics' as they strove to make more user-friendly products. 'The computer games boom is partly to blame,' says O'Riordan. 'We have been bombarded by 'virtual worlds' created on the PC, although the complexity of recreating reality is such that no PC can yet handle it.' He finds proof of Russian expertise in the country's military and space technology. He is not alone in his views. David Hughes, a professor at the University of Plymouth who chairs the British Computer Society special interest group on computer-aided design, has also worked with institutes in Russia and Ukraine. 'Their work is mathematically -based, and despite very low levels of technology, their programming skills are formidable. They have been able to get far more out of low-power systems than we would have believed possible.' The Russian mentality may be a result of 50 years of political repression, says Doron Swade, senior computer curator at the Science Museum in London, because anything which had a practical application was centrally controlled. 'The only way they could escape the controls was to embrace the abstract.' The Science Museum put ICL in contact with the Institute of Informatics Systems in Siberia, which led to the first talks last month. O'Riordan was enthusiastic. 'The Russians know how to make a machine sing - their programming doesn't waste a bit or a byte,' he says.</p>

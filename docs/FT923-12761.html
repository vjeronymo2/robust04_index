			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / People: Davis breaks record at Guinness Crispin Davis (right) is a man on the fast track. Having joined Guinness just two years ago, he has been elevated to the main board at the tender age of 42, which makes him far and away the youngest executive director of Britain's fifth biggest company. Davis is one of those marketing men who learnt their trade at Procter &amp; Gamble's marketing school. Having joined P&amp;G after Oxford as an assistant brand manager, he rose rapidly through the ranks and by 1978 was marketing director of the US consumer product giant's UK operations. During his time there he was responsible for establishing Ariel washing powder and Pampers disposable nappies as market leaders. After a stint in the US, where he rose to be vice-president of the foods business, he was headhunted to run the European region of Guinness' United Distillers business. Tony Greener, who recruited him, has gone on to be Guinness' chief executive and the rapid promotion of Davis, currently managing director of United Distillers, suggests that he is being groomed as a possible heir apparent. Guinness also announced yesterday that Austrian born Helmut Sihler, who retired as chief executive of Henkel Group last year, has been appointed a non-executive director. There is a certain irony in this appointment given that when Crispin Davis was running P&amp;G's German operations his biggest competitor in detergents was Henkel's Persil. ***** Steve Bedford, 36, group development director at STOREHOUSE, has been elevated to the board of the retailing conglomerate. His appointment reflects the growing influence of David Dworkin, the company's chief executive, as he builds a board of directors in his own image. Bedford and Dworkin worked closely at BhS where they wrought a radical cultural revolution helping to restore the struggling variety chain's pride and profitability. It is now hoped that the duo can perform a similar trick on some of Storehouse's other laggardly performers, such as Habitat and Mothercare. ***** Lord Weatherill, former speaker of the House of Commons and MP for Croydon North East for 28 years until he stepped down at the last election, has joined UNITED ARTISTS COMMUNICATIONS (LONDON SOUTH) as a non-executive director. The company supplies cable television and telephone services in Croydon and its environs to 41,000 subscribers. It is part of TeleWest, a joint venture between Tele-Communications and US West. ***** Lord Howe, Britain's former foreign secretary and deputy prime minister, has underscored his reputation as one of the great and the good by being appointed a member of the international council of J P Morgan &amp; Co, the most admired of the big US money centre banks. The council, which is chaired by former US secretary of state George Shultz, advises Morgan's senior management on matters of international concern and interest. It meets approximately once every eight months, so it is not going to require a lot of Lord Howe's time. Even so, there is a certain kudos attached to membership of the council, whose 23 members range from ex-Bundesbank president Karl Otto Pohl to Peugeot's Jacques Calvet. Lee Kuan Yew, a former prime minister of Singapore, has also been appointed to the council. Apart from Lord Howe, the only other British member of the council is Sir Christopher Hogg, a director of the Bank of England and chairman of companies like Reuters and Courtaulds.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Damascus: We Will Not Be </F> Dragged Along Like the PLO"]    [Text] Damascus -- Syria said yesterday that it would not  be dragged along to what the PLO was dragged to and that it  would resist all Israeli expansionist plans and economic  hegemony projects. A Syrian official has told AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT: We are explaining to everyone that peace depends  above all on full and comprehensive withdrawal and that Israel's  phased security agreements are nothing more than misleading  ploys and ways of circumventing the Security Council resolutions.    The official added: Israel has dithered and procrastinated  with all the Arab parties and requested peace treaties,  normalization of relations, and opening of borders under the  pretext of building up trust but refused to withdraw from the  occupied territories or to commit itself to such withdrawal.    The Syrian official said that what Israel wanted was not a  genuine Palestinian autonomy or authority but a group that obeys  its orders, carries out its instructions, and participates in  repressing the Palestinian people in the same way that the  mercenaries of Antoine Lahd (South Lebanese Army) act against  the Lebanese people and their towns and villages.    Referring to the Lebanese front, the Syrian official said  that Israel threatened to use force if the Lebanese Army tried  advance to the front lines, foiled every initiative by the  Lebanese Government for the implementation of Security Council  resolution 425, continuously committed aggression against the  south, carried out terrorist operations deep into Lebanese  territory, and abducted Lebanese citizens from their homes as it  did with Shaykh Mustafa al-Dirani on the pretext that he  belonged to the Lebanese resistance. He added that Syria would  not have been safe from Israeli aggressions had it been weak and  vulnerable.    In conclusion, the Syrian official said: Israel wants feeble  agreements that cannot survive and last but Syria does not  accept that kind of logic.</p>

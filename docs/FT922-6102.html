			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading A DULL day in stock index futures saw the June contract drift lower in afternoon trading as an aimless market looked to a weak Wall Street as its focus, writes Christopher Price. June opened at 2,733, and an initially lively start saw the contract squeezed up, reaching 2,744 by 10.30am. However, this proved to be the high point of the day, as interest drifted away. Although it still managed to trade at a slight premium to fair value for the rest of the session, the story was mundane as June slid with the cash market. The poor UK trade figures added to the negative tone. A declining Wall Street, pressured by faltering US bond prices, further undermined June. The contract ended at 2,713, down a net 26, and around its estimated fair value. Turnover reached 6,361 contracts. However, in after-hours' trading, June was under further pressure, slipping to an estimated two-point discount to fair value. Among traded options, turnover was boosted ahead of expiry day for a number of series. Lasmo was the top stock option, with 3,378 contracts dealt and the August 240 series particularly busy. Hanson and Cadbury-Schweppes which also expire today were also busy. Total turnover was 28,923 lots compared with 26,595 on Friday.</p>

			<p>940106 FT  06 JAN 94 / Metallgesellschaft reveals losses of almost DM2bn Metallgesellschaft yesterday stunned its creditor banks with news of an estimated loss of almost DM2bn (Pounds 773m) last year, and a request for a massive capital injection. 'It was far, far worse than expected,' one participant said after bankers met the new management of the crumbling metals, mining and engineering group. 'The company is effectively in the hands of the banks.' According to a formal statement from the group, the board proposed to raise DM2.7bn in new capital through a DM250 a share issue to raise DM1.4bn, and the conversion of DM1.3bn-worth of bank debt to junior convertible stock. The board also requested DM500m in new credit lines for the parent company, Metallgesellschaft AG. While bankers were asked to agree in principle to a 90-day debt moratorium, the company said they should decide on their participation in the planned capital raising with 'the highest priority', for fear of further damage to the company. Sound, high-profile subsidiaries such as the Lurgi plant engineering business, dependent on long-term contracts, often awarded by governments, could be put gravely at risk by loss of international confidence. Asked if the group's shares, condemned as 'effectively worthless' by some bankers, were to be suspended, a spokesman said: 'I don't know, I'm not the chairman of the stock exchange'. In November, Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, later sacked as chairman, announced a pre-tax deficit of DM347m for the year to September 30, attributing most of that to losses at a toolmaking subsidiary. But yesterday, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chairman since December 17, said when the revision of the accounts was complete, the consolidated deficit would be around DM1.9bn, almost all attributable to the parent, Metallgesellschaft AG. If the worst came to the worst, speculation on the New York oil futures market by MG Corp, a US subsidiary, which sparked the crisis, could cost another DM1bn over the next two or three years as positions were unwound. Apart from the equity issue, the group management also plans a sale of assets, possibly including the Buderus heating equipment business and other readily saleable operations, and to cut its workforce by at least 20,000. Although a company statement said the restructuring plans had been positively received by the 40 to 50 bankers present, some were unhappy at the tightness of the timetable. At the time of Mr Schimmelbusch's sacking, the group supervisory board said it had not been kept adequately informed. However, critics of German management controls have long complained that supervisory boards, often dominated by large banks, are overindulgent. At yesterday's meeting, officials representing Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank  -both large shareholders and lenders to Metallgesellschaft - were reported to have contributed little to the discussion. Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, a Deutsche Bank director, and chairman Metallgesellschaft's board of supervisors, said shortly before Christmas that management had allowed MG Corp to run its own affairs.</p>

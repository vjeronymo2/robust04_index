			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carmen del Riego: "Aznar Warns That Government </F> Should Take People's Party Into Account in Important Decisions"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- The main conclusion that Aznar drew  from the general [as published] election's outcome, addressing  the People's Party [PP] Executive Committee yesterday, is that  "nothing is the same," and the government must not scorn the  public's wishes, "because you must not show disrespect for the  polls," and so he warned that henceforth "no important decision  should be taken in Spain that does not take the PP into account."    The analysis made by the PP leadership is that with the  results of the European elections, "we are fully justified," and  so now "we have greater strength to negotiate with the  government, which must listen to us now."    As an instance of this, it was made clear at the PP  Executive  Committee meeting that the government cannot continue the  completion of the autonomy map with the transfer of areas of  responsibility to various communities "without the PP's taking  part in that plan, because the PP's votes are sufficient for it  to have to give its opinion on that configuration." Other  instances of the matters on which, in the People's Party's  opinion, the government will be unable to take decisions without  taking it into account are the renewal of the institutions,  without changing the majorities necessary for their election, or  laws such as those on trade or cable television.    In his address to the Executive Committee, Jose Maria Aznar  stressed that the PP should be pleased but not euphoric, and  that the success achieved "should be used only to be improved  on. It is a matter not of resting on our laurels, saying how  well we have done to have won, but of seeing where we have  failed in order to improve."    The PP has therefore set itself the aim of launching an  offensive of putting forward specific proposals and drawing up  sectorial programs in order to confirm the PP's ability to  govern. Aznar set the party to work on this, not allowing it to  rest and convening his main colleagues early in the morning, as  on every Monday, in the so-called matins. In the afternoon, he  convened the Executive Committee, because, as party leadership  sources explained, "we have a great deal left to do, and we must  be prepared for anything," referring to the possibility that  Felipe Gonzalez may soon decide to call an election.    Nevertheless, it was not all work at the Executive Committee  meeting, which received with loud ovations both the PP chairman  and European candidate Abel Matutes and candidate for the  Andalusian Junta [autonomous government] Javier Arenas.    Heeding the spirit expressed by Aznar, the PP, with the  prospect of attaining power in the not too distant future, will  begin this very week to put forward specific initiatives on the  country's main problems, which in many cases will be a  repetition of proposals that have already been put forward but  that have not produced a sufficient response among the public or  in the political sphere, since the PP has not been viewed as an  immediate government alternative. It believes that this will  change, "because after what happened Sunday [12 June], they will  have to listen to us."    Aznar will meet with the parliamentary group Wednesday in  order to analyze these initiatives, and Thursday the PP intends  to submit a law on government. Next Monday, the PP chairman  will convene the Executive Committee, with the intention of  presenting an alternative economic blueprint to that of the  government, "in order to tackle the economic crisis."    The conclusion conveyed by Jose Maria Aznar to the People's  Party leaders is that it is the government that "must make a  move" with respect to its future, and so a strategy of harassing  the government with the possible submission of a censure motion  is not being considered for the present; "rather, performing  constructive work with respect to society," irrespective of  whether or not there are resignations, cabinet reshuffles, or  other initiatives that Gonzalez could undertake as a result of  the election results.    As the same sources explained, the aim is to "to show that  we  know how to lose and know how to win, and that we are interested  not in the country's faring badly but in making the state work,"  because, they add, "we must not disappoint the Spanish people  now."

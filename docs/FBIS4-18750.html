			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Burundian Interior Minister Leonard Nyangoma </F> by Colette Braeckman in Brussels; date not given: "The  Situation in Burundi"]    [Text] [Braeckman] What information do you have regarding  the situation in your country?    [Nyangoma] The situation is more serious than in recent  weeks, when the forces of law and order were not responding to  the orders issued by the political powers.    This time, it is worse still because the commander in chief  of the army, who was also in the aircraft, was killed, too. Now  there is really no one left to command our armed forces.    [Braeckman] Just a few days ago, you were calling for  foreign  intervention. Do you still hold that view?    [Nyangoma] More than ever. There is only one way to succeed  in reassuring everyone in Burundi, by which I mean the  population, but also, and I insist on this point, the army  itself.    [Braeckman] And what if the army once again refuses to  intervene?    [Nyangoma] It must understand that it is in its own interest  to do so, because there is a real risk of general confrontation  among the population. People are still saying that if there is  civil war, and that is what we risk seeing happen, then there  will be neither vanquishers nor vanquished.    [Braeckman] Have you established any contacts in this  connection during your visit to Belgium, and, in your capacity  as interior minister, do you not believe that you should return  to your country as a matter of urgency?    [Nyangoma] No, I am not planning to return before the  scheduled date. First, I have the means to keep informed about  the situation, and second I believe that I can make useful  achievements while abroad as well. As for contacts, it is too  soon to speak about them, because they have not yet been  finalized.    [Braeckman] Was the Burundian president, who was onboard the  aircraft of his Rwandan counterpart, the intended target, or did  he die by chance?    [Nyangoma] We will have to wait and see what the results of  the inquiry are before answering that question. We still do not  yet know the precise circumstances surrounding the  assassination.    [Braeckman] How will a successor to the late president be  appointed?    [Nyangoma] According to the constitution, the only eligible  successor is the president of the National Assembly, who will  take over for a period of three months, after which time a new  president will be elected by our Parliament.    [Braeckman] What is the situation like in Bujumbura,  according to your sources?    [Nyangoma] Clearly, the population is very angry. However,  for the time being, the situation is calm. The people are aware  that there is a difference between the assassination of  President Ndadaye and recent events, where our president was an  accidental victim.    [Braeckman] What are the regional implications of this  crisis?    [Nyangoma] We must fear that there will be fresh waves of  refugees in neighboring countries.    Nonetheless, I would like to formally refute the news  claiming that a Zairian commando took part in the assassination  of President Ndadaye. None of those who were on the scene at  the time of the incident reported this item of information. The  coup was carried out by the eleventh battalion of paratroop  commandos, and eyewitnesses gave their assurance that the  assassins were only Burundians.</p>

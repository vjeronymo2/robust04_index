			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Railtrack negotiators at odds Today's shutdown of the railway network by most signalmen is due to a breakdown of understanding between the RMT rail union and Railtrack. The union wants an 11 per cent 'interim' rise for the railwaymen before entering negotiations on a new pay system. Railtrack insists any new money must be conditional on certain work changes. A bitter internal discussion on what to do appears to divide the company. The board failed to agree last Thursday on a course of action. Company attitudes do appear to have hardened over the weekend, however. The union's anger was undoubtedly fuelled by the change of tone on Monday, when Railtrack took a harder line. The board met and insisted that any pay rise for the signalmen beyond the 2.5 per cent on offer for all its employees would have to come through a negotiated package of productivity improvements by the end of September. Yesterday Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, released an internal letter sent out on June 9 by Mr Colin Hall, Railtrack South's production manager, to six other area managers to prove that there was an offer. This specifically mentions the company's offer to signalmen as being 5.7 per cent from April 1 with the 1994 pay offer 'to be based on the new rate'. Mr Hall added that 'strings' would be attached to the deal. These would cover the introduction of a 'national promotion structure', more flexible working and a 'commitment to discussions on job evaluation, signalling restructuring, and withdrawal of industrial action'. Mr Hall wrote: 'The present expectation is that the RMT will reject this. The company cannot go any further than addressing the differentials issue which the offer properly does.' Mr Chris Leah, Railtrack's chief negotiator, said yesterday Mr Hall's letter was 'an embarrassment' and that what it said was 'misconceived'. He denied that any offer - oral or written - had been presented to the RMT in negotiations. Further evidence of disarray at the company was also apparent yesterday in a briefing note dated May 16, from Mr Leah, which the RMT has acquired. He writes about an '11 per cent offer on basic rates' for railwaymen as a 'minimum increase to recognise the grade and to obviate differentials with traffic grades staff'. He adds that the 11 per cent on offer does not 'include negotiations for annualised hours, concentration of relief staff and restructuring'. He writes: 'It may well be increased as a result of the negotiations with the trade union.' Yesterday Mr Leah said that the company recognised that the signalmen had a genuine grievance. Their relative pay position was anomalous and discussion about wage restructuring for them dates back to 1987. The next one-day stoppage by signalmen is scheduled for June 22.</p>

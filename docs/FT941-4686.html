			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Hard sell for a new British cheese - Churnton's confident launch into the mass market You can almost hear the hoots of derision from across the Channel at the news that 'an exciting new British cheese' was launched this week. Yet, after the much-publicised demise of Lymeswold, the imitation blue Brie, the marketing experts are convinced they have got it right this time. The Cheese Company, formerly Express Foods and Britain's biggest independent cheese manufacturer, is oozing confidence. It has spent about Pounds 500,000 developing Churnton - whose name is supposed to conjure up homely images of traditional cheese-making - and is splashing out Pounds 2.5m on a saturation campaign of television and magazine advertising, mail shots and in-store tastings. Churnton is a hard cheese, made to a secret recipe in the company's creamery in Malpas, Cheshire. It looks like a cheddar but with an open texture, and has a fairly strong flavour. Unlike new, specialist farmhouse cheeses, Churnton is aimed unashamedly at the mass of consumers who buy mild or medium cheddar for everyday use. The cheese is being launched first in north-west England, where 18 per cent of households are 'heavy users' of hard cheeses, and will go national early next year. The initial six-week TV campaign began last night with a 30-second advertisement in the middle of Coronation Street, featuring Victoria Studd, the popular television presenter, pronouncing: 'After one taste, you'll turn to Churnton.' The sales line sprang from the success of trial tastings in Safeway stores across the country, in which eight out of 10 people said they would buy Churnton again. It is deliberately packaged to look like an ordinary cheddar, so 'the trick is getting people to taste it in the first place', says Maria Dooley, marketing manager. Price will be important at this end of the market. Churnton will sell at a slight premium to mild or medium cheddar, but the company has opted for fixed weight packs starting at 99p for 200g. 'When buying variable weight packs of cheese, people fish around for the ones that are below Pounds 1,' says Dooley. It might seem a gamble to target a new brand at a market which is 85 per cent dominated by supermarket own-label cheeses, roughly the reverse of France, where branded regional cheeses abound and the retailing sector is more fragmented. Roger Davenport, managing director, explains that 'the relative lack of branding in the UK is a result of the great success of major supermarket chains and their drive towards own label'. But any desire the supermarkets may have for innovation is stymied by conservative British tastes. Despite the range of hand-made and imported cheeses on offer, cheddar and other hard cheeses account for more than 75 per cent of sales. That is why Churnton is designed to be familiar, 'while offering advantages in taste and texture,' he says. The Cheese Company, which was bought out by its management from Grand Metropolitan for Pounds 96m only 16 months ago, believes there is room for growth in the Pounds 1.1bn UK market, of which it expects Churnton to capture about 2 per cent. British cheese consumption is rising by 1-2 per cent a year but is still only half that of continental Europe, and a third of France. Churnton, according to the launch publicity, is the first British cheese to be developed for the regular, weekly shopper in more than 50 years. With weary determination, Davenport fields comparisons with Lymeswold, which was withdrawn in 1992 a decade after a triumphal start. He says Lymeswold raised such expectations that the manufacturer, Dairy Crest, could not meet them and began delivering a product that was not up to initial standards. 'Unlike Churnton, they didn't get much repeat purchasing,' he says. 'Whereas ours is very much mainstream, Lymeswold was always, however successful, going to be a niche product.' Davenport is adamant that the cheese will not be found bland by its target consumers. There is at least one auspicious sign. When Lymeswold was launched, Peter Walker, then agriculture minister, was seen on television feeding chunks of it to his dog Bomba. Gillian Shephard, the present incumbent, does not have a dog.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Code of practice on stock lending issued THE STOCK Borrowing and Lending Committee, a body of market practitioners, has issued a code of practice for lending and borrowing domestic and international securities in the London market. The guidelines have no regulatory force, but the Securities and Investment Board is looking at ways of ensuring they are enforced, either by endorsing the code or by making the guidelines rules. It is considering the issue as part of its review of custody, which is nearing completion. A discussion document will be published in the next month or so. One reason for renewed regulatory interest in this area is that part of the Maxwell fraud might have been prevented if enforceable rules on the authorisation of stock-lending had been in place. The code is based on existing practice, and covers areas such as gaining Inland Revenue and regulatory approval, setting collateral, and seeking proper authority. It applies to borrowing and lending of both domestic and international equities and bonds. The size of the stock-lending market in gilts is Pounds 8bn, while UK equities lending accounts for Pounds 2bn. International securities lending is estimated at about another Dollars 10bn, consisting mostly of international equities. In the international bond market, the repo (repurchase agreement) market tends to fulfil the same function as the stock-lending market.</p>

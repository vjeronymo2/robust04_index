			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- The vice president of  the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS),  William Taylor, and some leading figures of U.S. media arrived  in Pyongyang Tuesday at the invitation of the Reunification  Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, North Korea's  central broadcasting station reported Wednesday.    Other invitees include CNN Vice President Eason Jordan,  WASHINGTON TIMES Managing Editor Josette Shiner and the  secretary- general of the Second World Peace Conference  sponsored by the Unification Church, Antonio Betancourt.    The Americans were met at the airport by Reunification Panel  Chairman Kim Yong-sun, Vice Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong and  the vice chairman of the Korean Committee for Cultural Relations  with Foreign Countries, O Mun-han.    Kim told the Americans that the Korean peninsula should be  reunified in a peaceful manner best serving the interests of the  Korean people.    Taylor previously visited Pyongyang in June 1992 and met  with  senior North Korean leaders, including Kim Yong-sun.    The Americans are among the guests marking North Korean  President Kim Il-song's 82nd birthday on April 15.    Meanwhile, a CSIS spokesman told a YONHAP correspondent in  Washington that Taylor will visit Seoul from April 20-23 via  Beijing.    A source well-versed on the CSIS said Taylor is carrying a  message from the U.S. Government to North Korea in connection  with the current nuclear stalemate.</p>

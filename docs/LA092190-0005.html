			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET DEBATE  </P> <P> It seems that the Congress is having the usual hard time putting together a  budget. I suggest that our representatives just let Gramm-Rudman kick in and  then resign.  </P> <P> These "honorable gentlemen" have not been able to get it together, ever. I work  3 1/2 months a year for the government already, and I know I don't get my  money's worth. Banking, business and health care are crumbling, and all they  want to do is raise taxes and cut social programs more.  </P> <P> Why can't they take responsibility for their past actions? Instead of Japan  bashing, take a quick lesson. Admit that you have made mistakes and destroyed  this great nation. Then get out of the way!  </P> <P> DENNIS E. HAMRICK  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

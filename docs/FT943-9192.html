			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BOC suffers from Forane factor BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare company, continued to suffer from depressed sales in pharmaceuticals following the expiry of the patent protecting Forane, its main anaesthetic gas in the US. The US market was split evenly with the sole competitor, Abbott Laboratories of the US, BOC said. It was 'reasonable to assume that there will be further competitors' in the next year or two. Profit margins for industrial gases also edged lower in the third quarter and the shares fell 31p to 714p. An exceptional Pounds 85m charge announced earlier this year depressed the company's results in the nine months to June 30. Pre-tax profit of Pounds 169.3m compared with Pounds 261.6m for the same period in 1993 but matched analysts' forecasts. Earnings per share before the exceptional item were slightly lower at 32.54p (33.24p). BOC said this was largely the result of the increased number of shares in circulation. The gases business saw profits rise to Pounds 243.7m (Pounds 231.3m) for the nine months, on sales of Pounds 1.85bn (Pounds 1.7bn). Industrial activity and demand improved in most countries, particularly in the US and Australia, said the company, 'but pricing pressures have not generally abated'. Healthcare profit fell by 42 per cent to Pounds 42.8m (Pounds 73.8m) as a result of competition to Forane. A new anaesthetic gas, Suprane, increased its market penetration. The Pounds 85m provision was made for restructuring programmes, of which Pounds 60m was for the healthcare business and the remainder for gases. The programme began this year and will extend over three years. When complete, BOC expects it to produce savings of about Pounds 60m a year. Third quarter margins were supported by the early benefits from the restructuring programme, said the company.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Stop Making Groundless Accusations To Drive a </F> Wedge between Thailand and Cambodia"]    [Text] The abrupt cancellation, on 16 April, of a planned  visit to Thailand by Cambodia's second prime minister, Hun Sen,  clearly reflected that the Cambodian leaders really believe, as  they charged earlier, that Thailand has been helping Khmer Rouge  forces in operations close to the Thai border by providing them  with supplies and logistics. They have dismissed Thailand's  repeated statement that its policy is that of supporting the  elected Cambodian Government.    Although we do not think the Cambodian leaders' charge that  Thailand, as a "state," supported the Khmer Rouge troops has any  factual basis, we cannot deny that support has existed at the  border. Yet, this has been rather mutual help at the people's  level within the normal range of contacts for border trade and  visits -- these contacts exist at other points along Thailand's  borders.    We think that the attitude adopted by the Cambodian leaders  does not reflect realities. If this continues, it will only  worsen relations and aggravate tension between the two  countries. This is not good for either side, especially  Cambodia, which is at the stage of national reconstruction.  Besides, we think that the attitude adopted by the Cambodian  leaders could spoil the talks between the Cambodian leaders and  the Thai Army commander, who is scheduled to visit Cambodia  within a few days.    The Thai Army is the prime target in the charge made by the  Cambodian leaders -- a spokesman of the Cambodian Information  Ministry said that there are bad elements in the Thai Army who  have supported the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in violation of the  Thai Government's policy of support for the Cambodian  Government. The charge was serious; and it was directed against  the Thai Armed Forces when Cambodian leaders failed to locate  the sources of fresh munitions and cannon rounds the Khmer Rouge  have in their possession.    During his visit to Cambodia, the Army chief will have to  answer those charges, and he might well have to put up with a  few proposals from the Cambodian Government -- they can be about  nothing other than Thailand's support for Cambodian guerrillas,  regardless of the fact that the Thai military has completely  ceased giving support to the Khmer Rouge since the peace  agreement was signed in Paris by the four Cambodian factions.    On behalf of the Thai people, we call on the Cambodian  Government to stop making groundless accusations. Not only will  they bring "a chill" in relations between Thailand and Cambodia,  the accusations will seriously affect national reconstruction in  Cambodia, badly torn by civil strife. We hope that the story of  a farmer and the viper, which referred to Cambodian leaders in  the past, will not have to be retold.</p>

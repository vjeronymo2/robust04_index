			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy After last week's good news on industrial production and unemployment, the deceleration of M4 money supply growth is disconcerting. But the slippage may not be as serious for recovery as it looks. It reflects a shift in corporate financing habits, whereby bank debt is being securitised through the issue of new equity capital or fixed-rate bonds. June alone saw companies raising some Pounds 3.5bn in the equity market, thanks partly to the flurry of rights issues from the property sector. Such balance sheet restructuring bodes well for future economic activity, especially since consumers show signs of being prepared to borrow again. The recovery may not be running away with itself, but it is not exactly faltering either.</p>

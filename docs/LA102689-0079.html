			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> ASSURING BLACK CATS' SAFETY  </P> <P> Two black kittens and two black cats now in the Pasadena Humane Society will  have to wait until after Nov. 1 to find a home because of a moratorium placed  on the adoption of black cats until after Halloween.  </P> <P> The temporary ban on adoptions of black cats -- in effect this year from Oct.  16 to Nov. 1 -- began eight years ago out of a desire to protect the animals  from Halloween party-goers or cult members.  </P> <P> The Humane Society advises owners to keep all pets indoors during the holiday.  Owners are also advised to refrain from giving animals candy and sweets.  </P> <P> A similar moratorium on the adoption of all animals is also put into effect in  mid-December to avoid mistreatment of animals bought as Christmas gifts.  </P></p>

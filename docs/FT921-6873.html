			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: US still wary of keiretsu JAPAN's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has concluded the country's six biggest corporate groups are becoming less reliant on in-house dealings and their extensive cross-shareholdings do not lead to exclusionary business practices, Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo. The findings will be presented in Washington today to a follow-up meeting for the US-Japan Structural Impediments Initiative (SII), designed to remove 'structural' barriers to trade with Japan and cut the US-Japanese trade deficit. The corporate groupings, or keiretsu, head a list of US concerns about access to the Japanese market; it is unlikely the FTC report, based on a study of the groups' dealings in 1989, will satisfy Washington. The FTC found that the six leading groups, the Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Sanwa and Dai-Ichi Kangyo keiretsu, relied on in-group procurement for an average of 8.1 per cent of their total procurement, down from 11.7 per cent in 1981. But, for certain strategic items, such as computers, the in-house sales ratio is far higher. The FTC found that groups used an electronics company in the same family for an average of 33.6 per cent of mainframe computer purchases, down from 35.6 per cent in 1981.</p>

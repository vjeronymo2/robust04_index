			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Russia boosts economics teaching: Plan for western-style research bodies and schools to be established soon The Russian government yesterday shattered the inert world of post-Soviet academic economics by announcing that it would establish a series of new institutions teaching market economics. Even more radically, it announced that the new economic research institutes would not contain 'several hundreds of people' as in Soviet days, but would be lean, stripped-down think tanks with a small core of specialists and a circle of associated economists - 'of the western type'. The announcement appears to signal the end of a prolonged period in which economic teaching has languished in a trough between full-blown Marxist-Leninist command economics and a market-driven approach. Announcing the move, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister and himself a former academic, said that 'unfortunately even the financial crisis in the academy in Russia did not succeed in destroying the old-fashioned academic approach - so that what you have in the world of institutes are monsters with several hundred researchers which attract finance according to a head count. We call on the Academy of Sciences to break with this old system'. However, as Mr Shokhin said, the Academy has so far failed to respond - forcing the Economics Ministry in concert with the committee on higher education to reshape economic teaching round two main institutions - the Higher Economic School, established two years ago, and a separate but linked Academy of Contemporary Economics. The School is already largely dedicated to teaching teachers of economics and will extend this work; the academy is designed to be self-financing, offering paid courses to business people and others on the stock market, macro- and micro-economics and accountancy. Mr Shokhin said that Russia 'must offer the same level of education in economics as other leading countries in the world' - stressing that he saw the new institutes, and their regional affiliates, as forcing houses for central and local government officials with the loss of an established aversion to the market. Mr Vladimir Kirelov, the minister for higher education, said that 'it is important people know what is happening in the Russian economy'. The academic godfather of the school is the remarkable Professor Yevgeny Yasin - a man whose name has been linked to economic reform ever since Mr Mikhail Gorbachev tried and failed to breathe some reformist life into a decaying communism in the late 1980s, but who has never been so identified with any one programme or faction as to join the other casualties littering the road to reform. Mr Shokhin, himself the only senior survivor from the first Russian cabinet of 1991, noted that he and Prof Yasin had helped form a club of reform economists working in the government - 'but since many of these who had been part of it have since ceased to play leading roles, it has been wound up'. Mr Yasin is likely to take the position of president of the new academy  - though the energy and initiative for the project comes from Mr Yaroslav Kuzminov, provost of the Higher Economics School - who has doggedly pushed for reform of the teaching of economics for two years and yesterday appeared to see it bear fruit. Mr Yasin said that 'a lot of what is written about reform here and its effects by journalists and publicists is an emotional reaction and one not really informed by knowledge of how a modern economy works. What we have discovered in the last few years is that an economist can be very well educated in the economics of Marxism-Leninism and be not at all educated as aneconomist'. He said that there was a need for specialists to work in the government departments dealing with the economy. 'This initiative that we academics and professors are starting is not for us and our generation - it is for the students of today and tomorrow'. The programme is being assisted by an Ecu5m (Pounds 3.9m) from the European Union and will be linked with the Erasmus University in Amsterdam, the University of Paris 1, together with Milan, Oxford and Cambridge universities. Part of the EU grant has gone to purchase copies of the textbook 'Economics' by David Begg, Rudi Dornbusch and Stanley Fischer - described by Mr Michael Emerson, the EU ambassador in Moscow and himself a distinguished economist, as 'the best of its kind'. Mr Dornbusch has been a sometime adviser to both the Russian and the Ukrainian governments - while Mr Fischer is now in place as the first deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, where one of his key tasks will be reviewing the Fund's work on Russia. He will no doubt be gratified that soon, the new economists will be speaking his language.</p>

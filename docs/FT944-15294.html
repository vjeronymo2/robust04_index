			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / The phoney war: A more active strategy to get rid of Saddam Hussein is essential The Kuwait crisis has already faded from the headlines. In retrospect the crisis appears rather phoney. Almost certainly, Mr Saddam Hussein had no intention of attacking Kuwait this time. Yet the crisis was also real, because in this game 'almost' is not good enough. A lot of people, after all, were almost certain he would not do it in 1990. As a result, the US put out confusing messages, which he misread as signs of weakness or indifference. This time, if one judges by the Iraqi media, Mr Saddam had identified Mr Bill Clinton as 'the hesitant president' on the basis of events in Somalia, Korea and Haiti. Well, Mr Saddam is not alone in that. Probably his objective was merely to stage a crisis, to which a 'diplomatic solution', perhaps involving ex-president Jimmy Carter, would have to be found. But had Mr Clinton not sent troops to Kuwait, Mr Saddam could well have taken it as a sign that the US had no stomach for a second Gulf war, and forged ahead. Now both sides are claiming victory. The US is apparently satisfied with the passage of yet another United Nations Security Council resolution, requiring Iraq not to deploy its troops in positions that enable it to threaten Kuwait and warning of 'serious consequences' if it does. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, believes this gives the US 'all the necessary authority to act' against Mr Saddam if he threatens Kuwait again. But this interpretation is contested by France and Russia. In Baghdad, official spokesmen and even some western diplomats believe the crisis has strengthened Iraq's position, by pushing the lifting of sanctions higher up the international agenda and bringing Russia back into the argument on Iraq's side. Certainly the crisis revealed the existence of a broad coalition of business, diplomatic and humanitarian lobbies in favour of easing or lifting sanctions. These lobbies point out that Mr Saddam's removal (unlike that of General Raoul Cedras in Haiti) has never been called for by any UN resolution; and they argue that Iraq's compliance with the resolutions that have been passed should be rewarded. This would supposedly relieve the needless suffering of the Iraqi people, while allowing western companies to win lucrative contracts and making it possible to build Iraq back into the regional security order, as a bulwark against the alleged Iranian threat. Yet in reality none of those objectives is likely to be realised while Mr Saddam remains in power. His lack of concern for the suffering of ordinary Iraqi people is amply attested. Food and medical supplies are not covered by the sanctions, and Mr Saddam evidently has money he could spend on them if he so chose. More money could be raised for that purpose by selling oil under the terms of Security Council resolution 706, which specifically provides for it. If he is allowed to sell oil and spend the money as he likes, we can be sure he will have other priorities. As for regional security, it is inconceivable that western or regional powers will again make the mistake of building up Mr Saddam as a bulwark against Iran. Even business opportunities would be limited by a continued arms embargo, by memories of what happened to foreigners in Iraq during the 1990 Kuwait crisis, and by general uncertainty about the stability of a regime so blatantly lacking any popular base, especially in the southern oil-producing region. In any case, it is now clearer than ever that the US will not agree to lift sanctions so long as Mr Saddam remains in power. Yet at the same time there is no guarantee that sanctions will remove him; and if they do he will not go quietly. Even Gen Cedras agreed to step down only when US troops were already on the way to force him out. Before that, he had done all he could to prove that sanctions were hurting the innocent Haitian masses more than they were hurting him. Mr Saddam is doing the same, and he has other tricks up his sleeve. The feint against Kuwait was one. The next could well be a new move against the Kurds in the north, starting perhaps with the area south of the 36th parallel which is not covered by the 'no fly zone', and hoping that Turkey would refuse to authorise retaliation by western aircraft based on its soil. The three-year-old US strategy of waiting for sanctions to work and reacting to Mr Saddam's provocations as and when they happen is not good enough. A more active strategy to get rid of him is essential, and should include some or all of the following elements: expanding the no-fly zone to cover all of Iraq, and excluding all armour and heavy artillery from both north and south; encouraging the opposition Iraqi National Congress to set up a provisional government in the exclusion zones, with financial and military support from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait; stating explicitly that sanctions will be lifted only if Iraq accepts Security Council resolution 688 (which correctly identifies Mr Saddam's internal repression as a threat to international peace and security and calls on him to stop it) and if UN human rights monitors are allowed throughout the country as recommended by the UN special rapporteur; lifting sanctions on areas controlled by the provisional government as soon as it accepts these conditions; setting up an international war crimes tribunal on the lines of that for Yugoslavia, and indicting Mr Saddam. Such a programme would remove the ambiguity about the purpose and target of sanctions, and would make it clear, notably to the Iraqi armed forces, that the country can be saved from anarchy only by hastening Mr Saddam's downfall, not by delaying it.</p>

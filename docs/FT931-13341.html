			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Books: Experiment to lyricism E E CUMMINGS: COMPLETE POEMS 1904-1962 edited by George J Firmage Liveright &amp; W W Norton Pounds 33, 1,102 pages IN THE 60 years between 1870 and 1930 there emerged a remarkable number of poets in the US. About one, TS Eliot, there can be no doubt as to his international reputation. Ezra Pound's significance, too, is without question despite his less appealing persona. Robert Frost's poetry was received with acclaim in Britain long before he was recognised in his own country. But there were others, less well understood outside the US, who are also of considerable importance. Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams are of this number. Then there were Edwin Arlington Robinson, Carl Sandburg, Robinson Jeffers, Marianne Moore, John Crowe Ransom and Hart Crane. Of this latter group the most provocative was the son of a New England Congregational minister. His name was Edward Estlin Cummings and he was born in 1894 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Cummings had been publishing poems since his early 20s but he did not become widely known until the appearance of his prose work The Enormous Room. This savage attack on authority was the result of being imprisoned by the French in the First World War for something he wrote in his letters while he was serving as a member of the Norton Harjes Ambulance Unit. The Enormous Room sent readers back to Cummings's first book, Tulips and Chimneys, published in 1923. Some of the 'Songs' in Tulips, like 'all in green went my love riding', have a fin de siecle flavour, but 'Chimneys' contains such now-well-known language experiments as 'In Just-/spring' and 'Buffalo Bill's/defunct'. There are also attacks on 'Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls' and who would not find at all acceptable such poems as ''kitty', sixteen, 5'1, white, prostitute' and the sardonic 'Humanity i love you'. If in the early poems there was a too obvious desire to epater les bourgeois it was evident by the 1930s that Cummings had something more serious on his mind. In ViVa and No Thanks we see him pushing forward the boundaries of communication, attempting to use words as he did paint on canvas - as in the notorious grasshopper poem ('r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r'). In New Poems and 50 Poems Cummings abandoned such extreme modernist experiments and developed a new and more intimate form of lyricism seen at its best in 'this little bride &amp; groom' and the powerful and moving 'my father moved through dooms of love'. One of the most striking things about him is his defiant individuality in an age of conformity - his readiness to attack what he saw to be the ills of society ('a salesman is an it that stinks Excuse', 'a politician is an arse upon/which everyone has sat except a man'). In Cummings's introduction to the Collected Poems of 1938 he said 'The poems to come are for you and for me and are not for mostpeople'. But to be uncivilly disobedient like a bohemian Thoreau is one thing. What about the calibre of Cumming's verse? RP Blackmur counted 'flower' 48 times in Tulips and Chimneys, concluding tartly that for Cummings the word must contain 'an almost unlimited variety and extent of meaning'. Any attempt to evaluate Cummings's contribution to poetry must therefore take into account the fact that he does not always exploit the fullest resources of the English language. Like Henry Miller in prose he was outre, shocking - sticking out his tongue at what HL Mencken called the 'booboisie'. On the other hand it cannot be denied that life leaps from his best poems. Cummings is least successful when he is being self-consciously hard-boiled, as in 'Poem, or Beauty Hurts Mr Vinal' or 'she being Brand/-new'. He is far better in his ironic comments on war like 'my sweet old etcetera' and 'plato told/him' and in his ability to catch the flavour of low-life speech, as in 'ygUDuh'. But he is best of all in such tender and unsentimental lyrics as 'the little horse is newlY/Born'. Simplicity has its virtues and although Cummings's poems might seem a little contrived today, there is a freshness about them which makes the reader return again and again with a sense of delight. George J. Firmage has revised, corrected and expanded the Complete Poems of 1973 using the original manuscripts and getting the typography right. He has also added poems from Cummings's Harvard years and from the Dial Papers, and his translations of Horace. It is all here, and although one cannot say with one's hand on one's heart that it adds a great deal to our perception of Cummings's quality as a poet, it certainly does not detract from it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service  (FSK) Sergey Stepashin speaking in Almaty on Tuesday reaffirmed  that the security services of some CIS states were spying on  Russia, notably the Baltic states and Georgia. He also reported  that a group of saboteurs from Armenia was detained recently, he  added that no such incidents occur with Kazakhstan.    A number of government officials were sacked following FSK  reports to the president, Stepashin told Interfax. He said many  of them were of a fairly high rank, but gave no names.    The FSK chief said Yeltsin was aware of the incidents of  government corruption and taking appropriate measures. He also  spoke of getting support from Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  "who is just as tough as the president" on matters of government  corruption.    The FSK chief also spoke of anti-terrorist squads being set  up in Moscow and parts of Russia.</p>

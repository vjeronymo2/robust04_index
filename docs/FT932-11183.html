			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: The 'fantasy-land economics' of Russian coal - The problems dogging the latest victim of the country's industrial crisis MR VLADIMIR Iorikh, the youthful commercial director of the Kuznetsk coal trading company, sat in his office in the grimy Siberian mining town of Novokuznetsk and scribbled some sums on a piece of paper. 'It's impossible to work out the real price of coal in Russia - it's fantasy-land economics,' he said with a despairing chuckle. For Russia's huge mining community, though, the better analogy might be a nightmare. For decades after earning its image as an epitome of Soviet industrial might, Russia's mining sector is now finding itself the latest victim of the country's industrial crisis. Earlier this month the Russian energy ministry announced that coal production in the federation had fallen by almost 25 per cent in the last three years, from 416m tonnes to 328m tonnes. At the same time, government subsidies to the industry have shot up to 1.3bn roubles a year, according to last month's calculations - or 6 per cent of the total Russian budget. Meanwhile, with two thirds of the coal mines estimated to be in need of urgent infrastructural investment, accidents in some areas increased by 30 per cent last year. 'It is a very serious situation indeed - it is worse than any other energy sector,' said Mr Yuri Shafranik, Russian energy minister, as he announced plans to close some mines by the end of the year. To a certain extent the reasons behind this decline are rooted in the familiar litany of Russia's industrial woes. Located on some of richest coal seams in the world, between the 1940s and 1970s the Soviet government developed thousands of mines - and mining towns - in regions like the Siberian Kuzbass, to feed both local industry and far flung enterprises and power stations across the Soviet Union. But with the overall decline of Russia's industry, coupled with the breakdown of the Soviet trading structure and reduced demand for coal on world markets, the mines have been finding increasing difficulty in selling their coal. The result has been growing stockpiles at the mines, spiralling debts across the sector, and a dramatic fall in infrastructural investment which, in turn, has left the mines increasingly dangerous and unproductive. 'The problem is that there is not a very great demand for our coal,' explained Mr Iorikh, who estimated that because of falling demand up to a fifth of the mines in the Kuzbass area would have to close, with the potential loss of thousands of mining jobs. But in addition to Russia's overall industrial decline, the disgruntled Kuzbass mine leaders argue that another factor has been at force in the mining crisis - the government's pricing policy, which fixes the price of coal sold to state enterprises at levels that the mines call 'fantasy-land' prices. 'The price is so low that we cannot possibly be profitable,' said Mr Vladimir Lavrik, director of the Abashevskaya mine in the Kuzbass. According to his calculations, the mines received between Rbs4,000 and Rbs7,000 a tonne. Although the government was supposed to top this up with subsidies, these were irregular and did not cover production costs. In the past year alone the Abashevskaya mine ran up Rbs800m of bank credits and unpaid debts to other enterprises, as well as a 100,000-tonne stockpile of coal it cannot sell. 'We cannot buy any equipment because we use all our money for wages, and so the situation gets worse and worse,' added Mr Lavrik. Although a recent government decree had turned most mines in the area into nominal shareholding companies, in which the government held a 38 per cent stake, Mr Lavrik claimed that because of continuing government control over the industry he was not yet able to contemplate the other potential solution - a radical reduction in his 4000 strong workforce, and a cut in the miner's wage, among the highest in Russia. For the moment, most mines are attempting to survive by selling as much coal as possible outside state structures and seeking export markets. In the Kuzbass region, for example, the old state bureaucracy that used to decide coal deliveries has been replaced by a new profit-making coal trading company, which has rights to trade coal abroad. But although some 20 per cent of the region's coal was exported last year, attempts to expand these exports have been dogged with difficulty, not least because of Russia's badly overloaded transport system. Moving a tonne of coal from the Kuzbass to Moscow now costs twice as much as the official state price of coal, while spiralling transit costs at the Baltic and Far Eastern ports have been undermining the low production price. At the same time, poor quality control and deteriorating processing equipment have made Russian coal less attractive to foreign buyers. 'Russian coal is potentially the cheapest coal in the world, but because the coal preparation equipment is so bad it is also potentially the most expensive coal,' said Mr Igor Shelechkov, a coal trader with the British-Russian company Promtrans trading, who estimated that between 1991 and 1992 the price of Russian coal dropped by almost a third on world markets, while exports fell from 25m tonnes to 15m tonnes. Local leaders in the Kuzbass hope that foreign investment will provide one solution to the investment problems. But though some Western entrepreneurs have attempted to buy into local mines, the results so far have not been encouraging - a pioneering Anglo-Soviet venture which invested in a Kuzbass coal mine two years ago, for example, was largely abandoned after it became bogged down in bitter recriminations of financial scams. 'The problem is that investing in a Russian mine would require huge sums of money, with very little return for many years,' added Mr Shelechkov. And with Russia's political situation remaining so volatile, irrespective of the 'fantasy land' economics, these seem to be risks that most international mining companies would prefer not to take.</p>

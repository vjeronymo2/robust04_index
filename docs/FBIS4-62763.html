			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] A difficult situation has arisen among Russian  nuclear workers. This was confirmed by last week's explosion in  Snezhinsk nuclear center in the Urals [on 13 May] that injured  two of the center's workers. In the opinion of the center's  leadership, the incident was caused by the unstable  psychological state of the creators of Russia's nuclear weapons.  This is occurring because of the extremely tense situation that  has arisen in the sector.    The state's debts to the Urals' nuclear workers are now  approaching 30 billion rubles. This has virtually caused  nuclear research to come to a halt. The leaders of the federal  nuclear center have again called on the country's government to  change their attitude to the nuclear complex.</p>

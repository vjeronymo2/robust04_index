			<p>BFN     [Editorial: "Chat Thai Moves in Right Direction"]    The Chat Thai Party's decision Saturday to conduct an  inquiry  into the drug trafficking allegations made against one of its  MPs, Thanong Siriprichaphong, by the US Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA) represents a step in the right direction to  clear up this scandal. The move will dispel any doubt that the  party will simply blindly jump to the defence of its member and  let the case be swept under the rug after the embattled MP has  made the denials.    Notably, the internal investigation on the drug dealing  charges was the first taken by the party executive committee  under a new helmsman, Mr Banhan Sinlapa-acha, who assumed the  party leadership Saturday. Mr Banhan also called upon people to  come forward to see him if they have recriminating evidence  against any other Chat Thai MPs who may have a hand in shady or  illegal activities. Such uncharacteristic straightforwardness  should be a healthy sign especially for the Chat Thai Party and  also for the political atmosphere in general.    Mr. Thanong's denial of all the charges made against him by  the DEA and his announcement that he is ready to fly to the US  to defend the case are not unexpected. Yet, these  pronouncements by themselves cannot dispel all doubts that may  still linger in the minds of many people who are well aware of  the MP's background or who heard what he said during the  much-publicised press conference at the Parliament last Friday.  He could repeat the same denials 100 more times anywhere in  this country, but it will simply be a self-deception if he  expects more people to take him seriously. The lingering  scepticism is not likely to vanish unless he shows his courage  to prove his innocence by deed rather than words--that is to  face his accuser in the US district court.    It is not impossible that the whole saga may be a  well-calculated ploy to discredit the Chat Thai Party and to  divert public attention from all the problems and negative  events confronted by the Government as suggested by some  Opposition MPs. But this is a totally different issue from that  of Thanong's. A clear answer must be put forward by the Chat  Thai Party before the case could be put to rest.    The party's five-man committee to probe the drugs scandal  has  been assigned with a daunting task to find out the facts and to  make public the result of the findings. At stake is not the  reputation of Thanong, but, more importantly, that of the party  which has been tarnished more or less. Therefore, the probe  team must be impartial and, at the same time, broadminded. To  get the facts, it is necessary that the committee must seek  information and evidence from the accuser which is the DEA, the  Office of Narcotics Control Board, the Police Department or even  the National Security Council. In the meantime, the embattled  Nakhon Phanom MP who should be regarded as innocent until proven  otherwise, must be given the opportunity to prepare his defence.    Mr Thanong's predicament is, after all, just the tip of the  iceberg of the shady or illegal business activities that several  of our politicians, senior police and military officers and  senior civil servants are believed to be involved in and which  are yet to be exposed--if they ever get to be exposed at all.  There have been talks or reports of some parliamentarians  acting as mafia bosses, operating illegal casinos and  surrounding themselves with bodyguards or gunmen, or MPs who  talk persuasively about forest conservation in the Parliament  but who own and operate sawmills which clandestinely accept  illegal logs. Ironically, these men can manage to stand tall in  society and accorded due respect.    Chat Thai is a big party which is made up of members of  diverse backgrounds and business activities--some of whom are  known to be involved in unlawful or unethical activities. The  party should also be well aware of its problem of reputation and  recognition, especially among the well-educated public. If the  party is to gain the trust and recognition of the public, its  first priority should be to clean up its image which, in the  past, has been tainted by its close association with or its  subservient attitude toward politically ambitious military  officers and the lack of political conscience.    With a new leader in charge, the Thanong case will hopefully  provide a fresh start for the Chat Thai Party to project a new  image and to take a new political course that will be more  acceptable to the general public.</p>

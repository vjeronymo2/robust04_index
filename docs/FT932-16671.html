			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: G7 aid a condition for Russian reform, not a reward RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin should savour the reception he received from US administration official at this weekend's Vancouver summit. He can expect a more sceptical welcome from some other members of the Group of Seven industrial countries, in whose collective name any multilateral aid package is likely to be provided. The economic arguments may be on the side of Mr Yeltsin. But he will have a tough time persuading deficit-burdened G7 countries that up-front aid makes good political sense. Western worries over the sagacity of committing aid to the Russian reform programme are understandable. Moscow politics remain unpredictable, while Mr Yeltsin's grip on power appears tenuous. Russian inflation is also accelerating fast, nearing 30 per cent a month over the last quarter. Inevitably, sensible investors are desperate to sell roubles for western dollars in order to salt their savings away in Swiss bank accounts. Yet none of these concerns weakens the case for aid. Indeed, the pace at which the Russian economy is approaching hyperinflation, and the scale on which capital is fleeing the country, make it all the more important that the G7 takes the plunge. For capital flight is only a symptom of the underlying economic malaise. It is the threat of hyperinflation, and the potential political disintegration that could follow, that make capital flight the only sensible strategy for would-be investors. Only by bringing the credit creation under control can the Russian government reduce inflation and stabilise the slide in the value of the rouble. That means stemming the flow of bank credits to indebted state enterprises, while bringing remaining subsidies within the government's budget. Central bank credits are currently growing by 20 per cent a month, over 70 per cent a quarter, of which more than half go to state enterprises. But the Russians cannot control inflation on their own, a point made repeatedly both by the Russian government and by enlightened external observers such as Mr Stanley Fischer, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and previously chief economist at the World Bank. Western aid, they argue, is needed to provide a non-inflationary way of bridging the gap in the government budget that central bank credits now fill. But how much aid is needed? About Dollars 2bn in the second quarter of this year rising to Dollars 4.5bn a quarter by the beginning of 1994, according to a stabilisation plan devised by Mr Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics professor and adviser to the Russian government. The plan is designed to reduce the quarterly rate of inflation from over 100 per cent today to 14 per cent in the first quarter of 1994. Meeting these inflation targets requires the rate of growth of central bank credit to fall to a fifth of its current level. Total credit creation continues to grow each quarter by a little over 15 per cent of gross domestic product, of which the share of central bank credit is to fall from 100 per cent today to a quarter by the end of the year, with western aid filling most of the gap. And when should aid commence? Standard IMF practice is to wait for a country to establish an anti-inflationary track record before supplying aid. But the Russian government argues that the urgency of their plight, and their financing difficulties, require up-front aid in order to allow the programme to begin. Mr Fischer agrees. 'The west rightly fears that economic assistance would simply be wasted,' he says. 'But without western financial assistance, the Russians will not be able to balance the budget and bring inflation down to a level that will allow other reforms to proceed.' Western aid, both Fischer and Sachs argue, should flow as soon as deputy prime minister Boris Fyodorov is in charge of credit creation and starts implementing stabilisation measures. Of course, the reformers may fail even with aid. But their chance of success depends critically on whether they can convince reluctant G7 governments to take the risk.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: MONEY AND FINANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- This table shows growth rates for the most widely followed measures of narrow and broad money, a representative short- and long-term interest rate series and an average equity market yield.

Applicant proposes to conduct these activities throughout the United States and the world. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks have generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity; or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y, 49 Federal Register 806 (1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board previously has approved, by order, underwriting and dealing in, to a limited extent, all types of debt and equity securities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Incorporated, et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 192 (1989) (1989 Section 20 Order),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> as modified by <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Order dated September 21, 1989, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 751 (1989) (Modification Order) and the Order dated January 4, 1990 (Foreign Bank Order). Applicant has stated that, except as described below, it will conduct the proposed underwriting and dealing activities using the same methods and procedures, and subject to the same prudential limitations established by the Board in the 1989 Section 20 Order, as modified by the Modification Order, including the Board's 10 percent revenue limitation on such activities. For this reason, Applicant contends that approval of the application would not be barred by section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377), which prohibits the affiliation of a state member bank with any company principally engaged in the underwriting, public sale, or distribution of securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant also maintains that the Board has determined that the proposed investment advisory, risk management, and best efforts underwriting activities are incidental to the proposed underwriting and dealing activities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See First Chicago Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 449, 451 n.7 (1994);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BankAmerica <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1163 (1993) (investment advisory activities);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see, e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 12 CFR 225.142;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Deutsche Bank AG <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 133, 139 (1993) (risk management);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 192, 213 n.59 (1989) (best efforts underwriting). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant has submitted a request for a confirmation that foreign subsidiaries, including the foreign bank subsidiaries, of Company's bank affiliates (Foreign Affiliates) are not subject to the section 20 firewalls relating to cross-marketing activities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Incorporated, et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 192, 215 (1989). Applicant also proposes to permit the Foreign Affiliates to sell bank-ineligible securities underwritten by, dealt in, or placed by Company to institutional customers as defined in Regulation Y and accredited investors as defined in Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Applicant also proposes to permit the Foreign Affiliates to recommend bank-ineligible securities to institutional customers and accredited investors provided that disclosure of Company's role in underwriting, dealing in, or placing the securities is made to the customers. Applicant argues that the scope of these firewalls should be limited to U.S. affiliates of section 20 companies and that the extension of these firewalls to the foreign subsidiaries, including the foreign bank subsidiaries, of Company's bank affiliates is not warranted in light of the regulatory framework applicable to these foreign subsidiaries, and that to do so would impose serious competitive disadvantages on Applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant also proposes to have Company enter into certain transactions with certain foreign affiliates and with Applicant subject to the limitations previously imposed by the Board in letters to J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., dated June 19, 1989 (Morgan Letters), except for the parent company guarantee described in the Morgan Letters in connection with certain repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions involving U.S. Treasury securities. Applicant otherwise would continue to comply with the Section 20 Firewalls set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.P. Morgan, supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as modified subsequently by the Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that the performance of the activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit the public by promoting competition, lower financing costs, and more innovative financing. Applicant also believes that approval of this application will allow Company to provide a wider range of services and added convenience to its customers. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will not result in any unsound banking practices or other adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the BHC Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than September 28, 1994. Any request for a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William W.

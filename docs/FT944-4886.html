			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares shrug off political and economic worries - Market Report The surprisingly strong showing by Wall Street late on Friday and another firm performance by US markets at the outset yesterday saw London's equity market consolidate an early good rise, in spite of the twin threat of early moves to higher interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 16.2 higher at 3,033.5. The strength in the leading stocks did not, however, extend to the rest of the stock market, where the FT-SE Mid 250 Index ended marginally easier at 3,458.3, down 1.6. There were other deep-seated worries for London, with the market increasingly concerned at the prospect of the government being defeated in the House of Commons later today when the house votes on the increase in VAT on domestic fuel. Adding to the underlying concerns was tomorrow's meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, to discuss monetary policy, and the Pounds 2.8bn gilts auction. One very disturbing detail of the trading session, dealers said, was the exceptionally low level of activity in the market ahead of the Commons vote and the meeting of the chancellor and the governor. Turnover in London was a dismal 456.3m shares, the lowest for more than two weeks, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for a disappointingly high 60 per cent of that figure. Even more worrying for traders was the fact that such a low turnover figure was boosted by a couple of programme trades, albeit of limited size. There was no denying, however, that European stock markets had responded willingly to Wall Street's sharp rise last Friday. Questioned as to why the markets had raced ahead in the face of the constant flow of economic data pointing to the probability of interest rate rises here and in the US, one leading marketmaker in London said the markets had already factored in the next round of interest rate rises. 'The political scene has weighed very heavily on the London market today,' he said. 'Although it is very unlikely, if the government were to lose tonight we would be in very big trouble indeed. Without that I feel we would have been much stronger today.' Other dealers said there was a feeling around the trading desks that, given a yes vote on the VAT issue, the FT-SE 100 could easily progress to 3,180 before meeting any strong resistance. There was also plenty of talk suggesting the long-awaited year-end rally may be taking shape. But again, the feeling was that Wall Street needed to demonstrate its resilience in the face of the interest rate concerns. Buyers moved in for equities at the outset, with the FT-SE 100 opening around 11 points higher, before slipping into negative territory within an hour as the interest rate factor triggered pockets of profit-taking. Once those bouts of selling were done, however, prices quickly regained the upward path, with overseas buyers also making their presence felt. Shortly after midday the FT-SE 100 Index was more than 15 points ahead and it progressed to reach a high for the session of 3,037.4, up some 20 points, before coming off that level an hour before the close. Around the sectors, the regional electricity stocks attracted some sizeable profit-taking, with analysts pointing out the sector's recent outperformance against the market in anticipation of interim dividend increases of 20 per cent-plus. Seeboard began the 'dividend race' last week. SG Warburg was the pick of the financial sectors of the market, reflecting a growing conviction that the bank will find rich pickings in moves by a number of UK building societies to merge and convert to banking status.</p>

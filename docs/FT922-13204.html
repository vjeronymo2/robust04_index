			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts One might well ask why Mr Norman Lamont ever worried about balancing the budget over the cycle. By the time the election result was confirmed last Friday, the Bank of England had not only officially issued Pounds 1.6bn in new paper but had also made undisclosed sales of around Pounds 1bn and announced an auction for the end of the month. And still the long gilt future closed nearly four points up on the day. After adding in an estimated Pounds 1.5bn of overfunding for the financial year just closed as well as around Pounds 800m of calls on existing issues due during April, the Bank has already covered nearly Pounds 5bn of this year's requirement. So the alarm that greeted disclosure of the Pounds 28bn PSBR for 1992-3 looks somewhat overdone. It helps that the election is not only out of the way but has been won outright by the Tories. That should make this year's autumn spending round less worrying for the market than it would have been under a minority Labour chancellor. This is not to say that funding the PSBR will be plain sailing from now on. It remains a general worry that Japanese purchases of US government bonds could dry up, undermining government bond markets everywhere. Closer to home, the assumption behind Friday's surge was that the UK's commitment to the ERM was finally established, thus reducing future inflationary risk and allowing gilt yields to converge towards German levels as Europe proceeds towards currency union. Convergence is by no means automatic, however. The UK's obsession with its election may have obscured doubts elsewhere about the Maastricht Treaty, typified in Denmark's referendum plan. Such concerns could quickly undermine the convergence theory and even prompt speculation about a D-Mark revaluation, which would be a worry for overseas investors in UK gilts. Although the UK PSBR is still not large in real terms for this stage in the cycle, the market cannot ignore the fact that it will double this year. Next year it will rise again, even under the Treasury's optimistic growth assumptions. It thus becomes clear why the Bank of England was so quick to avail itself of Friday's opportunity. Expectations of a base rate cut at some stage in the summer could support the short end of the market over coming weeks, allowing the Bank to dribble out some more paper. However, the spread over German bonds has narrowed to only around 150 basis points from well over 200 ahead of the election. Since France, with its better inflation record, still maintains a yield gap against Germany of around 80 points, that seems enough UK outperformance for the time being. Admittedly, the auction will tap the long end of the market hitherto neglected by the Bank. But until it fixes the amount involved after Easter, the possibility of up to Pounds 3bn in extra supply will also overshadow the market. After Friday's frenzy, it needs a period of calm.</p>

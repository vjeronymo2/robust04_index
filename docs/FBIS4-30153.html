			<p>BFN     [Text] Bandung, June 23 (ANTARA) -- Indonesian  telecommunication network PT [Company Limited] Telkom will allow  PT NEC Nusantara Communications, a Japan-Indonesia joint venture  company, to build a telephone exchange centre with a 1.5 million  telephone line (SST) capacity. PT Telkom Operation Director  Dadad Kustiwa told ANTARA here on Thursday that PT NEC Nusantara  Communications was given the contract because it has long been  successful in installing telecommunications facilities in  various cities in Indonesia.    The installation of the 1.5 million line SST-switching  centre  is part of a target to install five million SSTs throughout  Indonesia during the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan (Pelita  VI).    PT NEC Nusantara Communications was established under a  joint  venture agreement between Japan's NEC multinational company and  Indonesia's PT Elektrindo Nusantara and PT Humpuss, both private  companies.    Data indicate that the Indonesia-Japan joint venture company  has installed some 350,000 telephone lines so far.    The company is currently installing another 444,100  telephone  lines and is setting up a number of switching centres, each with  a capacity of 40,000 telephone lines, in various cities in  Indonesia.    The new contract, in addition to previous projects, brings  the total number of telephone lines confirmed to be installed  during Pelita VI to 2.3 million.</p>

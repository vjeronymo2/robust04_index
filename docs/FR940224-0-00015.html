			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim rule established requirements that a small bank had to meet in order to adopt a higher aggregate lending limit. Under that rule, the board of directors of the bank had to determine by resolution that a higher aggregate lending limit was consistent with prudent, safe, and sound banking practices in light of the bank's experience in lending to its insiders, and that a higher limit was necessary to attract or retain directors or to prevent restricting the availability of credit in small communities. The resolution had to set forth the facts and reasoning that supported this determination, including the amount of the bank's aggregate lending to insiders, expressed as a percentage of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, as of the date of the resolution. The bank also was required to submit its resolution to the appropriate federal banking agency, with a copy to the Board. Finally, the bank had to meet or exceed all applicable capital requirements. See 12 CFR 215.4(d)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the notice of the extension of the interim rule, the Board received 147 written comments, with 144 respondents in favor of making the 200 percent limit permanent. Small banks subject to the rule submitted the large majority of comments. Other commenters included numerous state and national banking trade associations, several state banking superintendents and Federal Reserve Banks, individual bank directors, bank holding companies, and law firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adverse comment focused on the relatively low level of use of the interim provision. Two of the three adverse commenters argued that a higher aggregate lending limit was not important to credit or director availability because very few banks had used the interim rule. One state banking commissioner noted that of the 88 small banks it supervised, only one had aggregate insider loans in excess of 60 percent of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus as of March 31, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Call report data reflected a similar low level of aggregate insider lending. As of September 30, 1993, of a total population of 7,435 banks with deposits of less than $100 million, only 17 reported loans to insiders in an amount greater than 100 percent of capital. A total of 131 banks reported insider loans greater than 60 percent of capital. Only 54 banks have notified the Board pursuant to the interim rule that they have adopted a higher aggregate lending limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In support of the proposed rule, sixty-two commenters stated that a higher aggregate lending limit was important in order that small banks not be forced to choose between refusing credit to qualified insiders and asking insiders to resign as directors. Several banks observed that this was a particular hardship because qualified directors typically are active businesspersons whose businesses have substantial yet healthy credit requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fifteen commenters observed that the aggregate lending limit was a particular hardship in small communities and rural markets because in those settings small banks were dependent on insiders as a loan source, insiders had fewer alternative credit sources, and insiders tended to be closely identified with their banks, making it difficult for them to seek credit from a competitor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to demonstrate that the higher limit was being used and would have important benefits if made permanent, the Independent Bankers Association of America (IBAA) presented in its comment a survey of 8,057 small banks. Of 1,060 banks that responded to the survey, 152 reported that the general aggregate lending limit had prevented them from making a loan to an insider; 95 respondents reported that the aggregate lending limit had prevented them from naming an individual as a director; and 53 respondents reported that they had accepted a director resignation attributable to the aggregate lending limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional commenters presented a variety of reasons for the low level of use of the interim 200 percent limit: concern that the interim rule would be eliminated, thereby forcing banks to retract credit extended in reliance on it; historically low lending levels; loan participations as an alternative to approving a higher limit; and deferral of consideration of the issue by small banks whose insider loans had not matured since adoption of the interim rule. Some commenters also observed that the interim rule imposed detailed requirements and that some banks may have feared attracting additional regulatory scrutiny by adopting the interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

European Union rules give EU citizens the right to vote and  be elected in member countries other than their own, on  condition of residency.    The Portuguese association in France (CCPF) and the  Federation of Spanish Emigre Associations in France, called for  the registration period to be extended from April 15 to the end  of April.    With 700,000 emigres in France, the Portuguese are the  largest EU grouping living as expatriates in France, ahead of  both the Italians and Spanish.</p>

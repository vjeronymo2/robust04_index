			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hint of help for small businesses THE government said yesterday that it would consider providing extra financial assistance for small and medium-sized businesses. During discussions in the committee stage of the Finance Bill on a Labour plan to retain the Business Expansion Scheme for manufacturing industry, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, told the standing committee that the government would 'watch carefully the development of access to equity capital of small and medium-sized businesses'. He spoke shortly before a Labour amendment to retain the BES for investment in manufacturing was narrowly defeated by 18 votes to 16. Labour MPs tabled the amendment to government plans to scrap the BES after 1993 on the grounds that help was needed for budding entrepreneurs. Mr Alan Milburn, the Labour MP for Darlington, said there was a 'crying need for investment in small manufacturing firms' to prevent a loss of ideas and innovations. Mr John Townend, Conservative MP for Bridlington, called on the government for consideration of another form of help for small businesses after 1993. He suggested that next year's Budget should allow the first Pounds 5,000 of a company's retained profit to be tax-free. Mr Dorrell admitted he had 'mixed feelings' about the government's plan to end of BES assistance for manufacturing. But he said the government had concluded that there were better ways of attracting money into new and developing businesses. The government has decided to broaden the tax relief measures for the film industry that were announced in the Budget. Mr Dorrell has tabled new clauses to the finance bill to provide relief up to a limit of 20 per cent of pre-production expenditure and to extend the planned 33 1/3 per cent annual write-off on film production to expenditure on the acquisition of qualifying films. Mr Dorrell said that the measures should encourage early research work on films.</p>

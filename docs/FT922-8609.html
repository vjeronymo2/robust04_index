			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Arts: Ice picks are definitely in . . . - Cannes Film Festival Does anyone have a good film out there? If so, please bring it to Cannes instantly. No matter if it is a home movie shot in wobbliest super-8 or if the only live creature in focus is the cat or if Auntie Flo falling into the children's playpool is the dramatic high point. It will still be better than almost anything at the 45th Cannes Film Festival. You who regard Cannes as a jamboree for hedonistic film critics should be here right now. With the exception of Robert Altman's spitfire Hollywood satire The Player - more anon - consider the films we suffer through to earn our modest dejeuners sur le plage. From Mexico, opening the Directors Fortnight, came Dana Rotberg's Angel De Fuego, a muddy-lit circus tale weighed down with ten-ton religious symbolism. From Canada, opening the Critics Week, came John Pozer's The Grocer's Wife, a surreal tale of small-town passion after - a long way after  -Twin Peaks. And from Germany, opening the 'Un Certain Regard' section came Michael Schottenberg's Averill's Arrival. In this a young man trapped between train connections finds himself in a nightmare town crowded with senseless bureaucracy and semaphoric non sequiturs. We would call the film Kafka-esque if we did not have some respect for Kafka. Scarcely does the champagne glass touch the lips in Cannes '92 before it is dashed by the summons to another subtitled torture session. No wonder The Player, Altman's satirical tilt at Hollywood based on the novel by Michael Tolkin, was received with near-demented joy. It is a comedy masquerading as a mystery thriller. Through the story of go-getting studio mogul Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) and his killing of a young screenwriter - suspected author of the poison-pen postcards Mill has been receiving - Altman sends his own poison-pen postcard to a movie industry that has marginalised him since his heyday with MASH and Nashville. Astonishingly, the whole of Tinseltown's front-of-camera division seems to have signed on for Altman's film. Grateful to bite the corporate hand that feeds itself from their talent, cameo-playing stars like Cher, Bruce Willis, Julia Roberts and Burt Reynolds dash in and out of the story with their mogul-spiting one-liners. Meanwhile Robbins excels as the Baby Face Thalberg trying to reform the system without actually changing it: the story of Hollywood's exercise of power through the ages. The Player opens in Britain soon: more then. Britain's own competition entries are James Ivory's Howards End and Terence Davies's The Long Day Closes, both May openers in the UK and both tipped for prizes at Cannes. Ivory's tour-de-Forster has been a huge hit here already and a buzz is growing around Davies's portrait of his childhood, sequel to Distant Voices, Still Lives, which has its official screening this week. I have seen it and will bet my stamp collection that it wins a major Palm. But you see the problem? We are looking forward since there is nothing much to look back to. Even the stars have not electrified the headlines. First among equals have been Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone who brought Basic Instinct to Cannes as opening film, with more snores than shockwaves resulting. The French, especially, could not understand why a simple tale of passion between a detective with a Versace suit and a blonde with an ice pick was supposed to scandalise le tout Europe. It is strange, though, is it not, how movie motifs spread. Ice picks are now definitely 'in.' A Russian director trying to sell more tickets to his film described it in his blurb as 'reality with an ice pick to the head.' And in Hal Hartley's mildly hypnotic Simple Men - the only Competition film within a mile of The Player and Howards End - a character also talks in passing of heads and ice picks. From the maker of Trust here is a simple tale of two brothers looking for their jail-escaped dad through the crazy boondocks of Long Island. Instead they find romance and a peculiar wisdom. The dialogue could be by Beckett, the visuals by Mondrian, the pace by a snail. But at least it is funny and original; and at least, if not aiming an ice pick at the audience's frozen brain, the film does suppose that we have brains. Too little of that at Cannes so far. Jury President Gerard Depardieu has joined the long line of Cannes jury supremos who instruct their peers to favour films appealing to the 'heart not the head.' Oh come now. This is a major European film festival. A little brain food would not be amiss, would it? We can get heart-warmers any day from TV or Hollywood; or from Cannes gossip columnists weaving desperate romantic tittle-tattle from a Cote d'Azur swarming with glittering people not yet doing glittering things.</p>

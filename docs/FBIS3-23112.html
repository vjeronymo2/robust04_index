Briefing newsmen in New  Delhi today, the city police commissioner, Mr. N.B. Kaushal,  disclosed that they had planned to create disturbances, attack  religious places, and use poison. He said it is for the first  time that Pakistan used its own nationals for such operations  who are trained and experienced in guerrilla warfare and  insurgency. Sixteen kg of explosives, detonators, hand  grenades, and Pakistani passports were seized from the arrested  persons who belong to the Islamic Inqilabi Mahaz [Revolutionary  Front]. Two sets of floppies were also seized from the  terrorists, who were planning to prepare a computer. Cases  against them have been registered, and they were remanded to  police custody.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of their primarily pelagic existence, leatherbacks normally occur outside of areas where they would be subject to take by shrimp trawlers. During most months of the year, leatherbacks are not considered abundant in shrimping areas, and only isolated incidents of take by trawlers are expected. However, the coastal waters of northern Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina experience relatively high abundance levels of leatherbacks as a periodic spring phenomenon. When leatherback abundance is high and shrimp trawlers are fishing, leatherback stranding pulses have been documented on adjacent beaches. A NMFS Biological Opinion prepared for a revision to the sea turtle conservation regulations made on December 4, 1992, (52 FR 24244) episodic stranding events from Florida through North Carolina and required NMFS to develop and implement a contingency plan to solve this problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A contingency plan for protection of leatherback turtles on the Atlantic seaboard that can be implemented, if necessary, was prepared in cooperation with State officials from Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. The necessity for implementation of protective measures for leatherback turtles is expected to be short-term and apply to specific areas. The plan considers several options to provide protection, and any or all of them may be implemented, if necessary, pursuant to 50 CFR 227.72(e)(6). These options include, closure of areas to all fishing, use of restricted tow-times in lieu of TEDs, mandatory observers, and use of modified TEDs designed to exclude leatherback turtles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Presence of Leatherback Turtles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During December of 1993 and January and February 1994, NMFS received regular reports of leatherback sightings in northern Florida. These sightings occurred during aerial surveys for right whales, conducted by the state of Florida from St. Marys, Georgia, to Sebastian Inlet, Florida. During December, sighting rates ranged from 12 to 49 leatherbacks per survey. During the first week of January, 15 sightings were reported. The level of leatherback turtle sightings at this time of the year is consistent with data from previous years. The turtles normally migrate northward during the months of March through June from Florida waters to those off North Carolina.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Sea Turtle Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the information presented and evidence indicating that shrimp trawlers may incidentally take endangered leatherback sea turtles, the AA has determined that immediate action may be necessary to conserve sea turtles. The AA has determined that incidental takings of leatherback sea turtles during shrimp trawl fishing in the leatherback conservation zone are unauthorized unless these takings are consistent with the applicable biological opinions and associated incidental take statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A biological opinion addressing the potential adverse effects of shrimp trawling to endangered and threatened species was conducted in 1992 for final sea turtle conservation regulations. The opinion concluded that, ``episodic take of leatherback turtles by shrimp trawlers during periods of high jellyfish abundance must be eliminated.'' A biological opinion on this action analyzed the impact of shrimp trawl fishing in the leatherback conservation zone on endangered leatherback turtles. The opinion emphasizes the need for additional protective measures such as requiring the use of TEDs with escape openings large enough for leatherback sea turtles to escape in areas where high abundance levels of leatherbacks are observed. The incidental take statement issued with this opinion allows for the documented take of 20 leatherback turtles and mortality of four leatherback turtles. If observer reports or other information indicate that this incidental take is met or exceeded, consultation must be reinitiated, and the AA may require additional or more stringent conservation measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definitions in 50 CFR 217.12 are applicable to this action, as are all relevant provisions in 50 CFR parts 217, 222 and 227.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``leatherback conservation zone'' means all inshore and offshore waters of the Atlantic area from Cape Canaveral, Florida (28 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; 24.6 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; N latitude), to the North Carolina-Virginia border (36 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; 30.5 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; N latitude).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS hereby notifies owners and operators of shrimp trawlers in the leatherback conservation zone that short-term closures in specific areas may be required to protect endangered leatherback turtles. Weekly aerial surveys will be conducted from northern Florida through the North Carolina-Virginia border. If sightings of leatherback turtles during such surveys exceed 10 animals per 50 nautical miles (nm) of trackline, the survey will be replicated within 12 hours, or as soon as practicable, to ensure that leatherback turtle presence is persistent in the area. If surveys demonstrate the continued presence of large concentrations of leatherbacks NMFS will temporarily close these specific areas to any shrimp trawler required to have a NMFS-approved TED installed in each net rigged for fishing, unless the TED installed is one of the NMFS-approved TEDs as described below. In addition, owners and operators of vessels operating in closed areas with an allowed TED, described below, must register with the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, in accordance with 50 CFR 227.72(e)(6)(v) (A) through (F). If requested, they must carry a NMFS-approved observer on board such vessel(s). A shrimp trawler in the leatherback conservation zone must comply with the terms and conditions accompanied by any such request as well as provide information on trawling hours, gear modifications and turtle captures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific area closures will be announced in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , on the NOAA weather channel, and in newspapers and other media. Shrimp trawlers in the leatherback conservation zone are responsible for monitoring the NOAA weather channel for closure announcements. Shrimp trawlers may also call (813) 893&hyph;3163 for updated area closure information. Closure will take effect upon public filing with the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS-Approved TEDs With Escape Openings Large Enough for Leatherback Sea Turtles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS previously approved the Taylor TED and two modifications to the Morrison TED that will allow leatherback turtles to escape the trawl. Descriptions of the Taylor TED and the Morrison modifications were published on May 17, 1993 (58 FR 28795).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Sea Turtle Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS anticipates that shrimp trawlers may continue to interact with leatherback turtles throughout the summer. As necessary, the AA may extend, for additional 30-day periods, the restrictions described in this temporary rule through notification in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the AA may modify, at any time, the requirements of this action through notification in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , to ensure adequate protection of endangered and threatened sea turtles. Under this procedure, the AA will impose any necessary additional or more stringent measures if NMFS determines that shrimp trawlers are having a significant adverse effect on sea turtles. For example, if monitoring to assess turtle mortality indicates that the incidental take level is approaching the level established by the biological opinion for this action issued under section 7 of the ESA, the AA may modify or add conservation measures to protect leatherback sea turtles. That level is 20 documented takes, including four by mortality of leatherback turtles. If the incidental take level is met or exceeded, if significant or unanticipated levels of lethal or nonlethal takings or strandings occur that are associated with fishing activities in the leatherback conservation zone, or if there is significant non-compliance with this action, additional measures may be imposed. Additional restrictions may include closing the entire leatherback conservation zone to all shrimping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AA has determined that this action is necessary to respond to an emergency situation to conserve and provide adequate protection for leatherback turtles. This action is consistent with the ESA and other applicable law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because neither section 553 of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) or any other law requires that a general notice of proposed rulemaking be published for this action, under section 503(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, an initial regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

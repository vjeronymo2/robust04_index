			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Khartoum, 27 June (KNA/PANA) -- Egypt has  released 89 Sudanese nationals in the northern town of Aswan,  after denying them entry and detaining them, state-run  television of Omdurman reported late Saturday [25 June]. It  reported that the Sudanese were held for seven hours. The  travellers, mostly middle-aged men, told the television that  they were held in a dining hall in a ferry named Saq al-Naam  somewhere between Aswan and Wadi Halfa. They were denied  drinking water and the opportunity to pray. The detainees said  they were packed in a hot room without air-conditioning, while  told by an Egyptian official that they would be allowed to  continue to Cairo. Detainees said they were guarded by regular  armed Egyptian troops during their interrogations and that they  were returned back to Sudan without any explanation.    Only old men and women were allowed to proceed to Cairo but  all able-bodied and young men were returned to Sudan. The  Sudanese travellers, who appeared frustrated and upset, told the  Sudan television that their luggage and money had been stolen  while they were in detention.    Commenting, Sudanese television said that it was clear that  the Egyptian authorities had adopted the measure as a precaution  against any infiltration of alleged Islamic fundamentalists.

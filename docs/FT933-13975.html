			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Two of a Kind: Something agnostic in the state of Denmark - Central bankers who are sceptical about deeper European Union Mr Erik Hoff-meyer, the 68-year-old governor of the Danish National Bank, is the grand old sceptic of European central banking. In office since 1965, Mr Hoffmeyer has enjoyed a close-up view of three decades of monetary turbulence. He has witnessed the virtues of European integration - and its limits. From the National Bank's bunker-like building in Copenhagen, he delivers a blunt judgment on the Maastricht plan for economic and monetary union. 'Ever since Maastricht was signed, the awkward thing has been that we have been discussing things which will probably never materialise.' Mr Hoffmeyer believes Germany, ostensibly a driving force behind European monetary union, does not really want it. 'If there was a referendum (in Germany) Emu would probably be defeated.' The Danish krone this week has been caught up in the latest currency turbulence centred on the French franc. Asked about the dilemma faced by France - whether to wait for the long-term rewards of stability against the D-Mark, or to submit to foreign exchange market pressures - Mr Hoffmeyer says obliquely: 'It's a question of patience.' He points to the 'rather strict' Maastricht limits on public debts and deficits which will determine which EC members can participate in Emu. 'The convergence criteria are obviously of German origin, and I can imagine the Germans had an idea of how difficult it would be to fulfil them.' Mr Hoffmeyer, a sagacious, soft-spoken man, is one of the best-known representatives of a small EC state which, by rejecting the treaty in June 1992, erected the first roadblock on the EC's path to union. The Danes ratified Maastricht in a second referendum in May, but only after gaining exemptions for the country from most aspects of the treaty, including Emu. Mr Hoffmeyer has a reputation for outspokenness. In the early 1980s, he warned that Denmark was 'sliding into the abyss' because of high public debt and inflation. In May, he complained that European currency co-operation had 'collapsed' because of competitive ERM devaluations. Mr Hoffmeyer admits there is much he does not understand about economies' behaviour and financial markets. He confesses he has mixed feelings about Maastricht. Before the 1992 referendum, Mr Hoffmeyer says he argued in favour of the treaty. A seat on the board of the proposed European central bank, he says, would have given the Danes greater leverage over European monetary policymaking, at present dominated by the German Bundesbank. 'Inside, we would have some influence. If you look at it logically, it's better to be inside than outside.' On the other hand, Mr Hoffmeyer doubts that Europe should pool decision-making in areas which are the fundamental preserve of national policy. 'We are moving too close to areas which have an effect on national identity. If we didn't have European union, it would not be a catastrophe. The essential aims are to prevent war between countries and to continue economic and political integration. You can do that without union.' Mr Hoffmeyer's views have been influenced by living with a large, powerful southern neighbour. Alone among foreign central bank chiefs, he has known all past presidents of the Bundesbank. A teenager during the German wartime invasion of Denmark, he fled to Sweden, and forged links with the resistance. At the Bundesbank's Frankfurt headquarters, Mr Hoffmeyer still ranks as a resistance fighter. After publishing a scholarly book last year on monetary history, Mr Hoffmeyer was chided by some Bundesbank officials for highlighting a German desire to flex political muscle in currency squalls. Mr Hoffmeyer admits his own central bank's muscles are rather weak. Under its 1936 statutes, the Danish National Bank is independent from the government. However, the National Bank's basic monetary stance, like that of other ERM central banks, is largely set by the Bundesbank. This follows almost inevitably, he says, from Germany's economic strength. 'The more integrated you are, the more dependent you are. Even during the period when we were more dependent on the dollar, I had the feeling that we mostly depended on Germany. I had no difficulties over that.' Mr Hoffmeyer - who retires at the end of 1994 at 70 - says he has become progressively more wedded to German-style anti-inflation policy. 'During the 1970s, my views changed. Inflation acts like a dissolvent on society. This became apparent in Denmark in the late 1970s. There was an uncomfortable feeling of instability.' Implementation of anti-inflation policies has less to do with dogma than with public opinion, Mr Hoffmeyer says. In the German-orientated ERM 'core' countries - including Denmark - electorates have been willing to sacrifice employment in return for more price stability. 'Over the time I have been at the National Bank, we have moved from full employment to more than 10 per cent unemployment, and from inflation of 15 to 17 per cent to a level of 1 1/2 per cent. I cannot say whether price stability is the prime condition for growth. But it has proved impossible simultaneously to fulfil the two objectives of price stability and high employment. 'People now seem to prefer price stability to full employment. The choice has been made not by the politicians but by the people.' In view of economic contraction in his country and many of its EC partners, the agnostic Mr Hoffmeyer leaves open the possibility that, one day, priorities could shift again.</p>

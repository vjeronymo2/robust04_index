			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (10): A force to be reckoned with - Profile, Central Bank Governor Alfons Verplaetse Somewhere near the top of the list of movers and shakers in modern Belgium stands Mr Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the central bank. His affable manner - accompanied by guttural chuckles and the occasional 'ooh-lah-lah' when describing the tumultuous events in the currency markets in 1993 - offers few clues as to the importance of his job. But make no mistake: 'The Fons' is a force to be reckoned with. As head of the National Bank of Belgium, Mr Verplaetse is the guardian of the national currency. He is the co-architect and standard bearer of the long-standing policy of shadowing the D-Mark, a policy which has served as the counter-inflationary anchor for Belgium but which came under severe strain during last summer's currency crisis inside the European Monetary Suystem. Mr Verplaetse also played an influential, if at times mildly controversial, backroom role last year ahead of negotiations between government, employers and trades unions on the global pact to bolster competitiveness, cut social spending and create more jobs. The governor supplied the intellectual framework (and the number-crunching) for the pact. Mr Verplaetse has been governor of the National Bank since 1989. Born in Zulte, in western Flanders, he took a degree in commercial science at the Catholic University of Leuven, and joined the bank in 1953. His career took off when he became chef de cabinet of then prime minister Wilfried Martens, where his formative experience was preparing the currency devaluation in 1982 which set Belgium back on the path of fiscal orthodoxy. Mr Verplaetse is a numbers man to his fleshy finger-tips. He rolls off figures with ease, pausing only to confirm their accuracy in the ever present annual report of the National Bank. Similarly, he pays discreet reference to his daily telephone conversations with his counterparts in Amsterdam, Luxembourg, Paris, and Frankfurt - one more sign of the close co-operation these days between the 'hard core' currency club within the European exchange rate mechanism. The spirit of co-operation was sorely tested last summer when market scepticism about the pace of interest rate reductions in Germany triggered a wave of attacks on the Belgian franc, the Danish krone and the French franc. Finance ministers responded by widening the ERM fluctuation bands from 2.25 and 6 per cent to 15 per cent on either side of the central rates. Mr Verplaetse supported the decision, but it led to severe pressure on the Belgian franc throughout the autumn. Market operators, having witnessed the virtual collapse of the ERM, were determined to test the resolve of the Belgian authorities. Looking back, Mr Verplaetse says the National Bank's strategy was straightforward: 'We had to buy time for the government.' This involved two separate manoeuvres. The first was a rise in short-term interest rates which risked choking off the early signs of economic recovery. The second was a more complicated effort to support the government's plan to secure an agreement on an austerity pact with unions and employers. In retrospect, even Mr Verplaetse is guarded about the experience. On the one hand, the social pact included some 80 per cent of the Verplaetse panel's recommendations; but the experience of not being able to secure a consensus across the board clearly came as a surprise to the governor. 'It was a new phenomenon,' he says, noting that in 1982 it was easier. A Belgian Cabinet minister is blunter: 'It was a mistake, and it will not happen again.' However noble the political intention, the impression was left that the National Bank was ready to compromise its independence, just at the time when central bank independence is a key tenet of the Maastricht treaty's provisions for European monetary union. Yet without the contribution of Mr Verplaetse, it is doubtful if the global pact would have got off the ground.</p>

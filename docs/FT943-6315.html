			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Banks set to make Pounds 100m on WPP swap A syndicate of 28 international banks which acquired convertible preference shares in WPP, the international advertising group, as part of a Dollars 271.6m (Pounds 176m) debt-for-equity swap two years ago expect to make a profit of around Pounds 100m when the shares are sold, probably later this week. The banks including Barclays, National Westminster, Midland and JP Morgan will convert 169.5m of the convertible preference shares they hold into 190.2m ordinary shares after the close of business on the London Stock Exchange tomorrow and are free to sell the shares immediately. The shares, representing a 26.5 per cent stake in WPP's enlarged capital, are expected to be sold to UK and overseas institutional investors. The placing is being organised by a consortium comprising Bankers Trust International, JP Morgan Securities and SG Warburg Securities. The sale highlights WPP's remarkable recovery. Earlier this month the company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 36.2m for the first half, up 50 per cent on the figures a year earlier, helped by falling interest charges and improving margins. The bank syndicate agreed to swap the Dollars 271.6m of debt for 239.5m new convertible preference shares in July 1992 when WPP was suffering from the recession in the advertising industry and struggling to service its high borrowings. The preference shares were originally convertible into ordinary shares at a notional price of 60p a share, but the conversion price was lowered to about 45p after WPP held a rights issue at that price in March last year. Since then WPP's share price has soared and closed at 119p on Friday compared with a low of 22.5p. The shares are expected to be placed at around 100p. Under the terms of the debt-for-equity swap the banks converted a quarter of their preference shares last September and sold the resulting ordinary shares for around a Pounds 16m profit. The final tranche of the bank's 12.2m convertible preference shares is convertible at any time. Conversion of these shares would mean the issue of a further 13.7m new ordinary shares - 1.9 per cent of the enlarged capital - and would eliminate the overhang of WPP paper.

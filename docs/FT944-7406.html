			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian coal tender result worrying for steel producers Steel producers have been given a sharp reminder of the state of the coking coal market with the results of a tender by the Steel Authority of India. Not only has it been undersubscribed - there simply is not enough coal available - but prices are up to Dollars 10.50 higher than the current level of the Japanese steel mills' contracts of Dollars 45.45 a tonne, free on board Australia and Canada. The tender result comes just as coking coal suppliers are gathering in Tokyo at the start of negotiations of prices for deliveries in 1995-96. Although the steel mills have offered roll-over prices, the debate will be over not whether there will be a price rise but the extent of that rise. The Indian tender saw just 1.5m tonnes offered against a request for 2m for 1995 supply. A further 450,000 tonnes was bid but breached the stringent World Bank conditions for qualifying bidders. The result has put the mill in an extreme quandary. Not only are the prices high - the lowest Australian bid is Dollars 7.50 higher than the Japanese price - but the option to offer more tonnage in exchange for coal producers being flexible on price levels is not available this year: there simply is no coal available. Steel producers in Asia and Europe are bracing themselves for higher price levels - particularly in Europe where fob prices are between Dollars 2.50 (for Australian supplies) and Dollars 6 (for Canadian) lower than for similar coals sold in Japan. As the Indian tender demonstrates, the anxieties are not limited to prices; supplies are extremely short. While this has caused great inconvenience in 1994, with steel production recovering from the slump of the previous two years, in 1995, when even higher steel output is expected, the shortage could become critical. Although some slight expansion of output is possible in Queensland and Canada, it is thought that this will not compensate for reductions in US availability. If these were not problems enough, there has been a major derailment of a coal train in Queensland, halting the flow of steam and coking coal to the coal ports of Hay Point and Dairymple Bay. Although the line is expected to be fully operational within a week, this disruption will be felt immediately. Coming hard on the heels of two derailments of the South Africa coal export line to Richards Bay and of severe flooding of the pits in Colombia's Guajira region, the Queensland mishap has reinforced the view that the 1994 coal market is jinxed.</p>

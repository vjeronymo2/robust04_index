			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, June 17 (XINHUA) -- The Cambodian  Government decided today to expel the representative office of  the Khmer Rouge from the capital Phnom Penh.    Meanwhile, government forces have begun bombing the western  town of Pailin heralding another major assault on the Khmer  Rouge stronghold, according to Khmer Rouge sources tonight.    Cambodian television has broadcast messages from the  co-ministers of interior affairs Sar Kheng and You Kockry who  said that the people of Phnom Penh are "indignant" over the  failure of the round-table meeting on June 15-16, and indicated  they would retaliate against the representative office.    The government has warned it can no longer guarantee the  safety of the Khmer Rouge staff in Phnom Penh and recommended  them to leave before June 19.    But it will ensure their safety to the airport if they  advise  a departure timetable at least one day before leaving.    However, the government stressed that if any staff miss the  deadline, anything could happen and it will not protect them if  they are attacked.    A spokesman also read out a strongly-worded statement on  television tonight, denouncing the Khmer Rouge for rejecting a  ceasefire proposal by King Sihanouk and thus rejecting the will  of the nation and the people.</p>

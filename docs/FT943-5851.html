			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking emerges as carmakers weaken Wall Street US stocks succumbed to profit-taking yesterday, as investors regrouped after a week-long surge in share prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 3.88 easier at 3,913.42, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 softened 0.59 to 475.50. Still, rising issues outnumbered declines on the Big Board by a four-to-three margin. Heavy program-guided trading lifted New York SE volume to 357m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 1.65 at 454.34, but the Nasdaq composite closed 0.84 down at 765.62. On balance, the day's conflicting economic news was neutral for the stock market. The Commerce Department reported a 2.3 per cent fall in factory orders, against forecasts of a 2.0 per cent decline. The slowdown supported the notion that the economy was cooling down enough to delay the Federal Reserve's move to tighter money. The credibility of that scenario, which had been responsible for the recent rally, was reinforced by the monthly survey of Purchasing Management Association of Chicago. The trade group said its August index of business activity receded from the previous month's level. However, the prices-paid component of the Chicago report showed a jump, unsettling the inflation-sensitive bond market during the morning. Although Treasury prices later recovered, equity investors could not get back on track after running up the value of Dow industrials by 4.5 per cent over the previous six sessions. But the profit-taking remained light. General Motors, off Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 50 1/4 , showed the biggest drop among the 30 Dow components. Some of GM's weakness was linked to renewed concern over Chrysler's future performance. Shares in the third-largest US car maker fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48 1/8 on reports that company insiders had sold stock valued at Dollars 7m in late July. Ford shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 29 1/4 . Semiconductor shares were the session's hardest hit sector. Texas Instruments tumbled Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 77 7/8 after SoundView Financial Group downgraded the issue. Earlier, a Japanese court rejected the company's claim of patent infringement by Fujitsu. Micron Technology, which was also knocked off SoundView's 'buy' list, lost Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 40 1/4 . NorAm Energy, a leading gas utility and pipeline operator, surged ahead 21 per cent to Dollars 7 1/4 . The net gain of Dollars 1 1/4 came in a response after a federal court in Houston threw out a long-standing lawsuit against the company. In the pharmaceuticals sector, which has come to life amid a flurry of high profile acquisitions, Warner-Lambert gave back Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 83 5/8 . During the previous session the stock bounded Dollars 5 5/8 higher on takeover speculation. On the positive side, Philip Morris strengthened Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 61 in trade of 8.7m shares on its announcement of a dividend increase and an ambitious stock buy-back programme. It was a relatively quiet day on the Nasdaq after eight straight sessions on the upswing. But Castle Energy jumped Dollars 3 1/2 , or 25 per cent, to Dollars 17 5/8 , its highest level in the past 52 weeks. The company settled a contractual dispute with Metallgesellschaft, the German group. Canada Toronto closed higher after moderate trading, extending its rise to four sessions. The TSE 300 index added 15.79 at 4,349.50 and advances led falls by 410 to 327. Volume came to 69.2m shares. Twelve of the 14 sub-indices rose, led by golds, up 1.7 per cent. Seagram, CDollars  1/2 firmer at CDollars 44 3/8 , reported better than expected second-quarter earnings and a quarterly dividend lifted to 15 cents from 14 cents. Mexico Equities lost ground for a fifth consecutive session, leaving the market's principal index below its level prior to the August 21 presidential elections for the first time. The IPC index slipped 30.11, or 1.1 per cent, to 2,702.73. Another surprising rise in bellwether Treasury bill rates and post-election fears of a renewal of troubles by the revolutionary faction in the southern state of Chiapas conspired to drive the sell-off. At the Bank of Mexico's weekly auction, rates for 28-day Cetes, or Treasury Bills, rose 51 basis points to 14 per cent - more disappointment for a market expecting a sharp post-electoral drop in rates.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: AHP defends delicate chemistry of Dollars 9.7bn acquisition - The merger with American Cyanamid has left some industry experts puzzled American Home Product's successful Dollars 9.7bn acquisition of American Cyanamid this week is only the latest, but certainly largest, convulsion to shake the troubled pharmaceuticals industry. The merger of the two groups will create the world's fourth-largest drug company, behind Merck, Glaxo, and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Combined turnover will be about Dollars 12.5bn, of which drug and health care products will account for almost 75 per cent. The industrial logic of the deal, unlike with SmithKline Beecham's asset-swap with Cyanamid proposed earlier this month, is not immediately clear. Admittedly, there is little product overlap. AHP produces top-selling food and consumer products such as Chef Boyardee pasta and Chap Stick, but is best-known for its drug brands. These include the headache tablets Advil and Anacin, the estrogen drug Premarin, and the contraceptive Norplant. Cyanamid's drug unit Lederle is known for its vaccines, cancer agents, antibiotics and Centrum vitamins. However, this impressive list of products does not tell the full story. Industry analysts say AHP's range of drugs is ageing rapidly, and facing intensifying competition from newer drugs on an increasingly price-sensitive market. There is nothing to suggest that the acquisition of Cyanamid will help rectify the situation. Lederle has not produced a new drug in years, and both Cyanamid and AHP have been consistently criticised for the poor quality of their research and development. 'Lumping two stones together doesn't make them float any better,' says one analyst. 'What is key is that the combined group starts producing some innovative products that can generate volume growth.' One potential route for greater innovation is the combination of the two groups' biotechnology businesses. AHP is a majority owner of Genetics Institute, and Cyanamid a majority owner of Immunex. Between the two, AHP will control a formidable biotech operation, says Mr Arvind Desai, an analyst with the independent US research firm Metha and Isaly. 'In terms of dollars spent on biotech research, it will be comparable to Roche's Genentech.' AHP, however, says there are no plans for merging Genetics Institute and Cyanamid's Immunex in the near term. There are the interests of the minority shareholders to consider, and Mr John Stafford, AHP's chairman, believes early benefits can be achieved from closer co-operation between the two biotech companies. While AHP sets about integrating the companies' drug businesses, the big question is what will it do with Cyanamid's agricultural-chemicals operation? Many Wall Street analysts believe it will be sold, if only because AHP will need to reduce its heavy debt load soon, and because there should be no shortage of buyers, at least for the non-animal health parts of it. Says Mr Desai: 'The agrochemicals business of Cyanamid is very attractive because it's in a fairly consistent growth pattern with high operating margins. By the end of next year, it could be worth Dollars 4.5bn or even Dollars 5bn.' However, specialists in agrochemicals are more doubtful about such large figures. They argue that with sales of about Dollars 1.7bn a year, it might command one to one and half times sales, but no more. The animal health business, with annual sales of about Dollars 305m, would command a lower premium. As for who might buy the agrochemicals business, Mr Desai names Zeneca of the UK; AgrEvo, the joint-venture between Hoechst and Schering of Germany; Rhone-Poulenc of France; and Ciba of Switzerland. Monsanto, Dow Chemical and Du Pont in the US are also mentioned. There would be few takers for the animal health operations. This speculation, however, is off the mark, says Mr Stafford, who insists that the agrochemicals unit is a good fit for AHP. 'It's growing. It's technology-based, which is consistent with our approach to the business. It's really an outstanding business, and will become part of our diversified portfolio.' Although the only obvious synergy between Cyanamid's agricultural unit and AHP is in the area of veterinary pharmaceuticals, Mr Stafford says there is unrealised potential in the business. 'It has a chemical library of some 300,000 compounds; by using today's technology, it can be screened for pharmaceutical uses - that can be an extra plus.' The immediate task for AHP is to start squeezing all the possible cost savings out of the merger. Considerable savings should be realised from eliminating the duplication of administrative, research and development, and marketing operations in the drugs businesses. Given AHP's renowned ability to control costs, analysts estimate that such savings could total as much as Dollars 300m a year. Saving money, however, was not the chief force behind the acquisition of Cyanamid, says Mr Stafford. 'The basic reasoning for doing this is not cost-reduction. The primary motivation is to build the business for the long term. It makes us a world player in vaccines. It dramatically increases our size in the pharmaceutical business worldwide. It gives us a position in Asian markets, where previously we were somewhat weak.' Yet, the company will have to move quickly on costs in order to start cutting into the Dollars 9bn in debt AHP took on to finance the purchase of Cyanamid. Mr Stafford is confident AHP can bear the debt burden for now. 'We can service and reduce the debt out of the cashflow of the combined companies. We may take other actions to help reduce debt, but we have no specific plans yet. And we'll still pay the dividend.' The deal may trigger even more cost-cutting in a sector that has already lost tens of thousands of jobs. One analyst comments: 'Either Mr Stafford has done his sums wrong, or there are huge cost savings in pharmaceuticals companies that we haven't even started to contemplate.' Meanwhile, the pressures of worldwide healthcare reform show no sign of letting up, and the fax machines of finance directors are known to be humming with proposals from investment bankers. This latest acquisition is unlikely to be the last.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- A message came to the  Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea from Otete  Gaston Mboyo, national chairman of the National Movement of the  Genuine Lumumbist Combatants of Zaire, on the occasion of the  second anniversary of the publication of the Pyongyang  declaration "Let Us Defend and Advance the Cause of Socialism".    In the message he said the Pyongyang declaration gave the  world's progressive people confidence in victory and courage by  showing them that the frustration of socialism and revival of  capitalism in the former Soviet Union and East European  countries does never mean the "end of socialism".    Noting that the world's revolutionary forces should be  reorganized with heroic Korea at the centre and that it is their  noble duty to defend Korea, the socialist bastion, he said they  would fight to discharge their international duty under the  Pyongyang declaration according to the idea of independence,  equality and anti-imperialism.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Warning of loss wipes 22p off Henlys' share price HENLYS GROUP, the motor trader, coach and bus manufacturer and distributor which has changed its name from Plaxton, yesterday warned that it would make a loss in the first half of 1992 and saw its shares slump 22p to 55p on the news. Mr Robert Wood, chief executive, said the problem area was the coach and bus manufacturing plant in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, where some of the 750 jobs would be cut in the autumn following a review by management consultants. Henlys had already cut coach production by closing three plants and concentrating production at the Scarborough plant. Mr Wood said that despite this action more was needed as demand had fallen again, even after a 60 per cent drop in the previous 18 months. He said that there were also teething problems with the group's new range of coaches. Henlys, which has half the UK market for luxury coaches but does not export them, has been trying to enter the Continental European market by introducing a range meeting European standards. Mr Wood said that other parts of the group were showing improved results, but that City forecasts of a small profit for the year were too optimistic. Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, is now forecasting an annual loss of Pounds 2.5m. In 1991 the group made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.8m, including an interim loss of Pounds 4.5m. Mr Wood said that cash flow was within budgeted levels and balance sheet gearing was in line with the 65 per cent recorded at the end of 1991.</p>

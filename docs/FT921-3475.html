			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall on concern over retail sales increase US TREASURY prices tumbled yesterday morning as traders registered their concern over inflationary pressures after a 1.3 per cent increase in February retail sales. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond crossed the 8 per cent level as the market responded to the data, which provided some evidence of economic recovery. In late trading, the long bond was  7/8 lower at 99 9/16 , yielding 8.03 per cent, while at the short end of the yield curve the two-year note was off 1/4 to yield 5.7 per cent. The market had expected retail sales to rise about 0.8 per cent in February and was surprised by the stronger figure. In addition, January sales were revised upward to show a rise of 2.1 per cent. Fear of inflation is starting to weigh on the bond market as the economy starts to show further signs of revival. Yields started to climb on Wednesday after President George Bush said economic growth was more important than the level of long-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange four-day system repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 3 15/16 per cent. The manoeuvre was widely expected and did not indicate a change in monetary policy. UK GOVERNMENT bonds fell nearly a quarter of a point as the market continued to fret about the government's forecast for borrowing in the next financial year. Traders said an opinion poll in a national newspaper, which predicted a hung parliament, and sterling weakness, also depressed the market. Attention is expected to focus on the opinion polls at the weekend, now a general election has been called. City economists believe a hung parliament is the most likely outcome of the election, according to a telephone poll conducted by Reuter news agency . The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from its opening of 113 7/16 to 113 7/32 . Among shorter-dated issues, the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 dropped from 100 15/32 to 100 1/4 . The Liffe gilt futures contract was heavily traded with a volume of 48,000 contracts, and slipped from 95.09 to 95.07. THE SPANISH government bond market dropped sharply on higher-than-expected inflation figures which wiped out any hopes of a cut in interest rates. Inflation for February rose by 0.7 per cent month-on-month, or 6.8 per cent year-on-year, compared with 5.9 per cent year-on-year in January. The market had expected a month-on-month increase of 0.1 per cent. Traders said there was a marked sell-off across the yield curve in response as many houses had taken long positions. The yield on the 11.60 per cent bond due 1997 moved from 11.03 per cent at the opening to 11.17 per cent. The 10-year issue - the 11.30 per cent bond due 2002 - saw its yield move from 10.67 per cent to 10.75 per cent. GERMAN government bonds fell on rumours the government is considering a scheme to extend a 25 per cent withholding tax on interest income to foreign investors. A spokesman for the German Finance Ministry later denied the rumour, but bunds ended the day slightly lower. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 88.28, fell to a low of 88.07 and ended at 88.23. JAPANESE government bonds ended unchanged to slightly lower in dull trading, mainly as a result of the yen's weakness against the dollar. The yield on the benchmark No 129 bond ended unchanged at 5.445 per cent after trading in a range of 5.425 to 5.445 per cent yesterday. The futures contract closed at 102.26, down from its opening level of 102.35, having traded in a range of 102.25 to 102.40. The unsecured overnight call rate was mostly traded at 5 per cent, up from 5 5/8 per cent on Wednesday.</p>

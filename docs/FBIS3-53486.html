In a statement following the inauguration of the renovated  general traffic department building in Madinat al-Nasr today,  al-Alfi asserted that the state is exposing any deviation,  corruption, or breach of the law, that confronting corruption is  the state's policy, and that no one is above the law.    On reports that some security officials are involved in the  case of the Madinat al-Nasr multimillionaire, who was arrested  recently, al-Alfi said that no conclusive evidence has been  brought against any security official and that the current  reports are mere rumors.    Al-Alfi added that the prosecutor is conducting his  investigations. Therefore, no premature judgment can be made.  However, if there were violations or someone was involved, this  will show up in the investigations. No one is above the law.    On the security forces' efforts to hunt down terrorists,  especially in Upper Egypt, and their shift to a defensive  position, al-Alfi denied this, stressing that the security  authorities have always been in control of the situation and  that they continue to take the initiative in tracking down the  terrorist elements.    He explained that the security authorities continue their  work day and night to confront any deviations or incidents  committed against the state's security and stability.    On Pakistan's expulsion of terrorist elements from its  territory and whether any of these terrorists have been  arrested, al-Alfi explained that there are continued contacts  with a number of states in this regard.</p>

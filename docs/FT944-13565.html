			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Coal traders fight 'support' for gas Coal traders are to complain to the European Commission that British Gas is receiving about Pounds 65m of 'support' from the Department of Social Security arising from the DSS's practice of paying gas bills directly for claimants who are in arrears. It is not possible for claimants who use solid fuel to get the same help, the traders say, and the market is distorted as a result. They will also complain that the system of pricing under which householders pay the same for gas throughout Britain distorts the market. The traders says this is possible because of British Gas's near monopoly.</p>

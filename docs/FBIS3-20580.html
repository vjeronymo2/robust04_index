After  purchasing the grain at the negotiated price, grain will be  supplied to the military at a stipulated price. Central and  provincial financial departments will share the price difference  for military grain supplies. Finances for military grain will be  managed by the provincial-level financial department. Grain  departments will be responsible for purchasing grain for the  military, and ensuring its supply.</p>

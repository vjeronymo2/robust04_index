			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> DUPREE GETS A TRYOUT  </P> <P> Running back Marcus Dupree showed up at Rams Park Monday, five years since he  last played football.  </P> <P> "It'd be like 'The Natural,' wouldn't it?" Coach John Robinson said of the  improbable comeback attempt.  </P> <P> Dupree, who sustained what everybody agreed at the time was a career-ending  knee injury while playing for the United States Football League's Portland  Breakers in 1985, still has a lot to prove, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Dupree apparently passed a physical exam Sunday. The Rams worked him out Monday  and were giving his reconstructed knee a more complex exam later in the day.  </P> <P> "It's been five years since I stepped on a football field," Dupree, 26, said.

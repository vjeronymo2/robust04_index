			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Waterglade management lose control The management of Waterglade International has lost its battle for control of the lossmaking property developer. It is to be replaced by the opposing shareholder group, led by Singaporean Winston Ng, writes Simon Davies. The new directors have undertaken to pursue a recapitalisation, which has become an urgent need for a company with negative shareholders funds of Pounds 10m. An immediate rights issue of Pounds 6m is expected. Mr David Cunningham, chairman, and the three other directors have resigned, and compensation for loss of office has been agreed. Mr Selwyn Midgen, Mr Anthony Midgen, Mr John Darby and Mr Derek Hayes will join Mr Ng on the new board.</p>

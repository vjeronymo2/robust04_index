			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): Nine selections from a global field of 1,400 - Two of this quarter's advisers see growth potential in the Pacific, and two pick Perpetual funds for total return / The experts' panel, Unit Trusts UNIT TRUSTS are often cited as an easy way for investors to own shares - but where does the beginner start? There are over 1,400 trusts to choose from. So we asked advisers to choose three unit trusts - one for income, one for capital growth and one for total return. They had complete freedom as to whether they opted for UK or overseas stock markets. Graeme Farquharson, of Hill Martin (Asset Management), says: 'Our approach to unit trust selection is 'top down'. We look at the providers first. How big are they? How long have they been managing funds? What is their overall performance? Only when it has satisfied our criteria does a management house go on our selected list. 'When we examine individual funds, we look at a number of factors in addition to performance: size, charging structure, the record of the indiviual manager, the investment philosophy. When performance is analysed, it should be on a offer-to-bid basis, and should be based on consistency over at least five years. 'Using the above criteria, my recommendations are: GROWTH: the Govett Pacific Strategy fund. 'We believe that the geographic area most likely to produce above-average growth in the medium to long term is the Far East, and we have selected a fund which can include investments in Japan. 'The Pacific Strategy fund was formed in 1987 and has been managed for the past three years by Peter Robson. The investment policy is 'top down', in that the asset allocation is decided first, based on information received from Govett's Singapore office, together with views gathered from brokers worldwide and its own research department. 'Performance has been splendid, the fund having produced just short of 140 per cent for the five years to January 1, 1993, and just under 40 per cent for one year to the same date. TOTAL RETURN: Buckmaster Income. 'While the Buckmaster Income fund is categorised as an income fund, its yield is relatively low at 4.25 per cent. This allows for both future income growth and a very real prospect of underlying capital growth. The fund has been managed for the past 3 1/2 years by Tim Gregory. 'The investment policy is 'top down', in that the macro strategy for a rolling five years is first agreed. Income funds have had considerable difficulty maintaining a high yield, due to the trend of dividend cuts and the effects of the recent changes in Advance Corporation Tax. This fund, however, achieves its core income from convertible preference shares, and is then free to make investments in lower-income, good-quality stocks. 'Performance has been good, with returns being 81 per cent for the five years to January 1, 1993 and 21.6 per cent for one year to the same date. INCOME: Perpetual High Income fund. 'Perpetual has built up a quite remarkable investment performance and won numerous industry awards. The High Income fund was formed in 1988, and is managed by Neil Woodford. It is invested to achieve a high income from a spread of international securities, with at least 50 per cent in the UK or EC. The current estimated gross yield is 5.13 per cent per annum. Past performance has been impressive, with growth of 38.5 per cent for the three years to January 1993.' Peter Tonkin, investment director of Towry Law, chooses: INCOME: GT Smaller Companies Dividend fund. 'In searching for a recommended income unit trust, I decided on an equity income fund, because of my wish to see a growing income. I choose a fund investing in UK companies, because the yields available are more attractive than those from most other markets. 'GT Smaller Companies Dividend fund, managed by Doug Hunter, was launched in September 1989, and is one of a handful of unit trusts seeking an above-average level of income from a portfolio of shares of smaller UK companies. 'The main investment theme of the fund is to choose companies which have good, solid businesses and sound managements but which are currently ignored by the stock market. These companies must have the potential, over the medium term, to grow their dividends, so that the fund can deliver income growth to investors. 'In June, the gross yield was just over 6 per cent - about 50 per cent higher than the average yield from UK equities. GROWTH: Schroder UK Enterprise Fund. 'I stay with the UK market in my selection of a growth fund. Looking ahead to further recovery in the economy, I pass over funds investing in our larger (and therefore more defensive) companies, searching instead for a fund which will move swiftly into those companies that are going to show above-average growth, and hopefully above-average share price rises, as economic conditions change. 'The Schroder UK Enterprise Fund, managed by Jim Cox, is my choice here. It is primarily a stock-picking fund. It has had an excellent performance since launch in August 1988, by focusing the portfolio on 40-45 stocks. TOTAL RETURN: Perpetual Global Bond fund. 'Now is the time for me to recommend exposure to overseas economies (and currencies) through bonds or fixed-interest investments via the Perpetual Global Bond fund. Perpetual appointed Alpha Global Fixed Income Managers as advisers to their fund. In June, the quoted gross yield was just under 6 1/2 per cent and the total return since launch in April 1992 had been more than 25 per cent - making it the top-performing fund in its sector over that period.' John Edwards, consultant, Berry Birch &amp; Noble, says: 'Recommending individual unit trusts is a mug's game. As the statutory warning says: past performance is not necessarily a guide to the future. Yesterday's winner often turns out to be tomorrow's loser. Unfortunately the contrarian theory, that poorly performing funds stand the best chance of moving to the top of the table, is not proven. Some unit trusts consistently lose value year after year. 'However, there are various basic criteria to be considered. First, there is the risk/reward ratio. Can the investor afford to lose in hopes of a big gain, or would he prefer something a bit safer with less potential reward? 'Unit trusts are essentially long-term investments, partly because it takes time to recoup dealing charges. But it depends on what is meant by long-term. It is no good simply selecting unit trusts or sectors which are currently flavour of the month. Things can change pretty quickly, and it is easy to ramp up short-term performance. For the long-term investor, it is important to take into account the record and pedigree of the companies offering unit trusts. 'For example, banks over the years have a dismal performance record, with few exceptions. Insurance companies may have other fish to fry, and not be too concerned about their unit trusts. 'So there is a case for picking unit trusts run by independently-owned investment houses with a long-term record. INCOME: Fidelity High Income. 'A few years ago, it would have been unthinkable not automatically to include M&amp;G and Fidelity in any list of unit trust recommendations. However, both groups have suffered considerable setbacks in their performance in the last few years, although they appear to have been recovering ground more recently. 'In fact, if income is required the recently launched Fidelity High Income trust is not a bad choice. It invests in a mixture of equities and fixed-interest securities. This helps to provide an above-average yield, stability in the event of a stock market crash, and the prospect of limited capital growth. It is an ideal vehicle for Pep investors wanting tax-free income. 'Newton Income has had a tremendous performance over the past five years. But there must be doubts as to whether this can be maintained following its transition from a small to large fund as the result of a big inflow of money. GROWTH: Schroder Pacific Growth. 'For capital growth, the best prospects for long-term capital growth appear to be offered by the Pacific Basin and Far East markets, including China but excluding Japan. Schroder has always been strong in that area, and its Pacific Growth fund has a consistently good record. TOTAL RETURN: Perpetual High Income. 'No one looking at unit trusts can ignore the all-round performance achieved by Perpetual in recent years. It has a cluster of top-performing trusts in several sectors. One could almost choose any of their funds. For total return, I would favour the Perpetual High Income fund, which not only has a reasonable yield but also a good growth record.'</p>

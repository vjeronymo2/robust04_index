			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> READING LIST ROSTER  </P> <P> California Senate Bill 813, enacted in 1983, asks that the content of  secondary-school courses stimulate an improvement in the effort and performance  of students nationwide. Thus spurred, the State Board of Education adopted  school curriculums (developed by the superintendent of public instruction) with  literary works of "compelling, intellectual, social or moral content," whose  example by way of excellent use of language would encourage writing and  discussion.  </P> <P> Individual choices are made by Orange County school district committees, taking  into account the perceived needs and abilities of their students. The Santa Ana  Unified School District has a short core list of requirements for teachers to  choose from (for example, one epic or one play among two or three). Extended  readings are made at teachers' discretion: English is a second language for a  large percentage of students.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach Union High School District, at the other end of the  spectrum, offers four tracks from grades 10 to 12: Honors, College Prep,  Readings List and Fundamental.  </P> <P> In the Capistrano Unified School District, junior and senior years don't share  a central curriculum: Students may choose from a variety of electives to  fulfill the necessary credits. The lists below only include English, American  and world literature classes; other elective classes offer such topics as sea  literature, sports literature and science fiction.  </P> <P> The lists compiled here began as lists of novels. However, because plays are  not distinguished from novels within the core list in the Santa Ana and  Capistrano school districts, drama has been added into other school district  lists for the sake of consistency.  </P> <P> ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT  </P> <P> Grade 9  </P> <P> * Animal Farm, by George Orwell  </P> <P> * Bless the Beasts and Children, by Glendon Swarthout  </P> <P> * Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens  </P> <P> * Hiroshima, by John Hersey  </P> <P> * The Ox-Bow Incident, by Walter Van Tilburg Clark  </P> <P> * Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry, by Mildred Taylor  </P> <P> * Treasure Island, by Robert Louis Stevenson  </P> <P> * Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds, by Paul Zindel  </P> <P> * I Remember Mama, by John Van Druten  </P> <P> * Romeo and Juliet, by William Shakespeare  </P> <P> * West Side Story, by Arthur Laurents  </P> <P> Grade 10  </P> <P> * Bless Me, Ultima, by Rudolfo A.

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Some Soviet conscripts will be let out of part of their military service and  students will be allowed to finish their studies before being inducted, Premier  Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told the Supreme Soviet, the nation's legislature. He said  that 175,500 students called up between 1986 and 1989 will be released from  service in August and September to continue their studies. Under certain  conditions some students may not have to return to the military after  completing their courses. The move, reflecting a more liberal attitude toward  conscription, was widely applauded by the Supreme Soviet, which passed a  resolution approving the measure with virtually no opposition.  </P></p>

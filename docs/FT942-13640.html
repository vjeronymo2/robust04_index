			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: CGT and you - a final / Many readers have written with comments and questions following the recent series in the Weekend FT on capital gains tax. In this follow-up article, Richard Chant and Alan Sugden examine three aspects not highlighted before - investment trusts, unit trusts and warrants - as well as queries on stock exchange investments INVESTMENT TRUSTS AND UNIT TRUSTS The main difference between these is that investment trusts (ITs) are what is known as closed-end funds and unit trusts (UTs) are open-ended. Investment trusts. The managers of ITs cannot create new shares to sell to investors except when an issue of new shares is made, and they can't buy in shares from investors. Hence the term closed-end. If you want to buy or sell shares in an IT, you do so in the market at the market price. This price depends on supply and demand, not the value of the trust's underlying assets. But some ITs have a finite life; at the end of it, they are wound up and the net proceeds distributed to the shareholders pro rata. The only other way out of an IT is if somebody comes along and bids successfully for it at a price closer to the underlying value of its assets. This has happened to several ITs in the past few years, including the Pounds 1.2bn Globe investment trust acquired by the National Coal Board pension fund in 1990. For CGT purposes, IT shares are treated just like any other. Unit trusts. Unlike the IT manager, the manager of a UT is able to create new units or cancel old ones as demand requires. Hence the expression open-ended. Buying and selling UTs is normally carried out through their managers at the offer or bid prices. These are based on the value of the UT's assets. To summarise: Investors in an IT can sell only at the market price - which might (and often used to) be at a substantial discount to the value of the trust's assets. Investors in a UT can get out at the underlying value, less expenses. UT equalisation. When you buy UT units from the manager, part of the cost is an accrual of income called equalisation. This is paid back to you with the next dividend; the tax voucher shows how much of the total paid is equalisation and how much is dividend. The equalisation is not taxed as income and, for CGT purposes, should be deducted from the cost of the units you bought. Apart from this, units in a UT are treated just like shares for CGT. ITs and UTs do not have to pay CGT on transactions within their portfolio of investments; this can give them a considerable advantage over the private investor. A chargeable gain or an allowable loss is made only when the IT shareholder or UT unit-holder sells. IT and UT monthly savings schemes. In March 1989, the Inland Revenue issued a Statement of Practice (5P 3/89) which introduced an optional alternative basis for indexation. Under this, the cost of shares or units invested through a monthly savings scheme during the accounting year of the IT or UT will be aggregated and treated as if they were a single investment made in the seventh month of that year. Thus, on any subsequent sale, the investor will have to make only one indexation calculation each year instead of 12. The optional basis can be used if the investor elects to do so within two years of the end of the tax year in which he disposes of units or shares acquired via a monthly savings scheme, and (i) the resulting gains, together with any other gains made in the year, exceed the CGT exemption for that year; or (ii) the total proceeds of disposals in that year exceed twice the annual exemption; or (iii) disposals in that year result in net losses. Further information on ITs and UTs. For personal information, we suggest readers write to the manager concerned. For general information, write to the secretary of the Association of Investment Trust Companies, Park House (6th Floor), 16 Finsbury Circus, London EC2M 7JJ; or to the secretary of the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, 65 Kingsway, London WC2B 6TD. Warrants A warrant is the right to buy a share at a certain price. Cost apportionment. To answer several readers' queries, let us see how this applies to an IT which issues shares and warrants in units of, say, five shares plus one warrant. The normal method, as shown in Table 4 of our third article (Zeneca/ICI: Weekend FT, March 19/20), is for cost apportionment to be done on the issue of a package containing warrants (see Table 1, Method A - Cost apportionment on issue). There is, however, an alternative method where warrants are issued to acquire shares of the same class. In this method, the warrants are treated as part of the holding of shares to which the warrant-holders are entitled to subscribe, and cost apportionment takes place on any disposal from that holding (See Table l, Method B - Cost apportionment on disposal). At least one IT uses this alternative method. The documents accompanying the issue of warrants should state which method to use but, if in doubt, we suggest readers write to the IT concerned. There are two reasons why it has become fashionable for ITs to issue shares with warrants. 1. IT shares usually stand at a discount to net asset value. 2. The net asset value initially is less than the issue price. This is because of issue expenses, dealing costs, and any initial charge made by the IT (known as front-end loading). The warrant element helps to bridge the adverse gap that otherwise would be likely between the first market value and the issue price. BTR warrants. Since 1988, a company called BTR has been making an annual scrip issue of warrants to its ordinary shareholders. BTR has confirmed that the alternative method, cost apportionment on disposal, should be used. This saves having to make a cost apportionment annually when further warrants are issued. When any part of the holding (BTR shares or warrants) are sold, the investor should make the following calculation, using the market prices on the day of disposal: A = Market value of shares or warrants sold. B = Market value of remaining holding (shares and warrants). C = Cost of entire holding indexed to date of sale. Cost apportionment: Shares or warrants sold = A (A+B) x C. Remainder of holding = B (A+B) x C. 'Free' shares Readers have asked about loyalty bonus shares in privatisation issues, and about the free issue of 100 shares made by Abbey National to each account-holder when it went public. Where there was a loyalty bonus, or where investors chose to receive a loyalty bonus rather than the vouchers offered in some issues, the value of the bonus shares received is treated as being the market value on the date they were issued. British Gas, for example, offered a one for 10 loyalty bonus (to a maximum of 500 shares) to subscribers who held their shares continuously from the offer for sale to December 31 1989. The market value on the issue of these loyalty shares was 234.5p apiece. Had the subscriber chosen the alternative of vouchers to set against future gas bills, the value of these should be deducted from the original cost of his holding. With Abbey National, the acquisition cost was nil. So, the treatment for CGT is this: 1. When a shareholder who has not bought any further shares in Abbey sells his 100, the whole of the proceeds of the sale is a chargeable gain. 2. When a shareholder who has also bought Abbey stock sells all or part of his holding, the 100 'free' shares are added to the pool at nil cost. Declaring losses A reader asks: When carrying losses forward, is it necessary or mandatory to enter the brought/forward losses in your tax return for years in which the b/f losses are not used to offset against gains in that year? To which the Inland Revenue replies: 'You must keep records of losses you wish to carry forward to future tax years. Your tax office cannot agree your losses until you have made a gain from which the loss can be deducted.' Our advice is to show the total of losses brought forward each year - whether or not you are going to use them in that year - for two very good reasons. First, doing so will help you keep track of them. Second, it will be easier to prove them to your tax office when the time comes to use them. Transfers between husbands and wives A number of readers are concerned that the Revenue might view transfers as avoidance of tax and refuse to accept them. As we said in our last article (March 27/28): 'The distinction between tax avoidance and tax planning is very fine.' We would suggest the following guidelines: 1. Ensure that the ownership of the security is transferred legally. 2 Although the date of the transfer normally is taken as the date of signing of the stock transfer form, do not sell before the new share certificate is received. The sale can then be made in the name of the new owner, who will give the new share certificate to the broker, and will be paid the net proceeds of the sale. 3. Do not agree the eventual sale before the transfer is made. 4. The new owner should hold the security for as long as possible in order to show that the sole purpose of the transfer was not merely to avoid tax. Rights issues - partial sale nil-paid When a shareholder sells some rights nil-paid to help pay for taking up the rest, is the sale deemed to be a disposal? The 5 per cent rule, described in our third article, applies here (see Table 2). Enhanced scrip dividends Readers asked for a worked example of a shareholder accepting both an enhanced share alternative and the broker's offer to purchase the new shares at a fixed price, free of any commission or dealing costs, for cash settlement. The calculation involves three share prices: the reference price (which is the average of the best bid and offer price over a specified period); the price on the first day of dealing; and the price offered by the broker (see Table 3. Indexation - making your tax return If your net chargeable gains amount to less than the annual exemption without indexation, but your total proceeds from disposals in that year exceed twice the annual exemption, ignore indexation and put a note with your transaction details to tell the tax inspector why you have done so. Valuing a dead person's estate In our first article (March 5/6), we said that an estate is valued using the open-market value on the date of death (or, if that was not a working day, on the last day for which prices were published before death). One reader has pointed out that this is correct for unit trusts. For shares, however, the executors can take the lower of the value of the portfolio on the last working day before death and the first working day after death. Transitional relief on indexation In our second article (March 12/13), we described the proposed changes to the rules on indexation. For disposals made on or after November 30 1993, indexation would be allowed only to reduce or eliminate a capital gain. It would no longer be possible to create or increase a loss by indexation. But modifications have now been made to the Finance Bill going through parliament. Under the modifications, individuals and trustees would be allowed to use indexation to create or increase losses by up to Pounds 10,000 on disposals between November 30 1993 and April 5 1995 (see table on Page VI). This would encourage loss-taking and bed and breakfasting between now and April 5 and could save the higher-rate taxpayer up to Pounds 4,000 in CGT.

WARRANTS ISSUED IN A 'PACKAGE'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- METHOD A - Cost Apportionment on issue. An Investment Trust issues shares and warrants in units of 5 shares plus 1 warrant, at a cost of Pounds 5.00 per unit. Let us say:         First market value of one share     = 97p         First market value of one warrant   = 25p         Thus First market value of one unit = 510p Cost apportionment:         Share   =    97p x (500/510)  = 95.1p         Warrant =    25p x (500/510)  = 24.5p         Unit    = (95.1p x 5) + 24.5p = 500p METHOD B - Cost Apportionment on disposal An Investment Trust issues shares and warrants in units of 5 shares plus 1 warrant, at a cost of Pounds 5.00 per unit. An investor buys 1,000 units at a cost of Pounds 5,000. Some time later he sells the warrants for Pounds 970 net.  Let us say that, on the date of sale, the market prices were:         Investment Trust shares   = 180p         Investment Trust warrants = 100p         Value of 5,000 shares   = 5,000 x 180p = Pounds 9,000         Value of 1,000 warrants = 1,000 x 100p = Pounds 1,000         Value of 5,000 units    = Pounds 10,000 Cost apportionment:         Shares   = Pounds 5,000 x (9,000/10,000) = Pounds 4,500         Warrants = Pounds 5,000 x (1,000/10,090) = Pounds 500 Chargeable gain on sale of 1,000 warrants:     - Pounds 970 - (Pounds 500 indexed to date of sale)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            TABLE 2. RIGHTS ISSUE - PARTIAL SALE NIL PAID  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- A company makes a 1 for 3 rights issue at 80p. Before the rights issue an investor held 30,000 shares, entitling him to subscribe for 10,000 new shares. He decides to sell 8,000 of his rights nil paid, to help pay for taking up the other 2,000, and does so at 14p, realising Pounds 1,094 net of expenses. He pays Pounds 1,600 to take up the remainder. On the first day of dealing ex-rights, the old shares stand at 94p. Is the sale deemed to be a disposal ? Let the proceeds of the sale of 8,000 rights = A = Pounds 1,094 and the value of his holding of the old shares that gave rise to the rights sold, ex-rights = B = 24,000 x 94p = Pounds 22,560                               A Pounds  1,094           The proportion sold = --- =            4.85%                               B Pounds 22,560 So, as this is less than 5%, the sale is not deemed to be a disposal. For CGT purposes, Pounds 1,094 is deducted from the cost of the original holding indexed to the date of sale.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                TABLE 3. ENHANCED SCRIP DIVIDENDS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The company declares a cash dividend of 10p per share, and offers shareholders the alternative of an enhanced scrip dividend of 15p per share. There is also an offer by the broker to buy the new shares. A shareholder who has a holding of 1,000 shares, with an indexed cost of Pounds 948, decides to take the enhanced scrip dividend and accept the broker's offer to buy his new shares. The reference price (the average of the best bid and offer prices over a specified period) is 150p, the price on the first day of dealing is 152p, and the broker's offer is 148p.                                      15p           Shares received = 1,000 x ---- = 100 shares                                     150p Income tax is based on the first day of dealing price: Net income (treated as 20% tax paid)= 100 x 152p = Pounds 152 Gross income = Pounds 152 x 100/80 = Pounds 190 Income tax payable will depend on the shareholder's marginal rate: Basic (25%) and lower rate (20%) taxpayers have no further liability to tax. Nil rate taxpayers will not be entitled to reclaim 20%, as the company has paid no ACT on the enhanced scrip dividend. Higher rate (40%) taxpayers will be liable to an income tax payment of (40% - 20%) x Pounds 190 = Pounds 38. Capital gains tax. The value of the 100 new shares is added to the indexed cost of the 1000 shares already held, to make a total of 1100 shares with a total cost of Pounds 948 + Pounds 152 = Pounds 1,100.  The cost apportioned to the 100 shares sold = Pounds 100.  The new shares were sold for Pounds 148, so the chargeable gain is Pounds 48. Fractional entitlements. Had there been a fractional entitlement, it would have been paid as a cash dividend at the cash dividend rate of 10p per share. eg: had our shareholder held 1,005 shares, a cash dividend of 10p per share would have been paid to him. ie: a cash dividend of 10p x 5 shares = 50p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

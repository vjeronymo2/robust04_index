			<p>BFN     [Text] The Government has stressed that it is not willing  to have any further discussions of the informal UN documents,  because Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas has not accepted  them. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said any further  discussions or an extension of the deadline would be  counterproductive if there is no Turkish political will to reach  a solution. Kasoulidhis was commenting on a statement by a U.S.  official to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC] that he  expects the Turkish side to be given two weeks to reply.    Kasoulidhis said the Cypriot Government expects the UN  secretary general's report to be submitted in accordance with UN  Security Council Resolution 902. He stressed that the report  should fully describe the facts, which speak for themselves. He  said there is no indication that the report and its conclusions  is a temporary measure.    In his statement to CyBC, the U.S. official said that if the  Turkish side continues its negative stance after the two-week  deadline, the UN Security Council will consider alternative ways  to implement its resolutions. The U.S. official said Robert  Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special coordinator on the  Cyprus issue, intends to discuss with the Turkish Government  ways to overcome the latest obstacles. According to the same  official, the basic obstacle is access to Famagusta. On this  issue, Denktas demands satisfaction regarding who will guard the  access and from what distance. The U.S. official said that  eight of the 70 issues that Denktas asked clarification on are  still pending.</p>

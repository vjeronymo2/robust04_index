			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today is the second day of the general strike by  civil servants of the public administration sector. The strike  action, called by one of the two national trade unions, the  Federation of Chadian Trade Unions, is being widely followed.  Here in Ndjamena the administration has been completely  paralyzed. Civil servants embarked on this strike action to  back their demand for their salaries, which they have not  received for several months.    In its recent petition to the government, the main trade  union federation called for the payment of two months of salary  arrears to civil servants working in Ndjamena and three months  of salary arrears to their counterparts in the provinces; the  regularization of the financial situation of workers who were  arbitrarily retired but later rehabilitated by the National  Salvation Council; and the regular payment of salaries and  allowances as of January, just to mention a few of the demands.    This strike action, which started yesterday, will end on 8  January, but may be renewed if demands are not met by then.</p>

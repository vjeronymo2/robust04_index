			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / France signals irritation over dissident arrests France signalled its irritation at the weekend over a further rash of dissident arrests, including the detention in Beijing of Xu Wenli, a prominent figure in the 'Democracy Wall' protests of the late 1970s, Tony Walker reports. Reports also surfaced of additional arrests in Shanghai on the eve of the arrival there of Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, on a four-day visit to China. Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, indicated growing French disquiet that 'we've got to the point where we are not appreciating this'. However, Mr Balladur had attracted criticism in France for his failure to speak out on dissidents. Earlier he had said that 'being efficient (on human rights) very often means being discreet'. China denied it had arrested more dissidents during Mr Balladur's visit, saying reports were 'completely groundless'.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: EBRD set to launch Ft1bn bond issue next week The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is due to launch its first issue of public debt in an eastern European currency on Monday with a Ft1bn (Dollars 10m) bond issue, the first public bond in Hungarian forint issued by an international borrower. It is a move the EBRD hopes will lead to more funds being raised in regional currencies, which would eliminate foreign exchange risk for borrowers and assist the development of the country's capital market. The issue, open to both Hungarian and foreign investors, and the first tranche in a programme of up to Ft5bn (Dollars 50m), will help finance the building of a toll motorway between Budapest and Vienna. 'If this programme is a success we hope to extend it as a standard bank product to other eastern European markets such as the Czech and Slovak Republics, and Poland,' said Mr Louis de Montpellier, director of funding at the EBRD. The initial Ft1bn tranche will be launched at par with a maturity of five years and a coupon of 27.75 per cent per annum for the first six months followed by a floating-rate coupon.</p>

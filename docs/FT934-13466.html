			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Compaq income doubled as cost controls pay off COMPAQ Computer, which yesterday reported a sharp increase in profits, is reaping the benefit of its continued emphasis on cost control and product innovation. The US group is the only large personal computer maker that is consistently profitable and it could soon overtake Apple Computer as world number two after International Business Machines. Shares in the Houston-based manufacturer rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 64 7/8 before easing to 64 1/8 , on third-quarter profits which surpassed most analysts' expectations. It reported net income of Dollars 106.77m, for the quarter ended September 30, more than double the Dollars 49.37m recorded a year ago. Revenues were up 64 per cent to Dollars 1.75bn, against Dollars 1.07bn. It is the fifth quarter in a row that Compaq has reported record sales. The results are all the more remarkable because the third quarter is traditionally its weakest. Earnings per share increased 105 per cent to Dollars 1.25, fully diluted, compared with Dollars 0.61 a year ago. Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, chief executive and the principal architect of Compaq's dramatic turnround 16 months ago, attributed the results to continued product innovation, an emphasis on manufacturing efficiencies and effective management of distribution. Until the middle of 1992, the company's market share and profitability had been threatened by a strategy of charging a premium price for quality and distributing strictly through approved dealers. Mr Pfeiffer sought ways of manufacturing quality products at lower prices and looked for new avenues to market. For the first nine months, revenues are running at Dollars 4.99bn, up 86 per cent on last year, while net income is Dollars 311.4m, up 152 per cent, equivalent to Dollars 3.68 a share, fully diluted.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Correspondent Dong Shengju (5516 0524 3515) and Reporter </F> Xiao Shuangsheng (5135 7175 0524): "Enhance Confidence and  Advance Steadily--Wan Guoqing (8001 0948 1987), Governor of  Hebei's People's Bank of China, Speaks on Reform of the Banking  System" -- place and date not given]    [Text] How should we implement the principles for banking  work to steadily promote the reform of the banking system? We  recently conducted an interview with Wang Guoqing, governor of  the provincial People's Bank of China, on this question.    Wang Guoqing said: In line with the guidelines of the third  plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, the State  Council defined the targets of the reform of the banking system  as establishing a macro-regulation and control system of the  central bank which is placed under State Council leadership and  which implements the monetary policy independently; establishing  a banking organizational system under which policy-lending  business is separated from commercial banking and which takes  state-owned commercial banks as the mainstay and allows the  coexistence of diverse monetary institutions; and establishing a  unified and open network of money markets which advocate orderly  competition and are strictly managed. This is a complicated  system engineering project of society, involving not only  macroeconomic regulation and control but also microeconomic  operation. We should implement it in an active and yet prudent  manner.    Speaking on the problems we have encountered in the process  to attain the targets of the reform of the banking system, Wan  Guoqing said: We are faced with a rare opportunity for our  reform and development. We should seize this opportunity to  promote reform with a firm confidence. We should also note,  however, that the deep-seated contradictions that bring about  loss of control of the total amount of credit and serious  inflation have yet to be fundamentally resolved; that effective  mechanisms for restraint and mechanisms for risk-taking have yet  to be established by monetary institutions; and that the tasks  to rectify the banking order have yet to be fulfilled. These  are the unfavorable factors affecting the reform of the banking  system.    In view of this, Wan Guoqing urged: Hebei's banking  departments should conscientiously implement the principles for  banking work for this year, carry out the various reform  measures in line with the unified arrangements of the state, and  comprehensively fulfill the tasks of banking work. In  particular, we should achieve success in the following work:    First, we should continue to rectify the banking order to  provide a good environment for the reform of the banking system.  We should continuously expand the achievements on the basis of  last year's rectification work. Monetary institutions of  various categories and at various levels should make continuous  efforts to clean up and collect all loans in violation of  regulations, correct the business activities in violation of  regulations, thoroughly separate themselves from the economic  entities they have established, and solve their own problems in  an all-round manner. We should continue to investigate and deal  with all illegal monetary institutions and the illegal banking  business and illegal collection of funds by nonmonetary  institutions to safeguard a steady banking order in society.    Second, we should bring the total amount of credit under  strict control to ensure the smooth progress of the reform of  the banking system. To bring the total amount of credit under  strict control in the process of changing the old banking system  to the new and avoid serious inflation is a need of the reform  of the banking system and also a need in establishing the  socialist market economy system. We must make it successful  this year. In line with relevant state stipulations, monetary  institutions of various categories and at various levels should  phase in the method of management of the proportions of assets  and liabilities under the guidance of quotas and try to use  economic means to control the scope of loans. The method of  management of the scope of fixed asset loans should be strictly  carried out, and the scope must never be exceeded without  approval. Conscientious efforts should be made to enliven the  use of the loans available, tap the potential of funds, and  raise more funds to support economic construction.    Third, we should steadily promote the reform of the banking  system and actively do a good job in the various preparations.  The People's Bank of China, the various specialized banks, and  other monetary institutions should make various preparations  according to the unified arrangements of the state. 1) They  should change concepts and consider issues from the viewpoints  of the central bank and commercial bank. 2) They should  strengthen their internal management and improve rules and  systems to lay a solid foundation for reform. 3) They should do  a good job in the calculation and analysis of date and other  relevant report work so that they can implement reform measures  as soon as possible. 4) They should conscientiously organize  staff members and workers to study relevant policy regulations  and intensify their training so that everyone will know  regulations and how to operate.    Fourth, we should conscientiously strengthen banking  supervision and management and conduct the reform of the banking  system according to law. People's banks of China at various  levels should earnestly change their functions and strengthen  banking supervision and management. When banking laws and rules  are promulgated, we should step up efforts to formulate the  detailed regulations for their enforcement and standards for  operation. People's banks of China and various monetary  institutions should learn to use laws as a weapon to safeguard  the safe and effective operation of the banking system, ensure  public interests, and defend social stability.    Fifth, we should "attach equal importance to two tasks" and  successfully build the infrastructure for the banking  departments. Realistic improvement of the contingents of staff  members and workers and strengthening of various fundamental  work are the basic prerequisites for fulfillment of the tasks of  the reform of the banking system. Focusing on this year's work  stress, Hebei's banking departments should "attach equal  importance to two tasks" and win achievements both in the  material civilization and the spiritual civilization.  Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China and all monetary  institutions should do a good job in accounting, joint final  accounts, cash receipt and payment, fund distribution, foreign  exchange control, and business and security to lay a solid  foundation for the reform of the banking system.</p>

Because our party has regarded the chuche-oriented  party-building theory as the leading guideline, our party is  displaying the pride of being an invincible revolutionary party.    The chuche-oriented party-building theory, which the great  leader [suryong] created and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il has constantly developed and enriched, is a complete  party building doctrine for the working class in our era.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has noted: The  chuche-oriented party-building theory is the completed party  building doctrine for the working class of our era.    Above all, the chuche-oriented party-building theory clearly  elucidates the road to party building based on the unitary  ideological system. Building the party based on the unitary  ideological system is a basic principle for party building.    The party's unitary ideological system is the leader's  [suryong] ideological system and leadership system. The working  class' party is the vanguard unit of the working class and the  working popular masses, who are organizationally and  ideologically rallied around the leader [suryong]. The mission  of the working class party lies in implementing the leader's  [suryong] ideology and leadership and in leading the working  popular masses to realize their independence.    For this reason, to discharge its missions as a political  weapon for achieving the leader's [suryong] ideology and  leadership, the party must establish the leader's [suryong]  ideological and leadership system.    Only when the party's unitary ideological system is  established can the entire party be armed with the leader's  [suryong] ideology; can it move as one under the leader's  [suryong] unitary leadership; and can it thoroughly realize the  leader's [suryong] leadership for the whole society.    Also, the chuche-oriented party-building theory most clearly  elucidates the road to masses-oriented party building. Building  the party into a masses-oriented party is a basic policy in  party building.    In the past period, the party has been regarded as the  class-oriented political organization and as the weapon for  class struggle, which represented and defended the class  interests. The party is the class' vanguard unit which  struggles to meet the demand and interests of a certain class.  However, if the party is built into the party only for certain  class' interests, it cannot fully discharge its duty as the  revolutionary party and cannot enjoy the support of the broad  segments of the masses.    Our era's historical conditions, in which the broad segments  of popular masses emerged as the masters of their fate, demand  that the working class' party be built into the party which  represents the interests of the entire people and includes the  leading elements of all working class circles. In the socialist  society where the masses of all walks of life are turned into  the socialist working people and where the social class  composition is unified, building the working class's party into  the masses-oriented party emerges as an urgent demand.    By scientifically penetrating our era's demands and our  revolution's concrete reality and by putting forward the masses-  oriented party-building theory, our party has opened a new road  for revolutionary party building.    The masses-oriented party-building theory, which our party  has put forth, is based on the chuche-oriented revolutionary  principle that the masters of revolution and construction are  the popular masses and that the might for promoting revolution  and construction lies in the popular masses.    The socialist cause is preciously the popular masses' cause.  Today, with socialism the desire of broad segments of the  popular masses and the social class' foundation for socialism  greatly expanded, the party struggling for the socialist cause  should be built into the masses-oriented party which represents  the interests of the entire popular masses and takes its root in  the broad segments of the working popular masses.    Our party has been the strong bastion of the revolution  because our party has been strengthened and developed into an  invincible revolutionary party that enjoys the popular masses'  absolute support and trust and because our party has been  combined into one socio-political lifeline in which the party  and the masses share the same fate of life or death. This is  the brilliant fruition of the masses-oriented party-building  line and the firm guarantee for our victory.    The chuche-oriented party-building theory has correctly  elucidated the road for building a militant party characterized  by strong organization and discipline. Revolutionary  organization and discipline are the life of the working class  party.    The working class party is the revolutionary general staff  that breaks through the numerous ordeals and tribulations to  organize and lead revolutionary struggle and construction work.  In a nutshell, the working class party should not be a group  which lacks standards and discipline but be a combat unit  characterized by strong organization and discipline.    Based on the party's firmly established unitary ideology  system, our party has correctly embodied the  democratic-centralistic principle; has strengthened and  developed the party members' life and the party's organization  and discipline; and, thereby, has been strengthened and  developed into an invincible revolutionary party with strong  organization and discipline in which the whole party moves as  one under the leader's [suryong] unitary leadership.    The chuche-oriented party-building theory is a valuable  guideline capable of thoroughly embodying the basic  party-building principle on basically adhering to the work  conducted with people. The chuche-oriented party-building  theory on basically adhering to the work conducted with people  is based on the theory of the chuche idea.    Because the main forces for promoting revolution and  construction are people, the working class party should resolve  all issues arising in party construction and activities through  the work conducted with people.    Our party has always given priority to the ideological  indoctrination work of party members and working people, that  is, the work conducted with people. By so doing, our party has  greatly strengthened the main forces of the revolution and  vigorously accelerated revolution and construction.    The chuche-oriented party-building theory has elucidated the  correct road to most brilliantly implement the party's political  leadership for revolution and construction. Firmly implementing  the political leadership for society is the basic mission of the  working class party. In a socialist society, the mission of the  working class revolutionary party is to responsibly lead the  people's fate and to provide them with an independent and  creative life.    To discharge its missions, the party should firmly realize  the political leadership in all national fields, including  politics, economy, culture, and national defense. The party's  responsibility and its leadership for the people's fate can  never be separated.    Enhancing the party's leadership and role in order to firmly  realize the political leadership for the whole society is the  basic direction in building the socialist ruling party. For the  first time, the chuche-oriented party-building theory fully  elucidates the essence, principle, and method of the party's  leadership for revolution and construction.    Our party has regulated party leadership for revolution and  construction as the political guidance, that is, guidance based  on politics, and has thoroughly checked the tendency for  political guidance to fall into administrative ruts. Our party  has thoroughly embodied the basic principle by raising it as the  basic principle to combine the party's unitary leadership into  the revolutionary masses-oriented line, thus correctly combining  leadership with the masses and constantly enhancing the party's  leadership role.    Our party has regulated a party committee as the supreme  guidance organization of the units concerned and has guaranteed  collective guidance in the party committee's activities. By so  doing, our party has correctly combined the unity of the  political leadership into the masses' initiative. By closely  combining the party's work into the administrative and economic  work, our party has strengthened the main forces of the  revolution and vigorously accelerated socialist construction.    The chuche-oriented party-building theory is a powerful  weapon capable of firmly establishing the revolutionary work  method and people-minded work style in keeping with the inherent  demand of the working class party. The issue concerning work  method and style is one of the basic issues determining the  success in strengthening the main forces of revolution and  organizing and mobilizing the popular masses into the  revolutionary struggle.    In the whole process of the party building, our party has  adhered to the chuche-oriented party-building theory, has  constantly struggled to improve the party's work method and  style, and has thereby fully established the revolutionary work  method and people-minded work style in the whole party based on  the revolutionary masses-oriented line.    Our party's work method is the anti-Japanese guerrilla work  method that the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song created early  on amidst the flames of the anti-Japanese revolutionary  struggle. The Chongsan-ri method and Chongsan-ri spirit were  deepened and developed in keeping with the realistic demand for  socialist construction to become our party's work method. In a  word, our party's work method is a work method in the manner of  the great leader [suryong].    Our party's work method is the most revolutionary and  people-  minded work method and style, which strengthens the  single-hearted unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and  the masses by closely combining the leadership with the masses  and which brings the creation of the masses into full play.    Our party has put forward the slogan, "Serve the people,"  and led all functionaries to faithfully work for the people.  By so doing, our party has thoroughly strengthened  single-hearted unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and  the masses to bring the unfathomable strength of the popular  masses into full play.    The chuche-oriented party-building theory fully elucidates  the issue of firmly guaranteeing continuity in party building.  Firmly guaranteeing continuity in party building is the most  basic issue that arises in carrying out the party's cause and  the working class' revolutionary cause. Because the working  class' revolutionary cause is a protracted cause which should be  conducted generation after generation, the cause of the working  class party-building cause should be inherited generation after  generation.    The frustration of socialism in various countries in the  world is a bitter lesson that if the working class party is not  strengthened and developed generation after generation, the  revolution is forced to undergo hardship and be stopped halfway.  Based on the legitimate demand for developing the revolution in  our era and on the historical lesson of the international  communist movement, our party has raised the issue of inheriting  the party's leadership as the most important issue arising in  the completion of the working class revolutionary cause  generation after generation. Our party has brilliantly resolved  the issue theoretically and practically.    As a result, a firm guarantee for completing the  chuche-oriented revolutionary cause generation after generation  can be secured in our country. This is the greatest victory  which our party has gained in the process of embodying the  chuche-oriented party-building theory.    Indeed, chuche-oriented party-building theory is the most  correct guideline and completed theory which elucidates the  future road for working class party building in our era.    We should take pride and confidence in having the most  complete chuche-oriented party-building theory that was created  by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and inherited and  developed by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. By  thoroughly embodying the chuche-oriented party-building theory,  we should further strengthen and develop our party into an  ever-victorious and invincible party.</p>

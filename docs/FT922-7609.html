			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / The Olympia &amp; York Insolvency: Shoring up a Thatcher memorial - Philip Stephens says John Major faces a dilemma over aid for Canary Wharf THE RATHER cruel joke circulating in the corridors of Westminster yesterday was that Canary Wharf might soon be renamed the Margaret Thatcher memorial themepark. After all it was the former prime minister's unashamed admiration for the Reichmanns which led her government to offer substantial financial and political backing to the project. However, it is her successor, Mr John Major, who has to bear the political costs of a series of decisions over the next few weeks which could well decide the future not only of Canary Wharf but of the whole east Thames corridor. Mr Major faces a classic Catch-22 situation. If he agrees to commit more public money to the project he would face fierce cross-party criticism that he is simply pouring good after bad into a development which will never be commercially viable. If he refuses, he could find himself blamed for putting back by a decade or more the most ambitious urban regeneration programme in the world. As yet there is no consensus among the ministers advising him on how he should seek to break free. His government's public position is straightforward enough. It remains committed to building the extension to the Underground's Jubilee Line, regarded as essential to the long-term viability of the development - but only if Olympia &amp; York or any subsequent owner meets the agreement to contribute Pounds 400m towards the project. At the same time it is willing to underline its confidence in Canary Wharf by relocating at least 2,000 and possibly up to 5,000 civil servants there - but only if the rents are competitive. Behind the scenes the judgments are not so simple. No one is keen for a large injection of public funds. The recession has wrought sufficient havoc with the government's finances to persuade even instinctively spendthrift ministers that money is tight. But Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is said to be among those who believe that if push comes to shove the regeneration of Docklands, which he nurtured during the early 1980s, could not be allowed to fail. One minister said yesterday: 'We have already poured billions into Docklands. We cannot let it collapse now.' The Treasury does not see it like that. It has never been enthusiastic about the Jubilee Line extension. It desperately needs to save money to bring down a soaring budget deficit. It thinks the rail link is worth far more to the owners of Canary Wharf than they are being asked for. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary, is said to be ready to scrap the scheme if the commitment is not met. Mr Major's problem is that such a hard-line stance could well further undermine confidence - who is going to take space without the firm promise of an Underground link? It would also make a nonsense of the plans to move civil servants into the development. Officially, the Department of Environment is still looking at four sites in Docklands for its 2,000 civil servants. In reality its senior officials say that before this week's announcement it was close to clinching a deal with O&amp;Y. But that deal - already involving higher rents than available elsewhere  -could only be justified if the Jubilee Line were certain to go ahead. So if the banks refused their share of the funding and the Treasury won the Whitehall battle against further subsidy Canary Wharf would face the double blow of losing the railway and a large prospective tenant. The question the banks and ministers will be asking themselves is whether Mr Major could stand by and watch the development collapse. The prime minister has already agreed to the costly diversion of the Channel tunnel rail link to east London to spur development in the east Thames corridor. Immense political capital has been invested in the successful regeneration of Docklands. The Treasury insists there is no such dilemma. That whoever controls Canary Wharf will see the sense of meeting the obligation to the Jubilee Line. The government could then do its bit through the relocation of civil servants - at suitably knocked-down rents. Not all of Mr Major's advisers are so sanguine.</p>

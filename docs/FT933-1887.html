			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Muted welcome for interest rate cut JAPANESE business leaders gave a muted welcome to yesterday's three-quarter percentage point cut in official interest rates. The cut, the seventh since early 1991, brings the Bank of Japan's official discount rate from 2.5 per cent to a new low of 1.75 per cent, a quarter of a point below what the markets had been expecting. It follows last week's Y6,150bn (Pounds 38.7bn) package of government spending. Mr Yasushi Mieno, central bank governor, said he saw no sign of a recovery in domestic demand, but the rate cut should help return the economy to a 'non-inflationary sustainable growth track'. Senior industrialists welcomed the cut but doubted whether it would be enough to revive the economy and repeated calls for income tax cuts. The coalition government is divided on income tax reductions, which are being studied by an official panel as part of a general reform of the tax system. The administration plans to consider a fiscal stimulus only if the economy remains stagnant by the end of the year. The Keidanren, the economic federation and leading mouthpiece for the business community, would evaluate the rate cut, said Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, its chairman. The move showed the bank realised the economy was in a worse state than it at first thought, he said. Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren employers' organisation, said he was unsatisfied with the size of the cut; there was room for more. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association agreed: it warned that an interest rate cut alone was not enough to stave off fears of a double-dip recession. Officials from the steel, electrical machinery and precision instrument industries added that they could only increase capital investment if they government took steps to stimulate personal consumption. Household spending fell for the third month running in July, because of cool weather and a decrease in summer bonuses, said the Management and Co-ordination Agency. Average July spending was, in real terms, 2.3 per cent below the same month in the previous year. The only significant private sector welcome for the rate cut came from the Zenginkyo bankers' federation, whose chairman, Mr Tadashi Okuda, said it should have a great psychological effect. Analysts doubted that the cut would have a big impact on borrowing costs, since rates on three-month certificates of deposit, at which commercial banks lend to each other, have already fallen since early August. The Bank of Japan is expected to try to nudge market rates down again to encourage a drop in the prime rate, on which commercial banks base their lending to business. 'At least this takes monetary policy off the plate for the next six months. It means that taxes will now be the focus of interest,' said Mr Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Asia. Share and bond prices rose slightly as a result of the move, with the Nikkei index up 200.62 points to 20,466.65.</p>

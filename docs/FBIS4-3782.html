			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Beijing Municipal  Government has helped open a department to help individual  businessmen with the formalities of arranging business trips  abroad.    The number of people travelling overseas not on behalf of  the  country has in recent years grown at the rate of about 30  percent per year. Last year alone saw more than 40,000 such  applicants.    Formerly, employees of private enterprises and individual  businessmen needing to go abroad for business activities had to  apply for exit permits under the guise of visiting relatives and  friends, or travelling for pleasure, for lack of clear  government stipulations.    So the exit permits help office has been set up to better  meet the growing need of applicants and to make it more  convenient for individual or private businessmen, and thus to  promote prosperity.    The new department will provide consultations, necessary  training and handle other formalities for owners of private  businesses, individual laborers, managers of township  enterprises and employees of non-public enterprises to make  overseas business tours.    The new department operates under the leadership of the  Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce.    Beijing now has 4,110 privately-owned firms and 230,000  individual businessmen.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, June 11 KYODO --  Japan's chief government spokesman said Saturday there is a  strong possibility of the UN Security Council adopting a  resolution in a week or 10 days against North Korea over the  nuclear standoff.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai made the comment in  a  speech in Hamamatsu.    The Security Council is expected to begin debating next week  a resolution the United States plans to submit calling for  sanctions against North Korea because of its rejection of  unhindered access to nuclear facilities suspected of being used  for nuclear arms development.</p>

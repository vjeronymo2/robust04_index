			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Anglovaal falls 3% on turnover advance but raises dividend Correction (published 25th September 1992) appended to this article. ANGLOVAAL, one of South Africa's large mining houses, has unveiled a near 3 per cent fall in net attributable earnings to R277.7m (Dollars 97m) for the year to June, from R285.1m the year before, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. This was despite a 6 per cent advance in turnover to R8.21bn from R7.74bn. Earnings per share emerged 19 per cent lower at 67 cents, against 82.7 cents. However, the directors are proposing a 9 per cent increase in the annual dividend of 100 cents per share, including a final payout of 67 cents, up from 92 cents for the previous 12 months. The directors say earnings growth in the 1992-93 financial year will be a big challenge in view of the recession, lower mineral and metal prices and inflationary pressures. They are planning for capital expenditure of more than R1.4bn over the next three years for expansion and asset replacement, most relating to Anglovaal Industries, the group's industrial subsidiary and largest contributor to earnings in year-end results. The directors also warned that unless there was a meaningful improvement in the rand gold price in the near-term, further retrenchments at industry and group level were likely to occur as marginal mines struggle to survive. Trans-Natal Coal, the South African coal mining group, may cut capital expenditure because it does not expect to maintain earnings in the year to June 1993, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. Mr Brian Gilbertson, chairman, said in his annual report that although some of Trans-Natal's exports were already sold and the revenues covered at favourable prices and exchange rates, it would not be able to maintain its current earnings in 1992-933. 'Accordingly, consideration is being given to deferring construction of the washing facility at Koornfontein, so that total capital expenditure for the year will not exceed R200m,' he said. Attributable income rose to a record level of R143.6m in the last financial year from a previous R138.1m. World market prospects for the current year were much less favourable, he said. The company was still negotiating a possible acquisition in Australia. CORRECTION EARNINGS per share of Anglovaal fell by 3 per cent to 464 cents in the year to June, from 478 cents. The figures were incorrectly reported in yesterday's FT.</p>

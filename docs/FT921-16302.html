			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: 'Hellish' year leaves many losers and a few winners - Nick Garnett revisits small companies he has written about over the last 12 months 'THE PAST year has been pretty hellish,' says Jenine Moody. 'Our turnover will be down about 40 per cent in line with the corporate hospitality market. In October and November the company's phone hardly rang.' With its six double decker buses, support vans and large marquees catering for the Bollinger boys during the Lawson boom years, Moodies found itself in the eye of the past year's recessionary storm. But anyone seeking examples of the damage which a recession has inflicted on Britain's tiny businesses need look no further than the scores of companies featured in this column over the past 15 months or so. Some of the weaker ones with precarious financing have thrown in the towel. Others proved remarkably resilient, pumping up turnover but watching helplessly as profit margins shredded. Those engaged in a bit of property speculation on the side were caught cold. Some infant companies saw growth forecasts turn into fiction. In only a few cases did last year prove to be fun and fruitful. Bootz Spatz and Shooz gave up the ghost. It manufactured all-weather footwear in Harrogate; its founder Michael Cooney had hoped to raise production from 25,000 to 40,000 pairs and break even for the first time in the company's short history. In 1990 the company had lost Pounds 58,000 but Cooney hoped to swing the company into the black by nearly doubling turnover to some Pounds 600,000. 'We just couldn't run it as a single production company,' Cooney says. 'It wasn't working what with the way the economy has gone and Americans undercutting in Europe. We were finding it more and more difficult.' For 'a few tens of thousands of pounds', the company's assets and trade name were sold to an Essex clothing company which now makes the same label footwear in its own factory. Garden Tours, specialising in horticultural holidays from Pounds 400 to Pounds 1,500, is at least in serious difficulty or worse. The company vacated its Milton Keynes premises without leaving a forwarding address. 'We would like to know where they've gone,' says a manager of the business premises it used. 'People have been ringing in and we haven't been able to tell them anything.' The company's owner, John Weltz, admitted in a radio interview a few months ago that the company was in trouble. He was using money deposited by new customers to pay off customers who had had their holidays cancelled. A former sales manager with Ladbroke Hotels, Weltz had been confident that the type of customer Garden Tours serves possessed pockets immune to recession. It has not worked out quite as he expected. Garden Tours was set up in 1986. In 1989 it had a claimed turnover of Pounds 600,000 and a net return of 18 per cent. It has been a difficult time in other ways for companies in the entertainment and leisure game. Laurence and Sue Cowley successfully raised turnover at their country hotel, Glazebrook House in Devon but the property market's steep slide is putting them under strain. They signed a contract two years ago to buy a disused abbey with planning permission for a leisure complex. That contract is costing them money but they have been unable to sell Glazebrook, a necessary move to finance the deal. 'We haven't even had one looker since we put it up for sale a year ago,' says Laurence Cowley. The 13-bedroom house in four acres is on the market at Pounds 700,000. 'We are committed to buying the other property. It's a very sticky position. We are treading on ice.' In spite of a virtually complete drop-off in business entertainment, the company has picked up other trade - more social functions, seminars and conferences, increasing turnover from the previous year's Pounds 160,000. The Cowleys have also pared costs. 'We have changed our wine supplier, dropped back on staff, renegotiated the laundry contract, changed the grocery wholesaler and we are using two or three butchers instead of buying from the same one.' The Alternative Shooting Company set up in August 1990 offered a different type of clay pigeon shoot. Banks of clay birds are hidden away on country estates providing a greater illusion of live bird shooting. The company turned out to be hopelessly optimistic about its first year's trading. Instead of doing 125 days shooting it did 20 and managed only a tenth of its target turnover of Pounds 500,000. 'We have been concentrating on keeping our head above water,' says Wendy Plummer, the marketing and reservations manager for the company based in Burford, Oxfordshire. Corporate hospitality has again proved a disaster zone. 'The difficulty has been not only getting a company to take a day's shooting but for those companies to get people to come on them because so many are worried about their jobs and don't want to take time off work.' Open days, cheaper at Pounds 150 than the 16-gun corporate day at Pounds 190, have become much more important than Alternative Shooting expected. Plummer says, however, that the general concept has been accepted by the shoot fraternity, the company now has a substantial client data base and a target next year of 70 shooting days. Some companies really drove up turnover last year. Watts &amp; Wright, a hand-crafted fitted kitchen and bedroom maker in Walsall, raised sales to Pounds 250,000, double that of the previous year. Profit was also up at about Pounds 30,000. The company's two owners, Tony Watts and Adrian Wright increased staff by two to eight and have started to land larger jobs in the Pounds 20,000 range. The market for Watts &amp; Wright's relatively high quality bespoke furniture is very tough as the rest of the kitchen and bedroom market. 'The market is very, very competitive. Its like a dog fight now,' says Wright. 'We are often selling domestic appliances at cost to get the job.' The company is being drawn further from its Walsall base. 'There is not much life in the West Midlands.' The two men have decided to keep their salaries unchanged at Pounds 18,000. Bob Dowdell, director of New Era Cosmetics, sums up the past 12 months. 'We thought it was going to be tough but we didn't think it would be this tough.' The company started in March 1990. Its principle product is up-market pot pourri and it turned over Pounds 105,000 against its target of Pounds 120,000. Like so many production businesses, New Era is expanding sales quickly and expects to have done Pounds 200,000 for the whole of 1991. But it is the same story of shrunken margins. 'Rather naively we thought we might break even in the first year. We actually made a loss of a few thousand pounds. We will make a loss this year as well of about the same amount.' Retailers and brand name suppliers of pot pourri for whom New Era produces, demanded price drops from the West Sussex business of about 5 per cent over the year. 'People are also delaying payments. We did not envisage that it would be as much a down turn as this, but our blends are different and we have not sacrificed quality.' The company, which also makes aftershaves, fragrance sprays and eau de toilette has started exporting to Sweden, Holland, Greece and Italy. 'We have been getting a name for ourselves in the market. and we are also developing our liquid filling facilities.' Dowdell and his partner Brian Charman together with another shareholder raised a further Pounds 20,000 to add to the businesses capital. 'We are not over-pessimistic but I don't want to borrow heaps of money.' Pam Jose is completing her second year at North-East Recycling, a Newcastle-based company handling paper, polythene and other recyclable waste. 'It has been very tough,' she says. 'Paper prices have kept on spiralling downwards by about 10 per cent last year and I'm expecting another drop this year.' Nevertheless, the company's puny turnover of Pounds 20,000 in its first nine months has become Pounds 77,000 in its second full year. Instead of making a loss of Pounds 15,000 it is breaking even and Jose is taking a salary from the business, allbeit just Pounds 5,000 a year. The company improved the layout of its warehouse and baling operation, is buying a portable baling press so it can carry out compacting at the site where it collects polythene and wants to purchase a baling machine for cans. The company will drop cardboard recycling because of low prices and is increasing its interest in polythene and polythene film which form half of its business. Among its network of suppliers and customers, North-East Recycling takes material from local shops, breweries and industrial companies and sells recycled material to polythene reprocessors for bin bags and all weather sheeting, paper mainly to paper mills and cans to Alcan. 'We are creeping forward inch by inch,' Jose says. J Chapman has been manufacturing sporting bags, hand and travelling bags in Carlisle, Cumbria since 1984. Two years ago it had a brilliant 12 months. It has also been busy during 1991 selling to its main customers, stores and own brand label bag suppliers. But its owner, John Chapman and wife Jo have been made all too aware of the general recession. 'Altogether it has been more difficult than we expected,' says John Chapman. 'Most customers are now wanting very quick deliveries of smaller quantities and that makes it very awkward. In the past three weeks I think there has been a sudden deterioration. Some customers cannot take the goods we are making even to their own design because they have no cash. We have had three or four letters in the past few weeks from liquidators of companies we have dealt with.' The company expected to turn over more than Pounds 500,000 last year but did not achieve that. Margins are also down from 30 to about 18 per cent. Chapman is disturbed by what he perceives as a continuous slide in the quality of material he buys, including cloth, brass fittings and leather. 'The quality is deteriorating substantially. Perhaps these companies are passing material which they would have rejected before. Perhaps they are cutting down on staff and therefore quality control.' If such deterioration in quality is now becoming endemic in other industries, that is a depressing feature the recession has bequeathed Britain.</p>

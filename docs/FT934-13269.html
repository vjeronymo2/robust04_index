			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Back from the abyss: The revival of confidence in Lloyd's The morning after the night before, the mood at Lloyd's was better yesterday than could have been expected when work began earlier this year on rules to allow corporate investors into the insurance market for the first time. Wednesday's landslide vote by Lloyd's Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported underwriting, in favour of the rule change signalled a fundamental shift by the 300-year-old market. Blue-chip banks and securities houses now plan to launch at least 16 new Lloyd's investment trusts, with the aim of raising more than Pounds 1bn from institutional and retail investors. The money will be invested in equities and gilts, but also used to back Lloyd's syndicates. Though the appetite of investors might not be as great as some corporate financiers hope, Lloyd's can expect to raise at least Pounds 500m. The decline in Lloyd's capital base, which seemed inexorable only 12 months ago, has been halted. Next year, capacity - the amount of business that can be accepted for a given amount of capital - should rise above Pounds 9bn, compared with Pounds 8.7bn currently. Heavy losses are expected when, over the next two years, results are published for 1991 and 1992, but confidence is returning: insurance rates are rising steeply in most sectors. For instance, Mr John Charman, underwriter of one of the market's biggest marine syndicates, says his rates have increased sharply this year. 'After many years of famine, Lloyd's is producing very strong underwriting profits,' he told Wednesday's extraordinary general meeting. Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, and Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, know, however, that excessive euphoria would be misplaced. Still to be implemented is an ambitious plan announced in April to transfer billions of pounds of potential asbestosis and pollution claims into a new reinsurance company, with the aim of 'ring fencing' the liabilities to protect new investors. They have also promised to reach an out-of-court settlement with thousands of loss-making Names whose legal actions are still outstanding. Failure would mean years of litigation. On both these counts, however, the market's prospects are brighter than Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton would have thought possible a year ago. Corporate investors recognise that totally ring fencing the old US asbestosis and pollution claims may prove difficult, but are prepared to accept this as a commercial risk. During the summer Sir Laurie Magnus, who has led work on a Lloyd's investment trust launched by Samuel Montagu, the merchant banker, was worried about the uncertainties. But now he is more pragmatic: 'We're not worried now. There is a risk but we have to take a commercial judgment.' Mr Michael Hesketh, a director at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, has been reassuring potential investors in CLM Insurance Fund, which BZW is sponsoring. He says the risks they face at Lloyd's from US pollution and asbestosis claims are no greater than those involved in buying shares in some UK and US insurance companies, which are exposed to many of the same claims. At the same time, the scale of Wednesday's vote in favour of Lloyd's plans on corporate membership demonstrates that dissident loss-making Names do not have enough support to dent confidence in the market. Mr Michael Deeny, the chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action Group, the biggest group of loss-making Names, is sceptical about the chances of an out-of-court deal and is still intent on 'suing the pants off Lloyd's'. But he acknowledges that Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton have won the confidence of many Names. There are also reasons for Lloyd's to be optimistic that the problems of the last five years, when losses totalled more than Pounds 6bn, will not recur. Corporate members and individual Names, who continue to underwrite without any limit on their potential losses, are beginning to diversify risks by making smaller commitments to more syndicates. Four out of five members' agents - which handle the affairs of individual Names - next year plan to introduce Members' Agents Pooling Arrangements, which will spread the commitments of Names more widely. Financial Intelligence &amp; Research, a consultancy monitoring Lloyd's syndicates, expects Mapas to supply Pounds 5.2bn in capacity in 1994, more than half the market total. Corporate investors are also more likely than individual Names to make greater demands on agents and syndicates, reinforcing moves towards greater professionalism in the market. Mr Chris Hitchings, analyst with UBS Global Research, says: 'Corporate investors are not brighter than Names, but they are managing other people's money and this does require them to undertake a basic exercise in screening investments for those whose demise would be indefensibly embarrassing.' Yet some pessimists see new problems arising out of this week's successes. Over the past 18 months, with much of the market short of capital, it has been relatively easy to press the case for cost-cutting and greater professionalism. But the expected inflow of capital could make it harder to persuade underwriters to accept lower salaries or conform to quality standards. Worse still, with capital abundant, some underwriters may be tempted to reduce their rates to win business, raising the spectre of the fierce rate wars that proved so damaging in the late 1980s. Agents who manage syndicates say that already they are unable to accommodate all the potential interest of corporate investors. 'There is now a large excess of supply of capital over demand,' says Mr Paul Archard, of the Murray Lawrence agency. Mr Robert Hiscox, deputy chairman of the market who oversaw plans to bring the corporate capital to the market, agrees that some attitudes have begun to change. 'The cockiness is back. A few arrogant underwriters are slipping back into their old habits.' Some underwriters tell him they intend to increase their charges for corporate members, says Mr Hiscox. 'I tell them: 'The lifeboat has just come in and you want to charge it to land?' ' Lloyd's had already taken some steps to prevent a repetition of its mistakes, unveiling contingency plans in April to limit, if necessary, the amount of corporate capital that would be allowed to enter the market. At the time, there was little expectation that such a mechanism would be needed. If too much capital is attracted for the market to absorb, however, Mr Rowland may have to invoke such powers - or the revival in confidence may foreshadow an unpleasant hangover at a later date for Lloyd's.</p>

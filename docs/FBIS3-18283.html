			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Mauno Koivisto thinks that at the time of  changing presidents, Finland is not in such a period of  transition where a change of guard will cause problems.  Koivisto did not think that he had left unfinished any projects  that would have strongly depended on him. The only matter that  had intensified at the time of the transfer of power was the  negotiations for European Union membership. President Koivisto  thought now, before the decisive talks, that they had proceeded  a long way and the number of open issues have been reduced. In  his opinion, it looks very much as if Finland has the least  number of open issues after Sweden. It is possible that a  solution will be found.    In a farewell interview granted for the Finnish News Agency  at Maentyniemi [new presidential residence in Helsinki],  Koivisto thought that new President Martti Ahtisaari will handle  matters in the traditional matter. The president will devote  himself to international issues.</p>

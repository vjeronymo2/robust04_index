			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Investigators found more than 1,000 types of dangerous chemicals in a San  Francisco Bay Area building when they served a search warrant in connection  with drug conspiracy charges, federal agents said. The building at Oakland  Research &amp; Laboratory Supplies Co. was filled with thousands of containers  of hazardous chemicals, many of them corroded and stacked randomly on shelves.  Agents had entered the building to search for records in connection with the  indictment on drug charges of Vincent Gammill, said Bill Morley, a special  agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Gammill was an employee of the  supply company. No containers appeared to be leaking or in danger of exploding,  according to officials. Most of the chemicals were stored in small quantities.  </P></p>

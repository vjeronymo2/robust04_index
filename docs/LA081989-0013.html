			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PURCHASING RAILROAD RIGHTS OF WAY FOR TRANSIT  </P> <P> Hooray for The Times! I left Los Angeles last year because of the intolerable  traffic and smog. Thanks to the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific, in five years  Los Angeles can once again have a fast and affordable alternative to the  region's hopelessly congested streets and freeways. For those Angelenos who  doubt the efficacy of light rail, come to San Diego and ride our fast and quiet  trolleys. Don't miss this chance, L.A. -- it may be your last.  </P> <P> VICTOR NEIBURG  </P> <P> Vista  </P></p>

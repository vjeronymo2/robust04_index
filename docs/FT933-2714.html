			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Nuclear 'green' image boosted NUCLEAR ELECTRIC yesterday declared its aim of cutting energy and water expenditure by 5 per cent this year as part of an attempt to improve its environmental image. The aim is one of a series outlined in the company's first environment report. It said it would stay within self-imposed radiation exposure limits for its workers three times more stringent than legal requirements, and foster openness and dialogue with communities. The nuclear industry has often been criticised in the past for excessive secrecy. Nuclear Electric's aims were published as it and other nuclear-related companies prepare for the government's nuclear review which will determine its future. The review has been held up while government ministries debate the terms of reference. The Department of Trade and Industry is the ministry most likely to lead the review. The company said yesterday that its power stations last year effectively saved the emission of 55m tonnes of carbon dioxide, the main cause of the 'greenhouse' effect. Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive, said 95 per cent of nuclear waste was low level. Naturally occuring materials such as granite and Brazil nuts were sufficiently radioactive to be comparable with such wastes. 'If I ate a chocolate Brazil nut I would receive a radiation dose of between 0.3 and 1 micro sievert. The annual average dose to a member of the public from nuclear power is just 0.3 micro sieverts.' He said when electricity was generated from nuclear power, carbon dioxide levels released were only 4 per cent of coal-generated electricity and 8 per cent of gas. The figures included mining of raw materials as well as construction of the plant and its running.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEEN KILLED IN ARGUMENT; YOUTH HELD;  </P> <P> CRIME: WITNESSES SAY THEY WERE FEUDING OVER A BROKEN TRUCK WINDOW.  </P> <P> An argument between two south Orange County teen-agers on a sunny beach here  ended Saturday with one man shot dead and the another in custody, the Sheriff's  department said.  </P> <P> The shooting took place about 1 p.m. in an area known as Dana Strand, at the  southern tip of county-run Salt Creek Beach Park.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Lt. William Francis said deputies responded to reports of a shooting  on the beach, where they found bystanders giving first aid to an 18-year-old  Dana Point man who had been shot. Paramedics transported the man to a nearby  hospital, where he was reported dead on arrival. The man's identity was  withheld until relatives could be notified.  </P> <P> Witnesses gave deputies a description of the suspect and the vehicle he was  driving. A 16-year-old Laguna Niguel youth, whose name is being withheld  because he is a juvenile, was arrested without incident in San Juan Capistrano,  Francis said. The suspect was being questioned by sheriff's deputies in Santa  Ana, Francis said.  </P> <P> Witnesses gave the following account:  </P> <P> The two were apparently involved in a running dispute that began before  Saturday over a pickup truck window that had been broken.  </P> <P> The victim was walking down a bluff toward the area in the sand where the  suspect and a group of friends were sitting. The suspect saw the victim walking  toward him and pulled a small-caliber, short-barrelled pistol.  </P> <P> The suspect shouted, "Leave the beach or I'll kill you. I'll kill you if you  come after me. I don't want to kill you, just leave." The victim replied, "Just  pay me for the window."  </P> <P> The two continued their shouting match as they headed north along the strand,  the victim pursuing the youth with the gun. The suspect turned and pulled the  trigger, hitting on an empty chamber. He ran again, then turned, went to his  knees and fired again, hitting the victim in the chest, police said.  </P></p>

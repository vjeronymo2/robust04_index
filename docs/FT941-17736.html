			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Alert as fresh European floods feared: Some EU countries have inadequate insurance cover Flooding across large parts of western Europe this Christmas - which, it was feared, would worsen in some regions this weekend - has already caused hundreds of millions of pounds in damage and has highlighted the inadequacy of insurance cover in some countries. Southern German cities could be hit by another deluge only days after water levels, the highest since the turn of the century, subsided. Officials in Cologne and Hanover said the Rhine could rise as fast as 2cm to 4cm per second, particularly if the unseasonably mild weather continues. In south-east England the National Rivers Authority issued more flood warnings yesterday. Red alerts - warnings that flooding was imminent - were issued for the River Ouse and River Uck in East Sussex, between Isfield and Lewes and between Isfield and Uckfield. In Kent, red alerts were issued for the River Teise and Lesser Teise, and on the River Beult. In France, during one of the wettest winters the country has ever experienced, the worst affected area is the Val-d'Oise around Pontoise, where hundreds of people have already been evacuated from their homes. But the river Oise is still rising. The rivers Seine and Marne are also expected to rise further this weekend. The roads running alongside the Seine in central Paris yesterday were still closed to motorists. There was also concern yesterday about north-eastern France, particularly the Vosges region, where there has already been heavy snow, and Alsace and Lorraine on the German border. At the height of the flooding in the southern Dutch province of Limburg a fifth of the province was under water. Further flooding is thought possible during the New Year weekend, and troops are standing by to evacuate people from their homes if necessary. Flood damage in the Netherlands is estimated at Fl 300m (Pounds 105m) - and none of it is insured. Dutch insurance companies have never offered water damage insurance to either their private or their corporate customers, and the December floods have revived calls for Dutch insurers to arrange a pooled form of insurance against flood damage. It was another natural disaster in Limburg - a freak earthquake in April 1992 - that first focused attention on the lack of insurance cover in the Netherlands against two natural calamities, flooding and earthquakes. Insurance against damages caused by heavy winds is, however, a standard part of Dutch insurance policies. After the 1992 earthquake, Dutch insurers put forward proposals for forming an insurance pool of Fl 50m for calamity damage, including damage caused by river water flooding. However, their willingness to provide cover depends on whether the government agrees to provide tax incentives. The insurance industry also wants the government to contribute money to the damages pool. The government has yet to respond, but the latest floods have increased pressure for action. The insurance industry is adamant that it cannot insure people against sea water damage. The Netherlands' densely populated coastal region, with its three main cities - Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam - lies below sea level, and any catastrophe caused by the bursting of sea defences would cost far more than insurance companies could ever pay, according to the Netherlands Insurance Association. Belgium is not much better placed, while most German states, with the exception of Baden-Wurttemberg, have not made insurance against flooding a law. Insurance companies there have been reluctant to cover such accidents. Against the background of increasing personal losses, the Bonn Finance Ministry has unveiled measures aimed at increasing tax allowances, or providing direct financial assistance, for those whose property has been damaged. These include the right to claim between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of renovation costs. Compensation claims up to a certain level can be deducted from profits or offset against company expenses. Employees in agriculture will be exempt from at least part of their tax. Claims can also be placed on home improvement grants spread over five years. The ministry has not yet issued any estimate for the cost of partially compensating people, largely because claimants have to assess the damage, and the floods have yet to end. The UK and France seemed best prepared for the eventuality. The Association of British Insurers said: 'We do not know how much the flood damage will cost. It is too early to say. But we feel it is unlikely to be enormous. It has not been associated with freezing weather. This is where the huge costs usually occur.' The French insurance industry is steeling itself for a bill of as much as FFr3bn (Pounds 344m) to repair the damage there this Christmas. The December downpour is the latest in a string of natural disasters to have hit France in recent months, starting with the Camargue floods in October and heavy rains in Corsica during November. The insurance industry, which was also inundated with claims from farmers in southern France following the hailstorm in July, expects the final tally for 1993's freak weather conditions to reach at least FFr4.3bn. However, the insurers are cushioned, thanks to legislation implemented after the 1982 floods which created a central fund they can draw on after natural disasters. The industry ploughs around FFr4bn a year into this fund, which has a healthy surplus.

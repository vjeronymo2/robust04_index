			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LAPD WILL REQUIRE DESK OFFICERS TO WALK THE BEAT TWICE A MONTH  </P> <P> In the wake of the mayor's refusal to provide money for police foot patrols,  Chief Daryl F. Gates has approved a plan to mobilize desk-bound officers to  walk the beats twice a month, officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> The plan to mobilize administrators, tentatively scheduled to begin in late  October, would allow police to deploy the popular foot beats without dipping  into budgetary reserves, Cmdr. William Booth said.  </P> <P> "We see this as a reasonable and feasible way within our current budget to meet  the needs the community has voiced," Booth said.  </P> <P> Gates has approved the plan and implementation details are being pulled  together by the department's Office of Operations using reports compiled by  supervisors on the numbers of officers available.  </P> <P> Initial plans called for plainclothes officers through the rank of sergeant  working administrative or desk jobs to don uniforms and walk beats two days  during each 28-day deployment period. Case-carrying detectives probably would  not be included.  </P> <P> "Basically we're asking does a person have to be on a desk job five days a week  or is four enough," said one administrative officer working on the plan. "We're  looking at who we can squeeze loose."  </P> <P> Booth and other administrators denied that the plan is a response to Mayor Tom  Bradley's veto of a City Council plan to fund foot patrols in 18 of the city's  crime hot spots with an allocation of $2.5 million.  </P> <P> The mayor recommended that the council approve a $750,000 expenditure for a  three-month pilot foot-patrol program, with the bill being paid by a surplus in  the department's salary account due to unfilled positions.  </P> <P> The mayor's suggestion, expected to be implemented by the council, drew a  warning earlier this week from Assistant Police Chief Robert Vernon, who said  using salary savings and other cost-cutting methods to fund the foot beats  could jeopardize other police efforts.  </P> <P> Council committee meetings to discuss the mayor's recommendation have been  marked by appeals from residents of crime-ridden communities who asked for an  override of the veto and sought the city's commitment to help rid their  neighborhoods of gangs and drug dealers.  </P></p>

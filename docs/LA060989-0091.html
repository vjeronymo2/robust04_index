The pilots, members of the Air  Line Pilots Assn., who are striking in sympathy with Eastern's machinists,  denounced the move as a "public relations hoax." ALPA said the latest company  demands for concessions were nothing more than a "paper trail" to the doors of  bankruptcy court, where Frank Lorenzo, head of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.  and considered an antagonist of organized labor, plans to "file for abrogation  of our contract."  </P></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Coats Viyella Coats Viyella's longer-term attractions emerge undimmed from the deluge of data accompanying its annual results. The company has restructured its businesses during recession and positioned itself well to exploit fast-growing emerging markets. Recent acquisitions have performed encouragingly. With gearing cut to 31 per cent, the balance sheet remains strong enough to permit more. But Coats' suggestion that the economic outlook was only faintly encouraging was enough to knock 7 per cent off its shares. Coats believes UK tax rises will dent confidence more than most assume. Rising cotton prices could also prove difficult to pass on to retailers, implying some margin squeeze. That suggests the 3.6 per cent fall in underlying operating profits may not easily be reversed  - especially as currency effects will be less favourable this year. The market may also be tiring of Coats' habit of paying paper dividends. Coats certainly has a better case to make than most with almost Pounds 100m of unrelieved advance corporation tax. This time, Coats will retain Pounds 35m of cash, which it has earmarked for worthy investments. But two previous enhanced scrip dividends and the conversion of preference shares have expanded Coats' equity base by 16 per cent since 1992. The latest scrip payment may add a further 2 per cent. It may be easy to lift the dividend 10 per cent when Coats does not have to pay. But it will become painful when Coats starts paying hard cash on so many more shares.</p>

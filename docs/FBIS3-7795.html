			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec today  returned from a two-day visit of Switzerland, where he had talks  with his counterpart, Flavio Cotti, and with the president of  the Swiss Confederation, Otto Stich. He had this to say, among  other things, about the outcome of his trip:    [Begin Zieleniec recording] The character of the visit was  primarily to put a seal on the present level of relations  between our two countries. We have also signed mutual letters,  in which we have confirmed the validity of obligations both  countries have against each other in international law.  Moreover, Switzerland is our important trade partner. Despite  its being such a small country, it occupies 12th position in our  trade relations with the outside world, which is very  remarkable. It was therefore natural that we should have also  discussed matters concerning the expansion of trade and economic  cooperation. Swiss companies are participating with distinction  in the process of the transformation of the economy. I have,  however, also noted that the first swallows of our capital  expansion, if I may say so, have appeared in Switzerland. Some  of our companies have already set up mixed companies or branches  directly in Switzerland. [end recording]</p>

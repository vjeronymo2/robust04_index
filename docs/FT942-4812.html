			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Irishman wins race abuse case A 36-year-old man from Northern Ireland has been awarded Pounds 5,902 by an industrial tribunal in Nottingham for suffering racial abuse at work. The case may have an important impact on how British employers treat their Irish employees. Mr Trevor McAuley was the subject of repeated anti-Irish remarks by some of his workmates. He was often called a 'typical thick Paddy' and was the subject of derogatory remarks 'about the Irish almost every day'. The tribunal agreed unanimously that he had suffered 'stress and humiliation'. 'This is the first time such issues have been put before an industrial tribunal,' said Mr Herman Ouseley, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality. 'We know from regular complaints made to us that Irish people suffer abuse day after day. We hope that they will be able to use this result to secure a change in attitude on the part of their employers.' Mr McAuley did not receive the current maximum award for race discrimination of Pounds 12,000. His award was made up of Pounds 3,402.50 for loss and compensation and a further Pounds 2,500 for injury to his feelings. From July 4, the maximum financial limit on awards in race discrimination cases is to be raised. Mr McAuley was a machinist in a small family business - Auto Alloys Foundry in Blackwell, Derbyshire. He was dismissed three days before the end of his first two years' employment at the company, which preventing him from bringing an unfair dismissal charge. The tribunal concluded he had been fired 'principally because he was an Irishman who would not take Irish jokes lying down, in other words he did not 'fit in' '. Mr Dan Taylor, his former employer, said yesterday he did not agree with the tribunal's verdict. 'I cannot afford commercially to appeal against it,' he said. 'But this case is another nail in the coffin of British manufacturing. We should not have to be dealing with matters like this but getting on with the job.' The industrial tribunal said Mr Taylor had 'not taken all reasonable steps' to prevent workers from abusing Mr McAuley. But Mr Taylor said it was unrealistic for him to tell 'rough, tough guys' in a foundry not to make remarks that would upset Mr McAuley. Mr McAuley, who has worked in England for 20 years, said he had been the subject of anti-Irish abuse before in his working life but not in the persistent form it took at the foundry.</p>

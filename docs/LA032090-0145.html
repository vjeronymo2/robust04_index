			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER;  </P> <P> ELECTRONIC FLAWS DISTORT CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL EPIC  </P> <P> Centuries ago, Rome had the spectacle of the Coliseum, where they fed  Christians to the lions. Nowadays, Southern California has the spectacle of the  Crystal Cathedral, where they feed miracles to the Christians.  </P> <P> "What you hear and see tonight is the staging of a historical truth. . . ." So  we are assured by the canned voice of the Rev. Robert H. Schuller as a preamble  to "The Glory of Easter," which opened Friday and continues through April 21 at  the cavernous, glass-walled church.  </P> <P> On the evidence of this show, Karl Marx was wrong when he claimed that religion  is the opiate of the masses. Instead, it's a theme park, with flying angels and  laser beams, blinding flashes of lightning and angry thunder that alternately  rumbles like an earthquake and cracks like a whip.  </P> <P> Nothing much has changed from last year's "Glory" except some of the principal  players. Producer-director Paul David Dunn's conception remains as piously  grandiose as ever -- the theatrical equivalent of an epic movie by Cecil B.  DeMille -- replete with a colossal cast of nearly 200 people and a menagerie of  horses, donkeys, lambs and a leashed tiger.  </P> <P> Jonathan Fuller returns in the role of Jesus, unstintingly beatific until he  undergoes the agonies of a grimly realistic Crucifixion, when he is called upon  to project spiritual as well as physical despair. Kim Criswell (of "Cats" fame)  is back again as Mary the Mother with the show's most human moments, brief  though they are, and a soaring solo entitled "Because He Lives."  </P> <P> For all the bravura spectacle -- and partly because of the outsize staging --  "The Glory of Easter" suffers from a major production flaw: disembodied voices.  The miking makes it impossible to tell who is speaking much of the time, even  with the help of a spotlight to focus attention on the main action.  </P> <P> When your eye finally catches up with your ear, you frequently lose the speaker  again as the action shifts elsewhere across a vast distance to some other spot  in the milling crowd. Ironically, this distraction invites you to close your  eyes and simply listen, which is a little like going to the ballpark and not  having a hotdog with all the trimmings.  </P> <P> If you do close your eyes, though, you'll notice that "Glory" sounds like  nothing so much as a small-scale radio drama. Minus the stage props, it could  make a good companion to "The Green Hornet."  </P> <P> 'THE GLORY OF EASTER'  </P> <P> A Crystal Cathedral production.

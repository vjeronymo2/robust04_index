			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Tendering warning issued MR Tony Baldry, environment minister, issued a warning to local authorities yesterday over compulsory competitive tendering. He said the government would not hesitate to use its powers to force councils to re-tender if they were found to be acting unfairly. In a speech in Nottingham he said compulsory competitive tendering had opened up more than Pounds 2.5bn of local services to private-sector competition, giving local taxpayers and residents lower prices and better services. Mr Baldry admitted that the courts' 'wider' interpretation of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, which often guarantee the jobs and pay of the existing workforce when work is contracted out, were 'a new factor' which private tenderers needed to consider. But he said this should not be an obstacle. 'A Tupe-based bid will probably have a higher up-front cost - but it involves no redundancy costs,' he said. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, will today call for a Commons statement on the government's local government review. The move follows speculation that ministers may be planning measures that will deny unitary authority status to a number of big cities and boroughs.</p>

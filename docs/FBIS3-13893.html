We are celebrating these days the anniversary of the  independence and the youth day in faithfulness to our martyrs  and fighters. The two days are symbols of the impregnability of  the country, and we celebrate them out of our renewed  determination to continue upholding the country's values and to  face up to the challenges, thanks to the will of its sons and  daughters.    The importance of these celebrations has been increased by  the presidential and legislative elections, which embodied in a  very good way the maturity characterizing the Tunisian people  and the country's worthiness of a developed democratic life.    Citizens, men, and women, you have cast your vote after  reflection and out of conviction, and you have expressed your  choice out of your pure will within the framework of  transparence and clarity. You expressed your choice with the  full respect of the rule of law and the commitment to civilized  behavior, which I had called for since the beginning of the  election campaign on the basis of the principles and values upon  which the new year was erected.    It is my pleasure on this occasion to express my sincere  thanks and appreciation to all the voters, men, and women from  all social groups, ages, and regions, who voted for me here and  abroad. I also express my gratitude to all those who  volunteered to support the presidential election campaign,  including the national organizations, the media, and all the  bodies, groups, and individuals, and I fully value their loyalty.    I renew my determination and pledge to fully shoulder the  responsibility as much as I can to continue with all the  Tunisians, men, and women the completion of the marvelous  national project we started building step by step on 7 November  1987 and whose edifice is getting bigger day after day thanks to  your positive response and contribution. You have renewed your  pledge to continue raising this edifice higher and higher by  voting for it spontaneously and in big numbers.    I take this occasion to congratulate the winners in the  legislative elections from all the national political parties  that expressed their support for the national civilized project  and contributed to the materialization of pluralism in the House  of Deputies for the first time in Tunisia's modern history.    Citizens: Now that the results of these elections have  become clear, the national duty and Tunisia's right on us demand  that we put its interest above any consideration. It requires  us all to get to work again and pursue the efforts within the  state of law, institutions, human rights, and the framework of a  consolidated and balanced society to face up to present and  future challenges. We must take our country in all sectors to  the level of advanced and developed countries, endeavoring  together for its lasting glory and esteem. May God give us  success and may His peace, mercy, and blessing be upon you.</p>

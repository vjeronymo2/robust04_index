			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Kubota posts 55% rise in profits Kubota Corporation, Japan's leading manufacturer of farm equipment and iron pipes, increased turnover by 4.2 per cent and profits by 55 per cent for the year to March 31. Group pre-tax income rose to Y27.3bn (Dollars 261m) on sales up at Y979.5bn. After taxation and other charges, earnings rose 47 per cent to Y8.2bn. Domestic turnover grew 5.8 per cent, despite weak private sector demand that cut sales of industrial castings and pipes. The loss was more than offset by higher sales for the company's environmental control equipment and building materials divisions, the result of an increase in public sector construction projects following successive government packages to stimulate the economy. Sales of internal combustion engines were stable despite a cool summer and the partial liberalisation of rice imports. Overseas sales were depressed by the sharp appreciation of the yen, falling by 3.7 per cent to Y155.9bn despite strong growth in the US. The parent company announced a 6.5 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, to Y28.1bn, on turnover lower by 0.6 per cent at Y744bn. For the current year, Kubota expects a gradual economic recovery to lift unconsolidated pre-tax profits by 7 per cent, on sales higher by 2 per cent.</p>

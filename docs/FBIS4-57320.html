			<p>BFN     [Text] Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer has declared  himself the winner of the presidential elections with a little  over 43 percent of the votes counted, according to the ninth  bulletin issued by the Central Electoral Commission of that  country. The note states that more than 75 percent of the votes  have already been counted. Balaguer leads his opponent Jose  Francisco Pena Gomez by three points.    Reports indicate that the country remains quiet and that  military patrols are more frequent in the face of electoral  fraud claims, a claim also made in past elections. Pena Gomez,  who is the candidate for the Dominican Revolutionary Party, the  main opposition in the elections, stated that 200,000 of his  followers were not allowed to vote.    [Begin recording] [Pena] I cannot say where this will end.  We  are talking about a fraud in the elections. The government and  the Central Electoral Commission have an obligation to correct  the situation.    [Balaguer] The elections have been fair. They claim that  there has been so-called manipulation through the press, in  complicity with foreign (?media). All these allegations must  stand against the truth. The truth is stronger than anything.  [end recording]</p>

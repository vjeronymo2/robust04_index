			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Technology: Computer takes on a mind of its own - The 'thinking' machine is a little closer to becoming a reality A computer that does not need software to tell it how to perform a task appears to be a contradiction in terms, but that is what Ricoh, the Japanese office equipment company, unveiled yesterday in Tokyo. Don't start erasing software files from your computer just yet. Ricoh's experimental neural computer - so called because it imitates human thinking processes - can only learn 16 characters at a time, even though it is put together with microchips that are blazingly fast. This is indeed a primitive performance for a computer that is 500 times faster than the typical workstation, and four times faster than supercomputers. Ricoh's neural computer is none the less a tantalising hint of things to come. In a year or so Ricoh hopes to install a small neural computer in its office photocopiers - one that will learn by itself, without software that sets parameters, how to adjust all of the interrelated variables that determine whether a copy comes out with even tone. The neural computer itself is not a new concept. Other Japanese companies like NEC, Fujitsu and Hitachi have developed neural computers that learn from their mistakes until they can perform a task. The theoretical advantage is that these machines should eventually be able to deal with ambiguous situations and to make judgments, like the human brain. They could be useful for text or voice recognition. Morio Onoe, professor emeritus at Tokyo University and general manager of Ricoh's R&amp;D group, says that existing neural computers have combined the traditional central processing unit with software that imitates the functions of neurons of the human brain. Ricoh's computer, by contrast, has no central processor, just 16 neurons that operate in parallel and are linked together. This allows them to perform at much higher speed. The computer is fed information in digital form and given a goal, but left to its own devices on how to achieve it. So far the tasks performed are simple. The computer, for example, was yesterday fed equations describing the rolling of a ball on a tilted see-saw, and told to move the see-saw to prevent the ball from falling off the end. After a dozen of so failed attempts, the computer managed to balance the ball in the middle. Onoe says the advances have come in two areas: the dispensing of software that instructs the computer how to perform specific tasks and higher-speed processing of complex problems. The experimental computer is put together with 32 neural chips which Ricoh developed two years ago and which have a single neuron per chip. The computer has a processing speed of 128 MCPS (million computing connections per second). The drawback of Ricoh's neural computer is that it requires a huge amount of computing power to learn something useful. Onoe says the first practical applications for the computer will be in mechanical control, where the variables are relatively few. While Ricoh plans to use the technology in its own office machines, it would also welcome partners to develop control systems for factory robots. Use of the computers for voice or character processing will require much larger capacity. Don't expect the machines to appear on desk tops any time soon. But they could eventually learn not only to process words, but print out letters from dictation and eventually, perhaps, write the memos on their own too.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> PETS;  </P> <P> THE TV DINNER FOR FIDO  </P> <P> TV DINNERS, those ubiquitous timesavers, have been popular with moms and kids  since Uncle Miltie and Howdy Doody dominated the small screen. Now man's best  friend can join the rest of the family with his or her own frozen dinner: Le  Gourmet meals, prepared by Breeder's Choice -- a small family-owned business in  Irwindale noted for its line of zoo-food catering to non-domestic felines and  birds of prey since 1947.  </P> <P> Each meal is a 14-ounce, fully cooked little meat loaf (about 90 cents) made  from beef or chicken and all-natural grains and oils. Enriched with vitamins  and minerals, the dinners contain no preservatives and are ready to eat in less  than five minutes when heated in the microwave.  </P> <P> Also available are a Lamb and Rice dinner (for finicky eaters), the Avoderm  (designed to replenish the oils in a dog's coat) and a frozen dinner for the  epicurean kitty.  </P> <P>  Le Gourmet meals are available at Feed-Rite Pet Shop, in the Farmers Market,  6333 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles, (213) 936-8833, and at other pet stores. 1 LINDA  ZIMMERMAN  </P></p>

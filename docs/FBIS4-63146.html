			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of a Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense Press Service </F> communique dated 18 May -- read by announcer]    [Text] The mass media have made conflicting reports over  the past few days on the outcome of the talks held by the  defense ministers of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia in Moscow.  The Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense Press Service deems it  essential to outline the following:    An agreement on a cease-fire was reached at the talks. It  was also agreed that there should be an opportunity for the  negotiating parties to work on the final document in a peaceful  atmosphere. The document was not signed because several of its  paragraphs were not consistent with each other. An experts  group is working on it. The defense ministers of Russia,  Azerbaijan, and Armenia will hold a new round of talks when the  experts conclude their work.    Meanwhile, the situation in the operations zone has been  relatively peaceful during the past few days. However, our  military positions in various parts of the front line have been  fired upon. Sadarak in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic was  also fired on with PDM's [not further specified] and mortars  last night. Azerbaijan's military forces ignored these  provocative activities and refrained from returning fire.</p>

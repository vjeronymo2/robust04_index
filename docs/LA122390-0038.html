			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOYCOTT OF 'PSYCHO' PUBLISHER DEBATED  </P> <P> Indulging in a rare quiet morning, I drank a cup of coffee while reading your  report on "American Psycho" and watching my 7-month-old daughter discover her  world. With the news of Ellis' third novel going into print, my nervous system  began to feel as if nuclear fission were about to take place.  </P> <P> Once again he will be spreading his gangrenous ooze under the disguise of  literature.  </P> <P> About five years ago, I was having a cafe au lait in Montparnasse with an  "intellectual" architect. He handed me a book and in his French accent touted  it as "fabulous . . . really American . . . culture, pop, great visuals. . . ."  (Ellis') "Less Than Zero" was making its underground debut in Paris.  </P> <P> As I read the book, I felt humiliated, abused, sick to my stomach and  frightened by an insensitive, uncaring and dangerously greedy brat who was  6,000 miles away. The ugly American had grown more ugly.  </P> <P> Care must be taken not to make Ellis a cult hero.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH MacQUEEN  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo  </P></p>

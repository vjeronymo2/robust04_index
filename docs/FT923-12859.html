			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Bundesbank looks east THE LOBBYING is done. With beaded brows and sweaty palms, the finance ministers of the industrialised world must now await the outcome of today's Bundesbank council meeting. But their increasingly desperate attempts to place the west's economic burdens on the shoulders of 18 German council members are misplaced. The Bundesbank's task remains to secure German price stability. That they stuck to this objective to the last is, rightly, the epitaph that the council members wish to secure. Unification has delivered an economic shock to the German economy far greater than almost anyone predicted. In the eastern Lander, the recession has been spectacularly deep; in the west the inflationary impact has been doggedly persistent. The demand for financial resources  - from the German taxpayer, the budget deficit and the banking sector - has overshot all initial projections. The Bundesbank has, as a result, found itself in a quandary. Concerned at rising wage claims and the build-up of hoarded liquidity, it fixed a restrictive target for monetary growth in 1992. Yet, in spite of record high interest rates, the subsequent acceleration of broad money growth has made a mockery of these austere expectations. The Bundesbank council could choose to ignore the message of its favoured monetary aggregate. As with any economic target, it is easy to find reasons why it might be distorted, particularly given the straits in which Germany finds itself. Reunification may have made the demand for money less predictable, while the demand for the D-Mark as a reserve currency in eastern Europe may have grown: the OECD's latest German survey provides a convenient list. Dented credibility Yet the Bundesbank will surely hesitate before abandoning its monetary target so lightly. To ignore the target when the going gets tough, however apparently justified by special circumstances, would dent the credibility of any future commitments the council might make. The Bundesbank's credibility has already been damaged enough: the section of the OECD report entitled 'An intensifying cost-price spiral' will have sent a chill up every council member's spine. It is not just credibility that is at stake. The counterparts to the rapid broad money growth reveal that the main cause of growing money supply is rapid credit creation by the German private sector. This credit growth has been hastened by the plethora of capital subsidies available for investment in the east, which reduce the cost of capital below market levels. Higher inflation Even an avowed anti-monetarist would concede that such a rapid rate of credit growth, outstripping the growth of either output or assets, risks feeding into higher inflation eventually. The British experience of the mid to late 1980s, when the rapid rate of credit expansion was conveniently but mistakenly ignored, sets a chilling precedent. The logical consequence of the Bundesbank's previous commitments, and current predicament, suggest that today's Council meeting should decide to tighten monetary policy. The UK's experience also suggests that raising interest rates is a blunt way of controlling runaway credit growth. Raising reserve requirements on bank lending or direct ceilings on the availability of credit may be a better option, particularly if the Bundesbank wishes to minimise the effect on international interest rates. If the Bundesbank council does decide it has no option but to raise interest rates, Germany's partners can hardly complain. It was their voluntary choice, after all, to link their currencies to the D-Mark in the pursuit of credibility. So recent lobbying by the French and British finance ministers should be ignored. It suggests these countries still do not understand the art of non-inflationary central banking. They complain about what is needed to give them the stability they say they want. For the success of the ERM has been built on the willingness of the Bundesbank to keep its anti-inflationary head, while all around were losing theirs. To ask the Bundesbank to tolerate high German inflation in the interests of European co-operation makes little sense.</p>

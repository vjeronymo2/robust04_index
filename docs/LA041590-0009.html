			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: A FATHER'S WORDS BY RICHARD STERN (UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO  PRESS: $9.95)  </P> <P> A supposedly comic novel about a divorced father struggling to come to terms  with his ne'er-do-well son.  </P> <P> Jack, who casually buzzes in and out of jobs and people's lives, obviously is  intended to exude an irreverent, counterculture charm -- a sort of literary  equivalent of Michael Parks in "Then Came Bronson." He comes off as a flake, a  slug and a bore. Cy, the narrator/father, is no prize either, and the two  characters richly deserve each other. Getting through Stern's wordy prose is as  cumbersome as chipping through a brick wall with a nut pick, and every bit as  much fun.  </P></p>

Far from being called unfortunate names, Gummer was last weekend on the receiving end of sumptuous hospitality from John Paleocrassas, the EU commissioner. Entertaining on his staunchly orthodox native isle of Andros, Paleocrassas first managed to drum up a Catholic priest to celebrate the feast of the Assumption specially for the Gummer family. Then, on a more secular note, the Andriots turned out in force for the annual Yacht Club dance. On a moonlit waterfront, Gummer led the proceedings and was later spotted doing an energetic Greek nisiotiko with his hosts. His efforts at the latter earned him the approval of one cigar-chomping tycoon who was heard to mutter something about 'a real sense of rhythm'. But then, as a Catholic, that's the only method he has any practice at.</p>

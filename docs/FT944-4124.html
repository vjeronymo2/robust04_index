			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Tough times for Swatch-maker - Doubts on SMH's future have hit the share price Investors seem to be having their annual case of jitters over SMH, the dominant Swiss watchmaking group. The registered shares of the maker of Swatch, Omega, Tissot, Rado, Blancpain and Longines watches have tumbled 14 per cent in the past three weeks to reach a two-year low yesterday of SFr137. A year ago, a similar burst of selling pressure greeted the news that Mr Stephan Schmidheiny, the Swiss financier, was withdrawing from the board and reducing his investment in the group. This time, the decline follows the announcement by analysts that they had lowered their forecasts of SMH's profits for the current year. However, the analysts themselves dismiss this as a cause, because it was already widely-known that this year's earnings would be hard hit by the effects of a strong Swiss franc. The worries today are more fundamental: there are doubts over the staying power of the vital Swatch brand, over the potential for the so-called Swatchmobile micro-car project with Germany's Daimler-Benz, and over the eccentric style of the 66-year-old chairman and controlling shareholder Mr Nicolas Hayek. Of these, the future of Swatch is the most important in the near term. These cheap and cheerful plastics watches have long since become the group's core product, with sales of over 20m units annually. With prices deliberately kept low, Swatch sales do not produce big profits, but rather huge cashflow which helps to cover the cost of developing and producing all watch components. After a decade of phenomenal growth, Swatch sales stagnated last year, leading to questions over whether the brand's popularity was slipping into irreversible decline. Unfortunately, SMH's erratic disclosure policy makes it difficult for investors to gather evidence and make an informed judgment. In August, it said Swatch exports were down by between 10 and 15 per cent in the first half, but Mr Hayek said last month sales had been growing again since the autumn. The group belatedly acknowledged Swatch's failure in the US and most east Asian markets, where plastic is not seen as fashionable. It has just launched a line of 'Swatch Irony', low-cost metal watches, to try to regain ground in these markets. If this product line can restore stability in the Swatch range, then the potential for a group profit recovery next year, boosted perhaps by a weakening of the Swiss franc, becomes tantalising. 'If they can stabilise the Swatch, that is enough to ensure growth in earnings,' says Martin Newson of Goldman Sachs International. 'I could see profits of SFr450m (Dollars 339.2m) next year,' says Mr Marc Polydor of Banque Scandinave en Suisse in Geneva. That compares with estimates averaging around SFr370m for this year, and implies that the registered shares are trading at less than 10 times next year's earnings. In 1993, the group recorded profits of SFr440m. Mr Pierre Tissot of Geneva bankers Lombard, Odier says those inclined to buy would do better to pick up the bearer shares, which are at a 14 per cent effective discount to the registered. But even if the Swatch problem is solved, analysts remain nervous about other factors. After three years of rumours about the Swatchmobile, SMH and Daimler-Benz finally announced last week that they would this month choose a site in France or Germany for an assembly plant. SMH's record with putting the Swatch brand on other products, mainly telephones, is not strong, and the car project represents a much bigger investment. Still, analysts point out that SMH has large liquid reserves and a very healthy cashflow. 'It is not a financial problem,' says Mr Tissot. 'It is a question of profitability. Margins in the car business are not like those in watches.' He also worries about signs of nepotism. Mr Hayek's son Nick has become a Swatch marketing director and his grandson Marc is also involved. 'The grip of the Hayek family is a source of concern,' he says. Mr Polydor is more relaxed. 'It could be a problem in the medium term, but for the time being there is a management team that is making the strategy.'</p>

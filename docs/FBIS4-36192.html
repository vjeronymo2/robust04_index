			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ze'ev Schiff: "A Signal to Damascus"] </F>   [Text] The fierce Israeli Air Force attack against a  Hizballah training facility in the Syrian-controlled area of the  northern part of the al-Biqa' should be construed, among other  things, as an Israeli signal to Damascus to the effect that  Israel does not regard the talks between them as reason for  preventing an operation against the extremist Shiite  organization.    The Syrian angle was debated in Israel prior to the  operation. In consultations held prior to the operation the  political process with Syria was raised. The freeze in the  talks between the two countries undoubtedly had an indirect  effect on the decision adopted. Seeing that there is no danger  of a military operation against Hizballah foiling such talks,  the military consideration finally prevailed. Hizballah in any  case is continuing its attacks against the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] and SLA [South Lebanese Army] in south Lebanon without  any consideration for the peace talks. In its operation Israel  has signalled to Syria and Hizballah that its security  considerations alone determine its mode of operation.    Those who made the decision to attack were aware of the  possibility that Hizballah would retaliate with Katyusha attacks  against our northern settlements -- as was actually the case  yesterday. Israel believes, however, that the attack did not  violate the understandings reached with U.S. mediation following  Operation Accountability. According to this understanding  Israeli settlements and Lebanese villages should not be attacked  unless fire is directed from within them. Hizballah, however,  is continuing its war against Israel in south Lebanon and has  hit many IDF and SLA soldiers. The Israeli operation was in  turn directed against a military training base for Hizballah  fighters, most of whom are sent to carry out attacks in south  Lebanon.    From the military point of view yesterday's attack can be  considered to be one of the severest blows ever suffered by  Hizballah. Many previous Air Force attacks ended with only few  Hizballah casualties, whereas this time the organization  suffered dozens of dead and wounded. The numbers involved  constitute a considerable percentage of Hizballah's total  fighting cadre, and are higher than the total casualty toll  Hizballah suffered in Operation Accountability. The operation  was carried out after 0200, under complete darkness, which  indicates the kind of ability Israel's Air Force has developed  for night operations. Lebanese sources say that the first wave  was carried out by jet fighters, which were later joined by a  second wave of helicopter gunships. It is clear that without  early intelligence regarding the details of Hizballah's training  base it would have been hard to locate the targets there.  According to one assessment, Mustafa al-Dirani's abduction and  interrogation in Israel improved Israel's familiarity with  Hizballah and its military infrastructure.</p>

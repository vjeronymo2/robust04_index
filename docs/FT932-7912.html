			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Friedrich fetches record Pounds 2.3m A PAINTING by the greatest German romantic artist of the early 19th century, Caspar David Friedrich, sold for Pounds 2.3m at Christie's in London yesterday. The buyer was the J. Paul Getty Museum of Malibu, California. 'Spaziergang in der Abenddammerung' (A Walk at Dusk) depicts a lone figure, perhaps the artist, contemplating a megalithic tomb at twilight. The price, at the low end of the estimate, was a record for Friedrich. This is the first 19th century German painting to be acquired by the Getty museum. The sale of this small, academic work is more justification for Christie's gamble in presenting for the first time a large two-day auction of German and Austrian art in London. Christie's expected Pounds 9m and was on target for Pounds 18m. On Wednesday an early 19th century scientific instrument - a precursor of the modern calculator - sold to the Swiss dealer Edgar Mannheimer for Pounds 7.7m. The price had been estimated at Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 20,000 and the sale was almost certainly the largest gap between an estimate and a selling price in auction-room history. It proves what can occasionally happen when two keen collectors are desperate for the same item. In Christie's modern art section a painting of 'Sunflowers' by Emil Nolde was on target at Pounds 661,500, while among the Old Masters 'Lucretia' by the Renaissance artist Lucas Cranach I doubled its estimate at Pounds 309,500. Christie's announced yesterday that on June 23 it will sell the first book printed in English . 'The Recuyell of the Histories of Troy' was printed by William Caxton in Bruges, Belgium in 1473, three years before he set up shop in the precincts of Westminster Abbey. It is expected to sell for up to Pounds 500,000. The book is being sold by the Marquis of Bath, who has two copies. The Marquis is disposing of 18 other duplicate copies from his library and expects to make Pounds 1m. Also in the auction is 'Chroniques de France', printed in Paris in 1493 by Antoine Verard, estimated at up to Pounds 700,000.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Editorial Chronicle" report: "The Court Is One Thing -- </F> the Job Is Another"]    [Text] On 6 April the Savelovskiy Intermunicipal Court  reinstated Viktor Linnik in the post of PRAVDA chief editor.  But the court is one thing -- and the job is another. V.  Linnik, who had issued a number of orders by the end of the day,  and the small group of journalists who support him, proved  unable to produce a newspaper: PRAVDA did not appear on 7 April.    Yesterday there was a joint meeting of Journalists Union  members and the PRAVDA journalists' collective. The meeting  relieved Viktor Linnik, who was reinstated in his post by the  court, of his duties as PRAVDA chief editor. Aleksandr Ilin was  again elected to that post.    So Viktor Linnik is giving the orders, while the vast  majority of PRAVDA workers are producing the newspaper.    [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 0911 GMT on 8 April adds:  "PRAVDA with a circulation of 218,000 is now run by Greek  businessman Jannis Jannikos, the president of the `PRAVDA  international' joint stock company."]</p>

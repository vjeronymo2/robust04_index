			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Vilnius Radio Vilnius Network in  Lithuanian at 0700 GMT on 11 May carries a 30-minute live relay  from the prime minister's office in Vilnius on the Value Added  Tax and problems related to it. Lithuanian Prime Minister  Adolfas Slezevicius made a brief comment at the beginning of the  program concerning the latest current political events in the  country. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, together with other  East and Central European countries, have become associate  members of the Western European Union. Speaking about the  importance of this, Slezevicius said:    "This is a step forward in increasing military and political  cooperation between East and West. It is my pleasure to note  that Lithuania, together with other Baltic countries, has become  an associate member of the union significantly earlier than  planned. This indicates that the European Union [EU] is  essentially changing its position on the Baltic states; it is  changing its stance in the sense of accelerating integration."    He also said that when the agreement on free trade with the  EU was signed this summer "our aspiration to become an associate  member of the EU will become more realistic."    Slezevicius did not deny that support from other Western  countries was needed for Lithuania to achieve this objective.  He said: "We believe that Germany -- it begins a term of  Presidency of the EU on 1 July -- will render us assistance as  promised by Mr. Kinkel, and, by the way, other countries also  support us on this. I believe that we will achieve good  progress in this sphere."    Speaking about the recent statement made by Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev concerning a possible increase of the  Russian military contingent on the territory of the Republic of  Estonia -- allegedly for the protection of the rights of the  local ethnic Russians -- the prime minister said that this  "causes concern" and "could only be seen as exerting pressure on  the sovereign state of Estonia." The task of the Lithuanian  Government, according to the prime minister, is "to express  solidarity with Estonia and protest acts of this kind."</p>

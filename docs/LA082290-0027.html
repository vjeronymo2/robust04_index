			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH SURELOCK;  </P> <P> THE SILICON SLEUTH  </P> <P> The grass proved greener for SURELOCK on the Del Mar turf last week. The  computer's bets piled up the biggest bankroll ever in this friendly  handicapping competition, dating through the Hollywood Park meeting.  </P> <P> SURELOCK's bets for today are a $10 exacta box, Keep On Top-Crystal Bounty, in  the third race; $40 to win and place on Desert Rumor and a $10 exacta box,  Desert Rumor-Dirty Old Man-Front Line Ready, in the seventh race.  </P> <P> Current Bankroll $2,484  </P> <P> Janice Goldinger, seemingly in the role of steady ant contrasting to SURELOCK's  grasshopper, will bet $40 to win on Swifterthanthewind and a $5 exacta box,  Swifterthanthewind-Bold Liloy, in the fourth race.  </P> <P> Current Bankroll $1,479.75  </P> <P> Note: Janice Goldinger, a horse owner, does not bet on races her horses run in.  SURELOCK does not own horses.  </P></p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (3): Monopoly walls breached - Liberalisation of telecom systems unleashes a wave of competition across Europe The liberalisation of Europe's telecommunications systems has gathered unstoppable momentum. After years of acrimonious tussles, the ramparts of the EU's state telecommunications monopolies are exposed, and the walls have been been breached in numerous places. It would, however, be a mistake to believe that a fully competitive regime is imminent. In their core voice market the former monopolies are likely to remain entrenched for years to come. Competition will be most intense in the data, mobile, satellite and value-added fields where the former monopolies' existing resources are relatively less substantial. Indeed, the building of the much-vaunted superhighways is likely to add to the armoury of the public telecommunications operators (PTOs) as they face the opening of their core markets. Given the expense of extending fibre into local networks - estimated at Pounds 15bn for the UK alone - the PTOs are almost certain to to be the principal operators of fibre grids. Until effective inter-connection regimes are established, other operators wishing to offer services across these networks are likely to find it hard to gain fair access. The key to effective competition is the liberalisation of infrastructure and the establishment, country by country, of a regulatory structure independent of the PTO and its sponsoring ministry. For either policy to be made effective, at least in the early years, the government must be firmly committed to competition and prepared to distance itself from the immediate interests of its PTO. In Britain, where competition is the centrepiece of the government's telecoms policy, both of the above policies have been pursued. Yet BT commands nearly 90 per cent of the UK market, a decade after the abolition of its monopoly and the licensing of a competitor. In EU states where governments are less enthusiastic about the merits of competition, rival operators will face a steep climb to establish themselves. Nonetheless, they start with three clear advantages over Mercury, BT's initial and largest competitor. In the first place, competition is already a fact of life in sectors other than voice. Almost every EU state has now licensed at least one competitor to the PTO in mobile cellular communications. Barely a year after its launch, Germany's Manesmann mobile consortium has at least as many subscribers to its GSM cellular network as has Deutsche Telekom to its GSM network, and a third German operator has been licensed. In France, the SFR competitor to France Telecom is thriving. In Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy rivals launch services this year or next. Some of the mobile operators are known to be interested in moving across to fixed-line voice services when the opportunity arises. The satellite and data sectors have also been opened to competition, with rival operators to PTOs now well established. A recent ruling in May by Germany's Federal Cartel Commission on illegal subsidies paid by Deutsche Telekom to its data subsidiary could prove seminal. The Cartel Commission found that Deutsche Telekom has been seriously hindering competition in Germany's liberalised data market, in particular in the provision of X25 data networks (known as 'Datex-P' in Germany), through subsidies from its monopoly voice and leased lines business. In all, subsidies of DM1.9bn were found to have been paid since 1989, the year Germany's data market was opened to competition. The findings have been referred to Germany's federal economics and telecommunications ministries, which will have to decide what measures to take. Meanwhile, Deutsche Telekom claims to have reformed its accounting system to end the illicit subsidies. Four features of the case stand out, all of which are likely in due course to recur across the EU in the far larger voice sector. First, the case was brought by an association of independent telecoms operators, VTM, whose members now have about 10 per cent of Germany's DM800m a year data telecoms market. The Cartel Commission would in all likelihood not have taken up the case but for the complaints. Secondly, the VTM association includes a host of national operators - BT, AT&amp;T, and the Swedish, Dutch and Swiss PTOs for starters. Unlike Mercury in the UK, the big players in the newly liberalising markets will be operators well versed in the tactics and practices of monopolists - and thus, perhaps, better able to seek to expose them elsewhere. Thirdly, it took five years from liberalisation for the claims of unfair cross-subsidies to be decided upon by the German competition authorities, and even then, the remedies remained unclear. Without dedicated telecoms regulators able to impose inter-connection regimes and accounting separation, entrants will find it slow and exhausting to gain legal redress for perceived unfairnesses in the competitive regime. Finally, Deutsche Telekom had, by common consent, gone some way to meeting the complaints even before the Cartel Commission's ruling. How fast will competition in voice services develop? It has already started in cross-border virtual private networks (see article on outsourcing, below), and elaborate call-back and other regimes are being established to circumvent monopolies for some international traffic from business districts. But for the voice market as a whole, outside the UK and possibly the Netherlands, competition is likely to have to wait until the 1998 deadline agreed by EU telecoms ministers last year - extended to 2003 for Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece, and to 2000 for Luxembourg. In practice, the extensions are unlikely to last as long as that. Mr Michel Carpentier, head of the EU's telecoms directorate, told a recent FT conference: 'We do not expect that all the countries eligible for derogation will fully use the additional five-year period. 'This has already been our experience for the initial services liberalisation step.' What happens after 1998 - or whenever competition is formally permitted in each state - depends upon a number of key decisions still to be taken, and in particular on three: the extent to which infrastructure is liberalised, the nature of national telecoms regulation, and the structure of regulation at EU level. The EU's Bangemann committee of industry leaders, set up last year to examine steps towards the 'information society' and due to report to this month's EU summit, will make a tentative nod in all three directions. Its summary conclusions, already published, argue for an acceleration of competition. It calls for 'opening up to competition, infrastructures and services still in the monopoly area', a significant development in the EU's position if endorsed by the Council. It also advocates 'removing non-commercial political burdens and budgetary constraints imposed on telecoms operators' - which could be taken as a clear reference to privatisation, the only sure means of keeping the politicians out of the month by month operations of the PTOs. The group also stresses the need to speed up the process of standardisation of network architecture to ensure full interconnection of networks and interoperability of services. However, the Bangemann group appears to have sidestepped the critical area of EU regulation, concluding lamely: 'An authority should be established at European level whose terms of reference will require prompt attention.' Such an 'authority' could be anything from a US-style Federal Communications Commissions to a feeble college of national regulators - and its terms of reference anything from promoting competition and settling inter-connection disputes to acting merely as a forum for exchanges of views between national regulators. A recent speech by Mr Karel Van Miert, the EU's competition commissioner, to a meeting of solicitors at S J Berwin, highlights the importance of the decisions still to be taken on regulation. Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome gives the EU tough powers over companies dominant in their markets; but, noted Mr Van Miert, no formal prohibition decisions against PTOs have been made since one against BT in 1982. Why? 'My services,' he said, 'have been struck time and again by the reluctance of companies - even very big and powerful companies - to lodge formal complaints against PTOs for fear of suffering reprisals.' Furthermore, he commented, 'lack of evidence' often precludes investigation even of those cases brought, for evidence is invariably hard to gather 'in view of the unsatisfactory accounting practices applied by the PTOs.' In other words, accounting separation, and a pro-active regulatory institution armed with first-hand knowledge of the internal world of the PTOs, is the essential pre-requisite for a fully competitive market. Whether the EU will prove able to establish a regulator equal to the task remains to be seen.</p>

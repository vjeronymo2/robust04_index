			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (39): Consultant's critique WHAT a relief to see evidence of a strategy, and an effective one at that. Unilever has a collection of difficult IT problems. As an acquisitive company, it inherits the systems of its purchases. It then has to integrate these with its own strategy without adversely affecting the profitability of the new company. In addition, it faces the problems of internationalisation. Few countries speak the same language or even have the same alphabet. This means that software is very difficult to transfer between two countries even if the same underlying concept applies in both. The strategy that Unilever has applied is a pragmatic one. It recognises that local conditions will vary. Sensibly, it tries to minimise the translation overhead by specifying a range of acceptable options (hardware and software) with inter-operability. Many other companies try and adopt a complex world vision that usually ends up increasing the effort. Unilever's focus is firmly on the business benefits, rather than technical brilliance. I particularly liked the way that the IT group sees its role as facilitating the transfer of ideas between subsidiaries, rather than as the fount of all wisdom. They may still need to address further the issues of integrating PCs, which are outside the Open Systems approach, but they have made an admirable start.</p>

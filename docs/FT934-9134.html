			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Philips leads call for more EU innovation EXECUTIVES from some of Europe's leading industrial groups yesterday called for more intensive co-operation between governments, the European Commission, scientists and industry to fight technological competition from Japan and the US. 'We are pleading with Europe to help us succeed,' Mr Jan Timmer, Philips president, told industrialists at a symposium in Eindhoven. 'We will play our part and do our duty, but we can't sit still.' Philips called for round-table discussions between government, universities and industry to identify the key technologies Europe will need to compete in the growing 'multimedia' sector, which will bring together computer, telecoms, consumer electronics and media groups. 'These are areas that can only be tackled when several companies and governments get together,' said Mr Timmer. He criticised European governments for 'not getting their act together' over European high-definition television. Ambitious plans for HDTV, in which Philips has invested heavily, were shelved in favour of a diluted project this summer. Executives from SGS-Thomson Micro Electronics, the Italian-French state-owned semiconductor producer, and Renault-Volvo, the Franco-Swedish car manufacturer, supported Philips' call for support from public authorities, in the form of intensified research programmes aimed at key technologies and backing for strategic alliances. Mr Pasquale Pistorio, president and chief executive of SGS-Thomson, said advanced industrial societies 'cannot exist without controlled access to an advanced electronics industry, which in turn cannot exist without controlled access to an advanced semiconductor industry'. Public authorities, semiconductor users and manufacturers had to work together to achieve such a goal, he said. Mr Pistorio said national and European authorities should promote tax incentives for research and development, and concentrate R&amp;D funding on large companies, 'the existence of which is an indispensable pre-condition for the viability of smaller ones'. Mr Martin Bangemann, European industry commissioner, said the European Union could play a role in helping to change the structure of traditional European industry - for example, by liberalising the telecommunications sector. Philips had invited industrialists, government and European Commission officials to celebrate the opening of a new exhibition of the company's technology near the group's headquarters in Eindhoven.</p>

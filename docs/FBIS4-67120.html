			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Big Heroin Gang Uncovered"] </F>   [Text] The National Criminal Police have uncovered a  Finnish branch of an international heroin gang. The police have  so far seized a little over 500 grams of heroin. The National  Criminal Police got on the trail of the gang upon being  contacted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S.  Customs.    Nigerian heroin has been smuggled via Finland to at least  the  United States and Germany, but additional Central European  countries were also mentioned in the preliminary hearing. The  activity has probably been continuing for at least a full year.    According to Criminal Commissioner Jaakko Sonck, it appears  that the heroin has not been sold in Finland.    Police have seized very pure white and brown heroin. Heroin  of this quality can still be cut before being sold to abusers.  In Finland the price for heroin on the street is from 2,000 to  5,000 markkas per gram.    Seven Nigerians residing in Finland have been arrested, and  four of these have been charged on suspicion of aggravated  narcotics violations.</p>

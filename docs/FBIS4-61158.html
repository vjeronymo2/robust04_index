			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Vinogradov: "Shooting Continues in </F> Karabakh Conflict Zone"]    [Text] There is every indication that Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev's threats of abandoning involvement in  settling the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict if the warring sides  continue fighting are having little effect. Contrary to  expectations calm did not prevail on all fronts 29 April.    As you know, Baku was the first to respond to Russia's  cease-fire initiative. Azerbaijani Defense Minister Mamedrafi  Mamedov agreed 26 April to suspend combat operations and begin  talks. It took Nagorno-Karabakh three days to come up with an  affirmative response. In a letter to Pavel Grachev, Andrey  Kozyrev, and Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian president's special  representative, Karabakh Foreign Minister Samvel Babayan said  that troops have been ordered not to fire.    A truce has not been secured. There is still no official  document. Whereas Azerbaijan is being guided by the Russian  plan, which talks about curtailing offensive operations and the  use of heavy artillery for shelling and aerial bombardment,  Stepanakert is acting on the basis of the 18 February protocol  signed in Moscow. This envisages a cease-fire applicable to all  categories of weapons.    Over the next few days a unified document is expected to be  signed, guaranteed by representatives of Russia and the CSCE's  Minsk Group. But for the time being the conflicting sides are  accusing one another of intending to use the peaceful respite to  regroup their forces and prepare for another assault. Over the  last few days the Karabakh troops have had some success in the  northern sector, penetrating several kilometers into Azerbaijan.  Baku is demanding that troops be withdrawn from the captured  areas, which by and large accords with the Russian plan.    There is a dual attitude to this document. Geydar Aliyev  supported it by and large, but is pressing for "certain  finishing touches." Yerevan agrees with the main provisions of  the draft, but claims that it does not have decisive influence  over Stepanakert. We were told by the Russian Foreign Ministry  that painstaking work still lies ahead in order to close the gap  between their positions. An Azerbaijani parliament delegation  led by Speaker Rasul Guliyev is holding consultations with the  Russian leadership. Experts led by the Swedish diplomat Matias  Mosberg [name as transliterated], head of the CSCE Minsk group  on Nagorno-Karabakh, have traveled out to the frontline area.    He described the Russian plan as the "most realistic,"  singling out such points as the liberation of Azerbaijan's  conquered territory and the creation of a joint staff to  supervise the implementation of commitments.</p>

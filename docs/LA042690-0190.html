			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ST. LOUIS PAPER FOLDS AFTER PUBLISHING ONLY 7 MONTHS  </P> <P> The St. Louis Sun, which hoped to be the first major metropolitan newspaper to  make a successful launch in this country since World War II, unexpectedly  folded Wednesday after only seven months.  </P> <P> At a news conference, Ralph Ingersoll II, editor-in-chief of the new newspaper,  said the Sun had published its last edition Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "Closing the Sun was a decision the St. Louis marketplace made for us," said  Ingersoll. Since launching the paper Sept. 25, 1989, the newspaper had  published 213 editions.  </P> <P> "It is clear that we could not achieve sufficient circulation to make this  enterprise viable, and so we have concluded that there is no longer room in St.  Louis for a third newspaper in addition to our own Suburban Journals and the  Post-Dispatch."  </P> <P> The Sun had struggled to overcome higher-than-expected costs, revolving-door  circulation, limited advertising and a murky image.  </P></p>

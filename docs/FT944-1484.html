			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television Christmas is already influencing scheduling trends: old films, a quiz and ancient comedy are in evidence tonight. Among the oldies I would happily plump for the repeated Only Fools and Horses (8.30 BBC1) above the others. Not quite Christmassy is Sex in a Cold Climate (9.00 C4). No, not a permissive update of Nancy Mitford but a documentary on Ann Summers, the sex shops I fondly imagined run by a liberated Hampstead-dweller in a Laura Ashley smock. The chain is actually owned by a group whose interests include porn mags, which adds a sinister edge to the shots of housewives shrieking at jolly sex-aids selling parties. Whatever happened to Tupperware? Don't answer - they have probably found an unmentionable use for that as well. Is tonight the last pre-Christmas sex (sorry, adult programme) binge? The Ballad of Nicky Mouse (12 midnight C4) is not quite unmentionable, merely unspeakable. Homosexuality in prison inspired the Jean Genet film Un Chant d'amour but this pretentious drivel is not, emphatically not, it.</p>

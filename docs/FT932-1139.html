			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Major suffers further jolt as Mates resigns: Letter to attorney general 'based on bogus information' MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday suffered another jolt to his leadership when Mr Michael Mates was finally forced to quit as Northern Ireland minister over his links with the fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir. Mr Mates bowed to pressure from Conservative MPs and resigned because of the 'cumulative damage' caused by revelations about his connections with Mr Nadir after weeks of speculation about his future. His departure is the third from the government since last year's general election and raised fresh questions among Tory MPs about the prime minister's style of government. Mr David Mellor resigned as national heritage secretary in September and Mr Norman Lamont resigned as chancellor last month. Hinting that he felt he was the victim of a campaign against him, Mr Mates complained in his resignation letter to the prime minister of 'the daily leaking of letters and so-called quotes from unknown sources  - most of them wildly inaccurate'. But Mr Mates's embarrassment was compounded when Scotland Yard said that the letter which precipitated his resignation was based on bogus information about police investigations into Mr Nadir and his assets. According to Scotland Yard, the two Metropolitan Police officers named in the letter sent to the attorney general by Mr Mates, complaining about police and inland revenue investigations, were in Northern Cyprus not to look into Mr Nadir's affairs but on unrelated business. The letter, published in the Daily Mail, claims that two officers, Mr David Jones and Mr Geoff Savin, visited Northern Cyprus to make extensive inquiries about Mr Nadir and his assets. But in an unprecedented contradiction of a minister's statement, Scotland Yard, while confirming that the pair visited Northern Cyprus, said: 'They had no association with or responsibility for any investigation relating to Mr Nadir.' Scotland Yard said Mr Jones and Mr Savin were members of SO1(3), a branch of the Metropolitan Police's international and organised crime branch dealing with extradition and deportation. The former minister was further embarrassed by reports of him dining at the Reform Club in London on Wednesday night with Mr Christopher Morgan, a public relations adviser to Mr Nadir. The controversy over Mr Mates came to a head when the Northern Ireland minister, after taking soundings among Conservative colleagues at Westminster, asked for a meeting with the prime minister to offer his resig-nation. Mr Major had avoided giving anything other than lukewarm support to Mr Mates, fuelling the impression that Downing Street was prepared to allow the minister to resign but was not prepared to sack him. But in an afternoon announcement which took the House of Commons by surprise, Mr Major said that he had accepted Mr Mates's resignation 'with regret'. He stressed that he believed Mr Mates had behaved 'with complete propriety' in raising Mr Nadir's case with the attorney general. Replying to Mr Mates' resignation letter, Mr Major added: 'I am sure that you took the right decision.' Mr Mates, referring to the watch he had sent Mr Nadir inscribed, 'don't let the buggers get you down', said in his resignation letter to the prime minister: 'In retrospect, I rather wish I had sent the watch with its now famous message to you.' The leak of Mr Mates's letter to the attorney general provoked claims by some of the former minister's colleagues that he was the victim of a 'dirty tricks' campaign. Rightwing MPs, however, denied he was a victim of his long lasting support for party leadership contender Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Mr Mates' decision to resign marked a swift about-turn. Early yesterday, he had appeared determined to remain in office. On Tuesday he said he had the 'full confidence' of the prime minister - suggesting he was determined to brazen out the calls for him to resign. The latest controversy has added to Mr Major's difficulties in exerting his leadership credentials. Tory MPs now show less and less inhibition about calling for changes in ministers or policy. Adding to the Tories' embarrassment was the claim by Mr Nadir on ITN television last night that he was courted by senior figures in the Conservative party seeking donations to Tory funds.

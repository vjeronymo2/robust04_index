			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (6): 'The real Africa' - Tourism / destination for travellers rather than tourists David Livingstone devoted only one paragraph of his journals to the Luangwa valley in eastern Zambia. He trekked through the plains in December 1866 and must have had a miserable time: December is the height of the rainy season, when dry river-beds overflow with treacherous waters, mosquitos thrive, and trails are washed out. Had he chanced upon Luangwa in the dry season, he might have been more eloquent about the richness of its wildlife, the variety of its tropical hardwoods and the mysterious aphrodisiac properties of the Sausage Tree. But as it turned out, it was the Victoria Falls which captured Livingstone's imagination, and the Luangwa Valley, confined to obscurity, remains one of Africa's best-kept secrets. More than a century later, Zambia remains a destination for travellers rather than tourists. Shoddy state-run hotels, bad roads and an unreliable state airline discouraged many would-be visitors. Tour operators estimate that fewer than 50,000 genuine tourists visit the country each year. Tapping Zambia's tourist potential has not been one of President Frederick Chiluba's priorities. The new government's cost-cutting measures have left little room for revamping Zambia's dilapidated tourist infrastructure, while the National Hotels Development Corporation has been dissolved. Its demise has left many hotels, particularly in rural areas, bereft of adequate funding. Most of them have now been slated for privatisation. The private sector has decided to make a virtue out of necessity, promoting Zambia as 'the real Africa' - a vast land untarnished by package tours, big hotels or zebra-striped minibuses. A number of private hotel groups are beginning to examine new ventures, with 33 new lodges planned for the national parks. In Lusaka, Standard Merchant Bank of South Africa and Anglo American Corporation are investing Dollars 6m to revamp the 40-year-old Ridgeway Hotel, one of the capital's landmarks. For the foreseeable future, however, Zambia is likely to remain a destination for the adventurous traveller. The first walking safaris in Africa, pioneered by Mr Norman Carr, a game ranger in the British colonial service who helped set up Zambia's national parks, began in the Luangwa valley more than 20 years ago. The tradition has been continued by Wilderness Trails, which run Chibembe Safari Lodge and Nsefu Camp in the heart of the South Luangwa national park. For those with steady nerves, nothing can quite match the excitement of coming face to face with a herd of 40 elephant, or fording a river teeming with hippos and crocodiles. The danger, say Chibembe's guides, is more imagined than real. In 20 years of organising walking safaris, not one tourist has been mangled by lions. But an armed game park ranger accompanies the typical three-day expedition for good measure. At night, it is common to hear the gruff panting of leopard stalking their prey and baboons barking nervously at the proximity of predators. Hippos emerge from the Luangwa river to graze. It is best to give them a wide berth - they are unpredictable beasts which can charge with a speed that defies their bulk. While Zimbabwe has tended to attract the majority of visitors to the Victoria Falls, several private operators have begun to offer interesting alternatives on the Zambian side. Tongabezi Safaris has exclusive access to Livingstone Island, perched right on the edge of the Falls, where a maximum of eight guests are ferried by inflatable dinghy or canoe. Livingstone camped on the island when he first 'discovered' the Falls in 1855. Tongabezi also organises white water rafting in the gorges of the Zambezi, downstream from the Falls, as well as boating and canoeing in the quieter stretches of the river.

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Vichy casts a shadow: France still refuses to accept shared responsibility for its past Revelations that President Francois Mitterrand of France had murky links with the right wing before, during and after the second world war have sent the French political class into a buzz of shock and horror. Socialists are dismayed that this latest blow to the reputation of their one-time leader will further contaminate their own damaged credibility. But not even his rightwing critics have crowed too loudly, for no political clan is quite comfortable when the Vichy era is under discussion. That is the point of this controversy: it is not what it reveals about the dubious political debut of Francois Mitterrand, but what it reveals about the feelings of the French today towards that inglorious chapter of their history. They still have difficulty facing up to what happened between the fall of France in 1940 and the liberation of Paris in 1944, when the Vichy government of Marshal Petain submitted to the Nazi victors. Every so often old wounds are reopened by a new investigation, and each time the French react with consternation, as if they had never heard of that traumatic era. Then the shock dies away, and the unacceptable past is again buried. So it is with the new book by Pierre Pean, Une Jeunesse Francaise*. It provides the fullest account yet of Mitterrand's early career, with many previously unpublished details. But most of the story has long been known: that Mitterrand came from a conservative, bourgeois background, and started his political career far to the right of centre; that before joining the Resistance he worked for the Petain government, and was awarded the top Vichy decoration, the 'Francisque'; and that he remained right of centre after the war. What is most disturbing about the book is not mainly what it reveals about Mitterrand then, but what it reveals about Mitterrand now. Pean clears him of any anti-semitism under Vichy; but it is dismaying that today Mitterrand should still be pretending that he did not then know about Vichy's anti-semitic laws, even though they led to the deportation of thousands of Jews to German extermination camps. Given his bourgeois, provincial background in the unstable years before the war, it is not surprising that Mitterrand should have flirted as a young man with the far right; but the fact that his friends continued to include people from the far right, not just after the war but into the 1980s, will reinforce his opponents' conviction that Mitterrand has few political principles. Perhaps the bottom line is that the president refuses to accept France's historical and political responsibility for the debacle of 1940-44. As far as he is concerned, Vichy was a different regime, and nothing to do with the republic - in fact, nothing to do with us today. It is as if Vichy were an accident, without organic origins in French political history, for which no one was responsible. It is in such terms that the French have repeatedly refused to accept shared responsibility for their history. Throughout the political instability of the 19th century, each succeeding regime was permanently under attack in terms of its essential legitimacy; and the rightwing tradition which rejected the legitimacy of republican democracy eventually erupted in the anti-semitism of the Dreyfus case in 1894, when the Jewish army officer was falsely accused of spying for Germany. The Petain regime was no doubt exceptional; it was not an accident. Like the nationalism of the late 19th century, it was a reaction to humiliating defeat by the Germans. The French have since tried to exorcise it as illegitimate; but unless they find some way of accepting collective responsibility for it, the struggles between rival concepts of political legitimacy will rage on, threatening instability. Throughout the 1950s, de Gaulle denounced the illegitimacy of the Fourth Republic, of which Mitterrand was a leading figure; throughout the 1960s, Mitterrand denounced the illegitimacy of de Gaulle and the Fifth Republic; and throughout the past 14 years the Gaullists have denounced the illegitimacy of President Mitterrand. This process is gathering momentum once more, in the run-up to next spring's presidential election. The conservatives ought to win that election easily. Yet they are split on ancestrally visceral grounds, and could throw it all away. If they were to unite behind the candidacy of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, he would surely win. But it seems more likely that there will be up to six rival candidates. Personal ambition is not the only factor. Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullist party, has been trying and failing to be president since 1981, and he will not give way now. But the undertow of the Chirac-Balladur struggle is political legitimacy. Chirac has as few political principles as anyone; but his claim to legitimacy and the loyalty of his party is that he is an inheritor of genuine Gaullism, while Balladur is merely a modernising conservative. In 1988, Chirac conducted his presidential campaign as farce. He frenziedly paced up and down, calling on President Mitterrand to come out and fight. Naturally, Mitterrand waited until Chirac had worn himself out, and then took him to the cleaners. Today Chirac is again frenziedly pacing up and down, calling for the election to begin; once again he is likely to wear himself out - and split the Gaullist party in two. This intra-conservative struggle should be interesting and possibly entertaining. We should remember that its historic roots pass through the unexorcised trauma of Vichy. *Une Jeunesse Francaise: Francois Mitterrand 1934-1947, by Pierre Pean, Fayard, FFr160</p>

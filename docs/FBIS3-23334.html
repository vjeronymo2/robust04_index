			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nicholas Watt, Ireland correspondent, in </F> Drogheda: "Revenge Gang Kills `Mad Dog' Terrorist"]    [Text] Dominic McGlinchey, the former republican terrorist  leader who carried out some of Ulster's most brutal killings,  has been murdered. Irish police believe his killers were former  associates settling a long-standing feud.    McGlinchey, who as head of the Irish National Liberation  Army  was nicknamed Mad Dog, was shot ten times at point-blank range  by three men as he used a telephone box next to a hospital. The  killing happened on Thursday night at Drogheda, Co Louth.  McGlinchey had been driving home with his 18-year-old son, also  called Dominic, who watched from the car as the gunmen shot his  father in the knees, stomach, chest, neck and head.    Detectives said yesterday that McGlinchey, who was believed  to be setting up a new republican paramilitary organisation, was  shot by former members of the INLA who had been stalking his  movements in Drogheda. Intelligence sources said McGlinchey's  killers were believed to have been tortured by him when he tried  to root out INLA informers ten years ago.    McGlinchey knew he was living under the threat of an attack  and escaped a murder attempt last June. The new attack came  three months after his release from the republic's Portlaoise  prison after a ten-year sentence.    A police source said yesterday: "This time they were making  no mistake. It was a real professional killing. The men who  killed him were settling an old score." The same group is  believed to have been responsible for the murder of McGlinchey's  wife, Mary, who was shot at pointblank range in front of her two  sons in 1987.    McGlinchey, who was devastated by her murder, vowed to root  out the killers. But it appears that they reached him first. A  detective said yesterday: "He lived by the gun and died by the  gun. He was not a man who was going to die in his bed of old  age."    Local people described the scene behind the Our Lady of  Lourdes Hospital. Kevin O'Rourke said: "I heard a couple of  bangs and someone screaming. I went out and could see this man  lying on the ground with a hole in his chest and head. Blood was  everywhere."    Margaret Black, 47, who lives near by, said: "I knelt down  beside him and felt a weak pulse in his neck. I knew he was on  the way out. He then said to me, 'Jesus, help me, Mary.'" This  was apparently a reference to his wife.    After forensic scientists from dublin examined the area,  McGlinchey's body was moved to the hospital mortuary early  yesterday for a post-mortem examination. McGlinchey will be  buried next week next to his wife in Bellaghy, Co Londonderry.</p>

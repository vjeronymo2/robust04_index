			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris today hosted the Lebanese National Congress,  which supports General Michel 'Awn. Michel 'Awn has been living  in exile in France for five years. He pledged not to express  his views but he has not given up the idea of playing a  political role in his country. He wants his country to stop  being the hostage of the rather complicated relations between  Syria and Israel. This is in substance what he said to Helene  da Costa:    [Begin 'Awn recording] We are awaiting recommendations in  order to get out of the stalemate in which Lebanon now finds  itself and the peace negotiations with Israel because things at  present are in a deadlock. Lebanon is totally signed away to  Syria. It cannot do anything. It is there, but it is absent.    My proposals cannot be announced without being adopted [as  heard] yet I advocate a change in the shape of the table. The  table should not be bilateral, it should be trilateral: Syrian,  Lebanese, and Israeli, because each of the two remaining forces  claims to be in Lebanon because the other is there. If there are  three of them, they cannot use this as a pretext. They must  answer specific questions. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 Apr (MENA)--Mahmud 'Abbas, alias  Abu-Mazin, a PLO Executive Committee member, arrived in Cairo  this morning. He met General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief  of staff and head of the Israeli delegation to the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. Palestinian sources said the  meeting aims to bridge the gap between the two sides' views  concerning various points that are still the subject of dispute,  particularly the legal jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho and the  control of the crossings.    Abu-Mazin earlier met members of the Palestinian negotiating  team. The talks during the meeting dealt with progress and the  efforts required to coordinate the Palestinian stances on the  proposals to be presented during this round of negotiations.</p>

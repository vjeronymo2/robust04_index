			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (8): Tough, but Barclays shines - How is the private sector adjusting to the government's economic reforms? FT writers provide four illustrations Along with exporters, the financial sector has been the main beneficiary of liberalisation - a development underlined in the sparkling 1993 results reported by Barclays Bank of Kenya. Pre-tax profits more than doubled in the year to December 31 with earnings per share up 88 per cent. Three main factors account for this impressive performance at a time of stagflation in the economy. Income was boosted by high lending rates - a net interest margin between overdraft and deposit rates, averaging 7.4 per cent (according to official Central Bank of Kenya figures), while lending was up 28 per cent over the year. More important was the return on money market operations - windfall gains from holding a substantial portfolio of high-yield treasury bills. Retail banks with a large customer base, were able to source funds from current and savings deposits at average rates of 18.5 per cent and 14.75 per cent, reinvesting them in treasury bills at an average rate of 57 per cent between April and December. This did not apply to banks forced to source funds from the interbank market, where rates were higher than on treasury bills. The third factor was the substantial increase in the volume of foreign exchange business, arising from the liberalisation of exchange controls, the requirement for tourist operators to make payments in foreign currency and the scope to exploit profit opportunities in highly volatile market conditions. Barclays targeted firms with foreign currency revenues. There were windfall profits to be made, says Barclays Kenya managing director Bob Bird, 'provided you got it right and didn't take undue risks'. Even so, 1993 was a tough year. Most of the participants in the country's 26 banks had never operated with market-driven exchange and interest rates. Barclays got its timing right, bringing in a foreign exchange dealer from London in November 1992 to prepare for liberalisation. Business volumes - and costs - expanded dramatically as the Central Bank delegated the issue of import licences to the banks. At the same time bank systems were simply not geared to cope with foreign exchange accounting forced on them by the introduction - and subsequent expansion - of retentions accounts. 'We anticipated liberalisation,' says Mr Bird, 'but with the rapid growth in volumes and inward inflows of foreign exchange, we ran up against infrastructural problems. We had to train managers and staff to be more market responsive, while alerting them to the pitfalls of foreign currency exposure.' The nature of bank lending changed, too. The pre-reform period was one of hand-to-mouth reliance on scarce letters of credit (LCs), but as Kenya's short-term credit rating improved and reserves rose to reach four months import cover while customer demand fell, it became far easier to open LCs. At the same time, the name of the business game had changed. In a controlled system inventory management by importers and manufacturers was based on 'just-in-case' principles. With long supply lead times, due to the cumbersome import licensing process and foreign exchange scarcity, management was forced to carry huge inventories. With liberalisation, lead times shortened dramatically and, faced with high borrowing rates and falling domestic demand, business has run down its stocks and its bank borrowing. One might have expected the roller-coaster business conditions of the past year to result in a fair number of corporate failures, but that has not happened. Mr Bird says there have been 'remarkably few' corporate failures and some surprisingly good results, given the difficult business climate. 'Nobody from the top 200 seems to be suffering too much, perhaps because a lot of them have switched heavily into exporting.' Barclays' 1993 performance will be a hard act to follow. Money market margins are far slimmer today, and more traditional overdraft lending is a better bet, with the spread between retail deposit and lending rates up to 16 per cent in February, according to Central Bank figures. But demand is relatively weak, and there is the danger of being caught by the reversal in the forex market if - later in the year - the shilling overshoots again, as it did last year, and starts to depreciate. Bankers say that one of the most important changes of the past year has been the rehabilitation of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). Until the appointment of Micah Cheserem, an accountant formerly employed by Unilever, as governor, the central bank, and with it monetary policy and bank supervision, was in disarray. There was little communication between the banks and the CBK, bank supervision was virtually non-existent and the economy was rocked by a series of financial scams, estimated to have cost the country - and the government - tens of millions of dollars. Mr Cheserem changed all that, revamping CBK's top management, stamping out corruption, strengthening supervision and tightening monetary policy, first by mopping up liquidity through the issue of treasury bills and subsequently by raising the statutory cash ratio of the banks from 8 per cent to 20 per cent of their deposits, thereby squeezing their lending capacity. Money supply growth of 26 per cent during 1993 is still too high. Although lending to the public sector declined 11 per cent last year and private sector borrowing was flat, money supply grew strongly, fuelled by the inflow of foreign exchange as exports increased and capital flight was reversed by the combination of foreign payments liberalisation and high nominal domestic interest rates. Kenya's net foreign asset position swung from a negative Dollars 100m in April to a plus number of more than Dollars 330m by the year-end. Despite these gains, the imbalance between a loose fiscal and a restrictive monetary stance means that the banks will remain in the frontline of the battle against inflation over the next year. Getting rid of the T-bill mountain, maintaining positive real interest rates - they are substantially negative at present - and managing foreign currency positions in a year in which the exchange rate overshoot can be expected to reverse itself suggests that 1994 will be another busy, though almost certainly, less spectacular year for the banks.</p>

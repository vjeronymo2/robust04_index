			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE APPROVES PLAN TO FINISH HIKING TRAIL  </P> <P> Years ago, many hikers with more enthusiasm than experience would trudge into  Bailey Canyon, a rugged gorge in the San Gabriel Mountains, only to be rescued  many hours or days later, lost, cold, hungry and sometimes seriously injured.  </P> <P> It wasn't until the late 1960s that hikers could find their way in the canyon  along a trail that was carved by a small group of teen-age boys who called  themselves the Sierra Madre Mountaineers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $50,000 Grant  </P> <P> But the Mountaineers, whose goal was to cut a three-mile zigzag path to Jones  Peak, a 3,400-foot ridge to the northeast of the canyon, abandoned the task  when it was two-thirds finished. Today, the map board in Bailey Canyon Park  labels the final approach to Jones Peak as an "uncompleted trail." But to many  hikers, "deer path" would be more accurate.  </P> <P> Sierra Madre officials were notified in May that the State Department of Parks  and Recreation has approved a proposal by the city to finish the job that the  Mountaineers started.  </P> <P> A $50,000 grant will be used to repair the existing trail, complete it to Jones  Peak and create a new three-mile segment that will link it to the Mt. Wilson  Trail in Little Santa Anita Canyon. Planning for the project will begin later  this year.  </P> <P> "Bailey Canyon was one of the best places for trapping," says Earl Lalone, 64,  a Sierra Madre native who remembers the canyon from the 1930s and who still  hikes there. "Up there we would get fox, raccoon, ring-tailed cat and coyote.  We shipped the pelts to a furrier in Chicago."  </P> <P> With his three brothers, Lalone was among the original members of the Sierra  Madre Search and Rescue Team. His son, Chris, was one of the Mountaineers in  the 1960s.  </P> <P> Bailey Canyon, one of several smaller canyons that slice into the mountains  between Eaton Canyon on the west and Little Santa Anita Canyon on the east, was  a logical place for the Mountaineers to create a path. They had grown up  listening to their fathers, members of the Sierra Madre Search and Rescue Team,  describe rescue operations in the mountains.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Site of Rescue  </P> <P> And the canyon, which starts at the northern end of Lima Street, was the site  of a rescue that sparked the formation of the volunteer Search and Rescue Team  in 1951.  </P> <P> When their sons came up with the plan to aid hikers in Bailey Canyon with the  trail, their fathers not only encouraged them but served as advisers, along  with representatives of the U.S. Forest Service.  </P> <P> For several years the group got together on weekends and during school  vacations, putting in hundreds of hours of work cutting switchbacks, or zigzag  paths, up the east side of the canyon.  </P> <P> They had completed the trail just beyond a point known as "the promontory," a  spur of land next to the trail that drops off sharply on three sides, leaving a  small, flat open area. Knee-high stone walls are the only remains of a cabin  built there in 1910. Here the proposed trail would have climbed eastward, away  from Bailey Canyon, zigzagging to the top of the peak.  </P> <P> But from the site of the cabin the trail fades rapidly. With more than two  miles completed -- about 2,000 feet of elevation gain -- the workers abandoned  their project.  </P> <P> Rae Anderson, whose three sons were members of the Mountaineers, says that as  the boys became young men, much of their enthusiasm was "diverted to cars and  girls." To finance their new interests, they found paying summer jobs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fire and Flood Damage  </P> <P> In October, 1978, a fire swept over the ridge and burned Bailey Canyon almost  to the stream bed near its mouth. Two months later, heavy rains resulted in  flooding, and the ground cover's being reduced to ashes led to devastating  erosion of the trail.  </P> <P> All things considered, the existing trail is in good shape today. Over the past  decade, local Boy Scouts and other groups have done intermittent sand-bagging  to shore up weak spots along the trail's edge.  </P> <P> Slopes cleared by the 1978 fire have been reclaimed by typical chaparral. The  canyon is alive again.  </P> <P> As recently as last summer, the Sierra Madre Police Department required hikers  to obtain a permit to enter the mountains above town during the peak fire  season.  </P> <P> But since Pasadena, Arcadia and the Angeles National Forest, which border  Sierra Madre, require no permit, Fire Marshal Bill Kramer said Sierra Madre  will waive the permit requirement on a one-year, experimental basis.  </P> <P> An advantage to hiking Bailey Canyon is that one does not have to slink across  back fences or sprint past privately owned beehives to reach the trail. It lies  entirely on public lands, starting on the edge of Sierra Madre at the end of  Grove Street. The hiker earns a feeling of accomplishment in the rough terrain  and is rewarded by lofty overviews of the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> Hiking purists do not fear that the trail will be clogged by mountain bikes  after the city's work on the trail is completed. It is narrow, and features  dozens of hairpin turns.  </P> <P> There are disadvantages, too. The present trail does not connect with any  other. After toiling more than two miles, hikers must turn back, or crawl and  thrash their way over three more miles of manzanita-covered slopes to reach the  Mt. Wilson Trail.  </P> <P> Jones Peak Trail is not for couch potatoes. It is steep and "as crooked as a  dog's hind leg," a veteran hiker once said. When the sun is high, there is  little shade.  </P> <P> The entrance to the canyon is in Bailey Canyon Park; the upper reaches extend  well into Angeles National Forest. The start of the trail is reached by passing  to the west of the flood control basin in Bailey Canyon Park and then, at a  locked gate, bearing to the left into the mouth of the canyon.  </P> <P> The large buildings with red tile roofs visible on the hillside to the west are  the Passionist Fathers Monastery and Retreat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Low Brush  </P> <P> Winter flooding over the years has eroded the stream banks near the canyon  entrance, isolating a short nature loop-trail on a bench of land opposite the  main trail. The trail winds into the canyon through low brush and a scattering  of sycamore and oak.  </P> <P> A quarter of a mile beyond the flood control basin, at the foot of a 35-foot  pine, the trail begins the long ascent to Jones Peak. The slopes are covered by  thick brush -- mostly manzanita -- and an occasional yucca. The rustling in the  bushes turns out to be a squirrel, rabbit or scrub jay. Tiny lizards leap away  at a hiker's approach.  </P> <P> At the cabin ruins, the trail swings away from Bailey Canyon and enters a  forest of pine and big cone spruce and then ends in thick brush.  </P></p>

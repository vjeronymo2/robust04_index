Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> CHARGES AGAINST MOM CALLED A HOAX  </P> <P> All but one of the 59 charges against an El Cerrito woman who was accused of  prostituting her children were dropped after the youngsters told investigators  they made the story up, prosecutors said today.  </P> <P> The 29-year-old woman, who has been held without bail since January, and the  children's grandmother had been charged with pandering, aiding in the sexual  molestation of children and furnishing drugs to minors.  </P> <P> The woman's 12-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son accused her earlier this  year of forcing them to have sex with dozens of adults and said they were given  drugs to make them more compliant. But they said over the weekend that they had  been neglected by their mother. She still faces a charge of felony child  endangerment. Charges against the grandmother were dropped.  </P></p>

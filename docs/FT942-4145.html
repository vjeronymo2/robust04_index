			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Stockholm doubts over Vienna vote Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister, said the uphill task of persuading Swedes to vote to join the EU this autumn would be even more difficult if fellow-applicant Austria rejects membership in its referendum tomorrow. But he admitted the severe doubts over the outcome of Sweden's November plebiscite on the issue were unlikely to be dispelled by an Austrian Yes vote, or by Finnish acceptance of membership in a similar referendum due in October. 'We can be affected negatively if things go wrong (in Austria) - not to mention the major catastrophe if things go wrong in both countries that will hold a referendum before us.

This would leave little time afterwards to overturn opinion, at present running strongly against membership. Mr Bildt, who leads a right-centre coalition, was sharply critical of the leadership of the opposition Social Democratic party, the majority of whose supporters are opposed to the EU, for not campaigning more actively for a Yes vote: 'It is strange that the largest party in Sweden has not taken a position on the largest issue in Sweden. . . I fear that we are past the point at which it will be possible for the Social Democrats to get a majority of their people on the Yes side.'

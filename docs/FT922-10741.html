			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / GM returns to black in quarter GENERAL MOTORS, the US carmaker in the throes of a sweeping restructuring, yesterday announced a return to modest profit after six quarters of red ink, thanks to lower losses in its core North American vehicle operations. The company reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 179m (Pounds 101m) and a sharp improvement on the Dollars 1.1bn loss in the same period last year before Dollars 942m of non-recurring gains. Sales and revenues rose from Dollars 29.19bn to Dollars 32.04bn. Wall Street had forecast a modest loss, although recently the company appeared to hint at a profit. GM's shares rose Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 40 1/4 . The figures should help GM over the next few months as it tries to sell about Dollars 2.3bn of common stock in the largest-ever international share offering, apart from privatisations. Mr Robert Stempel, GM chairman, said the Dollars 1.3bn profit turnaround, in spite of 'a very slow economic recovery in the US', was due mainly to an improved performance by its North American operations. GM, and other vehicle manufacturers, has been hit by the US recession and over-capacity. However, its capacity and productivity problems are more serious than its rivals and last December Mr Stempel announced restructuring for North America, involving 70,000 job losses. Earlier this month, GM's non-executive directors, dissatisfied with the speed of reform, staged a boardroom coup which clipped Mr Stempel's wings. The company said North American operations benefited from increased factory sales, manufacturing cost efficiencies, lower per-unit selling expenses, material cost reductions and a more profitable product mix. The company's US dealers sold 1.03m cars and trucks in the first quarter, up 3.6 per cent on 1991. GM's international vehicle operations had 'continued at strong profit levels'. The company's return to profits was helped by improved performances from its non-vehicle operations, with GH Hughes Electronics earning Dollars 181m (up from Dollars 97m), Electronic Data Systems making Dollars 133m (Dollars 122m) and General Motors Acceptance Credit, its finance arm, Dollars 354m (Dollars 306m). Earnings per share on common stock were 2 cents against a loss of 40 cents.</p>

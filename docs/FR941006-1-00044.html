Full payment for each subscription must be submitted by the Fedwire funds transfer system with credit directed to the Treasury's General Account. Full payment should be submitted by 3 p.m., Eastern time, to ensure that settlement on the securities occurs on the date of issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Noncompliance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The penalty imposed on any subscriber which fails to make settlement on a subscription once submitted shall be to render the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering for a period of six months, beginning on the date the subscription is withdrawn or the proposed issue date, whichever occurs first. The Division of Special Investments may determine to waive the six month penalty, pursuant to the provisions governing waiver of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126. Where settlement occurs after the proposed issue date and the Division of Special Investments determines, pursuant to 31 CFR 306.126, that settlement is acceptable on an exception basis, the six month penalty will be waived, and the subscriber shall be subject to a late payment assessment. The assessment will include payment of an amount equal to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the securities from the proposed issue date to the date of settlement, as well as an administrative fee of $100 per subscription. Assessments under this subsection are due on demand. Failure to pay an assessment shall render the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering until the assessment is paid. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1535&hyph;0091) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;344.9  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Redemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A security may be redeemed at the owner's option, provided a request for redemption is received not less than one business day prior to the requested redemption date.

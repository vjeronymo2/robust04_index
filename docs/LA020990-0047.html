			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN ENTRUSTS FOOTBALL TEAM TO HARPER  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran fired one past national champion football coach but managed to  replace him with another.  </P> <P> Joe Harper, coach of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's 1980 NCAA Division II  championship team, was introduced Thursday as the replacement for Bob Shoup,  whose 1971 NAIA title was the highlight of his 28-year tenure as Cal Lutheran  coach.  </P> <P> It became public in August that the 1989 season would be Shoup's last. Shoup's  ensuing grievance did not complete official university channels until Jan. 23,  but Harper said the controversy has not affected him.  </P> <P> "It really doesn't bother me," Harper said at a press conference. "My  involvement has been very short."  </P> <P> Dennis Gillette, vice president for institutional advancement, said the  university had no qualms about hiring a new coach even though there is a  possibility that the former coach will continue to contest his dismissal.  </P> <P> "We can't, because the university, as far as the position of former coach, has  gone through the process," Gillette said. "What happens from this point on,  we'll have to deal with it when it occurs."  </P> <P> Harper, 53, coached 14 seasons at San Luis Obispo. He coached Northern Arizona  from 1982 to 1984, compiling a record of 12-20, but moved back to his native  Southern California after several years in Flagstaff. A commercial real estate  salesman, he has been in private business since being fired by Northern  Arizona.  </P> <P> "I never wanted to get out" of coaching, said Harper, who has a career record  of 117-64-4. "I feel it's been a five-year search to find a situation that  looked right to me."  </P> <P> In 1986, Harper was a finalist for the Cal State Northridge football job.  </P> <P> "In my estimation (Cal Lutheran) is exactly the right place to be at this  time," said Harper, who lives in Arcadia but said he will move closer to the  school. "I feel fortunate that I was in a position when Cal Lutheran had a  need, I had a need, and that our paths crossed."  </P> <P> Harper's stocky build reflects his years as a UCLA lineman in the 1950s. At  CLU, Harper also will be a lecturer in the physical education department.  </P> <P> Harper said his teams have been pass- and run-oriented at different times in  his career. All three of his Northern Arizona squads averaged more than 200  yards passing per game, and his 1984 team topped out at 266.5 passing yards per  game.  </P> <P> Harper, noting that he had yet to evaluate his personnel, said, "It would be  silly to try to force a scheme that would be inappropriate to the people."  </P></p>

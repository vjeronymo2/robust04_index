			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (8): Some of the red tape has been removed  -David Buchan examines foreign investment Direct foreign investment, in the form of outright acquisitions of local companies or the building of green field factories, seems to most French people a more solid contribution to their economy than financial portfolio investment which can take flight more easily (see article on privatisation). But the controversy over Hoover's decision to switch its European vacuum cleaner production from Dijon to Scotland - and lower paid workers - has reminded many French that direct foreign investment can be flighty, too. The Hoover case was controversial, because the decision to disinvest was taken in the middle of a French election campaign, and because there was a suspicion, denied by the US company, that it was playing off two sets of European workers against each other. But it is not the only case of controversial foreign disinvestment; SKF, the Swedish ball bearing maker, and Iveco, Fiat's truck making arm, have also run into criticism for the abrupt manner in which they have laid workers off in France. However, given the much larger number of French companies which have been switching production to lower cost regions of the world, France has reason to be grateful for what new foreign investment it has been attracting. Certainly, Mr Jean-Daniel Tordjman, who holds the new post of France's special representative for international investment, is philosophical. 'There are always going to be closings (of foreign-owned plants) as well as openings, just as with domestic investment.' For the moment the latter category outweighs the former. Foreign-controlled companies created 14,148 jobs last year, though of course the net addition to employment was somewhat less - and dwarfed by the inexorable rise in the total number of unemployed, which hit 3.1m in April 1993. Nonetheless, last year saw a levelling-out of the traditional imbalance of French companies investing far more abroad than their foreign counterparts in France. Foreign-owned firms now employ 22 per cent of France's industrial workforce. They account for 27 per cent of its manufacturing output and 30 per cent of its exports, with particular strength in the food-processing, electronics and chemicals sectors. Mr Tordjman acknowledges the general slowdown in foreign investment. The US remains the biggest single source of outside investment in France. The most eye-catching of US projects is the Euro Disney complex outside Paris, which got off to a somewhat rocky start in spring 1992, but American companies such as Storage Tech and Dell Computer also built new facilities, in southern France. Among European investors, the most notable shift was the decline in new investment from Germany - now so preoccupied with its eastern half - and the rise in investment from Switzerland, prompted, perhaps, by Swiss companies' concern about their country shutting itself out of the EC. For all France's anti-Japanese rhetoric, particularly on car imports, almost all the Japanese electronics companies now have French subsidiaries. But in general, Japanese investment has slowed down in response to Japan's domestic problems, and this has been only partly compensated for by increased investment from Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. 'For a long time, we didn't give a clear message that we welcomed foreign investment,' says Mr Tordjman. 'But we do now - partly because we ourselves have become big investors abroad and we realise the importance of creating the right climate.' He ticks off the advantages of investing in France: efficient transport and telecommunications links; relatively cheap utilities; low inflation; relatively little pressure for wage increases (partly because of high unemployment) and a corporate tax rate which has come down from 50 to 33 per cent in the past five years. On the minus side, however, are the high payroll costs; employers have had to shoulder these in order to help finance the French welfare state which, in contrast to most of France's neighbours, gets little help from direct taxation. The Balladur government is trying to shift the burden of these payroll costs gradually on to the general state budget, but its room for manoeuvre is tightly constrained by the size of the budget deficit. France has made a special effort to attract headquarters companies to cities such as Paris. Mr Robert Tarika, head of Ernst and Young's tax and legal department in Paris, says that such headquarters 'are taxed on the basis of expenses incurred plus a reasonable rate of deemed income . . . which means that the tax amounts to less than 3 per cent of their total costs, compared to about 15 per cent in the past.' Mr Tordjman still complains that nearby rivals such as Belgium overdo the tax breaks for multinationals' headquarters, but claims that France has at least cut some of the red tape with which it used to entangle the new foreign investor. For example, the head of every foreign business in France  -like his domestic counterpart - must obtain a 'carte de commercant'. It used to take six months to get this out of the local administration. Now, Mr Tordjman claims, it takes three weeks.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The canny engineers of survival: A batch of good results in the engineering sector offers a ray of hope amid the gloom Good news is a rare and precious commodity for the bosses of UK engineering groups as they struggle to keep their companies at least one step ahead of the receiver. Sterling's difficulties and the threat of higher interest rates are adding to a sense of gloom caused by the longest and deepest recession many in the industry can remember. Last month's pessimistic forecast from the Confederation of British Industry highlighted the weakness of the economy. Meanwhile, there could be further bad news this month, traditionally the busiest for UK company results. But there has been a glimmer of hope in some recent figures from the engineering sector, and while they may not offer grounds for too much optimism, any good news from UK manufacturing is worth closer examination. The first to lighten the gloom was BBA, the component maker for the automotive, aviation and industrial markets. Early last month it announced first-half pre-tax profits up 26 per cent to Pounds 33m. Soon afterwards, GKN, the automotive components, engineering and industrial services group, surprised the City with a 37 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 65.1m. A week later, Birmingham-based Glynwed International, a producer of consumer and building products, plastics, and tubes and fittings, revealed a 48 per cent rise in half-year profits to Pounds 15.4m. Then, at the end of last month, Weir Group, one of the world's largest pump and valve makers, notched up a 23 per cent profit advance to Pounds 18.5m. The numbers are encouraging but should be viewed with some caution. The half-year statements of the engineering groups carry a clear message for other British manufacturers - cutting costs and raising productivity are essential to give any hope of raising profits in the current environment. Indeed, there is little to suggest any improvement in market conditions in the coming months. 'We do not expect the demand pattern we are currently experiencing in our principal markets to change materially in the next few months,' said Sir David Lees, GKN chairman. At Weir, chairman Lord Weir also stressed the importance of low-cost manufacturing and cash generation in generally hostile trading conditions. 'Although we are doing better, it is bloody difficult,' he said. Another important point is that, in an industry as diverse as engineering, there are always 'niche' opportunities for companies to make money even when general conditions are tough. The real question is whether a company has the ability to exploit them, as Weir has illustrated by taking advantage of buoyant conditions in the Asian power equipment market. This is a good example of an infrastructural sector which operates under a much longer-term business cycle than many other parts of engineering. There are also some special reasons for the rosy results. Glynwed, for example, cut group borrowings by about Pounds 12m in the first half of the year by selling three non-core businesses. Reduced interest charges thus contributed to the big rise in profits. Even so, it would be churlish to disparage profit figures which are a timely reminder to pessimists that the UK engineering sector is not about to disappear. The results are also a lesson to some smaller engineering companies which have been slow to take difficult decisions on cutting costs, says Mr Tim Bennett of the Birmingham-based stockbroking firm Albert E Sharp. After their experiences in the recession of 1980-81, the larger groups understood that they would need to move quickly to reduce production capacity in line with falling demand soon after the current recession began. GKN slashed its UK workforce from 64,800 to 40,600 between 1980 and 1982. While the cuts overall have been less severe in the current recession, none of the companies has shied away from cutting its workforce this time. The four companies' strong first-half performances, relative to the rest of UK manufacturing, bear witness to their improved management over the past decade. Nowhere is this better illustrated than at Weir, where management shortcomings brought the company to the brink of collapse in 1981. The company was forced into a drastic restructuring. High interest rates, the level of sterling and the weaknesses of domestic demand were contributing factors, but the main problem was weak management. Weir, says Mr Bennett, is 'probably the best example of an engineering success story. They've done it through good management of existing businesses and selective acquisitions.' Its low-cost manufacturing plant in Glasgow is competitive at current exchange rates, an important achievement, as its main competitors are German and Japanese. Meanwhile Weir has rejuvenated Hopkinsons, the UK's biggest producer of specialist valves and boiler fittings, which had been wracked by labour disputes before it was acquired in 1989. Such achievements are due partly to the tough-mindedness of executives such as Sir David at GKN, Mr Ron Garrick, the Weir chief executive, and Mr Gareth Davies, Glynwed's chairman, who have not shirked painful restructuring decisions. But the profit performances are due as much to a policy of internationalisation, intended to reduce dependence on a declining base of UK manufacturing customers. This is particularly apparent at the radically restructured GKN, where overall employment has plunged from 101,600 in 1980 to 31,400 last year. Sales in both years were almost identical at Pounds 1.92bn, but the overseas sales component, along with exports from the UK, jumped from 44 to 71 per cent. Even Glynwed, which still generates 70 per cent of its turnover in the UK, has had notable successes overseas, especially in its plastics business. There have been other big engineering groups to unveil favourable results recently. Last week, Senior Engineering Group announced an increase of almost 15 per cent in first-half profits to Pounds 10m. And T&amp;N, the motor components and engineering group, boosted pre-tax profits by 71 per cent to Pounds 34.7m owing to cost-cutting and successful investment in the US. A few more good results are likely over the coming weeks. Unfortunately, however, there is no evidence to suggest that the majority of big UK engineering companies could improve their results by emulating GKN, BBA, Weir and Glynwed. Most of them are already doing the right things - reducing costs, modernising their management and production techniques and seeking new opportunities overseas - but none of this can guarantee maintained profits, let alone increases, if conditions are depressed worldwide. The experience of the engineering sector has shown that UK manufacturers need to build their own bridges to profits. The sector will emerge weakened from the recession - whenever recovery occurs - but its standard-bearers will be those which can exploit every opportunity for growth in increasingly competitive world markets.</p>

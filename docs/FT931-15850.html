			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Danish visa scandal threatens to increase pressure on krone POLITICAL TENSIONS are growing in Denmark amid fears that prime minister Mr Poul Schluter's government might fall after the publication later this week of a report into a scandal involving visas for Tamil refugees. Currency analysts are worried that political uncertainty generated by the report could damage the Danish krone, one of the European exchange rate mechanism's weakest currencies. A judicial inquiry was set up to investigate an instruction by the minister of justice in 1987 to civil servants to delay issuing entry visas to relatives of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka who were already in the country. It is expected to release a 6,000-page report on Thursday. The opposition Social Democratic party, led by Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, is hoping it can exploit the report to bring down the minority Conservative-Liberal coalition government and return to office after 10 years in opposition. Concern about the Danish krone would follow last week's intense pressure for a devaluation of the French franc and punt in the ERM. Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at Warburg Securities, said: 'People are worried about the uncertainty that would be caused if Tamilgate led to the resignation of the government. This would make it difficult to hold the currency up.' He added that the prospect of political turmoil had already frightened people out of the Danish bond market. Developments are also being watched elsewhere in the European Community as Denmark took over the six-month EC presidency at the beginning of this month. Mr Schluter was not directly involved in the Tamil affair, but one of the questions which High Court judge Mogens Hornslett's report will seek to answer is whether the prime minister misinformed parliament when he reported on the affair in April, 1989, concluding his speech: 'Nothing has been swept under the carpet.' If Judge Hornslett's report contains explicit or implied criticism of Mr Schluter, he will come under strong pressure from the opposition to resign. Mr Schluter has repeatedly said he will call an election if the opposition tries to 'misuse' the report for political ends. Another possibility is that he would hand the baton to a party colleague, such as Mr Henning Dyremose, minister of finance, but there is doubt whether a majority in the parliament would tolerate a change in prime minister in this way. The attitude of the parties to the report may take some days to clarify. The Radical Liberal party, whose seven MPs hold the swing position in the eight-party, 179-member parliament, has said it will make its view known on January 17, after a joint meeting of the party's parliamentary members and the party's national executive committee. It is not clear whether the Radicals want a change of government. The party forms part of the parliamentary base for the present government. The affair began in 1987, when Mr Erik Ninn-Hansen, veteran Conservative party colleague of the prime minister, in his capacity as minister of justice, ordered civil servants to delay issuing entry visas to relatives of Tamil refugees who were already in Denmark. Mr Ninn-Hansen claimed he was within his rights to order 'reduced priority' for processing the visa applications. But the parliamentary ombudsman and other legal experts assert that the action was in breach of the law. New Irish leaders face trial by fire Page 2</p>

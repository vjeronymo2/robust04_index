			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Pledge given on cash for operations and waiting lists LABOUR yesterday allocated Pounds 582m of the extra Pounds 1bn it intends to spend over the next two years on the National Health Service, and gave an uncosted pledge to raise by 50 per cent the amounts earmarked for reducing waiting lists and cutting cancelled operations. It said it considered it prudent to leave a margin for 'contingency expenditure'. Yesterday's measures would be in addition to channelling Pounds 60m generated by ending tax relief on private health care into National Health cancer services. The largest single sum - Pounds 136m - will be spent on recruiting an additional 7,000 nurses. Another Pounds 35m would be used to help fund extra staff to reduce the pressure of work on junior doctors. A total of Pounds 100m would be spent on upgrading hospital buildings, Pounds 35m would go towards lifting standards of cleanliness and Pounds 50m would be used to kick-start more than 50 projects to provide accommodation for patients from mental health hospitals. Everybody over 40 would be entitled to free eye tests in an initiative for which Pounds 95m has been set aside. A further Pounds 50m would go to ensure that all intensive care beds could remain open at all times. A family doctor fund would provide Pounds 56m to improve the service provided by general practitioners; bids from GPs for funding innovative schemes would be invited. Labour would spend: Pounds 136m on 7,000 extra nurses Pounds 100m to upgrade hospital environment Pounds 95m for free eye tests for the over 40s Pounds 56m for the family doctor fund Pounds 50m for intensive care beds Pounds 50m for mental health hospital patients' accommodation Pounds 35m to improve hospital cleanliness Pounds 35m on extra junior doctors Pounds 25m on medical research centre equipment</p>

Speaking in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday,  Chernichenko said that "not crimes have been forgiven but  concrete people. Therefore the only goal of that amnesty was to  cross out the October tragedy and free their allies."    He believes that the decision on political amnesty has put  the country before the danger of new conflicts -- "They have  released into the streets of Moscow the people who are  professionals in staging coups. To hope that they will change  for the better would be as silly as to wait for a self-respected  wolf to become a vegetarian."    The euphoria of democrats over the adoption of the new  Constitution was premature. He said the saying "he cried at the  wedding but danced at the funeral" perfectly fits the deputies  who voted for the amnesty. Chernichenko explained the political  failure by the disintegration of democrats.    It took them several days to decide their position. They  voiced their assessment of the State Duma's resolution on  amnesty only on March 2 by saying that the amnesty was a well  thought-out political provocation, a frontal offensive against  democracy, the ultimate goal of which is to bring  revenge-seeking forces to power.</p>

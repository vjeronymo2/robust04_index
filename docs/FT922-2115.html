			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Three-union merger wins Nalgo backing THE CREATION of the biggest public-service union in Europe, with 1.4m members, became a virtual certainty yesterday when Nalgo leaders averted attempts to wreck a planned merger with two other unions. Delegates to Nalgo's annual conference defeated a series of motions aimed at ending or delaying the amalgamation with the Nupe public-service union and Cohse health union, planned to take effect from July next year. Nalgo's conference had been viewed by leaders of all three unions as the last and potentially most serious threat to 'final proposals' for amalgamation drawn up this year. Its backing, with the earlier support of the Nupe and Cohse conferences, means that the proposals will go to a ballot of members at the end of the year. It is highly unlikely that the unions' members would vote against the advice of their leaders. Unison, as the new organisation will be called, would be Britain's largest union, overtaking the 1.1m-strong TGWU general workers' grouping. The presence this week of Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, at the annual conference of the GMB general workers in Blackpool fuelled speculation that those two organisations would also merge. No formal talks are in progress, though, and an amalgamation would be some years off. At Nalgo's annual conference in Bournemouth, delegates voted overwhelmingly in favour of the final proposals after a series of heated debates lasting all day. Some opponents were angry that union subscriptions in the new union would be collected centrally. In Nalgo, collection is carried out by branches, which then pass some of the money on to headquarters. Other opponents are concerned about plans for affiliation to the Labour party. Nalgo is not affiliated, but in the new union all individual members would have a right to affiliate. Mr Ken Jones, chair of the retired members' group, speaking against the merger plans, said: 'The new union will be tarred with the one brush: affiliation to the Labour party.' Speaking for the merger, Mr Alan Jinkinson, Nalgo general secretary, said the only beneficiaries of a decision not to merge would be the government and employers. He said: 'We must not allow employers to drive a wedge between manual and white-collar workers. Nor can we allow a hostile government to benefit from wasteful multi-unionism.'</p>

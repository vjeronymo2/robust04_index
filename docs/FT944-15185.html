			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Cedel sets up on-line securities order system Cedel, the international clearing and settlement organisation, is to set up a subsidiary, called Liberty, to run an electronic on-line order routing service for European investors seeking access to the North American markets. Investors will be able to buy and sell securities on all the leading North American equities exchanges, as well as on the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The product, InterTrade Direct, is designed to be compatible with most broking work stations and internal systems. Liberty intends to extend the system to allow European investors access to Latin American and Pacific markets by the first quarter of 1995, and plans an extension allowing US investors similar access to European markets. Investors choosing the system will pay no fees, although broker-dealers who receive the orders will pay fees to the system. Those broker-dealers may then pass some of the costs on to investors in the form of commissions. Investors with access to screen-based information-providers can research prices of North American equities and electronically send buy and sell orders to US brokers.</p>

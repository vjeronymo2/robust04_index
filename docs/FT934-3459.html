			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Sanctions hit hard in Yugoslavia Yugoslavia yesterday told the United Nations that sanctions imposed 18 months ago had had a devastating effect on its economy, causing losses so far of more than Dollars 20bn, Reuter reports from New York. In a letter to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, it said the economy of the rump Yugoslavia had declined to 1960 levels. By the end of this year, per capita income would amount to between Dollars 200 and Dollars 250, with a further downward trend if the sanctions persisted in 1994, it said.</p>

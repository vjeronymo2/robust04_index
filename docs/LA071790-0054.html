			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COALITION WILL TRY STAR POWER ON NEA;  </P> <P> ARTS: ENTERTAINMENT ACTIVISTS PLAN A 'SWAT-TEAM' APPROACH TO INFLUENCE UPCOMING  LEGISLATION.  </P> <P> A show-business activist group has asked for six to 10 volunteers from among  the entertainment industry's biggest stars to form a "SWAT team" to drum up  support for the beleaguered National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> The proposal by the Creative Coalition, a New York-based activist organization  of motion picture, theater and music business celebrities, emerged Sunday  evening at a private meeting in Beverly Hills dominated by film industry  figures. The meeting was a standing room-only affair that drew more than 100  people to the auditorium of Creative Artists Agency.  </P> <P> Attending were producer Norman Lear, political pollster Pat Caddell,  choreographer Bella Lewitzky and a range of actors including Michael O'Keefe,  Jean Stapleton, Sarah Jessica Parker, Hal Linden, Justine Bateman, Robert  Downey Jr., and Lesley Ann Warren. The meeting was the final event in a weekend  campaign fund-raising trip by Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.) chairman of a House  NEA reauthorization subcommittee.  </P> <P> The meeting was organized by the People for the American Way organization,  which Lear founded 10 years ago.  </P> <P> The Creative Coalition proposal was disclosed by actor Stephen Collins, who  urged the Southern California show business community to avoid a mistake  Collins said it made in the 1950s when motion picture stars and executives  failed to act aggressively against the blacklisting movement.  </P> <P> Collins and other Creative Coalition officials conceded that the strategy has  something of a desperation flavor since floor votes are expected in the House  and Senate on key NEA legislation in the next three weeks. Final congressional  action on both NEA reauthorization and reappropriation are is not expected  until September or October.  </P> <P> "Hollywood did not do itself proud with the Hollywood 10," said Collins. He  drew parallels between the blacklisting of screenwriters, producers and  directors in the 1950s and the current NEA controversy, in which grants have  been cut off to controversial performance artists. Other artists have rejected  grants, including Lewitzky, who turned back $72,000 in NEA funding (she also  once refused to answer questions by the House Un-American Activities  Committee).  </P> <P> "They (the Hollywood Establishment) were very slow to get into (the political  threat posed by Sen. Joseph McCarthy)," Collins said. "We're in this same  situation now."  </P> <P> The SWAT-team strategy, Collins said, would rely on identification of as many  as 10 "huge celebrities with enormous middle-American appeal," who would  undergo crash briefings to make them aware of the minute details of the NEA  crisis. The superstars would then be sent to Washington and home state offices  of key politicians, and would conduct press interviews in support of renewing  the endowment without restrictions on the kinds of artworks it can support.  </P> <P> Collins said no mega-stars have been signed up for such a team, but he said the  Creative Coalition hopes that its members would be figures not normally  identified as political activists -- or at least not politically active within  a traditionally liberal context.  </P> <P> He said the Creative Coalition is determined to avoid a mistake common to  political campaigns that involve show business figures, only to discover that  the celebrities lack sufficient factual background in the cause with which they  are identified. "We tend to be passionate with the press," Collins said, "but  not well enough informed."  </P> <P> The extent of the challenge was illustrated indirectly by an exchange between  Williams and film and television ("Family Ties,") actress Bateman, who last  year performed in a Berkeley Repertory Theatre production of "Lulu." Bateman  said she was confused about how the NEA controversy had come to be so prominent  since she grew up in a social system in which her contemporaries believed such  issues as freedom of speech and abortion rights had been long ago resolved.  </P> <P> "I'm 24 years old," she told the veteran Montana congressman, "and it seems so  silly that we (even) have to talk about this."  </P> <P> Collins said the SWAT team strategy would be combined with a parallel tactical  move involving celebrities who were born or raised in 15 target states in which  congressmen and senators hold crucial undecided votes on pending endowment  reauthorization and appropriation bills.  </P> <P> The Creative Coalition said it already has nearly 300 actors and actresses who  have been identified for duty in which they would either agree to go to their  home states for a day, or spend a day doing telephone interviews with news  outlets in the key states -- including Missouri, Texas, Ohio, Michigan,  Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Illinois and Wisconsin.  </P> <P> Caddell told the group that the NEA situation has reached such a critical mass  that any Hollywood political response must necessarily be based on  sophisticated understanding of political factors involved. "There has to be a  political strategy," Caddell observed. "You can't let (Sen.) Jesse Helms  (R-N.C.) and these people take the issue to their (home) grounds (and seize  dominant positions in the debate). When you hurt them politically, all of this  will go away."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At 1530 on 23 June, all the people who had been  staying at the Chilean Consulate unconditionally left. Likewise,  53 of the people who stayed in the Belgian ambassador's  residence have returned to their homes after ending their  illegal and irresponsible action. Right now, the German Embassy  is still occupied by 21 people, and another 72 remain at the  Belgian Embassy.    All of them have this option: Abandon your irresponsible  plan  or condemn yourslves to remain for life under a roof which will  be a voluntary cell.    No one will attain, at any time, authorization to emigrate  through violence and violation of Cuban laws and international  legislation. Those citizens wishing to leave Cuba for diverse  reasons which range from family, personal, and economic matters,  to simple adventure, have been the object of a clumsy political  manipulation, which is condemned to complete failure like all  those contrived in over three decades of ravenous efforts  against the Cuban Revolution.    The Cuban authorities, as a goodwill gesture toward the  nations with which it maintains diplomatic and friendly  relations, have extended every recourse to the representatives  of the embassies involved to solve the conflict in which they  have found themselves entangled. Repeating: Only through work,  intelligence, serenity, and intransigence can incidents of this  nature be avoided and discouraged in the future.</p>

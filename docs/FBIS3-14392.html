			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ihsan Bakr: "Unconditional Return"] </F>   [Excerpts] In an unprecedented challenge to the feelings of  Arabs and Muslims, U.S. President Bill Clinton stood up to  declare that the United States regards Jerusalem as the unified  capital of the State of Israel. It appears that the United  States is not content with its full bias toward Israel and with  guaranteeing its military superiority over all the Arabs. Not  content with impeding -- for three weeks following the massacre  in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron -- a Security Council  resolution condemning the massacre and providing protection for  the Palestinian people, it wants to reward the killers by  declaring that Jerusalem is Israel's capital.    Such a grave declaration attributed to the U.S. President is  a precedent in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The official stance  of every U.S. Administration -- Republican or Democrat -- as  evidenced by documents has stipulated that the status of  Jerusalem and its future can be decided only within the  framework of negotiations between all the parties and as part of  the final, comprehensive, and just settlement in the Middle  East. This stance has been in force throughout recent years,  since the establishment of the State of Israel.    Now, with a frankness that can only be envied, the U.S.  President comes to declare his new stance that Jerusalem is the  unified capital of Israel. He then pledged to impede any  Security Council resolution condemning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre if it included or even hinted that Jerusalem is part of  the occupied Arab territories.    This U.S. stance was confirmed after Washington refused to  agree to a clause in the Security Council resolution issued the  day before yesterday pointing out that Jerusalem is an occupied  Palestinian territory.    It appears that President Clinton, whose popularity has  started to wane at a time when he is suffering from the  "Whitewater" scandal in which he and his wife are accused of  using their influence to profit and avoid paying taxes, wants to  win over the Jewish pressure groups in the United States. So he  has shown no regard for the feelings of Arabs and Muslims, not  to mention their legitimate rights. And why not? The Arabs  have been deprived of everything, even the ability to protest.  And why not, when the peace efforts are stalling and have  resulted in nothing more than retreats and concessions by the  Arabs to Israel in return for endless U.S. rewards to Israel  from the Arabs' pockets and at the Arabs' own expense? [passage  omitted]    This U.S. stance on Israel and the massacre that the whole  world condemned is not simply one of a complete defense of  Israel, but also one of pressure on the Palestinian leadership  to return to the Oslo Agreement and the negotiations and abandon  any popular demand to amend the Oslo Agreement or propose new  items on the agenda.    Warren Christopher told the Palestinian president quite  clearly: Return to the negotiations unconditionally. He wants  the Palestinians to surrender to Israel unconditionally.    It remains for us to say: Don't these changes in the U.S.  stance require a call for an emergency Arab summit at the Arab  League headquarters in Cairo to face a stance that not only  affects the Palestinians, but also the entire Arab nation? If  an Arab summit is not held now when the Arab-Israeli conflict is  entering a critical stage, then when can such a summit be held?  All the Arab regimes, not just the Palestinians, are  responsible for halting the slide in the Arab stance.</p>

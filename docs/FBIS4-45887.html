			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article entitled "You Can't Be a Shaman </F> Without a License" under the "Specialist's Commentary" rubric]    [Text] The law is simple and straightforward. As of January  1, 1994, medical establishments in Moscow can practice only if  they are licensed by the city. Medical offices, businesses, or  practitioners who choose to work without a license face serious  consequences, including penalities imposed by tax authorities.    V. I. Shastin, head of the licensing department for the Main  Medical Authority in Moscow, and Ye. V. Polivoda, a top official  in the same office, told this paper that the list of those who  have successfully applied for and obtained licenses numbers 795  offices, businesses, and private practitioners.    Although most of the nation's public health-care system is  in  the hands of licensed professionals, this cannot be said about  private medical practice. Only three individuals have been  officially authorized to practice medicine. They are Pastor  Chzhu Ok, an acupuncturist from the Republic of Korea, M. A.  Chkhikvadze, and D. M. Filler, all of whom are in private  practice. No more than 30 partnerships and cooperatives have  obtained licenses, although another 107 have applied for them.  There are nearly 2,000 medical establishments in private  practice.    Shamans, psychics, and folk healers must also obtain  licenses  that state the types of medical services they offer. None of the  practioners listed on the "hot line" have done so.    Incidentally, practioners of traditional or folk medicine  must undergo a different type of licensing and be regulated by a  special subcommission made up of those of their peers and  colleagues with a medical background. Any traditional or folk  healer wishing to treat people must have a medical diploma.    Today, inasmuch as the process of issuing licenses is being  bogged down by paperwork, the department responsible for  licensing is, in exceptional cases, issuing temporary  authorizations to practice medicine. Temporary licenses are good  for three months, whereas regular licenses are good for one year.    Anyone seeking medical help should be sure that the person  or  establishment they consult is properly licensed. This will help  to avoid problems.</p>

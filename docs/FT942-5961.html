			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Business failures lowest for 4 1/2 years The number of business failures last month dropped to the lowest level since December 1989, Andrew Jack writes. Corporate collapses in May totalled 157, down from 171 in April and 229 in May last year. In December 1989 there were 90 failures. Data on receiverships and administration orders is prepared by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, from figures in the official London and Edinburgh Gazettes. Until 1991 it covered only England and Wales. Mr Ralph Preece, partner in charge of Touche's corporate special services department, predicted that total failures for the year would be as low as 2,000 compared with 3,226 last year. The cumulative total for 1994 until May was 1,001. The largest fall in failures was in the south-east of England.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Inchcape invests Pounds 10m to expand Oman motor side INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, has expanded its motor import and distribution operations in the Middle East. It has bought a 49 per cent beneficial interest in Towell Auto Centre, which has exclusive import and distribution rights for Mazda in Oman, for OR5.6m (Pounds 9.6m). It is paying WJ Towell, TAC's owner, Pounds 8.4m cash on completion and the balance in equal chunks over three years. Inchcape will manage TAC, which has a 7 per cent share of the car market in Oman, selling 2,100 cars a year. In addition, TAC distributes Castrol lubricants, Lucas parts and Suzuki motorcycles in the Sultanate. Mr Derek Whittaker, a director, said: 'Inchcape has a long-standing relationship with Mazda. 'It is the exclusive importer and distributor of Mazda vehicles in France, Hong Kong and Finland, has a 40 per cent share of the Mazda UK import and distribution business and 50 per cent of the joint venture which markets Mazda vehicles in South China.' He added that Inchcape already had a number of joint ventures in Oman with WJ Towell, which will control the remaining 51 per cent of TAC. In March 1992, Inchcape bought TKM, funded by a Pounds 376m rights issue. It now sells more than 350,000 vehicles a year in 26 countries.</p>

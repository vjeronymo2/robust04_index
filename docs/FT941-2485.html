			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Share registrars angry at Bank plans for Crest The Bank of England has angered share registrars by proposing that the operator of the new Crest share settlement system be allowed to punish those who fail to meet standards. The Bank is overseeing the design of Crest, which is aimed at introducing paperless share trading and five-day rolling settlement by 1996. It wants to ensure that registrars, who keep records of share ownership, will be able to alter their records within two hours of having received instructions to do so. The Bank believes that unless registrars can act that quickly it will be impossible to effect five-day rolling settlement as planned. Britain's largest registrars say they can now - or will be able to by the time Crest becomes operational in 1996 - alter share registers within two hours. But many of the 150 or so smaller registrars may fail to meet that standard. The director of share registration at one leading bank said: 'The major ones have or will have the capacity by 1996. What we object to is the Bank of England singling out share registrars in the market place.' The Treasury proposed in a recent paper a rule aimed at meeting the registrars' objections. Under this proposal any Crest member who failed to fulfil obligations could be expelled from the Crest system. Moreover, the Treasury said that companies who kept the records of their shareholders themselves and acted as their own registrar would have to show that they had adequate technical capacity and record-keeping arrangements. The Bank of England is said to be particularly concerned about registrars because of their role in the failure of the Stock Exchange's Taurus system for paperless share settlements. Officials told it privately that constant changes to the Taurus design in order to meet the needs of small registrars became a crucial factor in the collapse of Taurus.</p>

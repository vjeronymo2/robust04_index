			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Overseas investors miss out on US rally EUROPEAN and Japanese investors have largely missed the latest leg of the rally in US bond markets - and with good reason. European investors shifted their attention to European bond markets in early 1992, as those economies slowed down, while Japanese institutions came under pressure to repatriate funds for investment in their domestic market. Yen-based funds which remained overweight in Treasuries this year have seen bond market gains wiped out by currency losses, following the rally in the yen. The worldwide bull market in bonds has outstripped expectations and economic fundamentals remain favourable. But most analysts still think that the rally has further to go in Europe than in the US, which was the first developed economy to emerge from recession. 'In textbook terms, 18 months ago was the right time to switch into European bonds,' said Mr Paul Abberley, head of fixed income at Lombard Odier, the Swiss-owned fund management group. 'Europeans haven't lost anything by making that move', as European markets have also rallied strongly. European institutions have, however, adopted an opportunistic approach to the US market. Mr Robert Gambi, international fixed interest and currency manager at AMP Asset Management in London, moved from an underweight to a neutral position in US Treasuries in July, and plans to shift back to an underweight position shortly. He believes the US bond rally will probably be over within the next three or four months. 'The US market obviously looks expensive, but any dip in the dollar has made the US market very attractive for European investors,' said Mr Michael Burke, a bond economist at Citibank in London. 'There doesn't seem to be anything working against a further rally' in the US market, said Mr Naoyasu Kawasawa, a fund manager at Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance, Japan's largest non-life insurance company. However, he added that he was reluctant to invest extra funds because of the foreign exchange risk. However, US Treasuries remain a core market for international bond funds. While the latest leg of the rally has been domestically driven, international investors may provide some support in any downturn, as they already perceive themselves to be neutral to underweight.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Eftov: "Inflation Based on False </F> Computations"]    [Text] According to the government, last year's  inflation reached 240 percent, although the statisticians assess  it at about 350 percent. What causes the disparity? Could an  erroneous computation by the Republic Statistical Institute make  the projections agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund  questionable? Why is it that the increased cost of petroleum has  not been included in the December inflation? As a result of this  "gaffe," wage increases will be lower than they should have  actually been.    We have learned that the government intends to demand  officially that the Republic Statistical Institute correct its  data on last year's price and inflation dynamics. On the eve of  the new year's meeting with journalists, Institute Director  Svetlana Antonovska, the Republic's leading statistician, made  the data public.    Therefore, Crvenkovski's Cabinet was among those  dissatisfied  with the work of the statisticians. Naturally, it separated the  government's dissatisfaction from the excessively gloomy  statistical depiction of the situation and the dissatisfaction  of the trade unions and the opposition, for instance, and the  excessive embellishment of our reality as depicted in official  statistical data.  <H5>  Questionable Timing </H5>   Essentially, what is the nature of the argument between the  government and the statisticians? At the news conference we  mentioned, director Antonovska said that last year retail prices  (therefore, inflation) rose 349.8 percent. Unlike the  statisticians, the calculations of the Ministry of Development  indicate that the annual inflation was somewhere in the vicinity  of 229.6 percent (the latest increase in petroleum products was  not included, the reasons for which will be explained later).  The gap between the inflation as computed by the ministry and  the assessments made at the beginning of 1993 (an inflation of  233 percent was anticipated) was minimal--1.2 percent.    The misunderstanding (let us avoid all sorts of stories and  speak of the real differences in the interpretation of the  facts, if possible!) lies in the timing in computing the  dynamics of retail prices. Namely, the statisticians computed  the dynamics of retail prices for the January-December 1993  period in terms of January-December 1992. It is thus that they  arrived at the figure of 349.8 percent increase. However, this  is only an average annual increase in retail prices (throughout  the world this is known as a deflator, which is subsequently  applied in determining the level of the public product, in  preparing the budget, and in computing the other macroeconomic  figures) which includes the inflation carried over from 1992.  Therefore, there can be no question whatsoever of an annual  inflation, for in this specific case the computations should  have covered the period through December 1993 in terms of  December 1992, which would amount to 229.6 percent (which was  the computation of the Ministry of Development).  <H5>  Wages Affected </H5>   However, this does not conclude the misunderstandings  between  the government and the Republic Statistical Institute. In  computing retail prices for December, the statisticians did not  take into consideration the latest increase in the price of  petroleum products. This is quite strange, for the increase took  place on the 13th of last month, while the inflation was  computed for the period between 21 November and 20 December.  Therefore, this did not include the direct impact of the price  increases of gasoline (let us not mention the indirect impact,  which will be included in computing the January and even the  February inflation, which would be normal); the statisticians  computed the December retail price increase at being 13.5  percent. Unlike them, in its computations, which include the  petroleum price increase, the Ministry of Development estimated  that December prices rose by some 18.7 percent. Therefore, the  computation of the pace of the annual inflation should be  amended. The annual inflation, according to the computations of  the Ministry of Development, should amount to about 244.7  percent.    The noncomputation of the increase in the prices of  petroleum  products in the December computation of the increase in retail  prices is of purely practical significance as well. On the one  hand, instead of raising the December wages, in terms of wages  in November, by about 20-21 percent (the actual increase in the  cost of living), according to the data of the Republic  Statistical Institute, wage increases should not exceed 15.7  percent. It is true that the December lag will be somewhat  compensated in determining the cost of living for January.  However, it must be borne in mind that the January wages are  subject to a different computation method compared to December.  To be more specific: wages will be increased at a lesser  percentage rate than actually required.    Naturally, the fact that increases in the price of petroleum  products were not included in the computations to determine the  December inflation will also question the government's  projection concerning the dynamics of inflation in 1994. At the  very beginning, one could project an increase in the planned  inflation from 70 to approximately 80 percent. This will annul  the heavy insistence of the government on ending the computation  of prices by 20 December so that as the start of the new year no  more drastic price increases will be expected. This will lower  the growth of inflation (a scenario used by all governments who  pledge to stabilize prices or launch an anti-inflation program).  In the final account, the question arises of observing the  limits agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund relative  to inflation dynamics.    All in all, this entire matter can be characterized as an  additional worsening of relations between the government and the  Republic Statistical Institute, relations which, in the past as  well, could not be considered satisfactory.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Letter: Customer protection Sir, The assertion by Mr Courtney (Letters, June 13) that water companies are unfairly derided is wholely false. Only the director-general of water services or, eventually, parliament can protect the customers; most certainly the managers of the monopolies have displayed no such concern. Furthermore, to pretend that the suppliers of water are running a business is clearly a nonsense since business is about risk, an element almost totally lacking within the water supply industry.

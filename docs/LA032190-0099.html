			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FALL FIGURES;  </P> <P> FASHION: LACROIX'S COLLECTION FEATURES WARM COLORS, UNITARDS AND LEGGINGS.  GIGLI OFFERS COCOON COATS, NARROW PANTS AND LONG JACKETS.  </P> <P> Christian Lacroix showed how to think '60s and dress '90s in one of the  strongest collections of this season. He presented it Sunday morning in his  couture salon that featured orange walls and shrimp-colored fashion runway.  </P> <P> Using warm shades of pink, violet, moss green and chestnut, with bits of  chartreuse thrown in, he built a collection around unitards and leggings;  short, trapeze-shape dresses and coats; fitted suits, and long, full evening  skirts.  </P> <P> Without question, the unitard is about to become as basic to a modern woman's  wardrobe as a slip used to be. Every top European designer now uses it as a  starting point for a wardrobe.  </P> <P> Lacroix's versions were in harlequin prints, shown with only a silk velvet hood  -- for women in perfect shape -- or, as a first layer followed by a suit or a  hooded duffel coat.  </P> <P> His daytime wardrobe relied on suits, some in Lurex-shot patchworks of plaids  and checks, some with floral-print velvet jackets and nubby wool checked  skirts. A new-looking pantsuit had a longer, fitted jacket and full trousers in  matching moss green plaid, spiced up with a metallic tapestry vest.  </P> <P> The best evening suits were cut close to the body with knee-baring skirts in  mahogany-colored silk brocade.  </P> <P> Lacroix added ponchos, velvet hobo hats decorated with small gold charms, and  knee-high, black suede boots appliqued in gold leather for day and night. He  used lots of thick, cable-stitched tights under boots for his favorite  trapeze-shaped dresses made of fluid woolen prints.  </P> <P> For informal formal wear he revived poor boy sweaters (heavily ribbed, with a  crew neck) shot with Lurex, to wear with enormous, iridescent taffeta evening  skirts. His two-layer dresses in gold lace and sheer silk had a dressier feel.  </P> <P> Romeo Gigli has reduced his philosophy about modern dressing to its basic  ingredients: cocoon coats, short and narrow pants, and redingotejackets.  </P> <P> His fall line is built around these unusual components, in uncommon fabrics --  especially iridescent silk, wool and suede, richly embroidered with Moroccan,  Middle European and Middle Eastern stitchery.  </P> <P> The focus of nearly every outfit was one of his extraordinary cocoon coats.  People consider them collector's items that ought to be hung on the wall, but  Gigli and his assistant toss them on over blue jeans.  </P> <P> This is the Italian-based designer's second season in Paris. (Gigli used to  show in Milan.) But his decorative, romantic, ultra-feminine approach to  fashion fits in well with the French.  </P> <P> Both Karl Lagerfeld and Gianfranco Ferre designed one collection under their  own names and another collection for a long-established French fashion house  (Lagerfeld for Chanel; Ferre for Dior).  </P> <P> Of course, the danger is that they will design old, venerable clothes for old,  venerable houses.  </P> <P> But both men seemed more comfortable than ever borrowing good ideas from their  signature line and adapting them to their new fall collections for the other  houses.  </P> <P> It worked out well.  </P> <P> For Chanel, Lagerfeld showed elongated jackets over very short pleated skirts,  a look he used often in his own line, shown earlier this week. Evening suits  that mixed sheer with solid black silk were part of both collections, too. All  his variations for Chanel were a little more structured and ladylike.  </P> <P> He used the gold chain links of Chanel handbags to trim little black suits with  cropped jackets and short narrow skirts. Red woolen suits were trimmed in  multiple rows of black and white rickrack, as were some new-looking, short,  narrow coats worn over skirts just an inch or two longer.  </P> <P> The bold houndstooth jackets he introduced several seasons ago were in strong  supply. This time they were shown in black and ivory, over short black skirts,  some narrow, some pleated.  </P> <P> One strong new look for evening was an off-the-shoulder tunic in bright yellow  satin with a slightly bell-shaped black satin skirt. High-heeled black satin  shoes with a strap across the instep added some sizzle.  </P> <P> Ferre's fall collection is his second for Dior. Unlike the first, this one  showed off more of his personal talents and tastes.  </P> <P> Ferre's skill with uncluttered sportswear in luxury fabrics translated to black  leather turtleneck tops tucked into narrow wool pants, camel colored leather  parkas with mink-trimmed hoods, and a number of straight-line narrow suits,  especially one in red with covered buttons down the back of the skirt. The  clothes were simple but not boring.  </P> <P> A long, narrow jacket with a high button closure was more Italian than French  (Dior probably would have put a curve at the waist), but Ferre is, after all,  based in Milan.  </P> <P> Ferre is not to be envied, having to work his own talents into the  long-established Dior look. And there were some misses, especially in the  evening wear that had too much or not enough going on. But this season Ferre  seemed more comfortable with integrating his personal style into the Dior  tradition.  </P> <P> Valentino could have ended his show just after it began, with the suits. They  looked energetic, modern and easy to wear, and they were the best part of his  collection.  </P> <P> He used a narrow-cut shirttail jacket in woodsy green tweed over a pleated,  checked skirt. He put a small-checked blouson jacket over a short, circle skirt  in rose tweed. Both options looked even newer, worn with over-the-knee-suede  boots. A day-into-evening-suit had a sequined, wool checked skirt with  sewn-down pleats, and a waist-length plaid jacket.  </P> <P> Some evening wear ideas worked much better than others. Knife-pleated skirts  worn with a pair of lace tops modeled after sweater sets had a sporty elegance.  But a group of black silk evening dresses sequined with images from ancient  Etruscan vases didn't work as well primarily because the clothes they decorated  fought for all the attention. This may not prove to be one of Valentino's most  important collections, but women who love his clothes will have more than  enough to choose from.  </P></p>

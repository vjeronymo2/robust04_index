			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Tobacco advertising ban upheld The Quebec Court of Appeal, in a test case, has upheld a federal government ban on tobacco advertising, ruling that it does not violate freedom of expression under the constitution, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. A lower court had found the ban unconstitutional and the federal government had appealed. The tobacco industry, which has complied with the federal ban since 1989, said it would almost certainly take the case to the Supreme Court of Canada. The three big tobacco producers seeking a final ruling on the ban are led by Imasco, the Canadian arm of BAT Industries.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> THIS YEAR'S POP FRESHMEN MIX AND MATCH TRADITIONS  </P> <P> Ice Cube is the first record artist to make a second appearance in Calendar's  annual salute to pop's 10 most promising new arrivals of the year.  </P> <P>  The controversial Los Angeles rapper was on last year's list as a member of  N.W.A, whose "Straight Outta Compton" album both ignited and defined the West  Coast gangsta-rap movement.  </P> <P>  Now on his own, Ice Cube, who contributed many of the key images and raps to  the "Compton" collection, delivered a solo album -- "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted"  -- that was even more ambitious and provocative, though nothing in it prompted  an FBI official to write a formal letter of protest, as an N.W.A song did.  </P> <P>  The following U.S. major-label debuts reflect the diversity of a pop scene  that is struggling to redefine itself during a period when rock's creativity  and impact are being challenged by rap and techno-pop. At least half of the 10  artists, significantly, are experimenting with the pop form by mixing hip-hop  or metal with traditional pop, rock or R&amp;B styles.  </P> <P>  In drafting the list, the emphasis was on artistic potential and vision, not  on sales. Mariah Carey, whose debut album has outsold all but one of the  artists cited here, may have a great voice and she may someday develop a strong  musical point of view. The same thing, however, was said about Whitney Houston  in 1985, and we're still waiting for a personal stamp to emerge.  </P> <P>  These 10 artists offered a glimmer of a pop vision in their 1990 debut works.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Bell Biv Devoe  </P> <P> Bell Biv Devoe's "Poison" (MCA) -- "Our music is mentally hip-hop, smoothed out  on the R&amp;B tip with a pop feel appeal to it," this talented New Edition  spinoff trio declares on its album cover, underscoring the growing willingness  of key artists to step beyond the artificial pop boundaries that have been  erected in recent years by conservative radio programmers. The encouraging  thing about Bell Biv Devoe isn't just that other musicians might be inspired by  their blend of traditional R&amp;B and contemporary hip-hop, but that record  companies -- noting the album's 2 million sales -- will begin encouraging  artists to become more innovative.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Black Crowes  </P> <P> The Black Crowes' "Shake Your Money Maker" (Def American) -- Chris Robinson,  the lead singer of this Georgia band, and Rich Robinson, his guitar-playing  brother, offer lively, accessible music that is a cross between the good-time,  R&amp;B-accented rock of the Faces and the rawer, Dixie-fried stylings of  Lynyrd Skynyrd -- a combination that may sound too dated to compete for our  attention in 1990. But the brothers, who also write the songs, swagger through  their engaging debut album with an authority that has made the Crowes one of  the quiet but welcome success stories of the year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Digital Underground  </P> <P> Digital Underground's "Sex Packets" (Tommy Boy) -- Ice Cube and Public Enemy  gave us the most compelling rap albums of the year, but the Underground  delivered the most entertaining. Another group that isn't shy about fusing and  rearranging traditional pop forms, thiscrew combine the freshness of De La Soul  with the comic persona of Tone Loc in such inviting novelties as "Humpty Dance"  and "Doowutchyalike." Just when you think the novelty of "Sex Packets" has worn  off, another playing makes you a fan all over again.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 808 State  </P> <P> 808 State's "90" (Tommy Boy) -- Part of Manchester's high-energy dance-rock  contingent, this techno-conscious outfit deals in such a streamlined version of  post-Kraftwerk synthesizer grooves that it can easily be mistaken for a  seamless, new-age band if the album is played too softly. But pump up the  volume in a club or on your own system and the music -- with clever world-beat  samples, frequent wit and silky allure -- becomes as stylish and engulfing as  the best of Soul II Soul, one of last year's freshman class members.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Gear Daddies  </P> <P> Gear Daddies' "Billy's Live Bait" (PolyGram) -- One tendency of ambitious and  talented young songwriters is to reach for big, central issues in hopes of  hitting on purposeful anthems. But writers -- from Dylan to Springsteen --  often tell us far more about the human condition by concentrating on life's  everyday moments. Thelonious Monster's Bob Forrest and the Replacements' Paul  Westerberg have been especially effective in recent years at relating on this  personal level. That's also the strength of Martin Zellar, whose  Minneapolis-area quartet combines the basic, bare-bones rock style of the  Replacements with a touch of the country color of the early BoDeans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> John Wesley Harding  </P> <P> John Wesley Harding's "Here Comes the Groom" (Sire/Reprise) -- Harding, a brash  former Cambridge student who throws words around with the dazzle and bite of  Elvis Costello, may be a true find or just this year's model. He has a great  sense of rock tradition, but isn't awed by it, frequently playing off classic  rock reference points in the songs. The question is whether he'll focus his  rich imagination and craft, or let his apparent obsession for racing on to new  ideas keep him from adequately polishing his work. If he finds the discipline,  he could be a major contender in the '90s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ice Cube  </P> <P> Ice Cube's "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted" (Priority) -- Ice Cube leads us here on a  rap tour of the projects that is so ugly and combative that the Village Voice  has now taken three cracks at trying to come to grips with it. Is it OK to use  offensive language to convey the degree of a brother's frustration and rage? If  we can draw a lesson from literature and film, the answer is clear: There is no  obligation to be polite or to have a moral attached. Beneath Ice Cube's rage,  there is the sense of an artist struggling to understand himself and his  community.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jesus Jones  </P> <P> Jesus Jones' "Liquidizer" (SBK) -- This snarling, sometimes cynical band from  England mixes a bit of the melodic, psychedelic currents of '60s rock with  post-punk guitar assault and sampled hip-hop rhythms -- it's only natural that  they cite influences as varied as the Byrds, Sonic Youth, Public Enemy and  Faith No More in the liner notes. Besides its cocky, kick-down-the-door  insistence, the band doesn't tell us much about its future direction in the  album, but there is enough commentary in the lyrics and tunefulness in the  melodies to suggest considerable talent and range.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mazzy Star  </P> <P> Mazzy Star's "She Hangs Brightly" (Rough Trade) -- Don't take the inevitable  Cowboy Junkies comparisons too seriously, because they undercut the originality  of this Los Angeles band and play into the hands of those who are writing off  the Junkies after a somewhat disappointing second album. Still, anyone who  appreciates the Junkies' quiet, soulful country and blues seasoning should find  much to admire in singer Hope Sandoval and guitarist David Roback's graceful,  bluesy blend of urban anxiety and country-accented innocence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Urban Dance Squad  </P> <P> Urban Dance Squad's "Mental Floss for the Globe" (Arista) -- Here's another  rock group, from Holland this time, interested in stretching pop boundaries.  The liner-note thank-yous give an indication of the various Caribbean and  hip-hop influences at work: Prince Buster Campbell and the Beatles to James  Brown and Public Enemy. But the racially integrated Dance Squad is equally  aggressive thematically, striking out at racism, stereotypes and apathy. The  direction isn't any more defined than that of Jesus Jones, but the band asserts  an independence and authority that bear monitoring.  </P></p>

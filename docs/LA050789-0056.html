			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SLOW-MOTION DEMOLITION';  </P> <P> RUSH TO BUILD DOOMS OLD HOLLYWOOD HOME  </P> <P> Although he often talked of moving from the two-story, turn-of-the-century  ranch house he has rented for six years, there was something about the place  that made Paul Gordon want to stay.  </P> <P> Once surrounded by citrus orchards that covered much of Hollywood, the house at  5552 Carlton Way, built by one of Hollywood's early developers, is a relic  encircled by apartment buildings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Forced to Leave  </P> <P> And even though the floors creak and the wind howls through the eaves, Gordon,  a writer, and his wife, Donna Williams, a sculptor, say they would gladly stay  if they weren't being forced to leave.  </P> <P> After watching their neighbors move out one at a time, when a developer began  buying up homes in order to demolish them and build apartment buildings, Gordon  and Williams got their eviction notice last October.  </P> <P> Since then, Gordon says the neighborhood has been "caught up in a kind of  slow-motion demolition" as transients have occupied vacant houses awaiting the  wrecking crew.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Couldn't Refuse'  </P> <P> "It was a shock, because the man who owned (our) house is a preservationist in  his own right," Gordon said. "He called to tell me the news one day, saying he  and his partner had simply been offered a price they couldn't refuse."  </P> <P> The seller, landscape architect Ed Hunt, said the decision to sell the house  was made by his partner "as part of an understanding we had that, if either of  us wanted to sell, the other would go along."  </P> <P> The new owner, Diversified Income Properties Inc. of Century City, went to  court to have Gordon and Williams evicted, and last week they agreed to vacate  the house in July. The company also bought the house next door and two others  behind it that face another street.  </P> <P> Later this month, the city's Cultural Heritage Commission is to decide whether  to designate Gordon's house as an historic landmark. Such a designation would  serve only to protect the property from demolition for up to six months,  officials say.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a nonprofit corporation headed by preservationist William Delvac has  entered into talks with the development company in an effort to buy the house  and save it.  </P> <P> "We're keeping our fingers crossed that something can be worked out. We feel  like we've done all we can do," Gordon said.  </P> <P> Although eager to see the house saved from demolition, he and his wife say it  is too late to remedy much of the damage the neighborhood has suffered.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Under Siege'  </P> <P> "We feel like we've been under siege here," he said. "Most of our little  neighborhood has disappeared before our eyes."  </P> <P> Last year, a block-long row of single-family homes on Carlton Way was bulldozed  to expand Grant Elementary School.  </P> <P> In the last several months, he and others say that four homes purchased by the  development company have been torn down. The Department of Building and Safety  halted demolition of four others, after preservationists complained that the  demolition permits were not in order. Several calls to Diversified Income  Properties officials were not returned.  </P> <P> As families have been uprooted, the pattern of life in Gordon's block has  changed dramatically, he said.  </P> <P> He and his wife recall when children sneaked up their driveway at night to  stare wide-eyed at the old rancho in the belief that it was haunted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Neighborhood Gone'  </P> <P> "Now," Gordon said, "those children are gone. Just look around, a lot of the  neighborhood is gone.  </P> <P> "Even in a community such as Hollywood, where people are accustomed to change,  it got to be a bit much."  </P> <P> Although there are fences around the abandoned houses, transients cut through  them in short order.  </P> <P> Doors and windows have been torn off. Walls and cabinets are punched full of  holes, and what were once well-kempt yards are dotted with piles of trash and  debris.  </P> <P> Broken liquor bottles, excrement and clumps of discarded clothing fill the  parlor of the bungalow next door to Gordon, where just a few months ago a  friend, who is a part-time actor, lived with his family.  </P> <P> The house and two others behind it on St. Andrews Place were "invaded" almost  immediately, Williams said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drug Abusers  </P> <P> "We've witnessed up to 22 people at a time using the house," she said. "They're  mostly drug and alcohol abusers, gang types, violent people. There's a constant  turnover. . . . "  </P> <P> For awhile, Gordon said, "there was a Spanish-speaking family living there. And  although we're talking about a place with no water or electricity, I think they  appreciated having it. They even did little things to keep up the front yard."  </P> <P> "Then one day, like a lot of other people in this neighborhood, they just up  and left, disappeared."  </P></p>

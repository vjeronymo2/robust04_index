			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vyacheslav Nefedov, director of the </F> All-Russia Consumer Market and Marketing Research Institute, by  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent Lyubov Volkova; place and date  not given: "The More Money, the Lower the Standard of Living?  Price Forecast for 1994"]    [Text] We are still inclined to visualize prices as  something akin to vicious watchdogs, who suddenly lunge from  around the corner and bite the passerby overcome with fear. And  in fact this is the way it is. But actually, there should be  nothing sudden in this. We have a right to know what to expect,  what to be prepared for, in order to protect ourselves, our  families, our business.    What sort of prices should the Russians expect in the  coming year? Our correspondent posed this question to Vyacheslav  Nefedov, director of the All-Russia Consumer Market and  Marketing Research Institute.    [Volkova] Vyacheslav Konstantinovich, in January 1993 you  warned that by the end of the year prices would rise on average  10-fold. While politicians and economists close to the ruling  circles maintained that prices would rise no more than three- to  fivefold. Their forecast had proved wrong as early as in the  summer. To what extent has the forecast of your institute's  specialists turned correct?    [Nefedov] Our forecast had been right on the dot. Prices for  foodstuffs and nonfood consumer items rose over the year on  average by a factor of 9.7-10.5. Rye bread now costs 9.2 times  more than a year ago; wheat bread--9.8 times more; beef--10.1  times, and poultry--10.4 times more. There are also some  products whose prices have shot outside the forecast range.  Bologna prices rose almost 12-fold, milk--12.5-fold, and  cabbage--15.6-fold. Onion prices increased more than 18-fold.    Not all food prices rose at this rate. Prices for rice rose  only 3.5-fold, sugar--?.4-fold [copy unreadable], and domestic  tea--?.?-fold [copy unreadable].    [Volkova] We are being told that lately inflation amounted  to  ?-? [copy unreadable] percent a week. Is this true?    [Nefedov] No. According to our data, prices for consumer  goods rose in November by 23 percent, and in December, according  to preliminary estimates--by 25 percent. The average price level  was held down, however, by the seasonal factor; that is, prices  for potatoes and some vegetables so far have remained level, as  well as those for sugar, since its processing is still  continuing. Prices for seasonal products will begin to rise,  however, any time now.    [Volkova] What is your forecast for the year?    [Nefedov] We are still continuously threatened, first, by  hyperinflation, and second, by a budget deficit. The mechanism  that stimulates expansion of production still has not kicked in.  The operational principle is: Raise prices and you may survive.  Production of daily necessities continues to fall--by 10 percent  in 1993. All in all, over the past two years production declined  by 25 percent. And the decline is the same in the production of  both foodstuffs and nonfood consumer goods. Only alcohol  production remains high.    Overall, our forecast for 1994 is this: prices for consumer  goods will continue to rise. By how much? It is very difficult  to come up with specific figures, since we do not know what the  government's fiscal and monetary policy will be. To be on the  safe side, we offer two forecast scenarios.    First scenario. If a tough monetary policy is implemented  (that is, the growth of the population's monetary income is  restrained by imposing restrictions on enterprises in all  economic sectors), prices will rise over the year fivefold on  average.    Second scenario. We call it moderate. According to this  scenario, prices will rise by a factor of 7.5-8.    [Volkova] This is considered moderate--like we had in 1993?    [Nefedov] No, 1993 went beyond moderate. By moderate we mean  that some slack will be permitted with respect to unprofitable  enterprises or even entire sectors under various pretexts.    In our opinion, as the year begins, the difference in the  rate of price increases for foodstuffs and nonfood consumer  goods will begin to increase. Prices for foodstuffs will be  rising faster. Under the so-called moderate scenario, the  population's standard of living declines faster. It is a  paradox: people are paid more, but the standard of living falls.  The gap between income and prices continues to grow. The demand  for foodstuffs will rise, since many people will have to give up  purchases of nonfood items. Bread prices will continue to rise,  since for many it will became the main nutrition staple. The  low-income group of the population already spends up to 80  percent of its income on food; the medium-income--50-60 percent,  and high-income group--25-30 percent. Stratification will become  even more noticeable.    [Volkova] Well, this is unquestionably not a reassuring  forecast. Why are you so certain that you are right?    [Nefedov] There are many amateurs now in the sphere of price  forecasting. We are professionals. We have more than 30 years of  experience in studying the domestic market. Our institute is  engaged in consumer market research; we study how it forms and  functions. In the past we were the head institute, with branches  in all Union republics. Now instead of branches we have retained  trade agents from among former branch associates, and currently  receive and process information from Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine,  and so on. One has to know what is happening around Russia  before attempting to forecast the situation here.    [Volkova] Where does your information go?    [Nefedov] We are under the Russian Federation Trade  Committee  and send all our reports there.    [Volkova] Does your information reach the politicians?    [Nefedov] It does not look that way.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: NUDITY REQUIRED  </P> <P> Producer Howard Rosenman, in the early stages of casting his Josephine Baker  biopic, tells us that Whitney Houston is among those who have discussed playing  the role of the legendary black American singer, whose bump-and-grind  toplessness made her a sensation in Paris of the '20s and '30s. "Whitney was a  little concerned about the nudity involved, but she realizes its absolute  necessity," Rosenman told us.  </P> <P> Rosenman, along with Alain Sarde and Michael Braun, hope to shoot the Orion  film in early 1990. Playwright George Wolfe ("The Colored Museum") is  completing the screenplay; Hugh Hudson ("Chariots of Fire") will direct.  </P> <P> Baker's story has had several false starts with other producers. A rival  production, "Josephine and Me," is currently being developed by French  producers.  </P> <P> "We think our slant is unique," said Rosenman. "It's the story of an expatriate  who was never recognized at home because of prejudices. After her success in  Europe, she returned to the U.S. in 1936 and was treated like a curiosity. It  was the heartbreak of her life." Leonard Klady  </P></p>

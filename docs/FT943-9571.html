			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: BHF reports unchanged profits at half-year stage Strong growth in commission and interest income compensated for a slump in own-account earnings and helped Germany's BHF bank group maintain first-half operating profits unchanged at DM148m (Dollars 94.2m), according to yesterday's interim report. Excluding the drop to DM9m from DM53m in income from its own financial transactions, partial operating profits rose 37 per cent to DM229m. Provided partial earnings continued to develop at this rate, BHF expected to report a satisfactory overall result at the end of the year, it added. The bank said prospects would depend largely on developments in capital markets, and it saw no reason to change its cautious assessment of its credit business. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts in the period were DM91m, up 36.5 per cent on a year earlier. On the basis of comparing six-month figures with 50 per cent of the previous year's full result, full operating earnings were down almost 9 per cent, although partial profits were 24 per cent higher. On this basis, risk provisions were up 8.8 per cent.</p>

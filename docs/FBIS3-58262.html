I never met with DIA  [Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate] Director Gianni De  Gennaro. I know that he passed through the Palazzo Chigi  [government seat] last Friday [7 January], but certainly not to  meet with me or for a security summit." Prime Minister Carlo  Azeglio Ciampi, flying from Rome to Brussels, denied the report  in the Naples daily newspaper IL MATTINO that a top secret  meeting had taken place two days ago between the head of  government and the anti-Mafia leader with the aim of discussing  the mysterious threats against President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.  Moreover, these threats were supposed to have come from  opponents in possession of no less than "an arsenal of infrared  missiles capable of penetrating the dark of night and striking  any target with great precision." However, this was not the  only denial to be heard during the prime minister's flight.  Sitting beside Ciampi, his military adviser, General  Giannattasio, reread the IL MATTINO article and explained:  "Weapons like these only exist in films. Perhaps not even in  films."    Giannattasio was quite clear that this is pure fantasy. A  little earlier in Rome, Police Chief Vincenzo Parisi made his  position clear: "These are exaggerations that are completely  unfounded but which could lead us to ridicule dangers and alarms  that are serious." On the flight to the NATO summit in  Brussels, the impression was that the head of government felt  himself to be stronger than the venom and conspiracies, and that  perhaps he hardly believes them at all. He confided in his men  that he believed the alarm spreading through the country to be  "perhaps a little exaggerated." In his blue cardigan and  glasses the prime minister chatted at length with [Foreign  Minister Beniamino] Andreatta, then started to work on his  folders at his table, just as if he were in his office and  despite the strong turbulence that accompanied the two-hour  flight.

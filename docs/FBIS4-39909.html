			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 11 TASS -- The speakers of the Russian  Parliament upper chamber and the Armenian Parliament specified  some items for their cooperation at their meeting at the upper  chamber on Saturday.    Telling this to journalists, Russian Speaker Vladimir  Shumeyko noted that a cooperation agreement between the two  chambers of the Russian Parliament and the Armenian Parliament  was signed on Friday.    The two speakers agreed that it is necessary to establish  inter- committee parliamentary relations and develop their  contacts while drafting legislative acts in order to boost ties.    Armenian Speaker Babken Ararktsyan stressed: "We highly  assess relations in the framework of the inter-parliamentary  assembly and claim at the same time that bilateral parliamentary  contacts should be also developed".    The sides discussed problems connected with Nagorno-Karabakh  at the meeting. Noting that the Bishkek protocol is still in  force, Shumeyko stressed that the meetings of parliament  speakers in St. Petersburg and Moscow "plotted a good road for  the negotiating process to settle the Armenian-Azeri conflict  with the participation of the third party -- the  Nagorno-Karabakh parliament".    The Armenian speaker invited Shumeyko to visit his country.</p>

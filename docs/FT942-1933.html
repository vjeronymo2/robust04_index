			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Henderson to appear at Scott inquiry Mr Paul Henderson, the former Matrix Churchill managing director, is to give oral evidence to the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry, it was announced yesterday. Mr Henderson, one of three Matrix Churchill directors cleared of the illegal export of machine tools to Iraq, had asked to give oral evidence after statements made to the inquiry by Lord Trefgarne, one of three middle-ranking ministers involved in the alleged relaxation of guidelines for such exports. He will give evidence on the points raised by the former minister. Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, the secretary to the inquiry, said Lord Justice Scott had also obtained evidence of Mr Henderson's contacts with the intelligence services. Mr Henderson would be questioned on some aspects of these contacts, he said. This part of his evidence would be heard in private at Mr Henderson's request, he said. Mr Muttukumaru said Mr Henderson had helped the inquiry from a very early stage, answering questions and providing written evidence. Mr Henderson is expected to give his evidence on July 7.</p>

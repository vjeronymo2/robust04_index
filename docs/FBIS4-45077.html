			<p>CSO     [Text] At a meeting in Mukalla two days ago with Lakhdar  Ibrahimi, a UN factfinding envoy to Yemen, Southern commanders  submitted a complete ceasefire plan to implement UN Security  Council Resolution 924. Ibrahimi has delivered the text of the  plan, a copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has acquired, to the  Yemeni leadership in Sanaa.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has also learned that the plan has been  distributed to the ambassadors of the permanent Security Council  members, along with an attached message, so they can discuss it  with their governments.    Following is the full text of the three items:  <H5>  One, text of the memorandum conveyed by Ibrahimi to the UN </H5> secretary general:    The Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]    The Premiership    Verbal Memorandum:    The DRY sends its warmest greetings to his excellency the UN  secretary general and expresses to him its extreme happiness  with the arrival of Lakhdar Ibrahimi as his envoy to the two  parts of Yemen.    The DRY wishes to point out that the serious crisis the  country has been experiencing is a result of the war that has  been going on since 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih declared it in a public  address he delivered at al-Sab'in Square in Sanaa on 27 April  1994.    In this regard, we are eager to point out the following  facts  to open the way for a correct understanding of the causes that  have necessarily led to the total collapse we are experiencing:    1. When Yemen's unity was proclaimed on 22 May 1990, our  Yemeni people looked forward to creating a modern Yemeni  state--a state of law and order in which all citizens have equal  rights and duties and which sees to the country's development,  progress, and prosperity.    2. At the time, leadership of the southern part of Yemen  proceeded toward unity with our brothers in the northern part of  the country confidently and responsibly in order to accomplish  the great objective of establishing a united state on the basis  of the unity accords signed by leaders of the two Yemeni states.    3. [As soon as] the Gulf crisis erupted, leadership of the  former Yemen Arab Republic disavowed all the unity accords and  worked with all means to impose its regime on the new state,  thus reflecting negatively on the life of our people in the  North and the South.    4. The national development and political, economic,  administrative, and fiscal reform program that was passed by the  House of Representatives on 15 December 1991 was an endeavor to  deal with the problems that had emanated from the position of  the leadership of the former northern part and to introduce  political, economic, administrative, and fiscal reforms in order  to create a modern state.    5. As soon as the government launched its effort, the minds  that controlled the leadership of the former northern part and  that opposed unity, development, and modernization launched an  undeclared war against YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] leaders.  This war has been embodied in political assassinations and in  all kinds of terrorist acts that have touched even foreigners in  Yemen. Fundamentalist Islamic forces have been used in terrorist  acts. Despite all the endeavors to end this criminal series, the  leadership of the former northern part refused to adopt any  legal steps against suspects and those who support them.    6. The crisis peaked at the end of 1992, i.e., when  parliamentary elections were scheduled to be held in November  1992, in order to obstruct the elections or to hold them under  unstable security conditions.    7. The situation was pacified so as to hold the  parliamentary  elections, which took place on 27 April 1993. Everybody aspired  to seeing the country make strides on the path of reinforcing  democratic action, of creating a united state, and of  introducing economic reforms.    8. The leadership of the former northern part continued to  cling to its position, and the chain of political assassinations  and terrorist acts continued on the eve of the elections, thus  convincing broad political forces in the Yemeni society that  conditions were going to remain unchanged, and even become more  complex, unless the influential forces abandoned their  practices, put an end to terrorist acts, and ensured security  and stability.    9. Political and security conditions became more complex,  thus impeding political and economic life. But efforts to seek  means and ways to overcome the crisis continued, and it was  agreed to hold expanded political dialogue among the influential  political forces in the Yemeni arena; two principles were agreed  upon: (1) peaceful dialogue to develop cures; (2) renunciation  of the use of weapons to impose solutions.    10. The Pledge and Accord Document was developed after  serious and responsible dialogue, and it was signed in Jordan on  20 February 1994.    11. Because of masked opposition, the influential forces  refused to draft a program to normalize conditions and to  implement the Document. So, political and economic conditions  became tense and there were allusions made to the use of force.    12. After further dialogue, it was agreed to hold Cabinet  meetings to begin implementing the Pledge and Accord Document in  Aden, Ta'izz, and Sanaa.    13. The Cabinet held its first session from 23-27 March 1991  [year as published] and a number of resolutions were adopted to  implement the Document, despite the attempt to foil the Cabinet  work. Military conditions were touched off in Shabwah on the eve  of the Cabinet session. Seven people were killed, and a number  of others were wounded.    14. The Cabinet held its second session from 6-7 April 1994.  At this meeting, GPC [General People's Congress] and YRG [Yemeni  Reform Grouping] representatives backed away from a number of  resolutions to which it had agreed in Aden. On the eve of the  Cabinet session, an attempt was made to strike the Southern  Basuhayb Brigade in Dhamar, which is within the northern  governorates.    15. The Cabinet convened in Sanaa from 20-21 April 1994 but  did not emerge with any resolutions. Its session coincided with  the following:    A. The Southern 3d Brigade, stationed in 'Umran, which is  within the northern governorates, was hit on 27, 28, 29 April  1994.    B. An attempt was made on the life of Dr. Hasan Makki, the  first deputy prime minister, on 28 April 1994.    C. Previously, the Southern Fifth Brigade, stationed in Hurf  Sufyan, which is within the northern governorates, was hit on  26, 27 February 1994.    16. Military acts were staged against the Southern Basuhayb  Brigade, stationed in Dhamar, at the beginning of May 1994. They  were followed by military acts against the Southern 1st Brigade,  stationed in Yarim. The brother prime minister contacted the  brother Presidential Council chairman in the United States,  where he is being treated, appealing to him to put an end to  these military operations against the Basuhayb Brigade and the  1st Brigade. A number of Yemeni figures did the same thing.    17. The strikes against these two brigades, in the wake of  the liquidation of the 3d Brigade and of the president's address  on 27 April 1994, were tantamount to a declaration of war.  Consequently, military operations spread to numerous parts of  the country.    18. Since 27 April, Yemen has been witnessing a dangerous  war  between forces of the two former states, which have not been  merged since the country's unification. Moreover, numerous other  institutions have not been unified due to the aforementioned  reasons.    In accordance with the above, we would like to register our  profound thanks to the esteemed Security Council and to his  excellency the secretary general for their interest in the  conditions in Yemen and for the issuance of Resolution 924. We  reiterate our adherence to all the provisions of this resolution  as of 1 June [1994].    In light of our talks with His Excellency Envoy Lakhdar  Ibrahimi, we summarize our viewpoint in the following:    A. Ceasefire Observation Mechanism:    Reaffirmation of Aden's and Sanaa's actual observation of  the  ceasefire, whose repeated violation by the al-Ahmar clan  government in Sanaa has been confirmed, should take top priority  in order to stem further deterioration of the conditions.    In this regard, the DRY Government reaffirms that it  welcomes  Sanaa's declaration and announces its proposal, which it has  conveyed to the Security Council through UN Envoy Lakhdar  Ibrahimi, that a military observation team supervise the  ceasefire. Because the previous military committee was formed  prior to the outbreak of the all-out war and because the U.S.  military attache, the Russian military attache, and the French  military attache, as the EC representative, plus brothers from  the Sultanate of Oman and Jordan, participated in that  committee, in addition to Northern and Southern military  elements, then urgent steps must be taken accordingly to  organize the ceasefire observation mission through a full team  that is capable of managing and performing the mission in the  best manner possible.    In view of the serious current situation and to establish  peace in northern and southern Yemen, it is logical and  appropriate that the observation team should include African,  Asian, and Arab League representatives so we can ensure a  complete and prompt implementation of Resolution 924. Afterward,  consultations can be held on the steps necessary to launch a  dialogue between the parties concerned without prior conditions  or reservations.    B. Aid:    The DRY Government also reaffirms the importance of  addressing urgent attention to the humanitarian side,  considering that environmental conditions in the governorates of  Lahij, Abyan, and Aden have worsened. Ships and planes belonging  to the International Red Cross, the Islamic Red Crescent, and  Doctors Without Borders loaded with medicines and foodstuffs, as  well as rescue teams, stand idle while waiting for their  shipments to be unloaded at the Aden Port and Airport--which  were still being subjected to concerted air raids and missile  and field artillery shelling by hostile Northern forces while  this statement was being written. This impedes the delivery of  humanitarian aid to deserving Yemeni citizens in the southern  governorates.    C. Arrangements for consultations with the secretary general  to hold an emergency Security Council session:    While expressing its denunciation and its extreme resentment  of the method employed by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who has rebelled  against constitutional legitimacy, who has been hostile to peace  initiatives, and who has rebelled against the international  community's will, which is embodied in Security Council  Resolution 924, the DRY Government finds itself required, by  virtue of its responsibilities, to seek the convocation of an  emergency Security Council session to adopt a deterrent measure  against the Sanaa regime.    The DRY Government takes this opportunity to express its  high  appreciation for His Excellency Lakhdar Ibrahimi and to register  its extreme respect for his excellence the secretary general.  al-Mukalla, 12 June 1994.  <H5>  Two, text of the UN observers team plan: </H5>   The UN team to observe the ceasefire between the two parts  of  Yemen in implementation of Security Council Resolution No. 924,  issued on 1 June 1994:    First, the team shall consist of:    A. Supervision committee: It shall consist of 11 capable  military men as follows:    1. Two Arab League representatives, one as original member  and the other as alternate member.    2. Two representatives of the southern part, one original  and  one alternate.    3. Two representatives of the northern part, one original  and  one alternate.    4. Two representatives of the Sultanate of Oman, one  original  and one alternate.    5. Two representatives of Jordan, one original and one  alternate.    6. The U.S. military attache or whoever represents him.    7. The Russian military attache or whoever represents him.    8. The French military attache or whoever represents him.    9. The PRC military attache or whoever represents him.    10. The British military attache or whoever represents him.    11. A UN military representative and an alternate member to  represent him.    B. Observers team: It shall consist of 100-150 officers. The  number may be doubled if the need arises. This team shall be  selected from the following countries:    1. The countries represented in the supervision committee.    2. Egypt, Syria, Morocco, and Algeria--Arab bloc.    3. Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and India--Asian bloc.    4. Senegal, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Kenya--African bloc.    Second, the team shall operate under the UN banner and  within  the framework of Resolution No. 924.    Third, tasks of the ceasefire observers shall be defined in:    1. Strengthening the ceasefire and determining the source of  its violation.    2. Supervising separation of the [warring] forces and  ensuring their withdrawal.    Fourth, arrangement for safe aid operations: All facilities  shall be secured for UN, International Red Cross, and Red  Crescent aid operations and operations of all organizations  involved in humanitarian activities.    Fifth, the UN secretary general shall take all the measures  necessary to ensure success of the ceasefire observation team's  mission.  <H5>  Three, text of the DRY Foreign Ministry message to the </H5> permanent Security Council members:    The Democratic Republic of Yemen;    The deputy prime minister and foreign minister:    The DRY Foreign Ministry conveys its warmest greetings to  the  foreign ministry of the friendly.... [sentence as published] And  the foreign ministry wishes to point out continuation of the war  declared by a backward tribal military band in Sanaa. This band  is spreading terror among Yemeni citizens in the southern  governorates, and it no longer possesses any constitutional  legitimacy.    Populated cities in the governorates of Lahij, Aden,  Shabwah,  Abyan, and Hadhramawt have been subjected to indiscriminate  shelling with missiles and cluster bombs and to repeated air  raids against civilian targets.    You are aware that the DRY Government has made sincere  efforts to reach arrangements for a ceasefire in accordance with  Security Council Resolution No. 924. But the tribal military  gang in Sanaa has persisted in its indiscriminate and concerted  attacks, thus disregarding the resolution.    Mr. Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the UN secretary general's envoy, has  visited northern and southern Yemen and has talked to the  parties concerned in an attempt to consolidate the ceasefire  stipulated by the resolution and to make arrangements for  peaceful negotiations between the parties concerned under UN  auspices, either in New York or Geneva or in Cairo, the Arab  League headquarters.    Because the ceasefire arrangements have collapsed repeatedly  as a result of Sanaa's failure to adhere to the ceasefire--a  failure confirmed by neutral figures and organizations (AFP,  Doctors Without Borders)--the DRY Government, while thanking  your esteemed government for your interest in establishing peace  between North and South Yemen so the two sides can devote their  efforts to reconstruction and development, urges your friendly  government to cooperate in approving the delegation of a  UN-supervised ceasefire team selected from Arab, African, and  Asian countries, including Algeria, Mali, Senegal, Malaysia,  Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Egypt, and Syria. Through  regional cooperation, the financial aspect concerning the  observation team will be secured without saddling the United  Nations with its burdens.    Establishing peace in Yemen will rely on your good  understanding of dimensions of the problem of continued war in  Yemen and of the ordeals and tragedies it will bring the Yemeni  people in the North and the South.    The UN charter guarantees peoples of the world their right  to  self- determination. We were, as you are aware, an independent  and sovereign state that was tied to your country by firm  friendly relations.    The DRY Foreign Ministry takes this opportunity to express  to  your esteemed ministry its thanks, appreciation, and best wishes.  'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Majid al-Asnaj  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister  Aden, 14 June 1994.</p>

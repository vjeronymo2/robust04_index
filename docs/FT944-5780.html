			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (16): Taking a pragmatic approach - Production information systems / A comprehensive network back-up system means that Philips Components' factory can work round the clock without constant technical support It takes a leisurely two hours or more for a television screen to progress from a dollop of molten glass through several cooling and cleaning processes to the finished product at Philips Components. The company's factory on the edge of Burnley, Lancashire, has therefore taken a pragmatic view about the frequency of updates and levels of back-up it needs in its on-line production information system. The system, developed last year as part of a multi-million pound refit of the entire plant, provides information which is six minutes old. The information network depends largely on a single central computer with various levels of fall-back without expensive duplication of equipment. The 350 staff keep the highly automated factory working round the clock, producing 2.5m screens a year. Until the refit and the new system, information was gathered on old Apple and BBC PCs. Reports were printed once a day and photocopied for distribution in time for the following day's production meeting. Information was therefore up to 24 hours old, so by the time problems were analysed from the printed reports it could be 30 hours after the initial incident before things were put right. The importance of these adjustments is reflected in the fact that the dollops of molten glass (known as gobs) are squeezed out of a 70-ton tank at 1,000 degrees - and the temperature can be adjusted by two degrees at a time. The plunger which presses each gob into a mould can be adjusted by 0.5mm. As plant manager Barrie Taylor says, 'output, yield and quality were erratic'. Business applications were run remotely on a mainframe computer at Philips' headquarters in the Netherlands. The factory refit brought the opportunity to replace the hotchpotch of systems with a single network developed from scratch. The Manman package from ASK (recently taken over by Computer Associates) was chosen for materials requirements planning (MRP). An on-line information system was produced by IT specialist Steve Hewitt and a colleague using the Powerhouse development language from Cognos. The factory now has a small central Vax computer from Digital Equipment which communicates with PCs on the factory floor and other devices which monitor and count the screens as they progress from the mould to the inspection area. Another 70 PCs and terminals away from the factory floor give managers and others access to the production information as well as to multi-user Vax versions of Wordperfect and Lotus 1-2-3 for word processing and spreadsheets. A Cognos facility called Quick enables users to do detailed analysis, for example to look at trends over longer periods. Technical design was vital. 'We only have a small IT presence, so the system had to be able to run round the clock without constant support,' Mr Hewitt says. 'Communications handling was kept off the PCs and put in the central Vax. It contacts each PC to collect data, typically every 10 seconds.' The Vax puts the data in batches and updates the information system every few minutes.' If the Vax goes out of action the factory PCs continue collecting data and the managers' PCs hold production information up to the last update. If all or part of the network goes down the computers affected continue working, albeit in isolation. In both cases, when links with the Vax are restored, the central machine checks when it last received data and gathers the missing data from the factory PCs. If a PC goes down the Vax notices after several attempts to collect data and displays a message to the central computer operator. There is further fall-back with the production counting systems. The counters are at 25 points and connected to a PC; if the PC goes down the counters have enough electronic memory to accumulate their totals until the PC is back in action. Mr Hewitt and a colleague developed the information system in Powerhouse in three months. 'We were assured by other users in Philips that it was easy to use and would enable us to do what we had planned, and that's how it turned out,' he says. 'Even if we'd been able to find a packaged information system it could have taken three months to implement it.' Mr Taylor says yield and output have increased by 10 per cent since the plant refit, and he believes most of that is down to the system. 'We now have more sophisticated control and can intervene much earlier if there is a problem,' Mr Taylor says. 'We therefore have lower statistical variations and consistent output.'

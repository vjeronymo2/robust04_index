			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson/RHM There is plenty in Hanson's offer document for RHM to make the target squirm, not least the reminder of its claim in 1988 that its past success was also the key to the future. That the future turned out dismal is now a matter of record. Hanson will, of course, have to increase its offer, but probably not by much more than RHM's current price of 249p. The ease with which it seems able to knock the company down, though, raises the question of how much even it can make out of the deal. The modest rise in RHM's shares since its demerger proposal hardly suggests much hidden value. Hanson could spruce up some brands and slice extra costs out of milling and baking. Even so, break-up profits would hardly enhance its earnings much. The alternative, which it seems to prefer, of developing RHM more or less as a whole will be slow to yield returns and costly in terms of capital expenditure and brand support. Perhaps one should take the company at its word and assume it does intend to create a new core business in food. The RHM bid would then be an example of the new-style Hanson at work. The hope would be that a more sober-minded approach would boost the market rating of its shares. But a food business would require further acquisitions. There are businesses which look cheap, but one has to hope Hanson would distinguish between assets that are cheap because they are undervalued and those that are simply not worth having.</p>

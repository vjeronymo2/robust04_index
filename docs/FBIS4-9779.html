			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 1700 GMT on 1 April carries its "Straight Talk" program live,  with host Osvaldo Rodriguez and his guest, reporter Eloy  Concepcion. Rodriguez begins the program by commenting on the  Agro-94 program: "We are taking up the topic of Agro-94 to  discuss embezzlement and the theft of vegetables and tubers and  many different kinds of agricultural products. Eloy, I believe  the measures taken to prevent theft have had some results and  more products can be found in the Havana City marketplaces. I  believe a good many products are reaching those marketplaces,  not fabulous amounts, but enough to complement the availability  of food."    On this, Concepcion remarks: "Yes, the measures adopted in  Havana were at the demand of the population. This is something  we must point out. There was a certain generalized lack of  social discipline manifested in the theft and embezzlement of  products. Many areas and streets of the capital were turning  into marketplaces for products obtained through the black  market." Concepcion goes on to say: "I believe these measures  are part of a cause that I would call noble: First, to curtail  this embezzlement, if not completely, at least enough to  establish the necessary order by which all products produced by  the Basic Cooperative Production Units, the  Agricultural-Livestock Cooperatives, and the state farms reach  the population. This should be their final destination, for  which the state and government have invested so many resources."    Regarding the marketplaces, Rodriguez states: "I recently  heard of some situations where a delegate of the people's  government is at the marketplace. The phenomenon between the  farms and the marketplaces was one, but there was a separate  network of dishonest people who would steal from the  marketplaces. Of course, this was not at all of the  marketplaces. It would happen in only a few of them. But there  was a network of dishonest people who would embezzle vegetables  and agricultural products to later sell on the black market and  who formed part of this illegal trade in vegetables. I believe  this has been stopped."    Regarding the distribution of agricultural products,  Rodriguez goes on to say: I believe the collection centers  [Acopio] must solve their problems now. Right now, in the midst  of the Agro-94 movement, Acopio must solve the problem of  transporting products to the marketplaces.    To this, Concepcion responds: I do not agree with you on  Acopio solving its problem. I believe Acopio, as it exists  today, must be abolished. I do not believe there is any other  solution or condition than for Acopio to disappear, from the  point of view of its current structure, which is inefficient.  Acopio has demonstrated its inefficiency and that it is  responsible for this whole problem of theft, embezzlement, and  misappropriation because the product goes through an infinite  number of hands and through an infinite number of structures and  paperwork that no one tracks or controls, and which cannot be  controlled by anyone."    Straight Talk concludes at 1715 GMT.</p>

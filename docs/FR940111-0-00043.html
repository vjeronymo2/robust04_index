			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 10, 1990, a final rule was published (55 FR 41312) terminating the FHA multifamily coinsurance programs and revising parts 251, 252 and 255. As a result of the final rule, parts 251, 252 and 255 each now consist of a single section dealing with the program phase-out process. However, while the former rule's provisions are no longer included in the Code of Federal Regulations, those regulations in effect before November 12, 1990 continue to govern the rights and obligations of mortgagors, coinsuring lenders and HUD in existence before the termination of the coinsurance programs. The effect of this rule is to revise those regulations as they relate to the handling of mortgage assignments to GNMA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 15, 1992 the Department published a proposed rule (57 FR 59314) identical in text to this final rule. No comments were received from the public concerning this proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In lieu of the above-quoted paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), this rule provides that ``For any Coinsured Mortgage that is not in default and is held by a defaulting lender-issuer, GNMA will have the right to perfect an assignment of the mortgage to itself. However, before exercising this right, GNMA will attempt to have the Mortgage assigned to another eligible coinsuring lender (unless it determines, with the agreement of the Commissioner, that the attempt would prove ineffectual because of market or other conditions). The assignment will be attempted by soliciting offers to assume the defaulting lender-issuer's rights and obligations under the Mortgage from those eligible coinsuring lenders that are also GNMA issuers and that are indicated on a periodically updated listing furnished to GNMA by the Commissioner.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the facts that (a) the authority to coinsure mortgages has been terminated; (b) for the most part, no market exists for the purchase of coinsurance servicing rights; and (c) none of the few remaining approved coinsuring lenders has shown any interest to date in assuming additional coinsuring risk by assignment of loans from GNMA, implementation of the regulatory requirement earlier set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) has proved to be a time-consuming, burdensome and fruitless process. Therefore, this rule amends parts 251, 252 and 255 to eliminate the requirement that GNMA, in every case, first attempt to assign issuer-servicer responsibility on current coinsured mortgages before perfecting assignment of the Coinsured Mortgage to itself and requesting full insurance endorsement by FHA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procedural Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule was reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget as a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, which was signed by the President on September 30, 1993. Any changes made to the rule as a result of that review are a part of the public docket file in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk listed at the beginning of this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is procedural in nature. It effects no substantive changes in HUD programs or policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule was listed as item number 1540 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 56402, 56431) under Executive order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

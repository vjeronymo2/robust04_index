			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Japan trade strength masked by Gulf payout JAPAN'S current account surplus in March fell 46.5 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 4.3bn (Pounds 2.54bn), though the decline was exaggerated by the transfer of much of a Dollars 9bn contribution to the Gulf war effort, the Ministry of Finance announced yesterday. The transfer masked a 13.6 per cent increase in exports and only a 5.6 per cent increase in imports, which brought the trade surplus for the month to Dollars 10.488bn, which was 31.6 per cent higher than the same month last year. For the Japanese fiscal year to end March, the current account surplus was Dollars 33.8bn, down 36.7 per cent from fiscal 1989, but it was also distorted by Gulf payments and higher than the official estimate of Dollars 32bn. Finance Ministry officials said the surplus was larger than expected because of the quick end to the Gulf war, lower oil prices, and a strong export performance, which the government fears will continue for the rest of this year and increase trade tensions. The trend appears to be continuing. In a preliminary report for the first 20 days of April, the ministry said that the country had a customs-cleared trade surplus of Dollars 2.8bn, compared to a deficit of Dollars 16.4m during the same period last year. Japanese investors were again sellers of foreign securities in March, with net sales of bonds at Dollars 2.539bn and net stock sales at Dollars 292m, after having been net purchasers of both during February. Meanwhile, foreigners remained net purchasers of Japanese stocks at Dollars 6.2bn after net purchases of Dollars 8.5bn in February. The figures for the fiscal year reflected the dramatic change in Japanese capital flows that began early last year. Japanese investors' net purchases of foreign stocks totalled only Dollars 847m, down from Dollars 22.9bn in the previous year, while net bond purchases totalled Dollars 41.4bn, down from Dollars 80.9bn.</p>

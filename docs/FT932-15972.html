			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Warning over rise in number of pensioners THE FINANCIAL pressures of an increasingly elderly population could cause conflict between the generations, the final report of a study of the lives and needs of older people warns today. The number of pensioners will peak around the year 2030 and impose heavy costs on people of working age, the report says. Older people taking on more paid work may be the best way to ease the problem, which it says will be worsened by the shift to earlier retirement. The report is the culmination of a series of studies into the third age  - defined as between 50 and 74 - financed by the Carnegie UK Trust and conducted by a range of research organisations. The findings will be used to launch a public debate about third-age issues later this month. By 2031, says the report, Britain will have 46 pensioners for every 100 people of working age compared with the present figure of 30. While it was understandable that younger people were given priority for jobs at times of high unemployment, it was 'in the interests of everyone that older people were enabled and encouraged to work'. The report calls for older people to receive better access to training and skilled paid work. Age discrimination should be eliminated where possible. 'Training, both on the job and for the unemployed, needs to be substantially increased so that over-50s can be given as much access to it as younger people.' Third-agers' potential could be achieved only when lifelong education, training and access to information were the norm. Britain, says the report, is 'a long way from achieving this'. It calls for a new independent body to monitor third-age issues at national level, and urges the government to address the future of the state retirement pension. The present policy of increasing the basic pension in line with prices rather than earnings is gradually eroding its role in maintaining living standards of pensioners, says the report. 'The basic state pension is enormously expensive because it goes to nearly everyone, and if its costs were reduced it would be possible to spend more on means-tested support for the poorest.'

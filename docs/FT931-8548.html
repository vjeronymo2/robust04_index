			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (3): Lawyers muscle in - Tax advisers are thriving ACCOUNTANTS DO it, lawyers do it, even property surveyors now claim to do it. A growing number and diversity of professionals are becoming involved in the lucrative world of tax advice. More than many other grey areas which cross the divide between the professions, tax consulting has become a battleground. And in a recession, the gloves are coming off. In the UK, tax advice has historically been dominated by the accountants. But the last few years have seen considerable growth in involvement from lawyers - reflecting their influence in other regions such as North America. Some accountants and lawyers are beginning to move beyond their own firms, while others are setting up their own specialist niche practices with even fewer confines. 'Traditionally accountants were involved in tax compliance and planning while lawyers were involved on transactional work,' says Mr Simon Stubbings, the head of tax at the London law firm Theodore Goddard. During the 1980s, the growth in transaction work exposed lawyers to tax work more frequently, he argues. That tempted lawyers and also allowed their clients to see and appreciate the greater scope for their expertise to be used. But lawyers held back until recently for cultural and professional reasons. They were generally less aggressive and more restricted in how they could market than the accountants. In international work, the accountants were able to make great play of their international networks and affiliations. More generally, they had the advantage of a recurring base of audit clients from which to identify and obtain additional tax work. That is changing. In the last four years, Theodore Goddard has hired two accountants to help it compete. 'They help make our advice more comprehensible to a finance director by putting numbers to the words,' says Stubbings. The change-over is not always easy. There is a considerable cultural clash between the two types of firms, according to Mr Daniel Feingold, of Strategic Tax Planning, which he created after stints with accountants and law firms. Theodore Goddard - in common with most other lawyers - still sees compliance work as a matter for the accountants, and transactions as their own exclusive territory. But the distinctions are becoming increasingly blurred. 'Tax planning has become the battleground,' says Stubbings. The picture is rather different outside London. 'Provincial solicitors throw up their hands in horror when they sense a whiff of tax being mentioned and they call in an accountant,' says Jill Hallpike, secretary of the Law Society's revenue law committee. 'But the City firms hold up their own against the accountants.' The tension between accountants and lawyers is being played out between the different professional bodies. There is already rivalry between the independent Institute of Taxation, and the Tax Faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Now the Law Society is considering introducing a specialist further tax qualification. The lawyers are not the only professionals encroaching on the accountants' turf in the UK. A large number of specialist agencies also chip away at particular niches such as entertainment tax or, in the case of firms like Crosher &amp; James, property work such as advice on capital allowances. VAT Clearing House offers an even more highly-focused service: the recovery of VAT on business expenses in the EC. That raises an important structural point about the changing nature of the tax profession. Increased competition is having an effect on both the size and the structure of fees. The firm only charges if it achieves recoveries, and takes 12.5 per cent of the tax received. Geographically, there is also a considerable challenge from overseas. London remains important as a centre for international tax work, but other areas are taking on growing importance. The Netherlands has always been an important rival. Mr Barry Larking, a lawyer with Smith &amp; Partners, a tax firm based in Rotterdam, who has worked for both law and accountancy practices, argues that many London firms adopt an 'ostrich-like approach' to issues of law beyond their own national boundaries. 'The big firms take a shotgun approach to international work, sending a book of information from each of the relevant national offices,' he says. 'We are not tied into a particular network, and can take a different perspective from the outside.' The accountants are still hitting back with greater emphasis on marketing, and the creation of new activities such as out-sourcing, by which they directly take over the running of tax compliance work in client companies. But Mr Feingold is among many commentators suggesting that accountants will become increasingly hard-pressed to compete unless they are in partnership with lawyers, since so much international tax work is essentially legal work.</p>

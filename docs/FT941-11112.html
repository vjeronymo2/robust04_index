			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Food and Drink: Cheap? It has to be champagne - Wine The crisis in Champagne that began in 1990 is slowly beginning to ease. Total sales last year are expected to exceed 220m bottles, compared with 214m in 1992, but still well down on the record 249m in 1989. But that is not the whole story. The increase is essentially restricted to cheap champagnes, largely sold in French supermarkets, which account for between 40 and 50 per cent of all champagnes there. Even the leading grande marque in volume, Moet &amp; Chandon, which sold 2m more bottles last year, had a downturn in revenue. The grande marques are still suffering from excessively high grape prices, supplemented by premiums for the finer grapes of the '89s and '90s that currently form the basis of their non-vintage blends. While the growers may be accused of greed, the merchants may at least be partly excused since they feared insufficient grapes, refused to sign a contract for a diminished proportion of grapes, and made individual contracts at much higher prices before the vintage and recognition of the growing recession. French supermarkets, followed by those abroad, took advantage of unsold stocks, particularly from co-ops and merchants engaged in the lower-price market, to buy and sell at little more than cost (a 2 per cent margin was not unknown) to attract customers. Prices in 1992 were down to FFr40-FFr45 a bottle at the premier prix, as the French trade calls it. This means champagne is on the market at little more than the minimum legal age of one year in bottle. But there is a limit to the amount of bottles than can be sold at cost and the basic ruling price is now around FFr50-FFr55. The top 1993 vintage price of grapes per kilo came down from FFr24 to FFr20.5 and the lowest from FFr20 to FFr16. The whole crop was sold and a record percentage of 55 per cent of grapes was bought by the merchants. This was helped by a three-year agreement limiting the maximum permitted yield to 8,400 kilos per hectare - the equivalent of about 190m bottles of champagne. A further 2,000 kilos was blocked. The basic cost of grapes per bottle of Champagne now exceeds FFr20 and a finished bottle, including interest charges for keeping each year, is around FFr43. Grape prices are now at least one-third less than at their height in 1990. May we expect to pay less? No, because price cuts have taken account of this fall. Moreover stocks are near a five-year rather than a normal three-year one and allowing for basic cost variations, it adds about FFr5 a year in interest rates to hold a bottle of champagne in stock. There are no en primeur sale revenues in Champagne. Nevertheless, from now we should be drinking higher quality champagnes at all levels. The third pressing (the second taille) is being eliminated - a reduction that will encourage growers to concentrate on their best, ripest grapes. This is accompanied by a blocked reserve of appellation Champagne. So wine still cannot be made into champagne until stocks are reduced. This can only mean better quality. Yet the wide gap between what may be called cheap champagne and the grande marques will diminish but never close, and the latter may never recapture their dominant position. They realise this and, apart from cutting staff and costs, they are reforming the Syndicat des Grandes Marques, founded in 1882. At least six members out of 28 will resign, including Mercier, Canard Duchene, and Prieur, while the rest will agree to buy a large proportion of their grapes from grande and premiers crus vineyards, they will make their wines only in their own premises, rather than sub-contracting, and will guarantee the ageing of around three years necessary for fine champagnes. All this will take some time, and it may be a year or two before the more distinguished house are out of the woods. The last vintage was not, as reported elsewhere, a disastrous failure. Although the very fine vintage predicted was spoiled by heavy rain in September, thick skins after a hot late summer and cooler temperatures meant no rot. The 1993 grape crop, although not a vintage year, will fall very well into the non-vintage blend that represents about 90 per cent of the industry's output. As Jean-Michel Ducellier, head of Ayala and president of the merchant's syndicate, said: 'We do not live in the Independent Republic of Champagne.' Its prospects must follow world economic trends, but better wines and stable prices should ease the path to recovery.</p>

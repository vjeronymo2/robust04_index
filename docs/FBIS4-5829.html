			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Role of the G-15 in the International </F> Situation"]    [Text] Delivering his keynote address at the opening of the  Group of 15 (G-15) developing countries summit in New Delhi on  28 March, President Suharto said that the developing countries  of the South should pursue a rational and realistic strategy in  seeking dialogue with the industrial countries of the North. He  said that in seeking dialogue, developing countries should be  conscious not only of the aspirations and concerns of the South  but also of the interests of the North. The summit, which was  officially opened by Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, ended  on 30 March.    According to President Suharto, the developing countries of  the South should emphasize the spirit of promoting common  interests and mutual benefit. This is the only way the G-15 can  bring the international economy out of its present disarray and  recast the inequitable international structures and practices  that have resulted in deepening disparity and injustice in  international economic relations.    The views presented to the G-15 summit by President Suharto  could be called strategic, although that would put him in a  difficult position. This is because the head of state was  representing Asian member countries at the summit and was also  speaking in his capacity as the chairman of the Nonaligned  Movement (NAM), which handles several other complex issues.    At the same time President Suharto was carrying out  Indonesia's policy toward the G-15. Since the first G-15 summit  in Kuala Lumpur in 1990, Indonesia has offered its expertise in  three programs: Population development, agriculture and food  production, and management to overcome foreign debt problems.  Indonesia is ready to send its officials to provide expertise  and advice to officials of any G-15 member country that requires  such programs.    Now let us refer to the G-15's objectives, spelled out when  it was formed in 1990 following the NAM summit in Belgrade,  Yugoslavia. One of objectives was to provide developing  countries with an opportunity to discuss effectively the basic  problems facing the Third World and the relevancy of the NAM.  The 10th NAM Summit in Jakarta managed to revitalize the group,  thus clearing up doubts about its relevancy in the post-Cold War  period following the reconciliation between the superpowers.    Another G-15 objective was to emphasize the effectiveness of  the existing group of 77 developing countries, or Third World  countries, known as the Group of 77 (G-77). The G-77  represented the developing countries at various international  fora. It was hoped that by reducing the G-77 to the G-15, the  voices of the developing countries could be channeled more  effectively, especially in promoting the long-stagnant  North-South dialogue. It was also hoped that, among other  things, the G-15 could play a more active role in the  international arena.    The G-15 is believed to have the potential to become a  consultative partner with the Group of Seven developed countries  (G-7) for the steady development of a favorable international  environment. The G-15 is expected to produce a working formula  to improve South-South cooperation and conduct regular  consultative meetings with the industrialized countries of the  North, which are attempting to undermine multilateralism in the  post-Cold War era. The G-15 should also establish closer  cooperation among developing nations and focus its attention on  the creation of a world founded on social justice, peace,  industrialization, economic cooperation, and sustainable  development.    Although the proposed dialogue between the G-15 and the G-7  is expected to be informal, it will be advantageous to the Third  World countries.    Apart from that, the G-15 should produce an effective  formula  on protectionism to protect the trade interests of developing  countries following the completion of the Uruguay Round of GATT  negotiations. The G-15 must seek ways to settle the foreign debt  burden faced by developing countries and the UN role in creating  peace and sustainable development. It must discuss proposals  for restructuring the membership of the United Nations Security  Council in line with the changing international scenario.    As the NAM chairman, Indonesia is committed to ensuring that  the G-15 continues to place great emphasis on cooperation among  developing countries and on international peace, prosperity, and  justice. In general, all nations have the confidence to solve  global conflicts in a new democratic spirit of partnership  through dialogue and negotiation. As a result, the G-15 forum  on South-South cooperation and consultation should be  intensified so that it becomes an effective instrument to  participate in international dialogues and negotiations and  achieve its objectives.</p>

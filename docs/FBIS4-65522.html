			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Environment Minister Hit With Wrath </F> of Greens"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 12 -- Statements from the new  minister for the environment, Altero Matteoli, that he favored  nuclear energy, a highway through the Tuscan coastal reserve of  Maremma, has sparked the wrath of Italian greens who declared  their readiness to defend the earth.    The spokesman for the Greens and former environment  minister,  Vittorio Ripa de Meana, branded the appointment of Matteoli, a  member of the righist National Alliance, as a "provocation"  against mainstream environmental thinking.    Premier Silvio Berlusconi, he claimed "has decided to carry  out a vulgar attack against this nation's environmental policy  tapping as head of the ministry a person who is totally inept on  environmental questions, who since yesterday has only babbled  dangerous absurdities: a return to nuclear power, expanding  highways, no limits to high-speed trains, trimming legislation  which protects the environment."    World Wildlife Foundation [WWF] president Grazia Francescato  issued a statement saying "I have the impression that he  (Matteoli) has not understood that he is environment minister.  Someone should explain to him that his job is to protect the  environment, not work to destroy it". Nevertheless, the WWF  said it hoped it was wrong and offered to give the new minister  all information he needed to help him perform his duties.    Green Gianni Mattioli said the new minister "has always been  an opponent of environmentalism, against parks and in favor of  laying cement for profit," while Roberto Musacchio of Communist  Refoundation stressed how a popular referendum was passed  against nuclear energy and how many of the projects of the past  which destroyed the environment were rooted in corruption.    Adelaide Aglietta, the Green whip in the European  Parliament,  said "the environment minister's declarations sound like a true  declaration of war on the environment."</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / BA plan to buy USAir stake postponed BRITISH AIRWAYS has been forced to postpone plans to proceed with the detailed implementation of its Dollars 750m (Pounds 430m) purchase of a 44 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier. Lord King, BA chairman, said the US government was reluctant to proceed until the outcome and consequences of the US presidential election in November became clear. The UK ministry of transport said the next round of bilateral talks with its US counterpart was scheduled between October 6 and October 9 in Washington. The ministry said officials were expected to discuss access for US airlines to UK regional airports. Also on the agenda was the right of UK airlines to fly beyond US gateway airports to other hubs. The issue of BA's links with USAir was clearly related, it said. A delay until after the election would compress the timetable for talks as the agreement says that either party can pull out if the transaction is not concluded by Christmas Eve. Meanwhile, in Washington, US airline executives launched a campaign against the British Airways-USAir deal. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United Airlines, said the deal as it stood was illegal because it gave BA control over every significant USAir decision. Even if it were restructured to comply with US law banning foreign control of US airlines, the US should still refuse permission. Joined by Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, Mr Ronald Allen, chairman of Delta Air Lines and Mr Frederick Smith, chairman and chief executive of Federal Express, Mr Wolf said the deal would give BA total access to the vast US air transport market while US carriers were blocked from the UK and European markets. 'To allow this to happen would be the worst mistake our government has ever made in air transportation,' Mr Wolf said. BA said: 'They've said it all before. It was the same bleating as before, reinforcing our view that we have made a good deal.' Meanwhile, Lord King said the prospect of buying a stake in Qantas, the Australian state airline which is being privatised, was 'quite a good prospect'.</p>

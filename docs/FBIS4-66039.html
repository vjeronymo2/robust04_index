			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas said that the promise that  changes would be made in the 21 March document, which violated  the package of confidence-building measures to the detriment of  the Turkish Cypriot side, has not been fulfilled. He held talks  on developments related to the confidence-building measures  today with U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher and then with Gustave  Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special  representative. In a statement after his nearly two-hour  meeting with Ambassador Boucher, Denktas drew attention to the  difference of opinion between the UN secretary general and U.S.  officials on the talks. Replying to a question on the  difference of views between the UN secretary general and U.S.  officials, Denktas said:    [Begin Denktas recording] We have been clearly informed [by  UN officials] as follows: The United States is the United  States. Its representative represents that country. We represent  the UN secretary general. We do not interfere in what U.S.  officials say. So, do not attach importance to what they say.    We are confused because we are wasting hours and days on the  matter. We have been trying to explain our case, requests, and  problems to the U.S. representative. On his part, he has said  this or that. Meanwhile, Gustav Feissel has made various  promises. However, he then crossed into south Cyprus and  informed the Greek Cypriots that the 21 March document will not  be changed. That is not the way to maintain the talks.    The United States and Feissel must make an effort to change  the document. I mean that the document will be changed if the  promises that have been made to us are included in the  agreement. A promise has been made to us in that regard.  However, it seems that everyone has forgotten that. Well, in  that case we cannot be blamed for obstructing the talks. [end  recording]    Explaining that a promise had been made to the Turkish  Cypriot side that the 21 March document, which was added to the  original confidence-building measures package but was rejected  by the Turkish Cypriot side, would be changed, President Denktas  recalled a statement by Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis  that his side would object to a reduction in any point.  Stressing that the existing confusion must be stopped, he  asserted that the Turkish Cypriot side continues to act with  goodwill on the package. Regarding the recent map on Maras  [Varosha], he said that pressure is still being put on the  Turkish Cypriot side to accept it. Denktas said: That is their  most serious mistake. However, they are trying to force us to  agree to it.    Stressing that he drew Ambassador Boucher's attention to  Kliridhis' statements that the Greek Cypriots will reach Kyrenia  and place the entire island under their control, Denktas said  Kliridhis' approach, which is supported by Greece, conflicts  with the spirit of the talks and the concept of partnership.    [Begin Denktas recording] Kliridhis talked about traveling  to  Kyrenia and placing the entire island under his control.  Naturally, all that cannot be linked with the talks that have  been held for so many years and with the establishment of a new  partnership republic, which is called for by those talks.  Kliridhis has adopted an irresponsible and dangerous approach.  Greece has definitely played a role in it. PASOK [Panhellenic  Socialist Movement] has adopted a resolution for a unitary state  in Cyprus. That resolution is common knowledge. Acting in  light of that resolution, the Greek Cypriots have decided to  allow Greece to establish a naval base in Paphos. That, too, is  common knowledge. Meanwhile, we are well aware of the Byzantine  tactics the Greek Cypriots have employed to acquire 90 tanks  from France. Greece argued that it supposedly scrapped those  tanks. However, they can be modernized in France to be used as  effective combat vehicles. All those preparations, statements,  activities, and steps to join the European Union indicate that  the Turkish Cypriot side is not being taken seriously. No one  wishes to recognize the conditions that have compelled the  Turkish Cypriots to establish their own state in Cyprus.  Likewise, no one wishes to realize that the Government of the  Cyprus Republic does not exist and that the Greek Cypriot  Republic in south Cyprus has been misleading the world into  believing that it represents the legal Cyprus Government.    I have explained those realities to Ambassador Boucher. They  have headed the Cyprus problem in the wrong direction. They  have done a great injustice to the Turkish Cypriots for 30  years. No one in the world can force the Turkish Cypriots to  accept the Greek Cypriot Administration as their government.  [end recording]    Replying to a question, President Denktas said that it is  very appropriate on the part of Ozker Ozgur, deputy prime  minister and leader of the Republican Turkish Party, to send  letters to him on the negotiating process. He said that Ozgur  outlines his party's views on the confidence-building measures  package and the negotiating process in his letters.    Speaking after his meeting with Denktas, Ambassador Boucher  described the confidence-building measures package as a good  opportunity for the two communities in Cyprus and stressed that  it must not be missed. Asserting that his country intends to  establish the arrangements required for reactivating the process  on the confidence-building measures package, Ambassador Boucher  said the opportunity for accepting the package has not yet been  missed. He also noted that the confidence-building measures  package must be maintained and progress must be achieved in the  talks with the UN officials.    In a statement to the correspondents after his luncheon with  Gustave Feissel, which lasted for nearly two hours, President  Denktas said that vague points must be clarified so the Turkish  Cypriot side can be in a position to reply to the points in the  nondocument, dated 21 March. Asserting that another point is  also important for the Turkish Cypriot side, Denktas said: That  is the fact that the nondocument has been converted into a  proposal by the UN secretary general.    Stressing that an opportunity has been given to the Greek  Cypriot side to hide behind the nondocument, Denktas described  that approach as a Byzantine design. He noted that the  embassies of the UN permanent members in Nicosia are aware of  the fact that almost all of the Greek Cypriot political party  leaders have rejected the confidence-building measures package.    Replying to a question, Denktas said that the UN secretary  general's report has not been deliberately postponed and noted  that the postponement creates an opportunity for the sides to  maintain their work. Denktas also said that certain issues have  to be discussed and the benefits that have been promised to the  Turkish Cypriot side have to be given a tangible form and  outlined in writing. Denktas expressed the hope that the UN  secretary general will maintain a balanced approach in his  report.    Asserting that the Turkish Cypriot side has not arrived at  the point where it can say yes or no, Denktas said that the  Turkish Cypriot Council of Ministers may take up the matter if  necessary after he returns from his visit to Turkey.    On his part, Gustave Feissel said the points discussed were  those that Denktas asked to be clarified or confirmed. However,  he declined to explain them. Feissel recalled that the Turkish  Cypriot side has been expected to give its reply on several key  points in the confidence-building measures package. He noted,  however, that the expected reply was not given today.    Feissel also recalled that the UN secretary general's report  is about to be published and described the present stage in the  talks as the latest point reached in the negotiating process.  He said that he will inform New York of the developments and  noted that he will be in touch with President Denktas before and  after the UN secretary general's report is published.</p>

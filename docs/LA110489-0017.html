			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THESE GIANTS FAIL TO DO WHAT THOSE GIANTS DID  </P> <P> Too bad "our" Giants couldn't do what "their" Giants did ("Yomiuri Giants Win  the Japan Series," Oct. 30). And they did it the impossible way: They lost  three in a row, then won four in a row.  </P> <P> If our Giants feel bad, they should phone the Kintetsu Buffaloes and hear their  story. I'll bet it's a classic, surely a dynasty in the rough.  </P> <P> DUKE RUSSELL, Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / France and Britain in EU airlines rift France said yesterday it had won majority support in the European Union for its efforts to blunt airline deregulation in order to bail out financially stricken flag carriers. But others at the Brussels meeting of transport ministers disputed the claim. Although France said nine of the 12 backed its proposals, four European Union member states - the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark - took the rare step of dissociating themselves from the conclusions to the debate on the future of civil aviation published by the Belgian presidency of the EU. The 12 agreed to try to repair the growing EU rift over the airline crisis at a special meeting in Athens on February 7, by when the 'committee of wise men' set up by the European Commission to examine the industry will have reported. Transport ministers will then try to agree a policy when they meet in April. France came to yesterday's meeting seeking a relaxation of EU rules which prevent airlines from sharing capacity, a freeze on air traffic fees, and EU funding to speed up the pace at which older aircraft are taken out of service. The UK led the opposition, calling for a ban on state aid to flag carriers, and arguing against any retreat from Europe's 'open skies' regime. By lunchtime Mr Bernard Bosson, France's transport minister, declared that Britain was 'absolutely isolated'. He said that for France 'there is no question of turning back' on liberalisation. But if Europe wanted to retain an airline industry, it could not jump 'from protectionism into a jungle of ultra-liberalism'. Mr Bosson claimed that Germany had swelled its 9-3 majority against Britain. Bonn, he said, backed French calls for implementation of safeguard clauses on overplied routes; accepted the idea of funding to withdraw old aircraft, but on environmental grounds; and sought 'moderation' rather than a freeze on air traffic fees. His statement was strongly denied by a senior German official, who said: 'We are much closer to the British than the French on this.' He confirmed Germany had refused to endorse the Belgian presidency document, which raised the prospect of EU funding and invited member states to invoke safeguard clauses on capacity-sharing. The clauses admit the possibility of airlines clubbing together to reduce flights and share out passengers if all carriers on a particular route are losing money. One UK official said the French 'were at a different meeting'.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Poll reform seen as boost for Labour LABOUR would sharply improve its chances of winning the coming general election if it gave public backing to electoral reform, according to new opinion poll findings. The policy shift could lift Labour's support by three percentage points nationally and provoke a 4.5 per cent swing in the Conservatives' southern heartlands and in more marginal Greater London. Detailed poll results, gathered by Mori for the Electoral Reform Society, show that Labour would also pick up one in five Liberal Democrat votes, passing on a potentially crucial gain in 'three-way' marginal seats. The survey, conducted between April 19 and 22 with a sample of 1,992 people, is certain to fuel pressure now mounting within the Labour party for Mr Neil Kinnock to back reform openly. Its headline figure showed voters turning a Labour deficit of two percentage points into a one-point lead over the Tories if the policy commitment was made. Furthermore, the poll showed supporters of all parties backing some form of proportional representation by a margin of three-to-one, when 'Don't Knows' were excluded. Labour party supporters were four-to-one in favour, with 71 per cent of those claiming to be 'PR knowledgeable' offering their support. The findings will provoke further controversy within Labour after the party's conference last year overturned its national executive committee and ordered a working party to extend an inquiry into PR for European elections, the proposed Scottish parliament and regional assemblies to Westminster itself. Labour's leaders have resisted backing a system of proportional representation for Westminster, the majority on the grounds that political opponents would claim it showed the party had given up hope of winning an outright majority on the first passed the post system. Mr Kinnock has long been careful to remain on the sidelines of the internal party debate. But with the working party due to produce an interim 'options' report in July, many believe he may soon take a public stand.</p>

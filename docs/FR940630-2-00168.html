			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Eligible Applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The eligible applicants for each of the four TA programs are listed below. Many organizations are eligible to apply for more than one TA program and are encouraged to do so to the extent they have the requisite experience, expertise and capability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  All applicant organizations must have demonstrated experience in providing TA in a geographic area larger than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single city or county and must propose to serve an area larger than a single city or county. Additionally, an organization may not provide assistance to itself, and any organization funded to assist CHDOs under this NOFA may not act as a CHDO itself within its service area while under award with HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A consortium of organizations may apply for one or more TA programs, but HUD will require that one organization be designated as the legal applicant, where legally feasible. Where one organization cannot be so designated for all proposed activities, HUD may execute more than one cooperative agreement with the members of a consortium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  All applicants must meet minimum statutory eligibility requirements for each TA program for which they are chosen in order to be awarded a cooperative agreement. (See Appendices C, D, E, and F to this NOFA for copies of applicable regulations.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  All eligible TA providers may propose assistance using in-house staff, consultants, sub-contractors and sub-recipients, and networks of private consultants and/or local organizations with requisite experience and capabilities. Whenever possible, applicants should make use of technical assistance providers located in the Field Office jurisdiction receiving services. This draws upon local expertise and persons familiar with the opportunities and resources available in the area to be served while reducing travel and other costs associated with delivering the proposed technical assistance services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) CDBG and Supportive Housing Eligible Applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) States and units of general local government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2) Public and private non-profit or for-profit groups, including educational institutions and area-wide planning organizations, qualified to provide technical assistance on CDBG programs or Supportive Housing projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) CHDO Eligible Applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public and private non-profit intermediary organizations that customarily provide services (in more than one community) related to affordable housing or neighborhood revitalization to CHDOs or similar organizations that engage in community revitalization, including all eligible organizations under 24 CFR 92.302(b)(1)(v) and (b)(2). An intermediary will be considered as a primarily single state technical assistance provider if it can document that more than 50 percent of its past activities in working with CHDOs or similar nonprofit and other organizations (on the production of affordable housing or revitalization of deteriorating neighborhoods and/or the delivery of technical assistance to these groups) was confined to the geographic limits of a single state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) HOME Eligible Applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) A for-profit or non-profit professional and technical services company or firm that has demonstrated capacity to provide technical assistance services;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2) A HOME participating jurisdiction (PJ) or agency thereof;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (3) A public purpose organization responsible to the chief elected official of a PJ and established pursuant to state or local legislation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (4) An agency or authority established by two or more PJs to carry out activities consistent with the purposes of the HOME program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (5) A national or regional non-profit organization that has membership comprised predominantly of entities or officials of entities of PJs or PJs' agencies or established organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Eligible Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) General.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible activities for each of the four TA programs are listed in the program regulations. (See Appendices C, D, E, and F to this NOFA for copies of applicable regulations.) Any and all eligible activities for each TA program may be proposed as part of an applicant's TA program. For the Supportive Housing TA program, this means that TA must be provided to help supportive housing applicants, prospective applicants, and/or recipients involved in supportive housing plan, develop, administer, implement, and evaluate their supportive housing projects or proposed projects; implement linkages between assisted supportive housing projects and other activities (including linkages involved in continuum of care comprehensive planning); and/or evaluate their supportive housing project's effectiveness at establishing a continuum of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants should pay special attention to eligible activities related to the Factors for Award contained in Section IV(A) of this NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

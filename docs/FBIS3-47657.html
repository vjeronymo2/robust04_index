			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- The government decided  Tuesday [18 January] on an action program aimed at boosting  foreign access to Japan's construction market.    The program calls for introducing an open bidding system on  public works projects ordered by central and local governments  and 84 public corporations. At present, only designated  contractors are allowed to participate in bidding for most  public works projects.    Under the new program, the open bidding system will be  introduced for central government-sponsored public works  projects worth 4.5 million special drawing rights (SDR), or  about 720 million yen, or above. One SDR is presently valued at  160 yen.    On eligibility to take part in open tenders, the program  makes it clear that construction firms, whether Japanese or  foreign, will be treated in a nondiscriminatory manner.    Projects, valued at 4.5 million SDRs or above, will be  opened  for bidding to foreign enterprises.    If public works are ordered by the country's 47 prefectures,  12 designated major cities and 84 public corporations like the  Japan Highway Public Corp., the threshold will be 15 million  SDRs.    For public works worth less, the existing designated  competitive bidding system will be applied, on condition that  the ordering body ensures greater transparency and objectivity  in designation and other related formalities.    The government drew up the action program to be in time for  the January 20 deadline for threatened U.S. sanctions.    The United States initially threatened to retaliate if Japan  failed to come up with effective measures to open the  construction market by October 31, 1993, but in October extended  the deadline to January 20.    On design and consulting services concerned with public  works  projects, too, the designated bidding system has so far been  applied.    But the new program introduces a system for choosing  participants from among those wishing to get orders which will  apply to such services worth 450,000 SDRs or above to be ordered  by the central government and public corporations, and services  valued at 1.5 million SDRs or above ordered by prefectures and  designated major cities.    The existing construction procurement checking committee  will  act as an agency for disinterested parties in taking up  complaints relating to open bidding.    To prevent bid-rigging practices and bribery, a plan to make  the guidelines for supervising and dealing with those found to  have engaged in such acts much more severe than at present will  be drawn up by the end of March.    The Fair Trade Commission will also lay down guidelines by  this summer to prevent bid-rigging in public works projects.    The existing "construction guidelines" which are notorious  for their numerous loopholes will be abolished.</p>

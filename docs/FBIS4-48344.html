			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Rui Mingas has accused the United  Nations of being too soft with UNITA [National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola]. The Angolan ambassador in Lisbon  stated that the United Nations is forgetting that UNITA does not  respect UN Security Council resolutions:    [Begin recording] [Mingas] I think that the United Nations  have long forgotten that there is a member country called  Angola-- the Angolan Republic.    [Unidentified correspondent] Is this a criticism of the UN  participation, rather the reduced UN participation in Angola?    [Mingas] No. More specifically, I am talking about the UN  Security Council's excessive tolerance toward applying  sanctions. You have to consider that the Republic of Angola is  the member state of the United Nations and not a group of rebels  like UNITA. The United Nations has not been set up to support  or have solidarity with a group of rebels, instead, it was set  up to preserve peace, promote unity among nations, and support  its member countries. We are a UN member state and do not  understand why, in practice, it looks more like it is UNITA that  is a member state and not our government. [end recording]    [Announcer] That was Rui Mingas, Angolan ambassador in  Lisbon  who despite the criticism believes that, by June, peace will be  a reality in Angola.</p>

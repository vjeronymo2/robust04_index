			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> S.F. HOSPITAL TO CLOSE OBSTETRICS  </P> <P> The oldest Roman Catholic hospital on the West Coast will end 133 years of  delivering babies in November.  </P> <P> St. Mary's Hospital said it is closing down its obstetrics unit because it  delivered fewer than 800 babies in the last year, although it was not losing  money.  </P> <P> Hospitals traditionally lose money when their number of births falls below  1,200 a year. St. Mary's has been shifting emphasis toward heart surgery and  orthopedic care. Both are more lucrative for a hospital than obstetrical care.  </P></p>

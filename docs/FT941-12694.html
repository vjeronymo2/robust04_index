			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sentrachem plans R294m rights issue Sentrachem, South Africa's third-largest chemicals producer with yearly sales of R2.5bn (Dollars 770m), has announced a R294m rights issue to reduce borrowings and finance local projects. Mr John Job, managing director, said yesterday the local stock market was buoyant and Sentrachem needed the money 'in the bag' well before the country's first non-racial election in April. Otherwise it risked waiting a long time for suitable market conditions to materialise. He said the decision to concentrate on upgrading local facilities partly reflected the collapse of plans to buy Chemplex, the Australian chemicals group, in 1992 after the Reserve Bank tightened foreign exchange regulations. Sentrachem was determined to acquire offshore assets and was making progress with approaches less sensitive to exchange control constraints. Sentrachem will issue new shares at 850 cents each, a large discount to the market price of 975 cents, with some of the cash used to trim long-term borrowings which stood at R360m at the group's August 1993 year-end. The group is upgrading facilities and has plans for a citric acid plant and agricultural chemical feedstock operation, with a combined capital cost of R150m. Next year, the group wants to take control of Sanachem, a subsidiary which exports crop-protection products jointly owned by Farm-Ag, a chemicals supplier.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Gilts auction success Gilt prices ended 1 1/2 points higher, encouraged by the Bank of England's successful auction of floating-rate gilts, the first for 15 years. It was over over-subscribed by 2.28 times. Traders hope that further floating-rate issues will limit the supply of conventional, fixed-rate gilts, which would help to support prices in that market.

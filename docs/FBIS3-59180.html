			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter Fritz] </F>   [Text] Qiao Shi, chairman of the PRC National People's  Congress Standing Committee, was received by the president of  the Austrian Parliament, by Foreign Minister Mock, and by  Chancellor Vranitzky in Vienna today. Apart from economic  issues, the talks also included the human rights situation in  China. There was no change in the differing views held by the  two sides.    Only a few people have demonstrated against the visit,  calling for an end to Chinese rule over Tibet.    Qiao Shi was the head of the Beijing intelligence service  for  many years. Even during Qiao Shi's visit to Germany, critics  said that his hosts would shake bloody hands -- an accusation  which Chancellor Franz Vranitzky did not support:    [Begin Vranitzky recording] I think this formulation is  inappropriate, and the point is not to shake bloody hands to  make business, but, through reasonable cooperation, one day --  and, I hope, in the not too distant future -- we should achieve  [a situation where] there will be no more bloody hands. [end  recording]</p>

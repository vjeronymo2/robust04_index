			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUNG ADULTS' INABILITY TO BUY OWN HOME  </P> <P> Kudos to Robert Kuttner ("The Great Generational Depression," Commentary, Sept.  3) and the few other souls in the (economic) wilderness for pointing out a  recent American phenomenon: the hard fact that a young family, by itself, will  never be able to own their own home.  </P> <P> Kuttner cites some (all too familiar to me) data, but what impressed me the  most was his theory: that the reason why "the political system is paying so  little attention to this remarkable generational economic distress . . . is  because the distress has yet to reach the opinion-leader class in a serious  way."  </P> <P> The fact today is that if you're young, and don't have a great deal of personal  wealth, or at least parents of means, then the only way you're gonna own a home  is to be a highly paid professional -- at least $65,000 a year. Then marry a  similar young professional and combine your incomes toward the purchase of your  home. You may be able to afford a small place in a not-too-objectionable part  of town. And whatever you do, don't make the mistake of having children! This  will put one-half of the mortgage-paying team out of commission for several  critical months! I mean, what do you want, a family or a home?  </P> <P> You tell the older generation this, and they'll never believe you. If you ask  the government for help, you are sent a list of no-money-down fixer-uppers. My  parents nod in sympathy, but, you see, they're financially strapped because of  that condo in Maui.  </P> <P> TODD WAITE  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

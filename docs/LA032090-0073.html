			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COYOTE COEXISTENCE  </P> <P> The Ventura County Department of Animal Regulation suggests some things to do  -- and to avoid -- to protect your pets from coyotes:  </P> <P> </P> <P> DO  </P> <P> * Keep small pets -- cats, rabbits, small dogs -- indoors. Even large dogs  should be kept inside after dark.  </P> <P> If you must keep a pet in the yard, build six-foot fences around it, with  outward extenders at the top of each post. String two or three strands of wire  along the extender to prevent easy scaling by coyotes.  </P> <P> * Feed pets indoors. If you must feed them outside, promptly remove dishes when  the meal is finished.  </P> <P> * Clear brush and dense weeds from around your property. This deprives rodents  (which attract coyotes) of shelter. It also reduces protective cover for  coyotes. Use traps and rodenticides, if needed, to remove rodents.  </P> <P> * Use trash barrels with tight clamping lids to prevent coyotes or other  animals from spilling the barrels' contents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DON'T  </P> <P> * Leave small children unattended in areas known to be frequented by coyotes.  </P> <P> * Feed or provide water for coyotes or other wildlife.  </P> <P> * Put trash cans out the night before the scheduled pickup. Wait until morning,  when coyotes will have less time to scavenge and won't have the cover of  darkness.  </P> <P> * Use plastic bags as garbage containers. Coyotes can easily rip them open.

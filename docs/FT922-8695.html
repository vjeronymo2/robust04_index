			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa losses continue in first quarter LUFTHANSA, the German airline, made a loss in the first quarter, continuing the poor financial trend which caused it to lose around DM400m (Dollars 250m) in 1991. The company, which will give full details of its performance at its annual press conference on Thursday, declined to give the size of the loss or to comment on reports that this was also around DM400m. Last year, the airline made a loss of DM475m in the first quarter, which was affected by the impact of the Gulf war. It recovered in the next two quarters but ended up with a loss for the full year, since the final quarter suffered from the weak state of the world economy. Mr Jurgen Weber, chief executive, has said several times that the airline, which is 52 per cent state-owned, will have to take drastic action to improve its efficiency and cut costs.</p>

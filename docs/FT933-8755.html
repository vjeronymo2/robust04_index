			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: IBM files patent suit IBM has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Conner Peripherals in the Federal District Court in San Jose, California, AP-DJ reports from Armonk. According to IBM, the suit charges Conner with infringement of nine IBM patents relating to magnetic disk storage technology. The suit seeks both damages for past infringement and an injunction to bar Conner from any further infringement. IBM said it is also asking the court to declare that certain specific Conner patents are invalid and not infringed by IBM. Conner Peripherals said it was 'disappointed' that IBM chose to take legal action rather than continue attempts to resolve the matter through negotiation.</p>

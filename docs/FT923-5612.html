			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / London's tourists led to scaffold A 'NIGHTMARE' is how Mr Ian Faris, marketing manager with London Coaches, describes his predicament. 'You go to point out what was a beautiful statue and all that's there is scaffolding.' Mr Faris, who conducts parties of tourists around the capital in an open-top bus, is surprised by the lack of complaints. 'We just describe what's underneath and everyone seems happy at that.' Outside a tarpaulin-bedecked Buckingham Palace visitors were not so muted. 'I think it's terrible,' said Mr Stuart Gifford, a day-tripper from Speke, Merseyside. 'We wanted to take some photos to show to our friends of our day in London.' Dozens of the capital's most famous buildings are under cover for maintenance. The list includes Horse Guards Parade, Downing Street, St James Palace, Admiralty Arch, the Albert Memorial and the Mansion House. At the House of Lords Mrs Gloria Allen, visiting London for the first time from Denver, Colorado, surveyed the scaffolding. 'I suppose it's got some charm, but I'd prefer it if it was how it looks in the guidebook.' Ms Isabel Coy at the British Tourist Board said: 'It's obviously as disappointing for us to have people visiting the capital and not enjoying themselves.' She said works were undertaken in the summer because many of the public buildings were not in use in that period.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Books: Penned by a very private poet - Anthony Curtis discovers another side to Larkin SELECTED LETTERS OF PHILIP LARKIN 1940-1985 edited by Anthony Thwaite Faber &amp; Faber, Pounds 20 791 pages WHEN CP Snow reviewed The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse on this page in 1973, he wrote: 'In making his collection, so deliberately, so generously, Mr Larkin has shown magnanimity and courage, two of the greatest virtues.' These are not the virtues likely to strike anyone who read the extracts from this new book that appeared in advance of publication. His fellow-poets are frequently described with a scurrilous, fulminating, table-banging, saloon-bar offensiveness that soon palls. These continual eruptions are the kind of thing many of us indulge in from time to time in private. They often involve crude nicknames and not very funny racist jokes about people in our circle. For example, of a woman poet who had just been given the Somerset Maugham award Larkin writes to a friend: 'What do you think of  .. getting four hundred nicker to go and get stuffed in Wopland?' Remarks of this kind are intended, surely, to be both ephemeral and strictly private. It does seem extraordinary that, while many of the people to whom they refer are still living, they should all have been now made public. Numerically only about one third of the letters are of this kind. They are the ones to the group of intimate friends whom Larkin has known since school and undergraduate days at Oxford, with Robert Conquest joining it later. Unlike Larkin, many of these people went on to a spell of active service in the forces and after that to make their marks in the wider world outside of academic life. The hairy chest that Larkin wears so inexorably when writing to them, with intermittently lewd references to the pornographic magazines he has been reading, seems like a determined effort to remain on terms with them and to preserve the rebellious camaraderie of the original undergraduate brotherhood long after it had ceased to be a reality. He probably felt defensive about his own war as a forces reject, having been graded C3 on account of his stammer, an affliction that interestingly disappeared on the death of his father. It led in 1943 to Larkin taking up the 'reserved occupation' (for someone in that category in wartime) of librarianship, a profession where he remained for the rest of his life. He became the University Librarian at Hull from where the majority of the letters are written. Larkin was one of those old-fashioned people who are reluctant to pick up a telephone when a letter will do just as well. In consequence the editor of the volume, Anthony Thwaite, Larkin's executor, had an enormous haul to choose from and he has given many examples of Larkin writing not only to his old Oxford chums but to anyone who encroached upon his life briefly or permanently. There are some fascinating unmawkish letters to the women friends he made after he left Oxford, especially to Monica Jones, a lecturer in English, to whom Larkin wrote what are some of the the nearest items in the book to love-letters. Their affair, like so many of Larkin's relationships, seemed positively to thrive on distance and separation. We learn that he used to go regularly on summer holidays with her. Letters to publishers form another group, and letters to the people who wrote to him out of the blue - aspiring poets and admirers - yet another. As one ploughs through the whole - the volume is best read in small doses - Snow's view of Larkin's salient qualities begins to appear slightly less inappropriate to Larkin the correspondent. There is a dogged courage in his perpetual refusal to budge - both to budge in a geographical sense away from Hull, except for some extraordinary occasion, and his similar refusal to budge in order to get on in the literary world, to be in the slightest bit pushy about his work. His career grew through ever wider recognition from critics and readers without any of those adventitious boosts from the hype-machine that jack-up lesser talents. His eventual South Bank Show accolade gave him a public presence that he had always affected to despise. Several letters to his chief editor at Faber, Charles Monteith, show that though Larkin was unconscionably slow at delivering the manuscript of a new volume - a 10 year-gap was his usual interval between books - he could be a tough negotiator when it came to the fine print in the contract. Larkin was indeed his father's son - Pop Larkin was a formidable administrator, Town Clerk of Coventry. When Philip Larkin was penning business letters in a professional capacity on publishing or library matters he was nobody's fool. Larkin's magnanimity is well hidden behind the wall he puts up to guard his privacy and creativity, but some of it is certainly to be found in his tactful, supportive handling of Barbara Pym after her novel had been turned down by Cape, her publisher for many years. Larkin admired her novels and had written spontaneously to tell her so. Her side of this correspondence was given in her sister's book, A Very Private Eye. What is remarkable from Larkin's side is the manner in which, though he is full of kind words to alleviate her misery, he does not abate one jot the force of his penetrating criticism of her work. Those who see the essential Larkin in the poem 'Dockery and Son' - a meditation by a middle-aged bachelor returning to his old Oxford college - will be interested in Larkin's confession to Monica Jones in 1966: 'I shall spend the rest of my life trying to get away from that poem'. This whole volume prompts one to say that he never really succeeded; but the final answer to that central question will have to await the appearance of Andrew Motion's biography of Larkin. This book has set the scene for it fully, indeed in far too great an abundance of trivial everyday utterances.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By contrast, under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by the HSWA (including the hazardous waste listings proposed in this notice) take effect in authorized States at the same time that they take effect in non-authorized States. EPA is directed to implement those requirements and prohibitions in authorized States, including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorization to do so. While States still must adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain final authorization, the Federal HSWA requirements apply in authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States in the interim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Effect on State Authorizations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because this proposal (with the exception of the actions proposed under CERCLA authority) will be promulgated pursuant to the HSWA, a State submitting a program modification is able to apply to receive either interim or final authorization under Section 3006(g)(2) or 3006(b), respectively, on the basis of requirements that are substantially equivalent or equivalent to EPA's requirements. The procedures and schedule for State program modifications under Section 3006(b) are described in 40 CFR 271.21. It should be noted that all HSWA interim authorizations currently are scheduled to expire on January 1, 2003 (see 57 FR 60129, February 18, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 271.21(e)(2) of EPA's state authorization regulations (40 CFR part 271) requires that States with final authorization modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and submit the modifications to EPA for approval. The deadline by which the States must modify their programs to adopt this proposed regulation, if it is adopted as a final rule, will be determined by the date of promulgation of a final rule in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2). If the proposal is adopted as a final rule, Table 1 at 40 CFR 271.1 will be amended accordingly. Once EPA approves the modification, the State requirements become RCRA Subtitle C requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States with authorized RCRA programs already may have regulations similar to those in this proposed rule. These State regulations have not been assessed against the Federal regulations being proposed to determine whether they meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State would not be authorized to implement these regulations as RCRA requirements until State program modifications are submitted to EPA and approved, pursuant to 40 CFR 271.21. Of course, States with existing regulations that are more stringent than or broader in scope than current Federal regulations may continue to administer and enforce their regulations as a matter of State law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that authorized States are required to modify their programs only when EPA promulgates Federal standards that are more stringent or broader in scope than existing Federal standards. Section 3009 of RCRA allows States to impose standards more stringent than those in the Federal program. For those Federal program changes that are less stringent or reduce the scope of the Federal program, States are not required to modify their programs. See 40 CFR 271.21(e). This proposed rule, if promulgated, would expand the scope of the Federal program by adding additional listed wastes. Therefore, States would be required to modify their programs to retain authorization to implement and enforce these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. CERCLA Designation and Reportable Quantities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All hazardous wastes listed under RCRA and codified in 40 CFR 261.31 through 261.33, as well as any solid waste that exhibits one or more of the characteristics of a RCRA hazardous waste (as defined in Sections 261.21 through 261.24), are hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended. See CERCLA Section 101(14)(C). CERCLA hazardous substances are listed in Table 302.4 at 40 CFR 302.4 along with their reportable quantities (RQs). RQs are the minimum quantity of a hazardous substance that, if released, must be reported to the National Response Center (NRC) pursuant to CERCLA Section 103. In this action, the Agency is proposing to list the proposed wastes in this action as CERCLA hazardous substances in Table 302.4 of 40 CFR 302.4, but is taking no action to adjust the one-pound statutory RQs for these substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reporting Requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Section 102(b) of CERCLA, all hazardous substances newly designated under CERCLA will have a statutory RQ of one pound unless and until adjusted by regulation. Under CERCLA Section 103(a), the person in charge of a vessel or facility from which a hazardous substance has been released in a quantity that is equal to or exceeds its RQ immediately shall notify the NRC of the release as soon as that person has knowledge thereof. The toll-free number of the NRC is 1&hyph;800&hyph;424&hyph;8802; in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the number is (202) 426&hyph;2675. In addition to this reporting requirement under CERCLA, Section 304 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) requires owners or operators of certain facilities to report the release of a CERCLA hazardous substance to State and local authorities. Immediately after the release of a RQ or more, EPCRA Section 304 notification must be given to the community emergency coordinator of the local emergency planning committee for each area likely to be affected by the release, and to the State emergency response commission of any State likely to be affected by the release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If this proposal is promulgated as a final rule, releases equal to or greater than the one-pound statutory RQ will be subject to the requirements described above, unless and until the Agency adjusts the RQs for these substances in a future rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Economic Impact Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section of the preamble summarizes the costs and benefits of the dye and pigment hazardous waste listings. Based upon the EIA, the Agency estimates that the listing of the five dye and pigment production wastes discussed above may result in nationwide, pre-tax, annualized costs of approximately $18.1 million for compliance in commercial Subtitle C landfills. The possible future costs of this listing including compliance with land disposal restrictions (LDRs) range from $20.3 to $70.7 million per year. The $70.7 million represents off-site incineration of non-wastewaters, while the $20.3 million assumes facilities with large non-wastewater waste volumes will construct on-site incinerators. A complete discussion of the EIA is available in the regulatory docket entitled ``Costs and Economic Impact Analysis of Listing Hazardous Wastes from the Organic Dye and Pigment Industries,'' November 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

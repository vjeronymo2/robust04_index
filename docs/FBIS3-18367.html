			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "bb": "The Keating Government Expects More </F> German Investment"]    [Text] Melbourne -- Even if Australia now considers itself  to be an active member of the Southeast Asian community of  countries, this new political and economic orientation should  not be pursued at the expense of traditional relations with  Europe. That is the impression that Lorenz Schomerus, head of  the Foreign Economic Policy Department at the Federal Economics  Ministry, obtained during talks with representatives of the  Labor government in Canberra.    "It was clear that Australia wants to have equal relations  with the main players," said the Bonn-based official. Following  the German-Australian economic and political consultations in  Canberra, an annual forum that the two governments agreed to  hold in 1988, Schomerus assessed German-Australian economic  relations as "good, sound, and free of problems." Germany's  restrictive policy on the import of coal constitutes a temporary  problem.    The Australian Government repeated its wish to Schomerus  that  Germany invest more in Australia and, above all, use the  Antipodean continent as a springboard for activities in Asia.  "The country is a good location for companies, people are  well-trained and conscientious, and that also applies to  management. All these things are positive," explained the  official in a conversation with HANDELSBLATT in Melbourne.    Speaking in Canberra, Schomerus drew attention to the Kohl  government's new concept for Southeast Asia, which "is geared  toward encouraging German companies, including small and  medium-sized ones, to become active in the region." The  ministerial director noted that the new Southeast Asia concept  that Schomerus explained in Canberra, setting out details that  had not been provided before, was noted with interest by the  Australian Government. There was also a feeling of satisfaction  in Canberra, because one could see that a country as important  economically as Germany was consciously looking to the Asian  Pacific region.    The Australian Government noted with regret that the planned  visit by Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert had been called  off, reported Schomerus. Australia has one of the most  competitive agricultural sectors in the world, and Canberra had  many questions to address to Borchert. Following the decline in  German exports to Australia over the past few years, during his  talks in Canberra, the minister was able to point to "a new  upward trend in exports covering the entire range of sectors in  which Germany performs well, from automobiles to machine tools."    The significance of German-Australian consultations extends  well beyond the two countries' bilateral affairs. Australia is  playing an increasingly active, leading role in multilateral  organizations. Bonn and Canberra are generally on the same  wavelength with regard to economic policy issues. Schomerus  said: "This means that there are possibilities for pursuing  matters of joint interest in international forums. The most  important reason for regular consultations between Bonn and  Canberra is to discuss how the world economy is developing and  what we can do jointly to ensure that things proceed in the  right direction."</p>

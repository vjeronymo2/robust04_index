			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CABLE TV PUTS PROFIT AHEAD OF FANS' WELFARE  </P> <P> I am boiling mad that Laker fans were denied the pleasure of watching earlier  playoff games because they were broadcast on cable television.  </P> <P> Those of us in the noncable world think of this as a crisis and don't like  being shut out.  </P> <P> Isn't there anything we can do about this? Is the world so commercial that our  sports can be enjoyed only by those who contribute to that commercialism?  </P> <P> HAZEL MacKENZIE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

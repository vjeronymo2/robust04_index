The ULIMO field commander, General Mohamed Dumbuya,  addressing a news conference on Monday [28 March] in Tubmanburg,  said ULIMO is fully committed to the ongoing peace process and  said they want the deployment of ECOMOG troops to be done  simultaneously so that no one side will be put at a disadvantage.    The LIBERIAN NEWS AGENCY [LINA] correspondent who traveled  to  Tubmanburg quoted Gen. Dumbuya as saying that ULIMO will do  nothing to jeopardize the current peace process and regretted  the current infighting which is causing more hardships for the  residents. Gen. Dumbuya said Bomi, Lower Lofa, and Grand Cape  Mount Counties are now calm and he appealed to humanitarian  organizations to resume relief operations in those areas.    The LINA correspondent said residents of Tubmanburg are  yearning for deployment of ECOMOG troops in the city,  considering the hardship being experienced in that area. The  correspondent says Tubmanburg is hard hit by acute shortage of  food, drugs, and other medical supplies as a result of the  recent fighting.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Students prepare to change masters: The challenges facing the 550 colleges that shrug off council control today ALL THE further-education and sixth-form colleges in the UK today throw off the shackles of local education authority control and begin what Mr John Patten, education secretary, describes as an unparalleled expansion in British vocational education. There are more than 550 of the colleges, which provide a range of academic and vocational courses for more than 1m students over the age of 16. They have now become independent organisations funded directly by the government. They are also preparing to increase their student numbers by 25 per cent over the next three years, with funds for an extra 250,000 students provided in the Autumn Statement. The main aim of the expansion is to raise the numbers staying on in education after the school-leaving age of 16. Fewer than half of 17-year-olds are currently in full-time education or training - far fewer than in almost every other European Community country. Mr Patten sees raising the level of staying on in the UK as a critical supply-side step in the raising of workforce skills. The 25 per cent student increase is only one of the colleges' challenges. Mr Patten is also urging them to use their new freedom to move away from the 'all-singing, all-dancing, all-providing' model. 'I want colleges to develop a diversity of mission, while retaining core access for people without basic skills,' he says. 'Colleges must gauge their market and develop in whatever directions they judge most likely to bring them success.' The newly independent colleges are striving to build closer links with employers, for whom they already provide sandwich courses and block release and part-time day release training. Business executives fill more than half the places on the college boards, and colleges will be expected to carry out regular surveys of local business to ensure that they are meeting employers' needs. Mr Patten is also keen to increase the quality of further education, after a recent Audit Commission report showed that more than one in three further education students fails to finish their course. A further-education charter in the autumn will require the colleges to publish information on performance, including exam results, drop-out rates and where students go after completing their courses. Improvements in quality will be encouraged by changes in the funding of colleges now under consideration by the Further Education Funding Council, the new quango that distributes government funds to colleges. The council has carried out an audit of every college to ensure that financial controls and systems are in place for them to take over responsibility for their destinies. Mr William Stubbs, the council's chief executive, says: 'Colleges have made remarkable progress in less than 12 months to prepare for independence.' Mr Patten shares this confidence: 'Lots of bright-eyed college principals are relishing their new freedom,' he says. 'It's exciting, dangerous and daunting - and they love it.' Some appear to find the future less exciting and more daunting than others. Almost half the colleges feel unsure about whether they can meet the ambitious expansion targets set for them by the government, according to a survey in last week's Times Higher Educational Supplement. However, Mr Jack Chapman, principal of West Kent College in Tonbridge, probably speaks for the majority when he welcomes independence day. 'The role of colleges will be brought into sharper focus under market conditions. Colleges provide a product, education, to a group of customers which includes parents, local businesses and employers. The changes will encourage us to provide products which serve their combined needs.'</p>

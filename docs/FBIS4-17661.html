			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk believes that  the holding of presidential elections on 26 June is "not  completely legal." If a new parliament confirms its decision on  holding elections and gives them legal force, then the president  will determine his attitude to the elections, INTERFAX-UKRAINE  was told Monday by the head of the presidential service  responsible for internal policy, Nikolai Mikhalchenko.    On Saturday, the president said that he intended to request  that the new parliament give its opinion on presidential and  local elections. Kravchuk also said that he still believed that  presidential elections in Ukraine on 26 June were premature.    Speaking about his attitude to the presidential elections,  he  said "I shall not agree to holding elections until they are  backed by our Constitution and laws."    In January, President Kravchuk said that he did not intend  to  take part in the presidential elections on 26 June. In later  statements he did not change his point of view.    Mikhalchenko said that the organizations which nominated  Kravchuk as candidate for presidency may collect signatures  without waiting for his final decision on standing for election.    According to Ukrainian electoral law, the nomination begins  90 days before the elections and ends 60 days before.    A candidate may be nominated by a party at a congress or by  an assembly of 500 voters.    The nominee may be registered if he collects 50,000  signatures, including at least a thousand from each of  two-thirds of the total number of constituencies.</p>

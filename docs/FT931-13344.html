			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Books: Stylish thoughts SENTIMENTAL JOURNEYS by Joan Didion HarperCollins Pounds 15, 319 pages I COULD die reading Joan Didion. It would be the perfect way to go - slipping effortlessly into the deep, dark spiral of the long goodbye while gorging on the unimprovable sentences with which Joan Didion constructs her narratives. Consider the perfection of this short passage: 'I was 10 years old when 'the atomic age', as we called it then, came forcibly to the world's attention. At the time the verbs favoured for use with 'the atomic age' were 'dawned' or 'ushered in', both of which implied an upward trend to events. I recall being told that the device which ended World War II was 'the size of a lemon' (this was not true) and that the University of California had helped build it (this was true).' In the opinion of her publisher, Sentimental Journeys is Joan Didion's 'latest foray into the ailing American psyche', a world of disconnectedness that Didion lacerates with the 'severe, crystalline beauty' of her prose. What the publisher does not emphasise is that most of the essays here are warmed-up potatoes: they appeared first in magazines. Nevertheless, not everyone is a devoted reader of The New York Review of Books or The New Yorker, let alone New West, so the publisher is performing a service. The collection does not start well. Its opening section is entitled 'Washington' and contains an essay largely about Nancy Reagan - 'Her social skills, like those of many women trained in the insular life of the motion picture community, were strikingly undeveloped' - that is strikingly second-hand, as well as sub-standard. But then the focus moves to California, where Didion is more at home. Curiously, even this section opens with a dud, Girl of the Golden West, which is about Patty Hearst and is that most unusual thing: a completely useless piece of writing. Then things take off. Los Angeles Days is an essay about the five-month 1988 Writers Guild of America strike against the Hollywood studios; Fire Season about . . . the California fire season; and Sentimental Journeys (by now we have moved to New York) about the gang-rape of a white middle-class jogger in Central Park in April 1989. All three show Didion at her best: as reporter, as interpreter and as stylist. The style is crucial. There are better, more industrious reporters than Didion, and her insights are sometimes highly odd. Quite often, I suspect, we are not gaining a privileged view of the hidden springs of American culture, business or politics, but a privileged view of the inside of Joan Didion's head, where billions of exotic chemical connections bearing no relation to reality are completed every second. But so what? Cosmologists are now tending to the view that there is an infinite number of universes, popping into, and out of, existence all the time. Where Joan Didion came from, no one can imagine; where she is going must be extraordinarily weird. How I wish I could follow her. Flamingo is reissuing Joan Didion's Slouching Towards Bethlehem and The White Album in paperback at Pounds 6.99 each.</p>

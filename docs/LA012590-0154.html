			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NAPA;  </P> <P> COUNTY BANS NEW WINE 'BOUTIQUES'  </P> <P> The famed Napa Valley wine-producing region has banned tasting rooms and  souvenir shops in new wineries after years of controversy over "boutique  wineries" designed more for tourism than wine production.  </P> <P> Napa County supervisors decided that all new vineyards must be designed solely  for fermenting and processing wine grapes. Vintners must also use at least  three-quarters Napa County grapes in their wines. The decision allowed the  valley's existing 70 wineries to continue to lure tourists with souvenirs,  tastings, restaurants and music festivals. It follows a growing argument over  the balance of viticulture and tourism as traffic congestion and development  alter the rural character of the valley.  </P></p>

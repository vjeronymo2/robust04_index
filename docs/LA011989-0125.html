			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPER BOWL XXIII: CINCINNATI BENGALS VS. SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS;  </P> <P> THE BENGAL MEXICAN-AMERICAN FLAVOR;  </P> <P> MUNOZ AND MONTOYA, CROSS-TOWN RIVALS, A WEIGHTY PAIR  </P> <P> For Cincinnati football players Anthony Munoz and Max Montoya, the USC-UCLA  game played in Pasadena last Nov. 19 was of vital importance.  </P> <P> Munoz, the one-time Trojan lineman, and Montoya, formerly a Bruin lineman, were  going out to dinner together that night but couldn't choose their wardrobes  until the game was over.  </P> <P> "They bet on it every year," Montoya's wife, Patti, said the other day. "The  loser has to wear the other guy's letterman jacket all evening."  </P> <P> So, that night, after Munoz had cheered USC in, Montoya was a Trojan for a  night.  </P> <P> "It could have been worse," he said here the other day. "What if I'd had to go  to SC!"  </P> <P> Shuddering, he murmured: "How awful."  </P> <P> After the USC-UCLA games of recent years, Montoya has never had trouble  climbing into Munoz's clothes. Standing 6 feet 5 or 6 inches and weighing  upward of 275 pounds, these are people who resemble super-heavyweight  wrestlers.  </P> <P> Here for their second Super Bowl in 8 years, they have been teammates since  1980 in the Bengal line, the bulkiest and, some say, the best offensive line in  the National Football League.  </P> <P> Munoz is the Bengals' left tackle, Montoya their right guard.  </P> <P> "I still find that absolutely amazing," Montoya said. "Two Mexicans from Los  Angeles, one from SC, one from UCLA, winding up on the same NFL team -- in  Cincinnati, of all places -- and playing pro football together all these  years."  </P> <P> They've already doubled the longevity of the average NFL player, 3 1/2 years,  and the end is nowhere in sight.  </P> <P> Munoz, 30, a first-round draft choice in 1980, said that he and Montoya, 31, a  seventh-round choice in 1979, are almost the league's only Mexican-American  players.  </P> <P> "The world has never had a whole lot of Mexican nose tackles," he said.  "There's a few kickers, that's all. There's Lupe Sanchez at Pittsburgh, and a  few with Mexican names, Ruben Rodriguez at Seattle, the Zendejas brothers."  </P> <P> None of the others, though, is ever mistaken for a super-heavyweight wrestler.  </P> <P> "I don't know how Maxie and I got so big," Munoz said. "But as a guess, I'd say  that Mexican food had something to do with it."  </P> <P> Both men relish their college connections.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't have been caught dead at UCLA," said Munoz, who played for USC in  the late '70s, when Montoya was at UCLA. "But I've found over the years that  anyone you get to know, you like -- even a Bruin."  </P> <P> Of his early years in Cincinnati, Montoya said: "At first, it was hard for me  to get used to playing in the same offensive line with a Trojan. To make it  worse, they made us room together. That's when I found out that Moon isn't a  bad sort at all -- for a Trojan."  </P> <P> Moon and Maxie.  </P> <P> "Enemies once, allies now," Munoz said.  </P> <P> Indeed, on the NFL level, college affiliations tend to blur everywhere --  regardless of whether an Oklahoma Sooner, say, is on the same club with a  Nebraska Cornhusker or an opposing club.  </P> <P> Among pros, the rivalries that last are conference rivalries.  </P> <P> Trojans and Bruins typically close ranks to think of themselves as Pac-10 guys  who wouldn't give the time of day to Big Eight guys, not to mention the oafs  from the deep South.  </P> <P> "When you play pro ball against all kinds of guys, you see how much better the  football is up and down the Pacific Coast than it is anywhere in the Big Ten,"  Munoz said, smiling as if he might or might not believe that.  </P> <P> The key now, plainly, is to bait the Big Ten instead of the Bruins.  </P> <P> Munoz continued: "Up here, you find that Maxie's a whole lot better guy than  any Buckeye."  </P> <P> MEAN AND NASTY?  </P> <P> Munoz and Montoya rank with the finest blockers in pro football.  </P> <P> Munoz, in fact, after a long career as a Pro Bowl player, is usually identified  as the NFL's top offensive lineman.  </P> <P> "I think he's probably the best that's played in an offensive line in the  '80s," CBS analyst John Madden said.  </P> <P> Asked how he reacts to such praise, Munoz said: "First, I like to hear it. Who  wouldn't? Second, it drives me to keep improving."  </P> <P> He is of the opinion that his pre-NFL life as a basketball player and baseball  player -- he pitched and played the infield for USC -- made him what he is in  football.  </P> <P> "I was the biggest third baseman in captivity," he said. "That made me work  very hard on my agility, to keep up with the little guys.  </P> <P> "In basketball, I was staggering around at 260 pounds trying to guard  180-pounders. That made me work hard on my quickness.  </P> <P> "You aren't exactly born quick, you know. The things you need the most as an  offensive linemen are quickness and agility, and you have to develop them  yourself.  </P> <P> "I really doubt if I'd be the football player I am if I hadn't liked basketball  and baseball so much that I pushed myself to excel."  </P> <P> Montoya, on the other hand, is often called football's model offensive guard.  He is a master pass blocker in a league that treasures the pass.  </P> <P> "For most of his career, Montoya has graded with or above the best (NFL) guards  in pass blocking," said Joel Buchsbaum, Pro Football Weekly's personnel expert.  </P> <P> Although he has played in the Pro Bowl and won some all-pro distinction,  Montoya would be more famous in the NFL, no doubt, if he weren't on the same  team with a player as celebrated as Munoz.  </P> <P> Those who choose honor teams often reason that one blocker or, say, one  cornerback, per club, is enough. That's unfair -- but they aren't going to  leave Munoz off, which, most of the time, leaves Montoya out in the cold.  </P> <P> This doesn't seem to bother him.  </P> <P> "I know how good I am," Montoya said.  </P> <P> And, said Cincinnati offensive line coach Jim McNally: "We know how good he is.  Max is nothing but a mean, nasty man."  </P> <P> Of Munoz, McNally, who has coached his two Los Angeles players throughout their  pro careers, said: "Anthony doesn't blow people off the line like he did when  he was younger. But he's still mean. He's the best athlete playing this game."  </P> <P> More than that, Munoz is a living reminder of the talent that USC has had over  the years in its offensive lines.  </P> <P> One day at USC, when Munoz went down with one of the three knee injuries that  all but wrecked his college career, he was replaced by a freshman named Don  Mosebar, who in time was to become the best player in the Raiders' offensive  line.  </P> <P> In a Trojan game a few weeks later when Mosebar also went down, he was replaced  by Bruce Matthews, who was to become the best player in the Houston Oilers'  offensive line.  </P> <P> Said Montoya: "It's tough sledding in L.A. for the gutty little Bruins.  Everybody knows that."  </P> <P> OR TEDDY BEARS?  </P> <P> The place to go for a night out in Ft. Mitchell, Ky., which is across the river  from Cincinnati, is a Mexican restaurant called Montoya's.  </P> <P> "Best Mexican food in the state," Montoya said. "With one exception."  </P> <P> Where's that?  </P> <P> "In Covington, Ky.," he said. "There's a great Mexican restaurant there, too."  </P> <P> That one is also known as Montoya's, Montoya said. He plans to spend the rest  of his life in the restaurant business, operating these and, he hopes, other  places.  </P> <P> "We might need a few more," his wife, Patti, said. "With only two, Maxie eats  up most of the profits."  </P> <P> Munoz, unlike Montoya, isn't aiming for a business career, although he is a  licensed realtor.  </P> <P> "Someday, I expect that Anthony will be in broadcasting, or maybe he'll just  stay in the community work that he loves so much," said Munoz's wife, Dede, an  amateur painter and singer who was born in Germany when her soldier father was  stationed there.  </P> <P> No one in the NFL is more widely involved in community projects than Dede's  husband, who is active in Athletes in Action, United Appeal, Cystic Fibrosis,  the Salvation Army, and 12 or 14 other charitable organization.  </P> <P> Last month, Munoz spent Christmas Day waiting on tables at a Salvation Army  dinner after persuading some of his teammates and coaches, including Sam Wyche,  to join him there.  </P> <P> "Sam looks a little different in an apron," he said.  </P> <P> On his vacations, Munoz likes to make missionary trips to Mexico, where, the  last time, he worked as a dental technician.  </P> <P> "(The Munozes) are the only (Bengal) family in the Faith Evangelical Free  Church of Milford, Ohio," Munoz said. "I went to Mexico with a dentist from our  church. We traveled around where some people hadn't seen a dentist in 5 years.  </P> <P> "The thing that made the most impression on me is how warm they are -- and how  they wanted to give (the dentist) something when they couldn't pay him  anything."  </P> <P> Munoz has heard, he said, that one of his forebears in Mexico stood 7 feet  tall. All he knows for sure is that he was born in San Bernardino and grew up  in a fatherless family in Ontario with 2 older brothers and 2 younger sisters.  </P> <P> He said he met Dede one day when, as opponents, they were playing softball, a  pastime they still favor, men's, women's, or co-ed, any old way. They have a  boy, Michael, 7, and a girl, Michelle, 6. They live in Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Max and Patti Lynn Montoya, who were introduced by mutual friends at UCLA, live  in Villa Hills, Ky., 2 miles from one of their restaurants.  </P> <P> "Close enough to take out, I'm very happy to say," he said.  </P> <P> They also have a boy and girl, Matthew and Alison, 6-year-old twins.  </P> <P> Maxie Montoya, son of a truck driver who is still on the road, was born in  Montebello and grew up in La Puente with a sister who is now a postal worker  and a brother who is a carpenter.  </P> <P> Traditionally, persons of Mexican descent have strong family ties and neither  Munoz nor Montoya is an exception.  </P> <P> Moon and Maxie, in fact, each have two close families -- their own and the  Bengal offensive line.  </P> <P> "On any football team, the offensive line is always a little team in itself,"  Patti Montoya said. "And you can imagine what the Bengal line is like with two  warm-hearted (Mexican-Americans) in there.  </P> <P> "Maxie and Anthony and the other fellows in the (Bengal) offensive line are  just a bunch of big Teddy bears. I've never known anyone as gentle as Maxie."  </P> <P> Hey, Patti, his coach says he's nasty and mean.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry, Maxie is kind and gentle," she said. "The things he loves the most  are his family, the (Bengal) offensive line, and Mexican food, not necessarily  in that order."  </P></p>

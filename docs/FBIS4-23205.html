			<p>BFN     [Text] The main trade union, the Federation of Chadian  Trade Unions, has decided to continue its strike as long as  workers' salary demands are not met. Here is Chadian Prime  Minister Kassire Koumakoye on the labor unions' demands.    [Begin Koumakoye recording] The labor unions demanded 35  percent. However, I should tell you that under the current  budget adopted by our parliament, in view of the devaluation, we  unblocked salaries so that there was a 20-percent increase.  Nonetheless, I believe the trade unions are right because the  devaluation was a disaster for our countries and people's  purchasing power was reduced by half. But, I also believe that  being nationalistic is being realistic, since they know our  country's problems. We have initiated negotiations to reach an  agreement. As we have said, nothing is impossible to Chadians.  We will succeed in making our national problems understood. I  am still convinced that together with the trade unions we will  be able to work out a national compromise. [end recording]</p>

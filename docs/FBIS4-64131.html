			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Diplomats Are Interpreting the </F> Crimean Problem"]    [Text] As is known, Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs  sent an appeal by Minister A. Zlenko to the heads of the  external political departments of other states on the recent  events in the Crimea. Responses to the document are already  streaming in. For example, the German Ministry of Foreign  Affairs disseminated the statement by FRG Foreign Minister K.  Kinkel to the effect that the Federal Government is following  the recent events on the Crimean Peninsula with concern.  Ukraine's territorial integrity and independence are essential  for stability and peaceful relations in Europe and cannot be  subject to any doubt. The Federal Government hopes, continues  the statement by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that  all interested political forces realize the significance of the  fundamental obligations within the framework of the CSCE and the  unconditional need to adhere to them.    The head of the Finnish external political department, H.  Haavisto, stated that he hoped that the problems that had arisen  after the well-known decision by the Crimean Supreme Council  would be resolved as soon as possible through negotiations and  assured that Ukraine's position and concern would be brought to  the attention of the state's top-level leadership.    During the meeting of Ukrainian Ambassador in the Moldovan  Republic V. Boyko with Moldovan Minister of Foreign Affairs N.  Osmoquescu [as published], the Moldovan side assured the  ambassador that the content of the letter would be brought to  the attention of President M. Snegur and leadership of the  Moldovan parliament. Moldova, which has suffered from the  policy of separatism, pointed out the head of the Moldovan  external political department, is fully aware of the danger that  the actions of the Crimean power structures are fraught with,  fully supports the Ukrainian leadership, and condemns the  separatists.</p>

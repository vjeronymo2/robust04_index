			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Civil servants without salaries after blunder: Computer system overlooks 65,000 payments ABOUT 65,000 Department of Employment staff are waiting this morning to see if the government will keep its promise that a cheque is in the post. A clerical slip in the department's computers has left its employees without last month's pay. 'The error is going to cost an awful lot of money,' said department officials, who declined to disclose details. The personnel division has agreed to pay any overdraft or bank charges incurred by staff because of the mistake. After the problem emerged on Friday morning senior officials and managers spent hours making arrangements, so far as they could, to tide staff over. 'It was a bit of a panic,' admitted one official. Managers agreed with some building societies to credit staff's accounts on Saturday. Others rushed around organising Giro and cash payments to employees relying on their salaries over the weekend. Officials were relieved to confirm that the department's ministers - Mrs Gillian Shephard, Mr Michael Forsyth, Mr Patrick McLoughlin and Viscount Ullswater - had received their salaries on time because they have separate pay arrangements. 'We weren't that surprised,' says Mr Ian Taylor, national officer of the National Union of Clerical and Public Servants for the Department of Em-ployment. 'It's happened before - about five or six years ago.' The exact cause of the embarrassment has not yet been tracked down. It was only revealed on Thursday evening when the Bank of England ran the department's faulty tapes. Mr Taylor said he understood someone had failed to tell the computers to pay out on Friday rather than on the last day of the month, a Sunday. The cost will not be known until all affected employees have submitted claims, but the department will almost certainly have to absorb it from within its existing budget. Mr Taylor said: 'We accept that errors occur. Providing the cheques are available today, we'll put it down to human error.'</p>

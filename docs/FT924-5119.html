			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Venezuela defeats second coup attempt THE Venezuelan government said yesterday it had defeated the second military coup attempt in a year against President Carlos Andres Perez. Up to 50 people died in the fighting, with hundreds wounded and the presidential palace bombed. The rebels, apparently supported by civilian insurgents, captured two important air force bases before dawn on Friday. They also took control of the government-owned television channel and broadcasting towers on the mountains overlooking Caracas. But by late afternoon the government claimed to have the rebellion under control. Interior Minister Luis Pinerua Ordaz announced that the leaders of the insurgency had surrendered to forces loyal to the government. After recapturing Francisco de Miranda air force base in eastern Caracas, loyal forces used tanks to take the last rebel stronghold, the Libertador air base in Maracay, west of the capital. Venezuelans learned of the rebellion before dawn yesterday when Lt Col Hugo Chavez Frias, the army officer who led the putsch last February, appeared on a videotape broadcast on government TV channel. According to opinion polls, Col Chavez, who apparently heads a group of disaffected lower-ranking officers, is one of Venezuela's most popular public figures. The rebel officers, who may now be linked with left-wing civilian groups, are at odds with the military high command, who for the most part appear to support the established order. They have denounced Venezuela's political elite as corrupt. Col Chavez, who was jailed after the February putsch, attempted in the broadcast to encourage civilians to take to the streets in support of the coup. However, it appeared that most Venezuelans stayed indoors. After the February coup, the government jailed the ringleaders, split up disaffected groups in the army and improved military intelligence. As in many Latin American countries, the army has lost its sense of purpose in the last decade or so, following the end of left-wing guerrilla violence and the rapprochement more recently with Colombia, with which Venezuela has had a long-standing border dispute. Similarly, the prestige of the armed forces has declined with the government's reduced ability - because of falling oil revenues which account for four-fifths of government income - to provide military hardware and pay reasonable salaries. The coup attempt comes against a background of rapid economic growth - one of the fastest in the world. From the depressed levels of 1989, it has grown by more than a quarter. Growth this year will probably exceed 8 per cent after surpassing 10 per cent last year. According to government figures, backed independently by businessmen, food consumption has grown by a fifth over the last year, a sign that the growth has not only benefited the rich. Employment is rising rapidly - a quarter of a million jobs have been created in the last year - on the back of an expanding private sector. The government says this growth has been created by its reform programme which deregulated much of the economy. Yet, according to opinion polls, the government and, in particular, the president - who faces elections at the end of next year - are hugely unpopular. This is partly because his administration has failed to improve on the poor standard of public services.</p>

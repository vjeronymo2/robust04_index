			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT TO SHOP: SWIMWEAR ACCESSORIES: BUY THE BOTTLE  </P> <P> DEAR HOT: To avoid a wild mix of tan lines, I stick with the same bathing suit  day in, day out. Are there any new swimwear accessories, preferably on the  inexpensive side, that I can add to keep from boring myself and my friends? --  A.L., Santa Monica  </P> <P> DEAR A.L.: Though we prefer the ultra-pasty, mega-sun-blocked look ourselves,  you might want to pick up some Zinka Glitter Dark Tanning Oil, a new SPF 2  product that contains glitter (turquoise or gold) and sells for $6.98.  </P> <P> As you may recall, the Zinka folks are to sunbathing gear what Ted Turner is to  the movies. They colored zinc oxide in 1986, launching a war-paint look on  beaches throughout the land.  </P> <P> (White zinc oxide has traditionally been used by sun worshipers to protect  especially sensitive areas such as noses. Zinka Nose Coat, the colorful  alternative, is still available and comes in neon pink, neon green, neon  orange, green/blue, turquoise or white at $4.99 a tube.)  </P> <P> The firm that's dedicated to making sunbathing more fun has another new product  this year: Zinka Sand-Free Oil ($8.59), an SPF 2 tanning oil so light in weight  that sand supposedly doesn't stick to it.  </P> <P> The glitter oil is carried at Miller's Outpost stores. Look for other Zinka  products at drugstores, surf shops and bikini boutiques. If you have trouble  locating them, you can call Zinka at (800) 435-6622.  </P> <P> DEAR HOT: I think I was born in the wrong era. I love Victorian anything --  lace collars, gloves, delicate pins and earrings. I'm an ardent reader of  Victoria magazine, but I'm frustrated because I can't seem to find the things  it features. I occasionally spot a few things at a thrift store, but I need  more to truly get my fix. Any ideas? -- B.Y., Long Beach  </P> <P> DEAR B.Y.: Before you rent "Somewhere in Time" from the video store once more  and drool over Jane Seymour's costumes, take heart -- there is hope. We are  aware that Victoria magazine has caused quite a run on Victoriana since its  1988 debut.  </P> <P> Your desire for those lacy, frilly, traditionally feminine things can be  satisfied at a few stores around Los Angeles, including Lavender &amp; Lace,  656 N. Larchmont Blvd. The store features floor-to-ceiling selections of  Victorian jewelry, hats, gloves, boxes stuffed with lace pieces, lace collars  and cuffs, piles of curtains and bedspreads, plus pottery, luggage and other  items. Golyester, 1356 W. Washington Blvd., Venice, and 7957 Melrose Ave., West  Hollywood, offers a good selection of vintage Victorian clothing such as  camisoles, bloomers, skirts and blouses.  </P> <P> And if you're looking for more updated Victorian styles, try Westminster Lace.  The chain of boutiques (in Century City, Sherman Oaks' Fashion Square, Brea  Mall, and South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa) sells new, romantic-style dresses,  jackets and blouses, plus lace by the yard, children's clothes and accessories;  enough to make any displaced Victorian woman happy.  </P> <P> SHOPPERS ALERT: Designers continue to launch their own boutiques. Some recent  openings include:  </P> <P>  -- First Issue, a women's sportswear division of Liz Claiborne, featuring  styles not carried in department stores, in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa.  </P> <P>  -- Laura Ashley Home, featuring English traditional home furnishings and  accessories in the spirit of Laura Ashley fashions, in South Coast Plaza, Costa  Mesa.  </P> <P>  -- BB1, carrying all-cotton, casual clothing for men and women from Ton Sur  Ton, in the Beverly Center.  </P> <P>  Already sick of those "Dick Tracy" trinkets? Just looking to blow some bucks?  Facing a wardrobe mess as unresolved as Laura Palmer's murder?

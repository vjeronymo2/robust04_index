			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GANG INVADES HOUSE; 1 OF 11 INSIDE SLAIN;  </P> <P> 5 SEIZED; KIDNAPING THOUGHT TO BE MOTIVE  </P> <P> In a confusing standoff in Watts, police officers said they encircled a house  for five hours Wednesday after an armed gang, apparently bent on kidnaping for  ransom, invaded a residence occupied by 11 illegal alien Salvadorans and shot  one of them to death. Police eventually stormed the house, only to find it  empty.  </P> <P> Investigators said five of the attackers were arrested a few minutes after the  shooting as they attempted to flee.  </P> <P> Ten occupants, carrying the fatally wounded man, ran from the home after the  arrests, but police said they continued to surround the home in the 100 block  of East 94th Street in the mistaken belief that still more of the attackers and  victims were inside.  </P> <P> Finally, at about 12:20 p.m., the officers lobbed tear gas into the residence  and went inside, but the modest, two-bedroom home was empty.  </P> <P> The identity of the man who was shot to death was not released.  </P> <P> Detectives said an off-duty LAPD reserve officer happened to be walking by the  home at about 6:45 a.m. Wednesday when he saw the gang of armed men pull up in  six vans and enter the home from a rear door that faces onto an alley.  </P> <P> "These people were trying to take (the aliens) out and put them in another  house in what clearly was a case of (kidnaping for) ransom," LAPD Lt. Bob  Kimball said. Kimball said the attackers hoped to extort money from the  victims' relatives in El Salvador.  </P> <P> Moments after entering the house, the attackers shot one of the residents and  pistol-whipped another, Kimball said.  </P> <P> He said detectives did not immediately determine why the two victims were  attacked.  </P> <P> Investigators said the off-duty officer, who was not identified, called for  help, and within a few minutes the house, which sits at the rear of a lot  behind another home, was surrounded by dozens of police officers.  </P> <P> At about 7 a.m., five of the attackers left the house and were taken  immediately into custody, police said. Several other members of the gang were  believed to have escaped during the arrests. Officers said they recovered two  pistols, two shotguns and a rifle.  </P> <P> Moments later, police said, the surviving victims left the home carrying their  fatally wounded companion. The man they carried out was taken to Martin Luther  King Jr./Drew Medical Center, where he died about six hours later of a single  gunshot wound in the head. The unidentified man who was pistol-whipped was  treated for his injuries. A report on his condition was not available.  </P> <P> The five suspects, none of whom were identified by police, were booked on  suspicion of murder. The aliens were placed in the custody of federal  officials.  </P> <P> Police, unaware that the home was empty, continued to surround the place  throughout the morning, lobbing tear gas in about two hours before they entered  the house.  </P> <P> During the five-hour episode, residents were evacuated from about 20 homes  surrounding the house where the attack occurred.  </P> <P> Cleia Thompson, who owns the house where the attack occurred and lives in  another home in front, said she had no idea the house at the back was occupied  by illegal aliens. She said she had rented it to a man named Carlos, who lived  there with his wife, Elsie, their two daughters and a number of other people.  </P> <P> "They mostly kept to themselves," she said. "You couldn't hear nothing . . . no  fussing, no fighting, no loud noise."  </P> <P> Some neighbors complained that the chickens that the occupants raised wandered  into neighboring yards and that their dilapidated cars lined the street.  </P> <P> Thompson's daughter said some of those residing at the house were sleeping in  the back yard "under the trees."  </P> <P> Thompson's nephew, Darren Johnson, said large amounts of food were taken in to  feed the group.  </P> <P> "People would be . . . carrying in sacks of taco shells and beans and all kinds  of food," Johnson said. "They could have supported a whole school."  </P> <P> Thompson said she had warned Carlos last week that too many people were living  in the tiny house.  </P> <P> "I told him they'd have to leave," she said. "He said, 'They're relatives.  They're just visiting.' I didn't see them no more after that."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Sandy Banks and John H. Lee contributed to this story.  </P></p>

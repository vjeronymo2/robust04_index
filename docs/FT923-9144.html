			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Kinkel calls for SPD to ease stand on military MR Klaus Kinkel, Bonn's foreign minister, yesterday turned a UN request for more support from Germany into a renewed plea for German military involvement in the world arena. 'The appeal to Germany from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary general, to take part in a UN rapid reaction force shows how pressing expectations are,' he said. The UN leader said in an interview published yesterday that he would welcome German troops in the UN stand-by force he proposed in a recent report, Programme for Peace. 'One of my aims is to win more support from Germany,' he added. Mr Kinkel called on the Social Democrat (SPD) opposition to give up its resistance to the constitutional changes needed for Bundeswehr forces to operate outside the Nato area. He said he found recent calls from SPD foreign policy experts for Germany to seek a permanent seat on the UN Security Council 'especially interesting'. Their proposals indicated that the SPD was coming to accept that the enlarged Germany had increased international responsibilities, and could no longer stand aside. However, he added, Germany's voice in the UN could only carry the necessary authority if the country fulfilled all responsibilities. 'These include readiness to take part in peace-keeping. . . and peace-making actions under UN auspices.' International observers considered Mr Kinkel's reaction 'predictable', a sign of the newly-appointed minister's frustration, and unlikely to yield any early results. However, they had detected a change in the government's tack on the issue of possible membership of the Security Council. Formerly shrugged off as 'not a priority', the issue, according to Mr Kinkel, would now be given 'suitable consideration' if raised. The change follows Japan's declared interest in the event of a reform of the UN Charter.</p>

Yavlinskiy's activity? -- a questionnaire from the All-Russia  Center for the Study of Public Opinion enquires. One of the  most widespread replies (34 percent) is: "I have some idea of  him from newspapers and from television interviews." An equal  number of those polled say that they know of Yavlinskiy only by  hearsay, while approximately 23 percent claim not to be familiar  with his name (what radio-less backwoods did they helicopter in  the questionnaire leaflets to?). Five percent, however, have a  good idea of Yavlinskiy's person, being familiar with his works  and his political platform, and a further 4 percent know of the  results of his activity in his state post. It is out of such  motley fragments that Yavlinskiy's portrait takes shape.  Although the smalt from which this mosaic portrait is made is  of varying brilliance and quality, recently it has been  attracting attention increasingly frequently. What is it that  makes us stop stop to look at it in the midst of a busy  schedule? Precisely 28 percent of those polled acknowledge  Yavlinskiy's high level of education and intellect, 10 percent  perceive boldness in his activity, 9 percent value his  principledness, and the same percentage value his ability to  talk with people (incidentally, 6 percent of those questioned  believe that he expounds his thoughts in too complex a manner  and that it is difficult for an untrained person to understand  him). Yavlinskiy's positive image is supplemented by the 5  percent who emphasized his political wisdom, 4 percent noted as  a virtue the fact that he is a practical person and an active  politician, and 7 percent have felt his personal charm.    But the portrait would be flat if it were without shadows: 3  percent of those who participated in creating the mosaic noticed  in their model a political opportunism and even  unscrupulousness, 2 percent noticed a superficiality, and 9  percent rebuke Yavlinskiy with being a pure theoretician and  armchair scientist.    And yet these dark stains do not overshadow the bright  aspects in the image of the person sitting for his portrait.  Proof of this is provided by the reply to an intriguing  question in the questionnaire: If Yeltsin does not declare his  candidacy in the presidential election and you have to choose  between Yegor Gaydar and Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, for example, for  whom would you cast your vote? It turned out that 25 percent  would prefer Yavlinskiy and 19 percent Gaydar. If there were a  similar confrontation with Aleksandr Rutskoy, in the  respondents' opinion Yavlinskiy would achieve a still more  convincing victory (32 percent against 18 percent). One of the  reasons for this success is that, according to 16 percent, he  expresses the interests of the widest sections of the  population. It is curious that 1 percent of those who replied  to the questionnaire perceived Yavlinskiy as a stooge of the  West, 2 percent, conversely, as a supporter of "the regime" and  a champion of Great Russia, while a similar percentage consider  him altogether a supporter of "socialism with a human face."  But the majority (21 percent) agree that Yavlinskiy advocates  democratic reforms but has serious disagreements with Yeltsin  and the present government. In these disagreements the  respondents frequently prefer Yavlinskiy. In the list of  statesmen who hypothetically could improve the situation in our  economy the majority (22 percent) prefer him, 17 percent prefer  Gaydar, 7 percent Yeltsin, and 5 percent Shakhray. In this same  category first place is allocated to Yavlinskiy when it is a  question of the ability to ensure compliance with social justice.    On looking at this portrait, the assembled people started  sharing their impressions. The most enthusiastic (6 percent)  said: "I would like him to become president." Cautious people  (18 percent) put them right: "I believe that he should hold  some other high state post." Others (19 percent) noted  categorically: "He should work in the government or parliament,  but under the leadership of a more influential politician."  Others (35 percent) spoke out altogether definitely: "It is  hard to say, as he has not yet shown his worth." Will there be  any other opinions?</p>

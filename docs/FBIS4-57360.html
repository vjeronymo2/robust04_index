			<p>BFN     [Interview with Daniel Ortega, general secretary of the  Nicaraguan Sandinist National Liberation Front, by Noel Irias;  place and date not given; first three paragraphs are  introduction by Irias]    [Text] FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] Secretary  General Daniel Ortega has announced that his party will promote  a broad policy of alliances, including the Higher Council of  Private Enterprise [COSEP], to work on a nationwide program that  will go beyond electoral periods and party interests.    The Sandinist leader said that he favors the existence of  several candidates for the post of FSLN secretary general but  emphasized the need to protect the methods and mechanisms to  protect party unity.    Ortega also called for a change in mentality within the FSLN  to promote more initiatives within the rank-and-file  organizations.    [Irias] Why did you announce that you were giving up a  possible presidential candidacy in 1996?    [Ortega] I can understand why people are so skeptical but I  have maintained that I did not enter the FSLN to hold a post in  the FSLN or in the government. I did not join the FSLN to  become president. In this stage of much discussion, some people  have been spreading the notion that I covet the presidency  again. I think this should be clarified. To me, this is an  ethical and moral issue. I do not desire to be president. I  have said this before and I reiterate it now. This is the true  reason, more so than national considerations. In addition, to  speak of running as a candidate is premature. Yes, I think the  1996 program should be of national unity. It is the only thing  that can save the country, regardless of whether or not there  are very polarized forces in the country.    [Irias] What do you think should be the mechanism used to  select the FSLN's presidential candidate?    [Ortega] The most important consideration should be the  program, which must be debated and approved democratically. The  program must be discussed with mass participation. This is even  more important than the mass participation in the election of  the candidates themselves. The people will vote for a program.  The decision for a candidate is a very important complementary  issue. The candidate will have to be selected according to the  political circumstances. It will be necessary to decide whether  or not the FSLN will run by itself or as part of an alliance.  After the congress, the Sandinist Assembly will meet to  stimulate a broad policy of alliances by inviting meetings with  different sectors, including COSEP, workers, producers, and  businessmen to draft a countrywide plan or program that goes  beyond electoral campaigns and party interests. We will later  consider the formula, who will head this proposal, who will hold  posts in the National Assembly or municipal governments.    [Irias] Would you agree that FSLN candidates be selected in  the departments?    [Ortega] I agree completely. The candidates should be  selected in a process headed by the Sandinists but which should  involve the largest possible number of followers and friends, so  our candidates can have or win the support of the majority of  the population.    [Irias] What about consulting with the rank and file  regarding the FSLN candidates?    [Ortega] The ideal thing would be for the formula to emerge  from intuition and political savvy. But this would be  insufficient if the rank and file are not consulted. This is  very important to consolidate the candidacy. A mechanism such  as the one used in Costa Rica, based on primaries, was  considered when the party statutes were debated, but it was  ruled out for material reasons. Anyway, the candidate must be  consulted with the rank and file.    [Irias] Why do you regard as risky the existence of other  candidacies, Henry Ruiz in this instance, for the post of  secretary general?    [Ortega] This is by itself a healthy principle. It is a way  such candidacies can be established, which requires careful  attention. If these candidacies lead to confrontations or  maneuvers typical of traditional parties, this is not healthy  because it conspires against unity. It is like prodding others  to fight, like sowing discord. The FSLN statutes establish the  right of active members to run as candidates. Therefore, there  can be several candidates for secretary general. The important  thing is that this electoral process take place in a friendly  and constructive manner, protecting the Sandinist unity.    [Irias] Would you back Commander Tomas Borge's candidacy if  he ran for FSLN president?    [Ortega] We have broached this topic on previous occasions.  In the First Congress we analyzed whether the post of FSLN  president, such as in other parties, was convenient or not. I  believe Commander Borge's qualities, a historic FSLN cadre, an  FSLN founder, an anti-Somozist, and an anti-imperialist who  spent time in jail after Somoza -- and Carlos Fonseca campaigned  for his release -- give him unquestionable merits and if he were  FSLN president he would enhance Sandinism.    [Irias] Would you back that candidacy?    [Ortega] Yes.  <H5>  Differences in the Opposition </H5>   [Irias] How do you perceive the concept of self-defense?    [Ortega] The things that happen in Nicaragua are not common  in other parts of the world, such as our 216 comrades who were  murdered in Jinotega. When a government or appropriate  authority does not have the capacity to protect its citizens,  the population not only has a right, but has a duty to create  the self-defense mechanisms to survive.    [Irias] Any other social group could use this argument to  arm  themselves. How would you resolve this situation?    [Ortega] The ideal situation is not that every person should  seek a self-defense mechanism. We cannot encourage that. We  have to exert pressure on the government to ensure that the  appropriate institutions maintain citizens' order and security.  We cannot encourage self-defense, but we cannot condemn it in  the cases such as I mentioned.    [Irias] What are the in-depth differences in this FSLN  internal debate?    [Ortega] The in-depth differences have to do with the  contradictions in Nicaraguan society, which are then blamed on  Sandinism. This causes a break-up with smaller groups each  going their own way.    That is why the main theme in this congress has to do with  the interpretation all Sandinists have to make on the concept of  opposition. This is a key issue -- to agree among us how to  face government policies -- this has to do with methods of  struggle and each sector will struggle the best it can.    We are obliged to stir awareness so as to ensure that people  defend their own interests.    [Irias] Is the FSLN secretary general not concerned that the  constitutional order, the legality that your government created,  may be adversely affected at some time by groups making claims?    [Ortega] We have to defend the institutions, the legal  state,  it is a principle. This is so governments do not create  policies that generate greater tension and serve as a culture  medium for violence. The original sin is government policies.  <H5>  Forefront Party? </H5>   [Irias] The FSLN has enormous political power and  institutional power quotas, and can use them to influence the  government to reduce institutional violence. Will the FSLN  wield this political influence quota on the other aspect of the  problem?    [Ortega] If the FSLN had used its influence in a coherent  and  coordinated manner we could have avoided a series of events that  the government has caused.    The government feels safe with what it can do because the  FSLN is unwilling to make true opposition. If we leap in that  direction the outcome will be favorable for the country because  it is a way to avoid violent behavior.    Provided the FSLN defends the institutions and policies in  favor of the people, conditions will be right for the people to  trust these mechanisms and not be forced, in desperation, to  seek violence.    [Irias] Do you hope to rebuild the FSLN as a vanguard party?    [Ortega] It seems to me that the term vanguard made sense  when we fought Somoza, when the FSLN was clearly a vanguard, a  very small political-military detachment that was at the  forefront in the struggle against the dictatorship.    Afterward, when in government, the FSLN became the party of  the masses. We need a revolutionary party that is organized in  accordance with how we currently live.    The most important thing after the congress is the FSLN  opening and a deep change in our mentality and in ways we  organize and communicate with the people. We need to break away  from the concept of directorate organizations that dictate lines  of work. We need to be agents of change to encourage  decisionmaking among grass root organizations. We need to  ensure that leaders possess proposals made by the rank and file.    [Irias] Would you eventually back General Humberto Ortega's  candidacy in 1996?    [Ortega] It is too early to speak of candidacies. It seems  risky to speak hypothetically. I have to be very careful  because it could be assumed that I am backing certain  candidacies.</p>

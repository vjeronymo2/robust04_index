			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: IDV buys 21%of champagne producer INTERNATIONAL Distillers and Vintners, Grand Metropolitan's drinks subsidiary, is to take its first stake in champagne production by acquiring 21 per cent of Champagne Laurent-Perrier and 1 per cent of Veuve Laurent-Perrier, its parent company. Laurent-Perrier, which is privately owned, is the fifth largest champagne brand with about 5 per cent of the world market and sales last year of FFr570m (Pounds 66m), 60 per cent of them outside France. The value of the deal was not disclosed. IDV, which already distributes Laurent-Perrier in the US, Japan, Italy and the Netherlands, will progressively take over distribution of the champagne in some of the roughly 120 other countries in which it is sold. However, Laurent-Perrier will continue to handle its own distribution in France, Britain and Switzerland. Mr Bernard de Nonancourt is president of Laurent-Perrier. His family owns 70 per cent of the parent company.</p>

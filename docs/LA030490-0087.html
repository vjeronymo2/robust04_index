			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10 RULES FOR LIVING WITH A 'FOR SALE' SIGN  </P> <P> Your life is perfect with one minor exception -- there is a 2-by-3-foot wooden  sign stuck into the front lawn that reads, "For Sale, Wescott Realty, 555-2000,  By Appointment Only."  </P> <P> The addition of that sign to your landscape can turn an ordinary household into  a frenzied one, because there are no secrets from prospective home buyers, and  no time of day is exempt from invasion. You and your home are constantly on  display.  </P> <P> There are steps you can take to prepare for the experience that will help you  to keep your blood pressure at a medically acceptable level while your home is  "on the market."  </P> <P> 1 -- You must eat, breathe and think like Mrs. Clean. No longer can you collect  dirty laundry on the bedposts, under the coffee table or on the bottom shelf of  the kitchen pantry.  </P> <P> You must load and unload the dishwasher promptly. Nothing makes a kitchen look  smaller than the debris of dirty dishes, unscoured pots and pans, and used  glasses. The prospective buyer is unlikely to believe you are preparing for a  dishwasher detergent commercial to begin shooting at any moment.  </P> <P> If you don't have a dishwasher, stock up on paper plates, plastic silverware  and glasses, and quit using the real things.  </P> <P> 2 -- Always make the bed. You can save time by not changing the sheets, and no  one will ever know. Wake up family members if you have to, or make the bed up  over them. So what, if it's lumpy; it will still look better than looking at  rumpled linen.  </P> <P> 3 -- Send your children for extended visits with out-of-town relatives.  Although the sight of toothpaste dabs in the sink used to be signs of  encouragement to you, at least it proved they were brushing, seeing them now  may trigger a migraine.  </P> <P> A teen-ager's stroll through the house can leave a trail that resembles the  path of a hurricane; a 3-year-old can single-handedly reverse the effects of an  entire day of house cleaning in less time than it takes to rinse out a sponge.  </P> <P> 4 -- Sell your pets before attempting to sell your house. Dogs often drool;  sometimes their drool can rival the flow of Niagara Falls, and when they shake  their heads after drinking water, you might need a raincoat. A prospective  buyer might think you have plumbing leaks with all the excess water on the  floor.  </P> <P> Prospective home buyers don't enjoy birds either as they have a tendency to  spit out seeds and shells indiscriminately, and without warning. Generally,  home buyers do not like to be pelted by these flying missiles or dive-bombed by  squawking parrots.  </P> <P> Owning a cat should be illegal when your home is on the market. Kitty litter  cannot smell good, no matter what brand it is, and kitty litter is less  appealing when tossed out of the box by the cat and onto the carpeting.  </P> <P> Go on a diet. While your house is on the market you should not cook anything  that has a lingering odor. Brussels sprouts might be good for you, but they  smell like used tennis socks when you cook them. That odor could drop the  resale value of your home by hundreds of dollars.  </P> <P> Prospective buyers might not appreciate the aroma created by Uncle Bill's bass  catch either; and you run the risk of offending the prospective vegetarian  buyer if you are grilling T-bones in your back yard during their visit.  </P> <P> 6 -- Stock up on vacuums. You can't afford to have yours break down during this  selling period, because lint, cracker crumbs, dog hairs and grass clippings on  the carpet seem to multiply overnight as quickly as rabbits during the fishbowl  period.  </P> <P> 7 -- Become close friends with a handyman, because anything that can break down  will do so once that "For Sale" sign is up.  </P> <P> Electric garage door openers will react to a sneeze. The garbage disposal will  decide it's better to give than receive. The bathtub and shower will clog and  resemble wading pools, and the self-cleaning oven will forget how to clean.  </P> <P> 8 -- Get rid of your telephone. If realtors have to write to schedule a  showing, you'll have more time to tidy up before they arrive.  </P> <P> "By appointment only" is somewhat misleading. It sounds very polite, but at  whose convenience is the appointment made? You are terrified to turn down any  appointment, no matter how bizarre or inconvenient the time.  </P> <P> Some home buyers are out there so early Sunday morning that they are shopping  before the morning paper arrives. Your realtor will often call with a hot  prospect a) when you have just covered your face with an avocado facial, b)  your husband's and your biological clocks finally mesh or c) when you have just  filled the tub with the last drops of your favorite bath oil.  </P> <P> 9 -- Prepare an emergency battle plan to cope with the "Can we come by in 10  minutes?" appointment. Decide in advance which family member runs the 100-yard  dash with the vacuum, who is responsible for hiding the dirty dishes, who has  to open the closets to check for fallen debris and who is on the wet towel and  hairs in the bathroom sink patrol.  </P> <P> 10 -- Leave the house as often as possible when appointments are scheduled to  show your home, or at least wear earplugs while the prospects are there. Some  of the comments you will hear about your home and its interior decorating might  enrage you to the point that you want to inflict bodily harm.  </P> <P> The chandelier you cradled in your lap for 2,300 miles of cross-country driving  is dismissed with "Oh well, it can be replaced." The bedroom wallpaper, which  took eight weeks to find, reminds them of a Las Vegas casino bathroom. This  couple wouldn't even consider sleeping in that bedroom until the wallpaper is  removed.  </P> <P> If you leave while your home is being shown, you will save yourself the  frustration of watching these people as they poke and probe into every nook and  cranny of your home and personal life style. It is less embarrassing to have a  pelvic examination.  </P> <P> Don't be shocked if the prospective home buyer surveys the contents of the  vegetable bin in your refrigerator, even though it is not included in the deal.  </P> <P> Selling a home is not for the timid, but you should console yourself with this  final thought: When the magical moment arrives and "Sold" is plastered across  your "For Sale" sign, you have crossed the line and are now a buyer instead of  a seller.  </P> <P> You must call your realtor immediately, regardless of the time of day, and  schedule appointments to watch others squirm in their fishbowls as you look for  your next house.  </P></p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Recovery aided by company results THE UK stock market, inspired by the newfound strength of Wall Street, followed other European bourses yesterday to register one of the best daily rises since the dramatic session which followed the re-election of Britain's Conservative government in April this year. In the City of London, telephone wires were on full alert as traders asked one another if yesterday's rise of 49.8, taking the FT-SE Index well above the 2,400 mark once again and making a recovery of 3.2 per cent since Monday night, meant that the bear market in UK stocks was finally over. Good, or at least satisfactory, trading results from a number of well-known UK companies supported hopes that the painfully drawn-out recession in UK industry may be at last reaching its close. Technical factors were also favourable, with a leading UK investment bank buying both the stock index future and the underlying blue chips. Stock index futures traders were cheered by the first two-day uptick since May 8 in the Footsie September future contract, which ended at a good premium. The overnight gain of nearly 52 points on the Dow Industrial Average in New York set the stage for a strong opening in London. The Footsie was ahead 23.9 within minutes to challenge the 2,400 level which, after a brief pause for consolidation of the early gains, was convincingly broken at mid-morning. The upward pace was encouraged by trading figures from BAT Industries and BT (formerly British Telecom). Improvement at its Eagle Star insurance subsidiary helped BAT, as well as the rest of the insurance sector, while BT gained ground after reporting better results than expected. London's optimism, supported by gains across the range of European stock markets, was soon further increased by Wall Street opening its new session with a gain of 37 points on the Dow. By the close of business, the FT-SE Index was 49.8 up at 2,423.2, a shade below the best of the session. Seaq trading volume improved significantly to 566.1m shares. Tuesday's Seaq total of 446m shares reflected retail, or customer, business in equities worth only Pounds 817m, still an unexciting figure for the London market. The day's trend was obscured by the activity in stock index futures, as well as by at least two large trading programmes in the equity market itself. BZW, which took on substantial blocks of both Footsie and non-Footsie stocks on Monday in payment for Wellcome shares, was believed to be busy in stock index futures, and may have sold stock into the equity market as well. However, a large buy programme moved across the trading screens just after 3pm. Traders on the London stock market will be watching closely this morning when ICI discloses its interim trading results. Strategists have long argued that company results will provide the first reliable signs of economic recovery in the UK, but have not expected to see these appear before the end of next month. Some warned yesterday that the market's current rally was driven to some extent by oversold positions.</p>

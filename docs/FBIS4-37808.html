			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 Jun (MENA) -- AL-AHRAM and AL-AKHBAR  assert in their editorials today that the continued fighting in  Yemen and permitting the language of guns and missiles to gain  the upper hand over the language of dialogue and reason do not  pose a danger only to Yemen's unity but also have a negative  effect on the Islamic and Arab nation.    AL-AHRAM writes that a cease-fire in Yemen is a primary and  indispensable condition for resolving the Yemeni crisis and  eliminating its causes. It adds that this remains a collective  Arab and international demand, as UN Envoy to Yemen Lakhdar  Brahimi declared following his meeting with President Husni  Mubarak yesterday.    The paper goes on to say: Many observers believe that the  northern forces are primarily responsible for the collapse of  the efforts to effect a cease-fire. A neutral analysis of the  current situation confirms that it is in Sanaa's interest now to  abide fully by the cease-fire. It notes that there are two  reasons for this; the first is that Sanaa's declared objective  from the war is to protect unity and the second is that Sanaa's  military operations in the south have apparently reached the  limits acceptable at Arab and international, and possibly  Yemeni, levels. The declared U.S. warning to northern Yemen's  government not to enter Aden is an expression of this fact.    Concluding its editorial, AL-AHRAM expresses its belief that  there is an impetus emerging to resolve the Yemeni crisis as the  parties to the conflict have agreed to meet in Cairo following  Arab and international pressure in order to discuss the  appropriate mechanism for implementing the UN Security Council's  cease-fire resolution and ensuring constant compliance with it.    In a similar editorial, AL-AKHBAR stresses that the  continued  fighting in Yemen despite all the Egyptian and Arab appeals to  stop the massacres of citizens in the north and the south is the  epitome of the tragedies that the Arab world is subjected to.    The paper then refers to Egypt's repeated declarations from  the time the crisis began that unity cannot be imposed by force  . It refers to its rejection right from the start of the  principle of fighting between the sons of the one homeland,  regardless of the reasons and causes, including the claims  advanced by some that the fighting is to protect Yemen's unity.    AL-AKHBAR calls on some Arab parties who are involved in  giving aid to one of the warring parties merely to serve their  vile intentions to stop doing so immediately so as not to help  deepen the split in the Arab ranks.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Moslems cast doubt on peace prospects MR Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, yesterday cast doubts on the prospects of reaching a peace agreement when talks resume today in Geneva, saying 'he felt like a thirsty man sent to find water in the desert'. Mr Izetbegovic, a Moslem, is due to meet his Serb and Croat adversaries after international mediators set a deadline of this week for them to endorse the republic's partition. A UN official yesterday warned against any side seeking 'radical' concessions instead of minor territorial adjustments of the package put forward by peace envoys Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg. 'Those concessions and the whole package are not going to stay on the table indefinitely,' said the official, adding 'bits and bobs are one thing but whole shopping lists are another'. The next days would determine whether the peace was to be given a chance or whether there was to be an intensified conflict, the official said. Bosnia's ruling assembly rejected the 'compromise package' at the weekend for failing to restore government control over territory that was mostly Moslem before the war. The assembly also criticised the plan for failing to provide sufficient Nato and US guarantees that it would be enforced. After his assembly backed the plan, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, repeated threats that the Moslems would be left with nothing if they rejected the offer. Bosnian Croat leaders said they would seek some minor changes in the plan, reportedly along Bosnia's frontier with Croatia which, under the proposed map, was mostly designated part of the Serb republic. The peace envoys have expressed their disappointment in failing to wring more concessions from Bosnian Serb leaders. Serb forces currently control about 70 per cent of Bosnian territory. The proposed map gives Serbs about 54 per cent, Croats 17 per cent, and Moslems some 28 per cent. Lord Owen last week said the settlement was the best deal he could salvage for the Moslems, Bosnia's biggest ethnic group comprising 44 per cent of the pre-war population. But Mr Izetbegovic, speaking after yesterday's talks were postponed until today because the Bosnian delegation had difficulties in leaving Sarajevo, was reported to have said: 'Our people need peace, and the proposals being offered are worse than war.' Meanwhile, the UN Security Council yesterday condemned the use of UN troops as pawns in the Bosnian war after Spanish peacekeepers spent a fifth day trapped in the Moslem sector of Mostar, AP reports. At least 53 Spanish UN troops have been unable to leave the eastern sector of the embattled city since Thursday. Moslems under Croat siege fear renewed attacks if the soldiers leave.</p>

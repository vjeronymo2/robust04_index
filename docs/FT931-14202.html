			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / 72 per cent of French population against devaluation of franc More than two French people out of every three - 72 per cent - are against any devaluation of the franc, according to an opinion poll commissioned and published yesterday by France's Finance Ministry, writes David Buchan in Paris. 'This shows the policy of the franc fort is not a technocratic policy, but one strongly backed by the French people,' Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said. The Sofres poll showed slightly less support - 60 per cent - for the European Monetary System in general.</p>

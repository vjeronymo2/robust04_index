			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBERTO FUJIMORI  </P> <P> I was disappointed in your article on Peru which stated that Sendero Luminoso  has been responsible for almost 18,000 deaths in the past decade (Part A, June  11).  </P> <P> This absolves the military and paramilitary from their responsibility in  thousands of those deaths. While recognizing the fanatical violence of Sendero  Luminoso, human rights groups, including Amnesty International, have repeatedly  condemned the Peruvian military's abuses, too.  </P> <P> "Terrorism" is a tactic resorted to by both sides in Peru's so-called  democracy.  </P> <P> RACHEL BRUHNKE  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

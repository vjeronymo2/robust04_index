			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Oil find lifts hopes for field west of Shetland Optimism about the UK's most promising frontier oil and gas area west of Shetland received a boost yesterday when Amerada Hess, the US oil company, reported a successful exploration well close to British Petroleum's Schiehallion discovery. The latest well, three kilometres south of BP's discovery, confirms that the Schiehallion reservoir extends into neighbouring exploration blocks. BP has estimated Schiehallion's recoverable oil reserves at 250m to 500m barrels. Amerada Hess, whose partners include Aran Energy, OMV and Murphy Petroleum, said it will hold talks with BP and its partner Shell on ways to 'appraise the technical and commercial potential of the field as quickly as possible'. Amerada Hess also announced that it had bought Esso's 15 per cent share in the nearby Clair field - a vast 3bn barrel reservoir which, with its complex geology and remote location, has so far defied development. The latest find at Schiehallion is expected to encourage other oil companies with acreage in the area to accelerate exploration programmes. Last week 10 companies said they were looking at the possibility of an integrated development scheme which might improve the economic viability of a number of projects west of Shetland. The deep water and bad weather in the area - and the absence of established infrastructure such as pipelines - makes development of the oil and gas resources relatively risky. Chevron yesterday announced that Ninian has become only the third North Sea oilfield to produce more than 1bn barrels. The others are Forties and Brent.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Chile invited to join trade zone with US, Canada and Mexico The leaders of the US, Mexico and Canada yesterday invited Chile to join them in the North American Free Trade Agreement, in what they described as the first step towards a free-trade zone covering the Americas. The announcement capped a three-day summit at which leaders from 34 countries in the Americas and the Caribbean promised to complete negotiations for the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas stretching from Alaska to Argentina by the year 2005. Mr Jean Chretien, prime minister of Canada, said talks would begin in the new year and full negotiations on Chile's accession to Nafta would start by May. 'For one year now we have been the three amigos. Starting today we will become the four amigos,' he said, adding that Chile would lead the way for other countries to join Nafta. US president Bill Clinton said the agreement was 'further proof of our intentions to complete the free trade area of all the Ameri cas by 2005'. Mr Eduardo Aninat, Chile's finance minister, told journalists: 'We are very optimistic that we can have a signed, fully-fledged accord 14-15 months after starting talks in January.' The existing Nafta members will meet next week to assess Chile's readiness to join the accord, with four-way talks starting in January. The Free Trade Area of the Americas, to be built on the foundations of existing agreements such as Nafta, was the central element in a five-page declaration of principles signed by the leaders of 34 countries in America and the Caribbean at the end of their three-day summit in Miami. In a 23-point plan, the leaders also spelt out specific follow-up actions to ensure their declarations do not turn out as empty as those made at the last Americas summit in Uruguay 27 years ago. The leaders also endorsed development goals, and promised steps to strengthen democracy and combat drug trafficking. Some Latin American leaders castigated Mr Clinton for the US failure to do more to stop drug consumption. However, the tenor of the conference was positive. Bolivian president Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said the summit represented a 'sea change' of formerly antagonistic attitudes between the US and Latin America. Yet some delegates wondered whether Mr Clinton - who even before his party's defeat in last month's congressional election only narrowly won approval of Nafta and Gatt - would be able to pursue his commitment to free trade and the 'partnership for development and prosperity'.

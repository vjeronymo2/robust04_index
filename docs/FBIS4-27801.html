			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Striving to boost its  international contributions as it aims to acquire a permanent  seat on the UN Security Council, Japan has begun weighing the  possibility of joining another UN-led peacekeeping operation.    Under consideration is participation by the Self-Defense  Forces (SDF) in a Canadian logistics battalion operating under  the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan  Heights, an area occupied by Israel since it seized the  territory from Syria in 1967.    The United Nations has informally requested Japan to  shoulder  some functions of the Canadian logistics battalion after Ottawa  decided to cut down the scale of its peacekeeping operations due  to financial difficulties, according to government officials.  Tokyo is expected to start looking into the specifics of  whether it can actually take part in the operations when a  government mission returns from Canada in mid-June. The  seven-member team is to study in Canada the details of the  logistics activities under UNDOF. If Japan decides to join  UNDOF, it will be its third participation in UN peacekeeping  operations, following a mission to Cambodia in 1992 and one to  Mozambique to end next February.    "No decisions have been made yet," said a Foreign Ministry  official. "The aim of dispatching the mission to Canada is  simply to explore the possibilities of the participation (in  UNDOF)." But according to some ministry officials, peacekeeping  in the Golan Heights seems to top the list of candidates for the  next destination for Japanese peacekeepers.    The 1,036-strong UNDOF, comprising infantry corps from  Austria and Poland and the 215-member logistical personnel from  Canada, has been monitoring the cease-fire and disengagement  between Israel and Syria since June 1974 after the Middle East  War in 1973. The Canadian team engages in transportation,  communications, fixing vehicles and supplying food.    The ministry officials said UNDOF is one of a handful among  17 UN peacekeeping activities now operating worldwide that fits  Japan's five conditions for joining such operations, including  the requirement of a cease-fire among warring parties. Earlier  this year, when Japan explored ways to step up contributions to  the former Yugoslavia, the lack of a cease-fire agreement there  prevented Japan from joining the Zagreb-based UN Protection  Force. Among those meeting Japan's criteria are the UN  operations in Cyprus, in the Kashmir region bordered by India  and Pakistan and at the Iraq-Kuwait border. "We're not thinking  of sending Japanese personnel to every one of the UN  peacekeeping operations matching Japan's conditions," said a  ministry official.    ``We have to think whether Japan can win high evaluation  from the international community by participating in that  particular peacekeeping operation, whether it could gain the  public's understanding while also considering the political  meaning of taking part in it,'' the official said on condition  of anonymity.    Cambodia and Mozambique both fulfilled such conditions, he  said. The mission to Cambodia, where SDF members were dispatched  abroad for the first time, contributed to the peace and  stability in Asia, while joining the Mozambique operation showed  Japan's interest in problems worldwide, he said.    The U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping mission to the Golan Heights  also meets such conditions, the official said.    Participation in UNDOF could prove Japan is not reluctant to  join peacekeeping operations in other parts of the world besides  Asia, he said.    Tokyo could also make an international showing that it is  eager to promote the peace process in the region, when new moves  are beginning to emerge in the process, the official said.    Also, because Israel and Syria are friendly with Japan and  because peace and stability of the Middle East region are  important globally, participation in such an operation could  gain public understanding, he said.    Another factor in favor of the dispatch to the  Damascus-based  UNDOF is a lesson learned from the 1991 Gulf war, the official  said.    Despite contributions totaling 13 billion dollars to the  multilateral forces and frontline nations, Japan faced  international criticism for not sending its own personnel and  conducting ``cash diplomacy,'' he said.</p>

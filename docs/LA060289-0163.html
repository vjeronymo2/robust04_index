			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> VALLEY MINISTERS ENDORSE BERNARDI  </P> <P> The Ministers Fellowship of the San Fernando Valley renewed its endorsement of  Councilman Ernani Bernardi this morning, saying the incumbent has helped them  improve their community.  </P> <P> "Mr. Bernardi, he's an antique -- he knows what's been going on in the  community," said the Rev. James Wade of Universal Church of the Valley in  Pacoima. "He cannot be replaced by an adolescent."  </P> <P> Bernardi, 77, was forced into a Tuesday runoff election by city Fire Capt. Lyle  Hall, 49. The ministers group, which represents 47 religious leaders from the  east Valley, had also endorsed Bernardi in the primary.  </P></p>

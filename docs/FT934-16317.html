			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Call for move to private regulation THE MINISTER in charge of the government's deregulation initiative called yesterday for the 'privatisation' of large sectors of the state's responsibility for industrial and commercial regulation. Mr Neil Hamilton, the trade and industry minister, said that industry should be handed responsibility for setting environmental and product quality standards and for granting enforcement certificates. Citing the French example in which fire certification of buildings is handled by insurance companies, Mr Hamilton said that business would made a better job of regulation and would inspire greater public trust. He told a meeting held by the Conservative Way Forward group: 'People would have more faith in an industry which set standards and which only accredited those who attained them than they would in a government which seemed obsessed with minutiae and which paid no regard to what producers could offer or what the public wanted to receive.' Mr Hamilton, a prominent member of the right of the Tory party, confirmed the government's plans to include an 'omnibus' deregulation bill in the next session of parliament. But in his speech to the Conservative Way Forward he went much further than the government has hitherto suggested. In many areas currently regulated by government, compulsion could be replaced by voluntary incentives similar to the Kite Mark system operated by the British standards institute, he said. In others, regulation should simply be scrapped to allow individuals to make their own choices and trade-offs. Mr Hamilton concluded: 'Much of what is presently done by regulation does not need to be done at all. It denies people to make the choices and trade-offs they want to make. It takes some products and services out of the reach of customers and denies them their benefits.'</p>

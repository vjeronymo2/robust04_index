			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR: MORE BARS:  </P> <P> Newport Landing, 503 E. Edgewater Ave., Newport Beach. Open daily till 2 a.m.,  Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m., Saturdays from 8 a.m., Sundays from 9  a.m. (714) 675-2373.  </P> <P> It's on the glitzy side, it tends to be crowded, the waitresses are a trifle  slow and the drinks ain't cheap. But there's a great view of the harbor and the  ferries that makes it all worthwhile. A fine place to park yourself on a Sunday  afternoon.  </P></p>

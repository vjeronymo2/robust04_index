			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Rabin-Peres Campaign Is a Completion of the </F> Threats and Pressure"]    [Text] The campaign launched by the Israeli prime minister  and foreign minister against Jordan yesterday was part of a  campaign with multiple purposes.    Since the time this country chose a consistent and clear  policy on dealing with events, campaigns and pressure have been  directed against it with the aim of ending its sound views and  judgment and of dragging it into positions and decisions that  many parties have experienced and which would lead to further  losses, complications, problems, and damages.    Jordan was the first party to call for peace based on  justice  and comprehensiveness. At a time when Jordan was aware of the  requirements of its role in the international community in terms  of commitment to charters and resolutions, it maintained both  its consistent pan-Arab position on the Palestine question and  its demand that the Arab rights be regained as a mandatory  condition for peace to be established and maintained.    Jordan also believed in the importance of peoples'  participation in decisionmaking and self-determination. Thus,  Jordan proceeded with its blessed march toward democracy without  hesitation and despite all circumstances. Moreover, a wider  participation in decisionmaking is being garnered now, and all  doors are being opened to a frank and responsible dialogue  within the framework of the law. Jordan has thus presented the  Arab model of an institutional state. Israel used to claim that  it was the only such model, and that there was no regional  democracy that recognizes the people's right to power sharing  and free choice. When Rabin and Peres level accusations at  Jordan and utter threats against it now, the matter becomes  clear. This is because, at a time when we are facing both a  siege that has been imposed on us since the Gulf war and  Israel's intransigence in repressing our kinsfolk in the  occupied territories, our verbal expressions can only demand  justice and commitment to international legitimacy, and warn  against the consequences of dealing with us and with other Arab  peoples in a manner which exerts further pressure.    The talk about peace and its importance for the region's  future and welfare of its peoples has been ours. When we talked  about peace in the past, we suffered much in terms of false  accusations and slander campaigns. But as others' positions  have circumvented justice as part of the desired peace, we can  only remain faithful to our positions and principles regardless  of campaigns and pressure. These positions and principles will  not be sold out, nor will any Arab right in Jordan, Palestine,  or elsewhere. This is because we do not accept sellouts in  response to threats and pressure out of our regard for all  religions, norms, and laws. Selling out will not establish a  just peace that will last and be accepted by the people.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Technology: A good read on screen - Digitalisation and CD-Rom are shaking up the publishing industry Books have changed surprisingly little since the printing press was invented 400 years ago, but a metamorphosis may soon set in. Digitalisation and CD-Rom technology, which allow vast amounts of information to be stored on a compact disc, are shaking up the staid publishing sector. 'A book today looks pretty much like it did a century or two ago,' says Valerie Hyman, a member of the faculty at the Poynter Institute media think-tank in Florida. 'But technological changes will profoundly affect this industry over the next two decades.' Known as electronic publishing or computerised publishing, these changes are already calling into question the very concept of a book. One company, Voyager, is already printing books on CD-Rom for reading on a computer screen. Other companies are exploring book-on-demand printing, which offers custom-designed texts. 'Publishing in the future will look more like a computer database,' says Joseph Dionne, chairman and chief executive officer of McGraw-Hill, which is becoming increasingly involved in electronic publishing. 'The idea is to be able to mix up the information and give to customers exactly what they want when they want it.' Primis, a subsidiary of McGraw-Hill which was developed with technology from Eastman Kodak and RR Donnelly, has put a new slant on the textbook market by allowing for customised printing at the bookstore. A professor 'designs' a textbook by selecting chapters, passages and other information from a selection of materials. The data are then digitalised and stored in Primis' computer. A student who needs the textbook can walk into a bookstore, place an order and receive the book through a computer link-up in a matter of minutes. (Primis' printers put out 90 pages a minute.) So far, only a small number of bookstores have this capability, but Primis expects the market to grow. The computerised method offers a number of advantages. 'The professor gets a textbook that exactly fits the course material,' says Suzanne Bedell, publisher at Primis. 'And the students don't have to spend money for extraneous materials.' The textbooks can also be updated easily from semester to semester, particularly important for courses in the sciences and politics. Xerox also wants to enter on-demand publishing. The company introduced high-speed Docu-Tech printers into the market four years ago and has been building up a database. Xerox is operating on-demand printing in about 30 test sites and plans to launch the product in the general market later this year. 'One problem for us has been binding the book on-site,' says Peter Galton, marketing manager for Docu-Tech. 'But this year, we'll be introducing the capability to create covers on the spot. We can do either case-bound hardbacks or perfect-bound paperbacks.' Xerox says it will also be able to print colour illustrations and graphics in the Docu-Tech products. 'Once you capture the information digitally, you can print almost anything,' says Galton. With the move to digitalisation, the lines between fiction, film, education, books, research and entertainment will become increasingly fuzzy. Primis already has plans to include videos of professors' lectures with some of its products. Voyager has gone a step further by trying to change not only the way books are put together but also the way they are read. It is marketing books on CD-Rom which are meant to be read on the computer. The company's version of Macbeth, for instance, features Shakespeare's original text, additional annotations, and a computer-screen video of a performance of the play by the Royal Shakespeare Company. If a reader does not understand a word, explanations and definitions can be revealed by putting the indicator on a word, and pressing a key. Other annotations can be obtained in a similar way. At any point in the text, the reader can also activate the video; this appears in the corner of the computer screen and the pages of the text automatically turn as the play progresses. 'As CD-Rom technology progresses to include more memory, we hope to expand the video part of the screen and diminish the text,' says Michael Cohen, producer/editor at Voyager. Electronic publishing is bound to trigger profound changes in the industry. The concept of bookshops and libraries may change completely. 'The bookstore and library of the future will hold no inventory, just databases,' says Dionne. The idea is that customers will make their selections from the computer, and leave with their computer disc or on-demand book in hand. By reducing up-front costs for the publisher, the technology may help new authors. 'Because the publisher doesn't have to invest in printing hundreds or thousands of books that might not be sold, this lowers the risk to publishers,' says Paul Aiken, attorney for the Authors' Guild. 'That means they should be more willing to take a chance on new authors, and this should allow more titles to become available on the market.' However, the guild is concerned about how the technology will keep track of copyright. 'If just a chapter of someone's book is being used, how will the payment be accounted for?' Aiken asks. 'And what if the author doesn't want the work taken out of context like that? These are complex issues that must be addressed.' Another uncertainty is the extent to which the reading of books on the computer will take the place of reading a printed book. 'I think there's room for both,' says Galton. 'Computer screen books may be appealing in some instances, but there's something aesthetic about a bound book, and something comforting about curling up in bed with a book.'</p>

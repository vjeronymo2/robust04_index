			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Banks may be held liable for pollution clean-ups Banks could be held liable for cleaning up pollution caused by companies to which they have made loans, under government proposals published yesterday. The consultation paper from the Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office suggests that a fund of millions of pounds might also be needed to cover pollution costs where no person or organisation could be held liable. But it stresses that the UK wants to avoid the problems faced by the US's Superfund, which has seen clean-up costs outstripping its budget. The report tackles questions about who should pay to clean up contaminated land, and how clean it should be. It recommends that land needs to be cleaned only to the extent of being 'suitable for use', not to its original state of cleanliness. Ms Clare Deanesly of Gouldens, the solicitors, said yesterday: 'The question that is really up in the air is liability for pollution that occurred in the past. There has been a lot of buck-passing between the public and private sectors.' The legal problems were highlighted in December in a court battle between Eastern Counties Leather and Cambridge Water over liability for water pollution. Last year the government scrapped plans for a register of contaminated land, part of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, because of fears that it would cause property blight and would place too great a financial burden on local authorities. Ministers are concerned that the legal uncertainties are preventing companies from securing loans and insurance, and making it preferable to develop greenfield sites rather than old industrial blackspots. The new proposals were attacked last night by banks, property companies and environmentalists. Ms Hilary Thompson, head of the environmental unit at National Westminster Bank, called for details of the banks' possible exposure to be clarified. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said: 'Our disappointment is that, after a year-long review, the government's recommendations remain so tentative.' Responses to the paper are due by May 3.</p>

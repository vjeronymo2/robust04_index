			<p>BFN     [Text] A consultative meeting of the delegates of the DPRK  Government, political parties, and public organizations was  held. At the joint meeting of the DPRK Government, political  parties, and public organizations which was held in Pyongyang on  11 April, a proposal was made that a national meeting, to be  participated in by the delegates of the authorities, the  political parties, and organizations, and individual figures of  the North and the South and the delegates from overseas, be  convened in Pyongyang or Seoul on the occasion of this 15  August, one year before the 50th anniversary of the fatherland  liberation, that a preparatory committee for the national  meeting be formed consisting of the delegates of the North, the  South, and overseas, and that the first round of the preparatory  committee meeting be held in May as a measure for the successful  convocation of the national meeting.    A consultative meeting of the delegates of the DPRK  Government, political parties, and public organizations was held  in Pyongyang on 25 May to discuss various matters connected with  the convocation of the national meeting.    Participating in the consultative meeting were the delegates  of the DPRK Central People's Committee, State Administration  Council, political parties, and public organizations.    The consultative meeting discussed various measures to be  taken at the present which include the matter of sending to the  South Korean authorities a telephone message urging them to  respond to our proposal for convening a national meeting and for  forming a national meeting preparatory committee and the matter  of electing the North side's delegates to the national meeting.    The consultative meeting pointed out first that the 10-point  program for great unity of the whole nation clarified by the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is enjoying great support and  sympathy among the people at home and abroad with each passing  day and that the proposal for convening a national meeting for  its realization has been evoking deep interests among the people  in the North and the South and overseas compatriots.    The consultative meeting expressed deep regret over the fact  that the South Korean authorities did not accept our side's  letter related to convening a national meeting, which was  proposed proceeding from the desire to open the road for peace  and peaceful reunification with the nation's united strength,  amid the circumstances under which North-South confrontation is  being intensified and the danger of a nuclear war is growing on  the Korean peninsula and that, furthermore, they went so far as  to intercept and block en route the letter sent to individual  addressees by international mail.    The consultative meeting has decided to urge the South  Korean  authorities to accept the proposal to convene a national meeting  as soon as possible, taking note of the positive position  expressed on 15 April by the preparatory committee to form the  South side's headquarters of Pomminnyon regarding the holding of  the national meeting. For this end, it has enabled the CPRF  secretariat to immediately send a telephone message which urges  South Korea to accept the proposal and to elect the delegates of  the South side's preparatory committee for the national meeting  to the South Korean National Unfication Board.    Based on the reaffirmation of the need to elect the  delegates  of the preparatory committee, the consultative meeting first  elected the delegates of the North side's preparatory committee  and those are as follows: Chong Mun-san, secretary of  Secretariat of the Administration Council; Kim Yong-ho, vice  chairman of Korea Social Democratic Party Central Committee;  Paek Nam-chun, secretary of the CPRF Secretariat; Kim  Yong-nam, vice chairman of General Federation of Trade Unions of  Korea; and Kang Yong-sop, chairman of the Korean Christian  Federation Central Committee and vice chairman of the Korean  Religious Council.    Participants in the consultative meeting have expressed  their  firm resolution to open a new significant phase to secure peace  in the country, as well as to achieve peaceful reunification  based on the great unity of the whole nation, thus surely  holding the national meeting on the occasion of 15 August of  this year, a year ahead of the 50th anniversary of the  liberation of the fatherland.    Also, they expressed the expectation that the South Korean  authorities immediately respond to the proposal to convene the  national meeting, and that the South side elect the delegates to  participate in the national meeting at the earliest date.</p>

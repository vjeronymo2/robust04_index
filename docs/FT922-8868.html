			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Pay deal may force German inflation higher FURTHER upward pressure on west German inflation is inevitable after last week's public services pay deal, the Bundesbank president and local government leaders warned at the weekend. The settlement, which will add 5.12 per cent to federal, state and local authority pay bills, will also have 'regrettable consequences' for postal and travel charges and boost expectations among private sector employees, according to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the central bank president. 'The situation has not been made any easier for us,' he said after an EC finance ministers' meeting in Oporto, Portugal. Mr Schlesinger's comments, his first since last week's strike settlement, further underline the Bundesbank's determination not to relax monetary policy until there are clear signs of deceleration in money supply growth and a turndown in inflation, currently running at an annual rate of about 4.5 per cent. Mr Hans Gottfried Bernrath, president of the local authorities association, said charges for labour-intensive services, such as rubbish collection, would be especially affected. People would also have to pay more for kindergarten and creche facilities, colleagues warned. Engineering employers and unions, meanwhile, prepared for their expected showdown this week. A meeting in the southern state of Hesse this morning would be the companies' 'last chance' to present a negotiable offer, said Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the IG Metall union. Mr Steinkuhler, representing 4m workers, again threatened a long and hard strike. If the employers failed to increase their 3.3 per cent offer, 'then the ballot and strikes will come much more quickly than some desktop strategists and loudmouths think,' he told a rally in Karlsruhe. Although he showed some signs of flexibility, calling for not less than 6 per cent in place of the union's initial 9.5 per cent demand, there was no indication yesterday that the employers were prepared to give ground. Most have been long reconciled to a bruising conflict. Up to 200,000 metalworkers are expected to respond today to renewed calls for 'warning strikes', as the engineering negotiations move to centre stage in Germany's bitter wages rounds. Disruption hit many private sector companies last week as building, and printing workers joined the engineers in protest stoppages, but the effects were blurred by the dominating influence of the first national public services strike in 18 years. Following last Thursday's public sector settlement, to be put to a membership vote today, the engineers are likely to throw their full weight behind their own campaign. Complaints continued at the weekend from public services workers disappointed by the outcome of their strike. Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, president of the main union involved, oTV, insisted that its 'political and material effects deal should not be underestimated'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 25 April, the Food Agency announced the result  of its examiniation of qualifications of trading firms that have  applied for registration in starting new business operations in  importing rice and wheat for fiscal 1994, stating that all the  applications have been rejected. Applications were accepted  1-10 March, and over 10 trading firms submitted applications.  All these trading firms meet the requirements to apply. For  example, applying trading firms "must be corporations (including  those set up in Japan but affiliated with foreign companies)  with capital of over 100 million yen and must have experience  trading in rice and wheat."    However, based on the judgment that, "when viewed from such  standpoints as credibility and experience in actual trade, these  firms seem to be unqualified" (as stated by the Import  Division), the Food Agency has rejected these applications.  When applications were made, no standards for approval were  made public. However, all of the trading firms were notified by  31 March, with each individual firm given reasons for the  disapproval of the registration. Trading firms have expressed  dissatisfaction with the decision, saying that "it may somehow  lead to dango [bid-rigging]."</p>

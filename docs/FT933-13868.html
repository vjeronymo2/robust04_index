			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Germany disappoints THE Bundesbank was quick to inform the market yesterday that there would be no reduction in German interest rates for the time being, writes Stephanie Flanders. Although German Lombard and discount rates stay unchanged until the next council meeting on July 29, short rates were still able to fall, due to the extra liquidity provided in Wednesday's repo tender. One-month German money closed at around 7.24 per cent, down from Wednesday's 7.40 per cent. There was more movement in Danish money market rates, following the central bank's decision to increase its repo rate from 7.80 per cent to 9 per cent. This drew attention away from France, where the central bank held its inter-vention rate at 6.75 per cent and the repo rate at 7.75 per cent. Three-month French money market rates fell during the day, reflecting the general lull in the tension surrounding the franc, rather than a fundamental shift in market opinion. Meanwhile, sterling money markets were unsettled at the short end today by a lingering shortage which at one point took overnight rates as high as 7 1/2 per cent. The Bank of England had forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.3bn, which was later revised to Pounds 1.45bn, but it did not enter the market in the morning. Afternoon discount market operations later dispatched the shortfall, and dealers did not generally think that the Bank had been signalling a rate change. Overnight money fell back to 6 3/4 per cent. Other sterling money market rates were steady, in spite of the fifth consecutive fall in UK unemployment and a large reduction in unit wage costs. As one trader pointed out, the unemployment data would have pleased the financial markets either way. 'It was a win-win situation,' he said. 'The promising figures mean that Britain is headed for precisely the kind of recov-ery that the markets would like to see, but weak fig-ures would have signalled an early rate cut, which is also desirable.' Overall, it was felt that the figures conveyed little new information, and this was reflected in the trading in sterling futures. The September contract declined 4 basis points to finish at 94.18, while the December contract was down slightly less to a close of 94.43.</p>

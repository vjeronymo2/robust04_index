			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Sainsbury muscles in - Appetisers More evidence, if it were needed, of supermarket power comes this week from J. Sainsbury which is muscling in on the specialist cookery equipment and delicatessen trade with new product ranges at keen prices. Its new cookshops will sell everything from meat thermometers (Pounds 7.99) and souffle dishes (6in Pounds 7.95) to saucepans (from Pounds 29.95) and steamers (Pounds 19.95). Kitchen equipment names include Le Creuset saucepans, Emile Henry ovenware and Apilco white porcelain. Sainsbury is selling its own range of textiles including aprons, tea towels and oven gloves. Brochures giving the product range are available in the cookshops which have opened in 11 stores, mostly in and around London. There are plans for further expansion in the new year. In its Special Selection foodstuffs range selected stores will be stocking goods including: chilli and garlic olive oil (350 ml, Pounds 6.50), truffle oil (250ml, Pounds 6.75), aged balsamic vinegar (Pounds 14.95), Cipriani pasta (egg tagliolini is delicious at Pounds 2.50 for 250 grams), carnaroli rice (500g, Pounds 1.50), and dried fruits ranging from blueberries (125g, Pounds 2.45) to Medjool dates (125g, Pounds 2.75). If Sainsbury has found the right combination of price and quality your friendly, corner shop deli has serious cause for concern. Visitors to the Geffrye Museum in east London from December 8-10 will be able to sample wartime food treats at a Christmas party set in the 1940s. The museum, which specialises in the history of the English domestic interior, welcomes guests with mulled wine and, after a candlelit tour of the period rooms, invites them to join in a celebration set in the final months of the second world war. Period morsels will include carrot cookies, potato floddies, prune roly (sic) and sticky gingerbread. Tickets (Pounds 23, in advance only) from The Geffrye Museum, Kingsland Road, London E2.

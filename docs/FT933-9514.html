			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Commission holds line on Emu THE European Commission remains adamant. Despite siren calls from London and other Euro-sceptical quarters, EC officials insist there will no fundamental shift in strategy in response to the de facto suspension of the exchange rate mechanism. Mr Jacques Delors made clear during last Friday's special meeting of the European Commission that the EC must 'tough out' the latest crisis - mainly by using the tools offered by the Maastricht treaty for reinforcing economic and monetary co-operation within the Community. The Commission president is also reported to be pinning some hope on a Franco-German political initiative before the EC summit in Brussels in December. This would serve to show the rest of the Community that the Franco-German alliance remains in good working order, but it would also demonstrate that European monetary union remains on track. Recent comment in the British and US press about a permanent rift between the French and Germans in the run-up to the ERM crisis is dismissed inside the Commission as 'wishful thinking'. The official view is that Franco-German differences were not so serious as to overwhelm the European monetary system. 'The structures remain, even if (some of) the rules have changed,' said one official. Mr Delors recognises, however, that the ERM crisis has created a vacuum in monetary co-operation. This explains the importance which he attaches to two separate reports which the Commission will publish before next January 1, starting-point for Emu's second stage. The first report will focus on the progress which the 12 member states have made on economic and monetary convergence; the second will set out the main political and economic guidelines for the Community, to be adopted by a qualified majority vote of the Twelve. According to EC monetary officials, both these reports should be used to define the EC's future route to Emu as set out in Maastricht. The British proposal to revive the 'hard Ecu' is likely to get short shrift in Brussels. One option to convince the financial markets that the Community is serious about monetary union would be to narrow the ERM's newly widened fluctuation bands. These were fixed at 15 per cent nine days ago to halt speculation against the franc and weaker ERM currencies; but EC officials note with satisfaction that Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark are all seeking to return to their 'narrow bands' rather than rushing towards lower interest rates. Another favoured option is to strike a deal on the location of the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of the European central bank, which would supervise a putative single EC currency. Such a bargain would also include a 'big name' to run the EMI, most likely a current EC central bank governor, but possibly an outsider. The policy is characteristic of Mr Delors, a man who believes that a little pain is often necessary for true salvation. It is also reminiscent of a certain former British prime minister who declared, with similar conviction, that 'there is no alternative'.</p>

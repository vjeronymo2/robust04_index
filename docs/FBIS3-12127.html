			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa with an </F> unidentified correspondent in Cairo on 26 February--recorded]    [Text] [Musa] It is an inexcusable criminal act. It is the  occupying authority's responsibility to protect the citizens  under occupation as provided by the Geneva Conventions,  particularly the Fourth Convention, and international law.  Consequently its responsibility is clear in this case and  cannot be shirked.    [Correspondent] We have already denounced the incident. Yet,  considering its gravity, are practical steps being taken?    [Musa] Discussions are underway, no, not discussions.  Contacts and consultations are underway in New York in  connection with the adoption of a resolution. We believe that  the UN Security Council should adopt a resolution, not a mere  statement. Some parties want only a statement. We want the  Security Council to meet and issue a resolution. The  instructions that we sent to New York spell this out. This is  our position and I clarified this to U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher when I telephoned him a short time ago to  discuss the affair. What is important is that the Security  Council should adopt a clear resolution on the matter. Second,  the Palestinian citizens' security must be protected versus this  criminality, this insanity, that the settlers and extremists  show in the occupied territories, for example the criminal Kakh  movement. Protecting the Palestinians is very important; this is  the number one priority to prevent a recurrence of such  incidents. The ongoing negotiations are supposed to enable us  to achieve Palestinian self- determination, establish  Palestinian autonomy, move from square one to more advanced  positions, and reach a solution to the Palestinian problem. We  cannot think that it is a solution to suspend the negotiations.  We act as if we harm Israel when we do this. No, we must adopt  such measures that will benefit us, including first protecting  the Palestinians in the occupied territories and second adopting  measures that will take us closer to a solution.    [Correspondent] Does this incident, or rather catastrophe,  in  the Ibrahimi Mosque negatively influence the peace process?    [Musa] This incident is undoubtedly bound to influence the  peace process negatively. Its recurrence might kill the process  entirely.    [Correspondent] Whom has Egypt's contacted so far?    [Musa] It has contacted everyone. Yesterday I issued a  statement and the president telephoned Yasir 'Arafat and  received a message from Clinton and a telephone call from Rabin.  Christopher called me on the telephone yesterday and I called  him today about this issue. In addition, we have contacted our  delegation to the United Nations in connection with the Security  Council meeting.    [Correspondent] Minister, will this incident make the  Palestinians demand a review of the status of the settlements in  Gaza and Jericho?    [Musa] The presence of the settlements and settlers in this  way clearly causes grievous harm.    [Correspondent] They are time bombs.    [Musa] It is evident that grievous harm is being caused by  the settlements and settlers to the peace operation and the  Palestinian citizens' security. Our position remains clear on  this: The settlement policy is an erroneous one that  contradicts international law. These settlers, particularly the  extremists such as the Kakh members, must be first disarmed and  then prevented from harassing the Palestinians.</p>

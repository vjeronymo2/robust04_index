			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: American Cyanamid turns in Dollars 166m loss AMERICAN Cyanamid, the US bioscience group, suffered a pre-tax loss of Dollars 166m for the second quarter, compared with pre-tax profits for the same period last year of Dollars 228m. The loss was the result of an exceptional charge of Dollars 378m for the acquisition of a 53 per cent stake in Immunex Corporation, the pharmaceuticals company that specialises in cancer treatments. The loss per share was Dollars 2.54, compared with earnings of Dollars 1.62 in the second quarter last year. Sales increased 2 per cent from Dollars 1.48bn to Dollars 1.51bn for the quarter. This was in spite of the strength of the dollar against European currencies, which reduced sales by about 2 per cent. Turnover of the healthcare division, which includes its pharmaceuticals subsidiary Lederle, fell during the second quarter. Although sales of vaccines increased, sales of consumer health products fell because of the strong dollar and lower sales of Prostep, the transdermal patch used to help stop people smoking. Worldwide sales of the agricultural group rose during the second quarter compared with last year, mainly because of increased sales of crop protection products. Pursuit and Scepter, two herbicides for soyabeans, did particularly well. American Cyanamid intends to acquire Shell's crop protection business.</p>

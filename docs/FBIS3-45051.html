			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Hsu Yun-teng (1776 0061 7506): "People's Bank of China </F> Specially Permits Continued Circulation of Hong Kong Currency in  Shenzhen and Zhuhai"]    [Text] When interviewed by this reporter by telephone  yesterday, an authoritative senior official of the People's Bank  of China [PBOC] pointed out: A compromise has been made between  the group of officials who advocate banning the circulation of  Hong Kong currency in Shenzhen and Zhuhai and another group of  officials who advocate allowing its circulation there. The two  groups have agreed that "for a period of time to come, the PBOC  will specially allow Hong Kong currency to circulate and be used  in the areas of Shenzhen and Zhuhai."    As for how many months or years that "period of time to  come"  means, he said: There is no specific timetable, which may be a  very short period, or a very long one.    He commented further, saying: The Bank of China Hong Kong  Branch will soon participate in the issuance of Hong Kong  currency. After Hong Kong is returned to Mainland China in  1997, Hong Kong currency will not be treated as foreign  currency. This does not conflict with the existing prohibition.    He anticipated that Hong Kong currency will probably be  circulated and used in Shenzhen and Zhuhai for a considerably  long time in order to facilitate the operations of people and  enterprises there.    He said: "In fact, it is unfeasible to ban the circulation  of Hong Kong currency in Shenzhen and Zhuhai. Such being the  case, it is unnecessary to insist on banning the currency there."    Qin Chijiang, a director of the Financial Research Institute  of the PBOC, also confirmed the correctness of the above remarks  and the consensus reached within the PBOC.    The news gives evidence to an exclusive report by this  newspaper, which revealed a few days ago that the Shenzhen  Branch of the PBOC had insisted that such a ban was unfeasible,  and that it would "omit" concrete measures for carrying out the  ban in its report for submission to its Beijing head office.    In addition, this newspaper also exclusively disclosed that  Yin Jieyan, director of the State Administration of Exchange  Control, had secretly visited Shenzhen a couple of days ago,  and, after his return to Beijing, tried to persuade policymakers  at the PBOC not to forcibly ban the circulation of Hong Kong  currency in the areas of Shenzhen and Zhuhai.</p>

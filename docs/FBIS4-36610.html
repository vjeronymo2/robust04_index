			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Closeup" column by Salamah Ahmad Salamah: "Israel's Long </F> Arm"]    [Text] Those who think that Israel's long arm of aggression  will not seek to attain its goals under peace are receiving  indications to the contrary that what Israel fails to attain by  tricks it, will try to attain through terrorism and aggression.  The latest Israeli aerial attack on south Lebanon, which killed  45 civilians as they slept, is proof that Israel at peace is not  much different from Israel at war. It was Israel that abducted  Lebanese leader Mustafa al-Dirani on the pretext of  interrogating him to learn the fate of an Israeli pilot who was  kidnapped in 1986. When some Hizballah members retaliated with  certain trivial and heedless operations, not against the Israeli  forces but against Israel's agents in the security strip  established by Israel in south Lebanon, Israel used these  incidents as a pretext to launch a bestial operation against  what it called Hizballah bases in south Lebanon.    This barbaric aggressive behavior was not condemned by the  United States. The aircraft that launched the aggression are  U.S.-made. There are also indications that the United States did  not oppose the abduction operation to get Lebanese Shiite leader  Mustafa al-Dirani. U.S. newspapers published reports that the  CIA requested that he be handed over secretly to interrogate him  to obtain information about the death of a U.S. hostage in  1989. This means that the United States, which fights  terrorism, does not mind taking part in it if there are some  good results.    The Israeli aggression against Lebanon makes one believe  that  the U.S. peace efforts to resume the negotiations between Syria  and Israel have reached a deadlock because of lack of desire on  the part of the Rabin government to enter serious negotiations  to achieve a total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan. For no  sooner had Christopher returned to Washington and declared that  he would not return to the region late in June as scheduled to  resume his efforts, than Israel found that the atmosphere was  ripe to deal several strikes here and there. Rabin seems to  want to regain some respect in opposition rightist circles and  face the wrath of the settlers whose fierceness was curtailed by  certain measures taken within the framework of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement.    Thus, the "peace efforts" seem like a successful public  relations campaign in favor of Israel, enabling it to continue  its occupation of Syrian and Lebanese territories and exhausting  Arab water, as a recent UN report noted, and obtaining arms from  the United States and the West in return for that fragile  agreement with the Palestinians.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Togo peace talks break down Talks aimed at rescuing the west African state of Togo from bloodshed and crisis broke down yesterday and were suspended indefinitely, French Co-operation Minister Marcel Debarge said, Reuter reports from Colmar. He said representatives of hardline President Gnassingbe Eyadema left Colmar in eastern France during the night, after talks with the country's pro-democracy movement collapsed. The Franco-German-sponsored meeting had brought together the country's five leading political groups. Togo's foreign minister, Mr Ouattara Natchaba, had earlier accused France of threatening military intervention, and said the army should be given a say if Togo's problems were to be solved.</p>

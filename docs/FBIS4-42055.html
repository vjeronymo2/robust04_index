			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The information center reporting on the  all-round settlement of the Abkhazian conflict reports from  Zugdidi that Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia and Jaba  Ioseliani, chairman of the interim Committee for Emergency  Situations, arrived in Zugdidi today. [passage omitted]    A meeting took place with representatives of the command  staff of the peacekeeping forces. A number of important issues  were discussed. It was pointed out that the motor bridge over  the Inguri River is practically restored. Checkpoints were  established at both ends of the bridge and the important  location is under complete control of the peacekeeping forces.    The Enguri hydroelectric power station and its security and  operation were seriously considered. The station as well as  other important objects are guarded by units of peacekeeping  forces stationed in the area. Thus, the Abkhaz side has no  formal reasons to limit power supplies. A common opinion was  voiced on ways to prevent the Abkhaz side from resorting to such  actions. This is expected to happen in the near future.    As for security in the zone, the representatives of the  peacekeeping forces said that the number of observation points  and checkpoints established there ensures security. It was also  mentioned that there is a greater number of checkpoints in Gali  Rayon.    The Georgian side voiced several considerations, namely, the  failure to make an official decision on the participation of all  sides in manning the checkpoints. Because of the Abkhazian  side's opposition, representatives of the Georgian side have not  been involved in the operation of the Sukhumi territorial  headquarters of peacekeeping forces.

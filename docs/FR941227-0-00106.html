If the Secretary makes any such determination, however, further assurances may be required to be submitted by the grantee as the Secretary may deem warranted or necessary to find the grantee's certification satisfactory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grant agreement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The grant will be made by means of a grant agreement executed by both HUD and the grantee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conditional grant. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary may make a conditional grant in which case the obligation and use of grant funds for activities may be restricted. Conditional grants may be made where there is substantial evidence that there has been, or there will be, a failure to meet the performance requirements or criteria described in subpart O of this part. In such case, the conditional grant will be made by means of a grant agreement, executed by HUD, which includes the terms of the condition specifying the reason for the conditional grant, the actions necessary to remove the condition and the deadline for taking those actions. The grantee shall execute and return such an agreement to HUD within 60 days of the date of its transmittal. Failure of the grantee to execute and return the grant agreement within 60 days may be deemed by HUD to constitute rejection of the grant by the grantee and shall be cause for HUD to determine that the funds provided in the grant agreement are available for reallocation in accordance with section 106(c) of the Act. Failure to satisfy the condition may result in a reduction in the grant amount pursuant to &sect;570.911. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2506&hyph;0060) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;570.430 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Hawaii program operation requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limitation on planning and administrative costs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For grants made with allocations prior to FY 1995, no more than 20 percent of the sum of the grant plus program income received during the grant period shall be expended for planning and program administrative costs. For grants received from allocations in FY 1995 and thereafter, a grantee will be considered to be in conformance with the requirements of &sect;570.200(g) if expenditures for planning and administration during the most recently completed program year do not exceed 20 percent of the sum of the grant made for that program year and the program income received from post FY 1994 grants during that program year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Performance and evaluation reports. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Grantees will follow the requirements of &sect;570.507(a) for entitlement grant recipients for all grants received in FY 1995 and thereafter. Grantees will continue following the requirements of &sect;570.507(a) for HUD-administered small cities grants for grants received prior to FY 1995 until those grants are closed out. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grant closeouts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Grants received prior to FY 1995 shall be closed out in accordance with the procedures in &sect;570.509. Grants received in FY 1995 and thereafter shall not be closed out individually. A grantee's entire program shall be closed upon program completion if a grantee ceases its participation in the Small Cities Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public Services. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Starting with the FY 1996 grant, grantees may follow the provisions of &sect;570.201(e)(1) that refer to entitlement grantees, allowing grantees to use 15 percent of the program income received in the previous program year in addition to 15 percent of the grant amount for public services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compliance with the primary objective. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Starting with the FY 1995 grant, grantees may select a time period of one, two or three program years in which to meet the requirement that not less than 70 percent of the aggregate of CDBG fund expenditures be for activities benefitting low- and moderate-income persons. Grants made from allocations prior to FY 1995 will be considered individually for meeting the primary objective, and expenditures for grants from pre FY 1995 allocations made during and after FY 1995 will not be considered in determining whether the primary objective has been met for post 1994 allocations. If the State of Hawaii decides to administer the Community Development Block Grant Program for non-entitled units of general local government in Hawaii, the State will be bound by the time period for meeting the primary objective that was chosen by each non-entitled grantee within the State until those time periods have expired. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

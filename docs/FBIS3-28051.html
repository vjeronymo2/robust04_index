The article quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as  saying:    "As the theses on the socialist rural question gives a  comprehensive exposition of how to bring the advantages of the  socialist rural economic system into full play, we can bring  them into full play when we go along the road indicated by the  theses."    It goes on:    The past 30 years of carrying through the theses on the  socialist rural question published by the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song in February 1964 has powerfully proved that the  theses is, indeed, a great program to successfully accomplish  the socialist rural construction as well as the cause of  socialism as a whole.    The rural theses is a program of the socialist rural  construction to defend socialism and bring its advantages into  full play by actively encouraging and developing collectivism in  the rural economy.    Collectivism is the life and soul of socialism.    The rural theses of the great leader is a program of the  socialist rural construction to strengthen and develop socialist  collectivism. It indicates the way of arming the farmers with  the collectivist idea and high scientific and cultural  knowledge, industrializing and modernizing agriculture,  overcoming immaturity of cooperative economy in all aspects of  ownership and management and raising it up to the level of the  state-run economy, the highest stage of development of the  socialist economy.    It is also a revolutionary program of socialist rural  construction to make a victorious advance not only of the rural  economy but also of the socialist cause by strengthening the  internal force of socialism.    The validity and greatness of the rural theses lie in  strengthening the guidance of the party and the state over the  countryside in every way, patterning the farmers on the  working-class and firmly preparing them to be resolute  supporters and defenders of socialism, reliable and competent  builders of the socialist rural community.    The principle and tasks of the rural theses including the  idea of pushing ahead with the three revolutions, ideological,  technical and cultural, and strengthening the guidance of the  party and the state over the countryside make it possible to  build up our countryside as an invincible fortress of socialism  by creditably carrying on the socialist rural construction and,  at the same time, strengthening the motive force of revolution  in the countryside.    The socialist rural theses is also a great program of the  socialist rural construction to help the entire agricultural  working people lead a worthy and happy life as full-fledged  masters of the countryside.    It leads the farmers to extricate themselves from the old  shackles of all ideological, technical and cultural fields, hold  the position of the full-fledged masters of the countryside and  glorify the dignity and honor of the masters.    There can neither be hotbed of exploitation nor be a gap  between the rich and the poor in our countryside advancing along  the road of the rural theses.</p>

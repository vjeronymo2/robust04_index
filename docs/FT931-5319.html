			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Letter: Tax avoidance is for all - not just Mr/Ms Average Sir, Since when has the right to take all possible legal steps to minimise his or her tax bill been restricted to the AVERAGE British citizen as stated in your leader ('John Birt Inc', March 2)? Lord Tomlin's dictum, which laid down the accepted standard for fair taxation, actually read as follows: 'EVERY man is entitled if he can to arrange his affairs so that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be.' Are you suggesting that some tribunal be empowered to decide which citizen is to be classified as 'average' for these or maybe other applications of the law? Alternatively, you no doubt think it reasonable that such judgmental power may rest with the members of that fair-minded institution, the press, who would of course never stoop to arrange their affairs so as to pay the least tax legally possible. Martin B Kershen, Waverley, 587 Watford Way, London NW7 3JG</p>

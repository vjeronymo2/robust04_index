			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the second day of his visit to Vietnam, Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai will today witness the signing of four  contracts for joint ventures considered the most substantive  ever concluded between Thai and Vietnamese businessmen.  Sathaphon Kawitanon, the secretary-general of the Board of  Investment [BoI], said the ceremony will be held before the  seminar on investment in Vietnam co-organised by the State  Committee for Cooperation and Investment and the BoI.    The four projects comprise:    -- the joint investment to establish the Siam-Vina Bank  between Thailand's Siam Commercial Bank, the Charoen Phokhaphan  Group and the Vietnam Bank of Agriculture    -- joint cooperation in developing an industrial estate  between the Bang Pakong Industrial Park and Sonadezi Bien Hoa;    -- a joint investment project worth 400 million baht  involving mining by the U-Surint Industrial Group with  Vietnamese state-run authority partners, and    -- a contract between Thailand's Advance Paint and  Chemical Co and Vietnam's Ngan Hua Economic and Engineering  Consultants and Dong Tam.    Mr Sathaphon, who led a group of 70 prominent Thai  businessmen joining the Chuan delegation, said the visit would  boost confidence in investment here and remind businessmen to  take genuine action for investment on a long-term basis. He said  the failure of previous visits by groups of businessmen several  years ago was because of improper investment regulations on the  Vietnamese side. The situation had now changed, especially  Hanoi's investment rules and regulations, which would help  induce more investment from overseas. "I don't think it is too  late for Thai businessmen to invest in Vietnam. We are not a  very rich country, so we have to be careful where we put our  money. We have to take time surveying places where there is  high potential.    Mr Chuan yesterday witnessed two agreement signing  ceremonies, on tourism cooperation between the two countries and  a joint business council between the Federation of Thai  Industries and Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry.    PM's Office Minister Sawit Phothiwihok said cooperation in  tourism would cover the liberalisation of air territories for  Vietnamese airlines to fly over Thailand to other destinations  worldwide. Cooperation on air traffic control between the two  countries would be processed under the agreement.    Consultation on further investment in tourism-related  businesses including hotels and tourist companies, would take  place later.    Meanwhile, Vietnam's request for a loan of US$100 million  from Thailand to develop its infrastructure has been agreed in  principle by the Finance Ministry, according to Wichit Suphinit,  the governor of the Bank of Thailand. Mr Wichit revealed after a  meeting with Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin yesterday that  the Hanoi Government had submitted a letter asking for a  $100-million loan from the Thai Government through the Bank of  Thailand. The central bank approved the request and agreed to  find the funds as soon as possible because the loan was  indispensable for the development of the country, he said. The  loan will be a syndicated one since Thailand does not have  adequate funds allocated for the purpose. The Krung Thai Bank  and the Export-Import Bank of Thailand were asked to coordinate  with local and foreign banks to mobilise the funds. "The  interest rate has not been discussed as Hanoi has yet to send a  withdrawal plan to the central bank and terms and conditions  must be agreed upon among syndicated banks. But the rate will  be fixed as is the normal practice for syndicated loans," said  Mr Wichit.    A Thai working group is already present in Vietnam. It will  negotiate at a certain level with the Hanoi Government prior to  Mr Wichit's arrival. The negotiations will be finalised in  Chiang Mai next Friday. Mr Wichit added that after discussing  the issue with Krung Thai Bank president Sirin Nimmanhemin --  the coordinator of the loan -- that proceedings for implementing  the loan would go ahead as soon as possible. Coordination among  syndicated banks will be concluded by next Wednesday and the  contract is expected to be signed by Friday. The loan marks one  of the most important syndicated loans between Thailand and  Vietnam. It would indirectly serve as an instrument to promote  Thai investment in Vietnam, he added. Mr Wichit said the loan  was quite similar to the Indochina Fund, except for certain  terms and conditions. The funds would be injected into  infrastructure projects or re-lent to the private sector for the  same purpose. The Indochina Fund lends directly to each  project, with the feasibility and validity of each project  evaluated by a special unit.    The Bank of Thailand is also considering setting up such a  unit to support the continued and quickly expanding investments  in the country, he said. Should Thailand ignore the opportunity,  it will fail to benefit from the current favourable liquidity  situation, part of which will come from foreign funds using  Thailand as a base to distribute their capital to Indochina.  Finance Minister Tharin said he had discussed with M.R.  Pridiyathon Thewakun, the president of the Export-Import Bank,  seeking banks to join the syndicated loan. He said the loan  would be long-term and the rate would not be a major concern as  Vietnam was mobilising funds to develop itself. The loan would  serve as an index for Thai banks lending to Indochinese  countries, including foreign banks operating in Thailand, said  Mr Tharin.    "The loan is endorsed by the credit of the Hanoi Government.  Therefore, the types and specifications of projects will not be  required. The Vietnam Government has full authority to decide  which projects will get the money," said Mr Tharin.</p>

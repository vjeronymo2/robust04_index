			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PARIS PAPER STRIKE TURNS VIOLENT  </P> <P> A strike that has virtually paralyzed the distribution of newspapers in Paris  for a week turned violent today when pickets clashed with non-strikers.  </P> <P> The Parisian Newspaper Distributors said four non-strikers were injured when  strikers attacked them with iron bars as the workers packed newspapers into  delivery trucks.  </P> <P> Talks between newspaper owners and strikers demanding a pay increase were due  to begin this afternoon as newspapers said their existence was being threatened  by the week-old strike.  </P> <P> The dispute has kept almost all Parisian newspapers, including the Paris-based  International Herald Tribune, off the streets. Almost all French newspapers are  sold on the streets, with very few home delivered.  </P></p>

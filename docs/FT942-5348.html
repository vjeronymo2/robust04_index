			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Travel: Devon - good waves, man These guys tell me we are driving after high waves. I am the green one here, the novice lured by the prospect of 'pure pleasure.' We stop at Welcome Cove and it is a most unwelcome place. There is rain, grey sky and only a bit of light left in the July evening. Thin lines of black coral run down the beach and disappear into the sea. Beyond a steep cliff is a barren landscape of shapely curves. Legend says that about 100 years ago farmers used to gut their sheep on those hills to placate the devil. Apparently, they blamed evil spirits for killing off their flocks. But the guys I am with are not superstitious. They are waxing their boards in glee - waxing makes the board less slippery - and telling me we are in luck. They reckon these are fine waves. Soon, I am up to my chest and out of control in sea a murky shade of green, holding the surf board tight. A seal pops up and bobs off. Another high wave crashes over my head, sweeping me closer to those dark claws. What am I doing here? There are other places to surf in Devon. Black figures in wet suits hunched over boards like jackdaws waiting for waves are a common sight along the fractured north Devon coast at any time of the year. They have been there since the 1960s, when Australian lifeguards first drifted over with their boards. Locals say that some of the best surf in the world is at Croyde Bay, where waves roll up a sandy slope and bounce off an oyster bed. But there were no waves to speak of there that day. At the bar in the Thatched Barn Inn it was decided to go and look for some. Hence the road trip. Pity. Croyde is a laid back village refreshingly free of gloss. It is part of a chunk of land between Barnstaple and Ilfracoombe that juts into the sea like a hooked nose. It is just west of Exmoor national park, and is an unfashionable but friendly landing place for Atlantic swells and travellers to south-west England seeking a daring alternative to cream teas. More than a few visitors to Devon find their way there each year, but most pass it by. The lure of the theme-parked, congested south is apparently too much to resist. In Croyde, a place of contrasts, surfers hang out in narrow high-banked lanes. White cottages with thatched roofs stand in well-kept gardens. In the Thatched Barn, an inexpensive menu includes pheasant pie and fresh Lundy plaice. A stroll away is Croyde Bay and a car park where surfers often camp. Those black figures you see in wet suits waiting for the next wave are not all lithe young men. There is a core of committed surfers well into their 50s who dare the waves. I tracked down one of them eating a ham sandwich in his garage. 'Pure pleasure, that's what I call it,' Alan told me. His garage, where he crafts foam and polystyrene into surf boards which he sells, is just down the road from Braunton, an inland village a few miles south of Croyde. A wizened man, Alan is not quite bald. He is an agile 58-year-old who surfs whenever there is a wave. Often he is out at 4am. 'Surfing is much more than a sport; it determines how you live,' he said. 'I'm addicted to the rush you get from the energy of the wave. But it's impossible to describe. You've got to try it.' I was told about a local barrister: a man who doesn't want to miss chances. In court, he wears a wet suit beneath his gown. Other passionate surfers include Surfers Against Sewage, a group leading calls for a clean-up of British waters. Occasionally, their members surf wearing gas masks. As well as fish, they reckon, you could catch ear infections or hepatitis. You might even die. I suppose it was cavalier of me to try to learn to surf at Welcome. These were not beginners' conditions. I caught a cold but no waves. At least I got out alive. Equipment: wet suits are essential for warmth even in the height of summer. Beginners should use long boards, which are easier to balance on. Boards and wet suits can be hired for around Pounds 20 per day. More information from British Surfing Association, tel: 0736-60250.

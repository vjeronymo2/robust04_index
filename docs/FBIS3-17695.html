Speaking in parliament Tuesday, he said that women and  children have been evacuated from the canyon. However, the  majority of the population do not want to leave their homes.  This is another indication that the population in the Kodori  canyon needs help.    Shevardnadze also said that on Monday on the line of  confrontation between the Georgian and Abkhazian forces near the  Inguri River there were local clashes, but on Tuesday morning  the situation was calm.    Shevardnadze noted the intensification of Russia's mediatory  efforts and also talked about Georgia's preparedness for talks  for a peaceful settlement of the conflict.    Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Georgian Defense Ministry  said  Tuesday that fierce fighting continues in the Kodori canyon near  the village of Zemo Lata. Abkhazian units are shelling Georgian  positions. About a dozen Abkhazian helicopters airlifted  additional manpower and armaments from Sukhumi.    The spokesman said that in the early hours of March 29 there  were no positional changes in the zone of fighting. As many as  five Georgian were killed and four wounded. According to the  spokesman, Abkhazian casualties totalled sixty.    Deputy chairman of the Tbilisi-based pro-Georgian Council of  Ministers of Abkhazia, Akaky Gasviani, confirmed to Interfax  that the advancement of the Abkhazian formations and  maercenaries towards the Kodori canyon had been stopped by the  morning of March 28. Now the line of confrontation passes near  the village of Verkhnyaya Lata, he said.    Gasviani said that the chairman of the temporary committee  for the state of emergency Djaba Ioseliani visited the Georgian  positions Monday.    So far Interfax does not have an Abkhazian version of what  happened in the Kodori canyon.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-BANKER SENTENCED IN CREDIT-DATA SCAM  </P> <P> A former Tustin bank president was placed on a three-year probation Wednesday  for providing five Las Vegas casinos with phony credit information that was  used to set up credit lines for several alleged organized crime figures.  </P> <P> Roger McGinnis, 52, of Orange was sentenced to 300 hours of community service  by U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> McGinnis, a former president of Far Western Bank, had faced a maximum five-year  prison term and a $10,000 fine after he pleaded guilty in November to one count  of conspiracy.  </P> <P> In deciding on the probation sentence, Wilson said McGinnis had suffered enough  from the stigma of a felony conviction, adding that he didn't want to ruin the  former executive's chances of employment.  </P> <P> Based on the information provided by McGinnis, the casinos loaned thousands of  dollars to John DeMattia and Morton Goodman. The Justice Department has linked  the two to a Los Angeles organized crime family.  </P> <P> The casinos were Binion's Horseshoe, the Las Vegas Hilton, the MGM Grand Hotel  and Casino, the Sands Hotel and Casino and the Desert Inn and Country Club.  </P></p>

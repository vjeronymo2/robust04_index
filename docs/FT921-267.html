			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: 'Pate' takes battle to France BUOYED by a rise in opinion poll support for the Liberal Democrats, Mr Paddy Ashdown fled floating voters at home for France yesterday to seal un photo-opportunite exceptionnel. Keen to boost his reputation as un homme actif et un bon Europeen, he addressed an imported audience in Boulogne on Labour and Conservative failure to set Europe as an election issue. Monsieur Pate Ashdown - as translated by Mr Jean Gol, president of the Belgian Liberal party - boasted, in convincing French, of how he was the first chef de parti opposition to take his election campaign out of the UK. But the menu of Eurobabble and speech was for home consumption. 'We should campaign hard to see that the central bank comes to London, Europe's foremost financial centre. It is absurd for Britain to hold back and to see greater integration as a threat.' In the ensuing Euro-Liberal love-in, Mr Yves Galland, leader of the Liberal Democrat and Reform Group of the European parliament, compared Pate Ashdown's landing with the arrival of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders' regiment in defence of Belgium in 1914. 'Britain needs her Liberal Democrats if she is to catch quickly, and without loss, the European train leaving from Maastricht,' he said. Mr Willy de Clercq, president of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Parties, poured on the creme. 'You are not known as 'action man' for nothing,' he said. Mr Ashdown headed from the cheering audience, across the road, for a three-course lunch at Boulogne's La Matelote Restaurant, avec des vins blanc, rouge et rose for the coach of journalists, then returned, via high-speed catamaran, to Dover. He had been abroad for less than four hours. 'It has been serious politics and a good lunch,' said a party official. Back on the humdrum UK campaign trail, Mr Ashdown's visit to Rochdale and Manchester today will lack a certain je ne sais quoi. Earlier, Mr Ashdown insisted that any minority government would have to agree to introduce legislation authorising proportional representation in the first session of the new parliament to secure Liberal Democrat support, Ivor Owen writes. He reaffirmed that in the event of a hung parliament Liberal Democrat MPs would be prepared to defeat the government rather than permit a re-run of 1974, when Mr Harold Wilson's minority administration clung to office for just over six months before securing a minuscule overall majority in a second general election. Interviewed by David Frost on TV-am, Mr Ashdown emphasised the encouraging message from the opinion polls that support for the Liberal Democrats was growing with 'not much sign' of it being squeezed by the two main parties. He acknowledged that if unable to secure an overall majority both Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, were likely to seek to 'ignore the judgment of the ballot box' and try to go it alone.</p>

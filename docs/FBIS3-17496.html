Azerbaijan makes a protest due to illegal arrival of  Deputy of the Russian Duma, Nikolay Lysenko, in Khankendi  [Stepanakert] and his statements which are aimed against  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. "Such  statements of Russian Deputy can spoil Azerbaijani-Russian  relations", says the document.    The leader of the Russian National-Republican Party, Nikolai  Lysenko, said on March 18 in Yerevan that "Russia must recognize  Nagorno-Karabakh republic". He added that "Nagorno-Karabakh has  the right to exist as a sovereign republic. Azerbaijan's  aggression against Karabakh would have been impossible if Turkey  did not back it. Russia, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh have  common geostrategic interests".</p>

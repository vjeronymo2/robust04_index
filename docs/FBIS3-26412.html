When President Clinton submitted the federal budget plan for  fiscal 1995 to Congress today, the cuts in many of its spending  programs will be the sharpest ever.    The 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars plan "is to prioritize  programs, decide what we don't need and focus investments in the  areas we think are important for the country," said Budget  Director Leon Panetta.    In the plan, the Clinton administration proposed to cut  spending from more than 300 federal programs, eliminate 115  minor programs to save 3.25 billion dollars, and cut federal  workforce by over 100,000.    The budget gave seven of the 14 cabinet departments less  money to spend while investing more on high-tech, job creation,  children education, worker training, crime fighting and  protection of environment.    Inputs in areas like technology, for example, will be up  about 40 percent, spending for primary schools will be slightly  more. Some 2.7 billion dollars with regards to fighting crime  are also added.    Congress republicans complained that there were only some  minor changes in the new budget as compared with that of Former  President George Bush. "But I still think it had teeth in it,"  said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole.    "I think republicans ought to help the President in  eliminating some of these programs," Dole said on Sunday [6  February], although he, like other republican lawmakers, foresaw  that some massaging will take place.    Observers predicted a lot of fire around the budget, which  did not include, for example, the full effects of Clinton's two  major proposals: welfare and health care reform, making it an  incomplete presentation of all added costs.    "Both health care and welfare reform have profound budgetary  and economic consequences," said Representative Alex Mcmillan, a  republican from North Carolina, who called the missing  "especially distressing."    The budget included tax increases on tobacco and business,  and proposed cuts in Medicaid and Medicare, instead of the costs  of some new entitlements and subsidies, observers noted.    "The budget is remarkable for what it's missing," Senate  Minority Leader Bob Dole said. He said he was worried that the  elimination of some programs might affect the low-income  Americans.    The budget is controversial in three major cuts: urban mass  transit subsidies, community development grants like public  housing for the elderly, and subsidies for the poor to heat  their homes, the last of which was protested in a letter signed  by 51 senators.    The three have become "non-negotiable items," said Kweisi  Mfume, a democratic representative from Maryland. He stressed  that "there are other things to look at" when cuts are  considered and compromises are made.    Explained Budget Director Leon Panetta, "We are pumping  money  on one end, and its not coming out the other end in terms of  constructing public housing."    According to the Congressional Budget Office, the deficit  will dip to 171 billion dollars this year and 166 billion  dollars in the next fiscal year, but it will rise to over 300 by  the year 2004.    "If we were not doing what we're doing, (the deficit) will  be  much higher," said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on Sunday.    Despite the efforts in deficit reduction, the total federal  spending will continue to rise over the past five years by about  23 percent, according to the bipartisan Congressional Budget  Office.</p>

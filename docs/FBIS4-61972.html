			<p>BFN     [Text] Activities by the present Kyrgyz Government in  certain spheres are practically a failure, the Kyrgyz  president's press service said in its statement circulated in  Bishkek today.    The statement underlined that improvement of the system of  taxation and establishment of the state budget was the main task  of any government. The statement emphasized that since the  state budget was not receiving taxes it could not pay wages to  physicians, teachers, artists, and scientists. This limits the  opportunities for the state in providing social security for  pensioners, students and other not well-off categories of the  population. However, the government continues to finance  unprofitable enterprises which cannot sell their production  freezing significant financial funds.    The unjustified decrees in the purchasing capacity of the  population hampers to sell products even if the actual demand  for it exists. This aggravates the crisis in the Kyrgyz society  and economy. The present situation lays the agreements with  international financial organizations like the IMF and the World  Bank open to possibility of a wreck in what concerns the  financing of the economic and social reforms. No preferential  financial resources could be attracted to the Republic under  such circumstances.    The statement also pointed out that the position and the  moves of the government were absolutely illogical within the  context of the aggravating economic and social situation. The  government, however, keeps deferring works on development of the  gold deposits with the participation of foreign investors for  mutual benefits. Primarily, this means the delay in joint  development of the Kumtor gold deposit with the participation of  the Canadian Cameco company.</p>

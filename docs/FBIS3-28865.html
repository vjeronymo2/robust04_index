Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says:    This is a sinister act trampling upon the sovereignty and  dignity of our Republic and a crude interference in our internal  affairs. And it is a deliberate act to block a peaceful solution  of the nuclear issue by complicating the situation on the Korean  peninsula.    The author of the commentary further says:    The DPRK is a special position today after temporarily  stopping the effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty.    At the DPRK-U.S. contacts last year it had agreed to receive  inspection necessary for the continuity of the safeguards of the  IAEA on its nuclear sites and discussed this matter with the  secretariat of the agency.    If the secretariat truly has the intention to peacefully  solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it must  renounce its unreasonable demand going beyond the scope of  inspection necessary for the continuity of safeguards.    No threat and blackmail can work on the Korean people.    The seditious quarters of the IAEA should look squarely at  the reality and behave themselves properly.</p>

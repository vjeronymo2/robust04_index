			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Collecting: Rarities in blue and white - Susan Moore samples the numerous wares of quality Chinese porcelain Chinese porcelain takes pride of place at the seasonal Oriental art shows in London this month. Even the British Museum presents highlights from the Meiyintang Collection, the first public display of one of the largest and finest private holdings of Chinese ceramics in the west. Amassed during the last 40 years, this continental collection is remarkable for the variety, quality and rarity of its pieces which range from Neolithic pottery and Han and Tang dynasty tomb figures and burial wares to Ming and Qing Imperial porcelains (June 9-September 9). Eskenazi has a no less sumptuous feast of market rarities in its exhibition of early blue and white (10 Clifford Street, W1, June 7-July 8). From their first large-scale manufacture in the 14th century, these luxurious white porcelains painted in underglaze cobalt blue have been highly prized in China and beyond. Perhaps no ceramic tradition has been more widely imitated or more enduringly popular. The Middle East appears to have been the destination of a number of these vessels. Forms are distinctly un-Chinese: there are Islamic emblems, even a Persian inscription proclaiming a piece the property of one Alamgir Shah. The star turn, discovered in Damascus 30 years ago, is a spectacular and densely decorated mid-14th century Yuan dynasty dish, 46cm wide. In the central medallion, reserved in white on a rich blue ground, are cranes and ducks in a lotus pond, well observed and full of life. Their liveliness is matched by the dish's surface: one of the delights of handling blue and white is the way in which the impurities in the cobalt produce a heaped and piled effect in the glaze and a varying intensity of blue. This unique piece is of museum quality and into a museum it may well go  - given that it was broken and repaired and even hair-line cracks are not tolerated by the new breed of avid Hong Kong collectors. The show's other tour de force is not technically blue and white at all. This large, deep Ming dynasty bowl of the Hongwu period (1368-98) is decorated with scrolling peonies in underglaze copper red, which firing has turned into the subtlest of pinks and greys. Dated 1340-1435, the 26 pieces bear Pounds 45,000-Pounds 400,000 price tags. At S. Marchant &amp; Son (120 Kensington Church Street, W8), the focus is on the great age of blanc de Chine - 1640-1710 - a much more particular taste. As this show demonstrates, however, the craftsmen of provincial Dehua gave their glossy white wares an astonishing variety of expression. At one extreme stands a graceful and superbly modelled Guanyin or goddess of mercy in flowing robes. Dating around 1640, and 38cm high, the figure bears the seal mark of the mysterious He Chaozong, the most illustrious name in Dehua porcelain. At the other, a whistle in the form of a European gentleman in a tricorn hat seated astride a comically grinning tiger. The whole group is only 4.7cm high. Prices Pounds 200-Pounds 30,000 (June 3-24). Early celadon porcelains from Korea, China and Japan are the delicate fare at Jehanne de Biolley Oriental Art (29 Conduit Street, W1, June 1-July 1). Prices Pounds 150-Pounds 20,000. Chinese, Korean and Japanese works of art are also at Spink's, 5-7 King Street, SW1, June 1-17. Notable here is a pair of white jade lotus-shaped drinking cups that unusually bear the mark of the Qianlong emperor, and an understated white porcelain moon flask from late Choson dynasty Korea. Prices Pounds 5,000-Pounds 150,000. The Oriental Art Gallery's wide- ranging exhibition includes Ming and Qing caladons, blanc de Chine and monochrome porcelains at 4 Davies Street, W1, June 7-24. Prices Pounds 950-Pounds 55,000, with most objects under Pounds 10,000. With characteristic theatrical flourish, Christian Deydier of Oriental Bronzes Ltd unveils one extraordinary item for one evening only. This is a pair of stylised gold tigers dated to 8th century BC China, their slender, elongated bodies decorated with cinnabar stripes and formed out of gold strips wrapped and pinned around a wooden core. Professor Han Wei, an authority on ancient Chinese gold, has suggested that the 45cm long tiger mounts flanked a burial pillow. Nothing quite like them is known in gold - nor any other gold artefact of comparable size and date. Deydier is asking around Pounds 1.5m. 96 Mount Street, W1. June 7, 5.30-8pm.</p>

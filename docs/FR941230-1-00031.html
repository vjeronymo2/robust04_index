Although the recipient need not permit persons other than the sponsor to use any license or other resulting technology, the price paid by the sponsor must be no less than the price that would be paid by any non-sponsoring party. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cooperative research agreements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A research agreement relating to a facility used pursuant to a joint industry-university cooperative research arrangement is described in this paragraph (d)(3) if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Multiple, unrelated sponsors agree to fund university-performed basic research; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The research to be performed and the manner in which it is to be performed (for example, selection of the personnel to perform the research) is determined by the university; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Title to any patent or other product incidentally resulting from the basic research lies exclusively with the university; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Sponsors are entitled to no more than a nonexclusive, royalty-free license to use the product of any of that research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basic research. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of this paragraph (d),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> basic research <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has the same meaning as under section 41(e)(7)(A) (that is, any original investigation for the advancement of scientific knowledge not having a specific commercial objective, except that this term does not include basic research conducted outside the United States or basic research in the social sciences, arts, or humanities). Basic research does not include applied or practical research, product development, or similar activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exception for general public use_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General public use_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Private business use does not include use as a member of the general public ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> general public use <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Use of a financed facility by nongovernmental persons in their trades or businesses is treated as general public use only if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The facility is intended for use by the general public; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The use by those nongovernmental persons is reasonably expected to be on the same basis as use by other members of the general public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Relation to other use. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Use of a financed facility by the general public does not prevent the proceeds from being used for a private business use because of other use under this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Intended for use by the general public. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Number of users. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A facility is not intended for use by the general public if less than 25 percent of the reasonably expected direct use of the facility is by persons that individually account for no more than 1 percent of the use of the facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Persons constituting the general public. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although the general public ordinarily includes natural persons not engaged in trades or businesses, the general public may consist entirely of a large number of nongovernmental persons engaged in different types of trades or businesses. The general public cannot consist predominately of a large number of nongovernmental persons engaged in the same type of trade or business. For example, an electric transmission line used by a large number of electric utilities is not used by the general public. See, however,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of paragraph (h) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Use on the same basis_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Use related to other facilities_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The use of a financed facility by a nongovernmental person is not on the same basis as use by the general public if the financed facility is functionally and integrally related to another facility that is used by that nongovernmental person (the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> primary facility <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and significant economic benefits with respect to the primary facility arise from the use of the related facility that are not available to the general public. If more than 75 percent of the use of the related facility is by the general public and not use in connection with the primary facility, the benefits to the primary facility are treated as insignificant for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

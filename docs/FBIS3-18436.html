			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by J. Hufelschulte and M. Krischer: "Liaison Man of </F> the RAF"]    [Text] The news from the FRG Interior Ministry came by  telephone. The caller urged that senior official Karl B. be  immediately transferred to another department of the Federal  Office of Criminal Investigations (BKA).    In the BKA president's staff in Wiesbaden, the explosive  nature of the official order was immediately clear. After a  brief note about the telephone conversation, the high-ranking  official picked up the stamp and put "confidential -- official  secret" on the piece of paper. No one should learn what  Interior Minister Manfred Kanther and his State Secretary Kurt  Schelter had just ordered on 2 February 1994.    The banishment from Bonn hits a dedicated BKA official who  has caused serious problems for the German security authorities,  which have difficulties anyway, and who is now radically  condemned to silence -- eight months after the counterterror  operation in Bad Kleinen.    Senior official Karl B., who was the head of BKA  Counterterrorism Department No. 11, found out:    There is a high probability that Klaus Steinmetz, the  alleged  spy of the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the  Constitution in the Red Army Faction [RAF], is a leading RAF  activist.    The man who put the investigators on the trail of Birgit  Hogefeld and Wolfgang Grams in Bad Kleinen in June 1993 was a  top RAF courier and obviously knew about secret terror  operations. He kept everything to himself, however, and did not  tell his controllers at the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the  Protection of the Constitution about his knowledge.    The official BKA paper, which was drawn up by Karl B. and  which immediately disappeared into a drawer because of the  relentless analysis, permits only one conclusion:    Steinmetz cheated the authorities. He cheated the  Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the  Constitution as well as the chief federal prosecutor, who  suspended proceedings against him on 28 January.    "The investigations," Hans-Juergen Foerster of the Chief  Federal Prosecutor's Office says, "did not give sufficient  reason to publicly indict him."    A BKA official told FOCUS: "They are glad Steinmetz is gone  now. They do not want to ask him anything any more. They do  not want any answers that would be embarrassing -- embarrassing  in particular for those who controlled Steinmetz as a liaison  man and who would now have to realize that they had lost control  of him and that he might have committed crimes while they  protected him."    Steinmetz, who is hidden somewhere and being prepared for a  new life with a new identity abroad, would have to face  indictment according to the uncomfortable BKA paper.    According to the findings by the terrorism experts, the guy,  who describes himself as a minor cog and mediator between two  camps, is in reality a big shot. As one can read on page 17 of  the BKA dossier, he is considered to be a person who "is tightly  integrated in RAF structures" and can probably "be called a  supporting member of the RAF."    According to the BKA analysis, Steinmetz never took the  truth  very seriously. His statements are "incredible" and "in  complete contradiction" with BKA findings "on essential topics."    The alleged liaison man claims to have established contact  with the RAF command echelon in autumn 1991 in Metz, France. He  claims to have met Hogefeld and Grams, who were caught in Bad  Kleinen, in Paris in February 1992. After evaluating all  evidence, the BKA investigators are certain that he had access  to the RAF command echelon much earlier.    Steinmetz also gave a bad impression with his statements  about the spectacular RAF attack on the prison in Weiterstadt on  27 March 1993.    Shortly after the operation in Bad Kleinen, he claimed that  he had learned about the forthcoming bombing of the super  prison. Steinmetz later made a turnabout when interrogated by  the BKA and the Chief Federal Prosecutor's Office. "I did not  know anything about that beforehand," he dictated to the  reporters and was thus permitted -- the investigating  authorities knew about the interview -- to present himself  publicly as innocent.    The explosive BKA report leads to other conclusions:    Klaus Steinmetz, to whom the RAF gave the cover name  "Bruno,"  was obviously a top courier of the terrorists who had gone  underground. He transported documents that, according to the BKA  dossier, "would permit profound insight into the communication  structures if the police got hold of them."    A task that no one -- and quite certainly not the strictly  secret RAF command echelon -- would entrust to a "minor cog."    The transport of "structurally relevant secret messages," as  the BKA analysis says about the Steinmetz role, "is probably  assigned to such persons to whom both the sender and also, in  particular, the recipient (illegals, RAF members for whom there  is an arrest warrant) have a long tested and intensive  relationship of trust."    One insider told FOCUS: "Now they are all fluttering with  fear. After the BKA stock-taking, one must necessarily  investigate the question of whether the liaison man perhaps knew  about assassination attacks beforehand, such as about the ones  on Rohwedder and Herrhausen."    Karl B., who is renowned in the BKA because of this expert  qualifications, suddenly felt an icy wind blowing in his face  after he had presented his report.    Reportedly, he was three times requested to formulate his  findings about the true role of liaison man Steinmetz  differently. Karl B., called Charly by his colleagues, stuck to  his version. The result: The hot document was stamped "not  usable in court."    The Chief Federal Prosecutor's Office, the master of the  investigations, reacted with irritation to the official, whose  analysis threatened to torpedo the suspension of the  investigations against Steinmetz. In a talk with BKA President  Hans-Ludwig Zachert in January 1994, Karlsruhe Senior Prosecutor  Gerhard Loechner is said to have harshly criticized the tense  relationship between the two authorities. The scapegoat was  found quickly: senior BKA official Karl B.    However, also internally, both in the Wiesbaden BKA and at  the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the  Constitution in Mainz, Charly the Steadfast caused big trouble  with his report. The reason: Important evidence has  disappeared.    The background: According to BKA investigations, Steinmetz  was handed a particular cargo one day before the operation in  Bad Kleinen. Wolfgang Grams wanted to send two glasses of red  currant jam to his parents. Birgit Hogefeld reportedly gave  Steinmetz two personal letters. After examining the typewriter  ribbon, it was concluded that one letter was for her mother, the  other one for a women from the supporters' scene, who uses the  cover name Vicky.    After the GSG-9 operation the Rhineland-Palatinate Office  for  the Protection of the Constitution took over Steinmetz' cargo.  During an interrogation by the BKA Counterterrorism Department  No. 24 of 24 August 1993, official G. remembered the jam --  however, he claimed not to know anything about the letters. It  is, however, these two mysteriously missing letters that make  Steinmetz' great importance in the RAF structure clear, the  suppressed BKA dossier indicates.    In the future, the uncomfortable senior official Karl B. is  supposed to keep his hands off terrorists. As of 1 March 1994,  he will be transferred to another department -- the Interior  Ministry has refused any comments about the background of this  transfer.    Charly, the experienced RAF hunter, now has to keep  statistics about drug-related crimes.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Government delays release of coal survival plan THE GOVERNMENT has been forced to delay publication of its plan for the coal industry until next month, suggesting MPs may not have the chance to debate it until after the Budget on March 16. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is still struggling to secure the consent of the two main electricity generators in England and Wales to take an extra 65.5m tonnes of British deep-mined coal over five years. This is the amount the government believes is necessary to win backbench approval for its rescue plan. The generators have offered to take 40m tonnes at subsidised world prices, and an extra 15m providing the government pays for the cost of stocking it. It also emerged yesterday that British Coal has decided not to appeal against a High Court ruling that its decision in October to close the 10 most threatened pits was unlawful. It decided against the appeal after mining unions yesterday failed in a separate High Court attempt to challenge consultation procedures to be used by British Coal over the 10 pits. The National Union of Mineworkers and Nacods, the pit deputies' union, had accused British Coal of having no intention of entering into genuine consultations and challenged its use of mining engineers John T. Boyd to review the threatened mines. Lord Justice Glidewell - who last December ruled the original closure decisions unlawful - dismissed the unions' request for new court orders to ensure independent scrutiny of the closure programme. The High Court had no jurisdiction over the matter and British Coal had yet to decide finally on the form of consultation to be used, Lord Justice Glidewell said. British Coal, explaining why it had decided against an appeal against the December decision, said it did not want to be distracted from the consultation process. The government's inability to publish a white paper on coal before next month demonstrates the difficulties it faces in deciding on the future of the industry. Last month Mr Heseltine said he wanted to publish the white paper as early as possible in February.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Private phones in Europe FIVE YEARS ago British Telecommunications was the odd man out of the European telecommunications industry. State ownership of national telephone operators was the norm and the UK government's privatisation of BT was considered eccentric. But over the coming five years private ownership is likely to become the norm. Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark have all announced plans to sell shares in their telecommunications carriers. France is expected to do the same, though France Telecom is not on the Balladur government's initial privatisation list. Even Greece's socialist government, which campaigned against the privatisation of OTE during the recent election, has not totally turned its back on some form of private ownership. The motives behind the trend to private ownership are mixed. A belief in the greater efficiency of private enterprise and the benefits of competitive markets - the prime motive behind the BT privatisation - is sometimes a factor. The Netherlands, for example, is encouraging the country's railway, cable television operators and electricity utilities to join forces to compete with a privatised KPN. But in most countries financial considerations are often decisive. By selling stakes in the phone companies, cash-strapped governments can both plug their fiscal deficits and attract private capital to finance expensive network investments. The need to continue investing vast sums in eastern Germany was the factor which finally persuaded Germany's opposition last week to remove its veto on privatisation of Deutsche Telekom. Forming alliances Yet another motive for privatisation is a perceived need to respond to global competition by forming alliances. Such alliances are easier to cement if the partners are privatised and so can take stakes in one another. The current collaboration talks between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom may lead to share swaps. In general, privatisation is likely to be beneficial. In the UK, it has spurred BT to greater efficiency, delivering lower prices, better quality and increased choice. But there are also dangers. First, most governments are not opening up their markets at the same time as privatisation but waiting until they are forced to by the European Commission. Since this will not happen until at least 1998, monopolistic operators could lack the incentive to change their cultures. Second, many governments want to keep substantial shareholdings so they can still influence key decisions. But too much political interference will compromise the efficiency and dynamism which would flow if management were free to manage in the light of commercial objectives. In so far as wider political objectives, such as the provision of universal service, need to be safeguarded it is preferable these are imposed transparently by an independent regulator. Disturbing desire Third, several governments are showing a disturbing desire to use alliances to block global competition. That seems a motive in the Franco-German talks and the parallel discussions between the duo and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US giant. There should certainly be no ban on restructuring an industry which has been artificially fragmented on national lines. The creation of trans-European networks could abolish the 'frontier effect', under which the price of international phone calls is three times that of national calls, and give users the benefit of one-stop shopping. But it is important that competing networks emerge from the restructuring process, not a pan-European or transatlantic cartel. These dangers can be overcome, but only if both governments and the Commission have a clearer focus on liberalisation. At a national level, the priority should be to open up markets at the same time as privatisation, while establishing vigorous regulatory bodies to ensure that competitors gain fair access to monopoly networks. At the European level, the need is to discriminate between anti-competitive alliances and those which enhance competition. The Commission will also need to be more ambitious about its liberalisation plans. That way, privatisation will achieve its full potential.</p>

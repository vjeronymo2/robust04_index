			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (16): Manos tackles the car fumes - Athens Pollution MR Stefanos Manos is fed up with discussing the problems of Athens. The minister of environment and public works, an energetic - some would say impatient - technocrat, he blames 'endless talking and delays in decision-making' for the continuing presence of the nefos, the brown pollution cloud that hangs over the city in still weather. Car exhaust fumes are the major source of atmospheric pollution in Athens, now that industrial emissions are more strictly controlled and householders banned from using heavy diesel oil for heating. Last summer Mr Manos proposed a tax break for Athenians who bought a new car equipped with a catalytic converter, provided that their old model was turned in. Less than six months later, a short space of time by the standards of Greek bureaucracy, the measure was fully in operation. Car buyers, who normally pay import tariffs of over 100 per cent on new vehicles, rushed to the showrooms. Within weeks, the main graveyard for superannuated cars near Mount Parnes outside the city was almost overflowing. Over the past decade the number of private cars in Athens has risen from 550,000 to 880,000. This was partly the result of government attempts to cut pollution levels in the city centre by permitting cars to circulate only on alternate days, according to the final digit of their number-plate. Athenians got around the odd-even driving ban by acquiring a second car. But since many new purchases were of second-hand vehicles, the city's car fleet grew visibly older and dirtier. At the beginning of 1990, 40 per cent of private cars were more than 10 years old, compared with 15-20 per cent in other European Community capitals. 'The incentives are very successful. At the present rate, 30 per cent of the Athens car fleet will be replaced in three years. Then from 1993, only clean cars will be allowed into the city centre,' Mr Manos says. The next stage of his plan to banish the nefos is to build a network of underground garages across the city to provide 25,000 new parking spaces by 1994. They would be privately operated for 25 years and then turned over to the Athens municipality. 'On any weekday, there are 45,000 cars illegally parked around Athens and 60 per cent of the city's road surfaces are taken up by stationary vehicles. If we get parked cars off the streets, traffic will start flowing faster and there'll be fewer fumes,' Mr Manos says. The third stage is to revive a highway project first proposed over 40 years ago by building about 50 kilometres of highway across northern Athens to relieve pressures on central traffic arteries. It will cost about Dr150bn (Dollars 850m) and be operated 'by the constructor as a toll road, a fast highway where you pay to save time.' Mr Manos says he is sticking to 'quite simple projects, because you have so little time to make anything happen before people start thinking in terms of the next election.' The biggest project of all, a Dr250bn extension of the Athens underground, should finally get under way by the end of the year. Its start is already two years behind schedule because of politically inspired delays and a dispute over contract terms. An international consortium led by Siemens of Germany is to build two new lines across the city centre, totalling 18 kilometres in length, and nine stations including one beneath Constitution Square. The extension will take six years to complete and should carry 1bn passengers a year.</p>

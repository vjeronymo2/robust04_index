			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / London's export slide casts recovery gloom EXPORT orders and deliveries among London's manufacturers fell for the third consecutive quarter in the three months to December, in contrast with most other regions, Emma Tucker writes. The London Chamber of Commerce says in its latest quarterly economic survey published today that domestic orders and deliveries also continued to decline, while 82 per cent of manufacturers were operating below capacity. The survey suggests that London is still suffering more than the rest of the country, with no sign of recovery yet. Exporters fared slightly better after sterling's devaluation in September, but the chamber believes there will be no growth in exports during the first quarter of this year. Recent cuts in base rates have been slow to take effect and business confidence is depressed by rising unemployment and sluggish activity. The survey says London's short-term employment prospects are the poorest in the country. Almost 40 per cent of manufacturers and 35 per cent of service-sector companies have cut staff in response to lower demand.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Check your Serps position every year - Opting out / Personal Pensions EMPLOYEES WHO are relying on just themselves and the state for their pension must decide how much they will do for themselves and how far they will rely on the state. All will receive the basic state pension. If they do nothing else, then by default they are also in the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) - the second tier of the state pension scheme. But they have the choice of opting out of Serps, known as 'contracting-out', and making their own provision through an appropriate personal pension. With the general election over, some of the uncertainty about the future of pensions has been removed. Employees can make the choice as to whether or not to opt out of Serps with certainty, at least for the current financial year. The choice depends on whether the employee considers that a personal pension will provide a greater pension than Serps at the state pension age - 65 for men and 60 for women - for the particular year's contribution. It is not an easy comparison. The Serps pension for a year, say 1992-93, is a certain fraction of the employee's earnings for that year between the lower earnings limit (currently Pounds 2,808 a year) and the upper earnings limit (Pounds 21,060). This amount is revalued each year in line with national average earnings until the employee retires. In contrast, if an employee opts out of Serps, the contribution paid into the personal pension would be 8.46 per cent of earnings between the lower and upper earnings limits consisting of: Employee's contracted-out rebate           2.00% Basic tax relief on this rebate            0.66% Employer's contracted-out rebate           3.80% Incentive contribution                     2.00% TOTAL                                      8.46% Employees do not receive any tax relief if they remain in Serps. The incentive contribution applies to all employees who have not been contracted-out during the previous two years. It is paid from the National Insurance fund. This contribution, less expenses, is invested in an appropriate personal pension from a life company, and the accumulated sum at state pension age used to buy a pension. So the longer the time to pension age, the greater the accumulated sum, and thus the greater the ultimate pension. So, under the present regime, the younger the employee the greater the pension secured from an appropriate personal pension, compared with the pension from Serps which is virtually fixed in relation to the employee's earnings. Employees can obtain an individual benefit illustration, prepared under the rules of Lautro (the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry), which compares the Serps benefit with that on a personal pension. The Lautro rules, for once, are realistic for these illustrations, and employees can make their choice on appropriate figures. A rule of thumb used by certain life companies is that it is favourable for men up to age 45 and women up to age 37 to contract-out of Serps with a personal pension. Employees should check each year whether it is still advantageous, because conditions are changing, and a different set of criteria will apply for future years. In April 1993, the rebate on National Insurance contributions is reduced to 4.8 per cent of earnings between the lower and upper limits - 1.8 per cent for employees, and 3 per cent for employers. In addition, the incentive payment, which was originally intended to cease next April, will continue to be paid at the reduced rate of 1 per cent to all employees aged 30 or more. This in itself alters the equation, and the pivotal ages for contracting-out will be a year or two lower than at present. These criteria, taken at face value, would mean that employees presently contracted out through personal pensions, who will have reached or passed the pivotal age by next April, should seriously consider going back into Serps. But the changes carry deeper implications, particularly the 1 per cent incentive payment. It is widely interpreted that this payment heralds the introduction of age-related rebates - that is, the level of rebate will increase with the age of employees, to reflect the rising cost, with age of matching pensions provided by Serps. If an age-related rebate system is introduced, then there may not be any advantage in returning to Serps whatever one's age. So employees should delay any decision until the situation is clarified. However, those relying on Serps, or its contracted-out equivalent, will find that their ultimate pension will still fall well short of expectations, particularly the higher paid. They need to top-up with personal pensions, whether or not they are in Serps. This message appears to be getting through. The Prudential group reports that nearly three-quarters of employees who have contracted-out through personal pensions have made additional provision. Contribution rates are related to age: Age                    Percentage of                         net relevant                             earnings Up to 35                       17.5% 36-45                          20.0% 46-50                          25.0% 51-55                          30.0% 56-60                          35.0% 61-74                          40.0% High earners, however, are restricted as to the ultimate amount of contribution which they can make by the ceiling on their earnings - known as 'the cap'. This is currently Pounds 75,000. They can only relate their contributions to personal pensions up to this limit. But this is the only restriction imposed on personal pensions.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei higher as Hong Kong sees 2.8% rise An easing of selling pressure on Japan Tobacco, whose unsuccessful listing last week eroded confidence, encouraged buying by overseas and institutional investors and the Nikkei 225 average gained ground, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index closed 184.44 higher at 19,989.60, rising for the fourth consecutive day. It fluctuated between 20,000.70 and 19,855.47, with trading by securities dealers also lifting activity. Volume totalled 245m shares, against 251m. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 17.34 at 1,584.66, while the Nikkei 300 put on 3.71 at 290.50. Rises outnumbered falls by 776 to 198, with 172 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.38 easier at 1,305.46. The advance on Wall Street on Friday encouraged futures trading which, in turn, prompted arbitrage buyers. Overseas investors, followed by domestic institutions, bought large-capitalisation stocks, including steels and shipbuilders on hopes of a worldwide recovery in steel demand. Over the next few weeks the market is expected to focus on interim earnings announcements and forecasts for the full year. However, some analysts did not think that profit increases would lift share prices for the time being. Traders also said potential sellers around the 20,000 Nikkei 225 level were expected to cap a rise in shares. Steel companies led activity. Nippon Steel rose Y4 to Y400 and NKK by Y2 to Y299. Shipbuilders were also traded, with Hitachi Zosen up Y13 to Y567 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries by Y14 to Y789. Japan Tobacco, which declined sharply following its listing last week, rallied Y20,000 to Y1.08m, while other privatisation issues were also firm, with East Japan Railway up Y1,000 to Y483,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gaining Y15,000 at Y905,000. Japan Telecom, the long distance telecommunications operator, fell Y60,000 to a new low for the year of Y3.54m on profit-taking. Kyushu Matsushita Electric, an affiliate of Matsushita Electronics Industrial, shed Y400 to Y2,440: investors were discouraged by a 61 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits and the forecast of a 40 per cent earnings decline for the full year. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 165.79 to 22,094.95. Roundup Friday's rally on Wall Street provided a lead for some Pacific Rim markets. Taiwan and Manila were closed. HONG KONG followed Wall Street and saw a flood of pent-up demand drive the market ahead by 2.8 per cent, its biggest one-day rally since August 30. The Hang Seng index rose 266.78 to 9,646.25 in a broadly based rally led by recent laggards. The mood was also boosted by growing expectations that Britain and China were close to a deal on the financing for Hong Kong's new airport, which took HSBC Holdings up HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 91.50. BANGKOK finished 1.5 per cent higher amid demand for building material and property development shares, ahead of the launch of a Bt5bn mutual fund to invest in these sectors. The SET index closed at the day's high, up 22.71 at 1,528.83, in heavy turnover of Bt9.1bn. SEOUL was higher in active trading after wide fluctuations on the back of renewed buying interest in securities houses and lower-priced manufacturing shares. The composite index closed 7.36 ahead at 1,105.62, having hit a day's high of 1,115.48. Volume, at 55.9m shares, was sharply up from Friday's 47m. Securities shares with good earnings forecasts found demand. Ssangyong Investment and Hanshin rose Won1,000 each to go limit-up at Won25,300 and Won21,000 respectively. SYDNEY finished higher, taking its lead from foreign markets, but the market remained overshadowed by today's domestic balance of payments data. Volume was thin at 138.9m shares as the All Ordinaries index closed 23.6 or 1.2 per cent up at 2,044.8. Finance stocks met healthy buying. The four major banks all finished higher, with investors buying in anticipation of strong final result announcements shortly. ANZ rose 10 cents to ADollars 3.90 and Westpac 8 cents to ADollars 4.53. WELLINGTON was modestly firmer after a number of leading stocks went ex-dividend, putting a restraining influence on the main index. The NZSE-40 Capital index, which does not adjust for ex-dividends, ended 5.21 higher at 2,100.37, while the NZSE-40 Gross index, which does adjust, put on 23.35 at 2,560.78 in turnover of NZDollars 38.2m. KUALA LUMPUR's early gains were cut short as investors largely ignored the 1995 budget, announced last Friday, and prices put under more pressure by bouts of forced selling by clients unable to meet margin calls. The composite index ended 4.19 off at 1,108.85 after hitting an early high of 1,122.72. SINGAPORE saw property and finance issues make the most headway, while Malaysian stocks were lower, again on forced selling. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 16.57 to 2,379.03. JAKARTA held on to early gains at the close on the back of brisk foreign buying and a firmer Indosat price. The official index ended 7.09 higher at 523.49. Indosat's strong performance in New York was reflected in the domestic market, with its price rising another Rp125 to Rp8,650. COLOMBO edged ahead on domestic buying, but turnover of SLRs30.8m was at its lowest level this year on poor foreign demand. The All-share index gained 3.33 at 1,093.65. SHANGHAI's A share index fell 4.7 per cent, but was off its lows after the exchange president reiterrated July's commitment to introduce market boosting measures. The index lost 32.78 at 668.63 in very thin turnover of Yn1.4bn.</p>

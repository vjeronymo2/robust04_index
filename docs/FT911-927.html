			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: European papermakers anticipate recovery - They have attracted investors hunting for cheap, cyclical stocks ALL AROUND the world, pulp and paper companies have been reporting disastrous results. In the US, almost all the big paper companies have announced sharp profit falls for the first quarter of 1991 and, if anything, the situation is even worse north of the border in Canada. The big Nordic companies have also been struggling with depressed pulp prices, high costs and severe over-capacity in many sectors of the market. Sweden's pulp and paper companies saw their pre-tax profits fall on average by 35 per cent last year, and many in the industry are expecting worse to follow in 1991. Even the largely self-sufficient Japanese companies, which are normally a law unto themselves, have been feeling the squeeze because of over-capacity in the industry. The downswing in the pulp and paper cycle has struck with a vengeance. Yet set against this dismal industrial background, many of the big paper companies' share prices in most of these markets have climbed sharply since the beginning of the year. For example, a composite index of several Nordic paper companies, including Stora and SCA of Sweden, Metsa-Serla, Kymmene, UPM and Enso-Gutzeit of Finland, and Norske Skog of Norway, shows a 28 per cent improvement since the start of 1991. This compares with an 18 per cent rise for Nordic shares in general, as measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices. Is this simply another curious case of stock market perversity, or is there a rationale for this remarkably buoyant performance? The justification that analysts advance for the strength of equity prices in this sector is that, since the beginning of the year, institutional investors have been on the prowl for relatively cheap stocks in traditionally cyclical industries, and have focused on paper and packaging shares as representative of these investment criteria. Thus the stock market is performing its classical function of anticipating future economic and industrial developments. However, Mr Peter Bradshaw, an analyst who follows the Nordic paper companies for Swiss Bank Corporation, believes the surge is premature and is anticipating a recovery that will not happen for some months to come. He adds: 'What we have seen is a huge run-up in a lot of the shares since the Gulf war ended and we are now at a critical point. My own view is that the share prices have run ahead of the fundamentals.' A consensus appears to have emerged that the bottom of the pulp and paper cycle has now been reached and that the upswing is now in sight. But Mr Bradshaw has his doubts. 'As far as any upturn is concerned, there is still no sign on the horizon. All of the (paper) markets, with the exception of Germany, remain weak,' he says. Germany is still benefiting from what one analyst describes as the 'feel good' sentiment of unification, and demand for paper and board products has generally remained strong. PWA, Germany's largest producer of paper and board and the eighth biggest European group, has seen its shares surge 24.3 per cent since the start of 1991, compared with 15.2 per cent for the German market as measured by the FAZ index. Unlike many other paper companies, PWA is still undervalued, according to some analysts. The company has good defensive strengths and does not suffer from the same cost pressures as its Swedish and Finnish rivals; yesterday it maintained its dividend and reminded investors that its group net profits actually rose by 10 per cent in 1990. Although shares in the Nordic paper sector may now pause for breath, they should move ahead again strongly when firmer evidence emerges that the industry is on the upward path. They may be lifted by takeover speculation as much as by the prospects for a swift rebuilding of profits, as the industry continues its voracious consolidation.</p>

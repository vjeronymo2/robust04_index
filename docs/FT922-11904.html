			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Benlox seeks approval of creditors for restructuring BENLOX, the building and engineering company which formed the vehicle for an abortive Pounds 2bn bid for the retail group Storehouse in 1987, has written to shareholders seeking approval for a fundamental restructuring. The group, which lost its Stock Exchange listing in November, will be seeking the agreement of about 20 non-bank creditors - owed Pounds 4m - at a meeting on May 8. Agreement would enable Sheikh Amin Al-Dahlawi, who is one of the largest non-royal traders in Saudi Arabia, to inject assets into the group in return for Pounds 3m worth of shares. Shareholders will also be asked to authorise the expansion of the capital base from Pounds 6m to Pounds 20m. The group is not revealing what assets Sheikh Amin Al-Dahlawi is proposing to inject into the group until it receives shareholder approval for the restructuring. It may then launch a rights issue to offer shareholders the chance to participate in the company's expansion. To mark the company's new start it is also proposing to change its name to Keatway International. The restructuring is being spearheaded by Mr Bob Hankes-Drielsma, chairman, and Mr Paul Bloomfield, who joined Benlox in 1988 from Mountleigh, the property company. Mr Hankes-Drielsma said shareholder approval of the proposals would put the group back on track. It is currently working on possible transactions in eastern Europe. Bank borrowings have been reduced from a high of Pounds 16m in November 1989, when Mr Hankes-Drielsma joined the board, to Pounds 200,000. Trading in the company's shares may soon take place by way of Rule 535. Mr Hankes-Drielsma said was not yet trying to get a listing. Once the restructuring goes ahead the accounts for 1989, 1990 and 1991 will be published.</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Some common sense on US and China During most of the post-war period respectable western opinion worried about the low living standards and slow growth of Asian, African and Latin American nations, who made up the so-called Third World. Now the fashionable worry has flipped over; and it is that the best-performing of these countries will overwhelm the established industrial nations. Some of the alarmism has been fuelled by a recondite piece of research, which appeared in an appendix to the May 1993 World Economic Outlook published by the IMF. This reassessed the share of different parts of the world in global GDP. It did so by converting currencies on the basis of their estimated domestic purchasing power rather than at their market exchange rates. The result was that the established industrial countries had their share of world output in 1990 reduced from 73 to 54 per cent, and the developing countries had theirs raised from less than 18 to more than 34 per cent. The most famous finding of all was the trebling of China's share in world GDP from 2 to 6 per cent. These new estimates have travelled by bush telegraph among the economic talking classes, where they are now in vogue. They should not in fact have caused any surprise. It has long been known that GDP comparisons at market exchange rates exaggerate the poverty of many Third World countries. The Canadian economist and national income expert, Dan Usher, observed a couple of decades ago in his travels in Indo-China that most people had a tolerable, if basic, standard of living. Yet their pay, expressed in say dollars or D-Marks, would have brought rapid starvation to anyone having to live on it in North America or western Europe. The reason for the discrepancy is also well-known. Market exchange rates establish a rough equivalence of purchasing power for different currencies in terms of products which feature in international trade. The stress is on approximation. The US economy appeared to drop from nearly a third to barely more than a quarter of the world's total, due first to the overshooting and then to the undershooting of the dollar in the 1980s. In Third World countries there is a systematic tendency for non-tradable products and services to sell at very low prices relative to tradable ones. Travellers know how cheap are restaurant meals, shoe cleaning and other personal services in poorer countries. The new estimates have had less effect on growth rates than on total output. Developing countries have been growing faster than established industrial ones at least since the mid-1970s. Since 1984 developing country growth rates have averaged almost 5 per cent per annum, against 2 1/2 per cent for developed ones. In the two years to 1994 the IMF expects developing countries to grow by nearly 6 per cent per annum while industrial countries grow by only 1 1/2 to 2 per cent. Among the latter, the dear old European Community is projected to grow by between  1/2 and 1 per cent. These estimates incorporate an additional 0.8 per cent added to the average annual growth rates of developing countries and a subtraction of 0.1 per cent for the developed world, as a result of the rebasing exercise. Without these corrections the developing world would still have shown a more rapid growth rate than the industrial west. But the rebasing does make a difference. Old figures showed rapid Third World growth was necessary to offset its high population growth. Output per person seemed to be growing at an approximately similar pace in both areas. The new estimates suggest Third World growth is faster even on a per capita basis. Even the latest corrections may not go far enough. They still suggest the US, with a fifth of China's population, has a total real GDP 10 times as large. But in any case the discrepancy in living standards remains huge. Surely a gradual catching up by China is welcome - although it does not justify turning a blind eye to human rights abuses in China or its adjacent territories.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UN envoy takes message to Col Gadaffi A SENIOR United Nations envoy yesterday left for Libya bearing a letter for Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, in what appeared a further mission to emphasise that Tripoli must comply with UN resolutions demanding the extradition of two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing. No details on the purpose of the visit were made available yesterday. But diplomats in New York stressed that the trip was not prompted by any movement in the deadlock between Libya and the UN. The visit appears designed rather to keep channels of communication open between the UN and Tripoli. Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, UN undersecretary-general, is expected to arrive in Tripoli at the weekend. He visited Tripoli earlier this year to call on Col Gadaffi to hand over the suspects and is expected to repeat the demand in a meeting with the Libyan leader. As the secretary-general's representative, Mr Petrovsky has no brief to negotiate with Col Gadaffi, but rather will reiterate the terms of UN resolution 731, which calls on Libya to hand over the Lockerbie suspects and four men accused by France of being behind the bombing of a UTA airliner and for Tripoli concretely to dissociate itself from acts of terrorism. 'This is not mediation, just communication,' said a western diplomat at the UN. Mr Petrovsky will tell the Libyan government that air, arms and diplomatic sanctions placed on April 15 will remain in force until Libya complies with resolution 731. Countries applying the sanctions, under UN resolution 748, are expected to give a progress report on their compliance to the UN Security Council on May 15.</p>

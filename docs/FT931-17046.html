			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Sales continue to outweigh purchases  -Directors' transactions WITH THE market reaching new highs, it is not surprising that the number of sales is far outweighing the number of purchases. Nevertheless, there are more purchases this year than there were at the same time last year. At the end of October, three main board directors of Babcock International, the heavy engineering concern, were buying their own shares below 30p. This latest purchase by Jeffrey Whaller, the deputy chairman, is altogether larger and more convincing. Investor sentiment may be negative over the short term, but a pattern of support from the boardroom is clearly emerging. Another company with an uncertain future is Amstrad, the consumer electronics group. Alan Sugar's proposed buyout has failed, raising questions about his long-term commitment to the company's future. The sales by Malcolm Miller and Robert Watkins of 714,000 and 563,500 shares at just over 23p do little to change investor perception of the company, particularly when these sales represent their entire holdings. John Munro, managing director of Fairway Group, which supplies computer stationery for the freight industry, developed a keen appetite for his own stock last year. He bought a total of 590,000 shares the most recent batch of 375,000 at 37.5p. The first purchases, made in February and March, were executed at prices between 44p and 48p. When Henlys Group fought off an unwanted bid from rival motor dealer T Cowie, one might have expected its share price to have gone into reverse. On the contrary, two features have combined to reassure investors: firstly sales of cars and commercial vehicles have improved sharply, against market expectations. Secondly, the company was forced to cut costs aggressively making it a more attractive recovery prospect. With the share price back at 73p, Robert Wood, chief executive, has bought 35,000 shares, taking his holding up to 168,000.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    No of Company                Sector     Shares   Value   directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Airsprung Furniture    Misc       36,060     153      2* Amstrad                Elns    1,277,500     295      2 Applied Holograph      Misc       22,000      22      1 Argyll                 FdRe      114,050     477      2* BM Group               EngG       30,000      26      1 Body Shop              Stor       50,000      97      1 Bowthorpe              Elns      230,000     616      1 Daily Mail &amp; Gen A      Med        6,000     442      1 Electronics Data Pr    Elns        5,000      25      1 Grand Metropolitan     Brew      167,534     776      1 Haemocell              Hlth    1,130,000   1,921      2 Ladbroke               Hotl       25,000      45      1 Persimmon               C&amp;C       13,375      28      1 Protean                EngG      200,000     260      1 Psion                  Elns       25,000      25      2 Reed International      Med      187,600   1,210      2* Sainsbury (J)          FdRe        7,000      37      1 Salvesen (Chr'n)       BuSe      201,394     703      2* Sherwood Computers     BuSe      310,000     735      2* Sleepy Kids            Hotl      132,000      38      3 Smith &amp; Nephew         Hlth      100,000     165      1 Smiths Industries      EngA      204,741     704      1* Staveley               OthI       32,976      74      2 Tesco                  FdRe      211,341     546      1* Thorn EMI              Hotl       45,332     389      1* Titon Holdings         BdMa      154,500     231      2 United Newspapers       Med      172,000     887      3* Whatman                Hlth        7,220      31      1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Babcock Int'l          EngG      120,000      38      1 BNB Resources          BuSe      120,000      48      1 Fairway Group          Misc      375,000     141      1 Forte                  Hotl      190,000     342      1 Henlys Group           Motr       35,000      26      1 Iceland Frozen Food    FdRe       56,000     346      2 Joseph (Leopold)       Merc      130,000     325      2 Kleen-e-Zee            Stor      695,959     466      4 Sycamore               Metl      486,859      41      1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

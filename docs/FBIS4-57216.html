			<p>BFN     [Text] The socialists will not be part of the future  government. PANPRA [Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary  Party Of Haiti] leader Serge Gilles so stated this morning at  our microphone. He was the guest in the morning broadcast:    [Begin recording] [Gilles] The position of my party is  clear.  It is the same position as that of the socialist bloc. We have  expressed it already. It is clear. We are against Article 149  and therefore we do not agree. This government does not have our  support.    [Reporter Renois] Does that mean, Serge Gilles, that PANPRA  will not agree to participate in the formation of the future  government that Mr. Jonassaint will establish?    [Gilles] Not at all. Not at all. We have said so. For the  past two weeks, it has been clear. We are against Article 149;  since the coup d'etat, we have been against Article 149. We have  always said that a negotiated return is necessary. It is  necessary to go back to the negotiation table, to dialogue.    [Renois] In your opinion, is negotiation still possible  today?    [Gilles] Negotiation is always possible; I am convinced of  that. Dialogue is always possible. But good faith is necessary  on both sides, by the two protagonists. This is what we say. And  for a dialogue to be fruitful, it is necessary to listen to each  other. It cannot be a dialogue of the deaf.    [Renois] Are not the doors closed for this dialogue that  your  party hopes for?    [Gilles] No! I hope that the doors remain open. We want to  force them. It is necessary that the doors remain open. It is  necessary that we return to negotiations. It is necessary to  return to dialogue. For us, it is an obligatory passage. This  crisis, as we have said, is so deep that it will not be solved  with sanctions, not with an embargo, not with Articles 149, 148,  or 111. This crisis cannot be solved with a constitutional  cover. A political compromise is necessary. It is necessary to  reach a compromise. It is necessary that the protagonists resign  themselves to finding this compromise on specific points  regarding Haitian society, the Haitian people, the Haitian  nation. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: ACCBank rises 31% to IPounds 8.5m ACCBANK, the state-run Irish concern being groomed for privatisation, reported a 31 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from IPounds 6.51m to IPounds 8.5m (Pounds 8.41m), in the 1992 year. Established in 1927 to provide exclusively agricultural loans, the bank has in the past five years diversified its operations and now trades as an ordinary high street bank. It has 45 branches throughout Ireland and a deposit base which expanded last year by 21 per cent to IPounds 592m. Interest and other income grew by 19 per cent to IPounds 95.7m (IPounds 80.4m). Total assets rose by 26 per cent to IPounds 860m (IPounds 681m). The 1992 dividend of IPounds 763,000 goes to the Irish Government, which is the 100 per cent shareholder. Last August, Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, announced that the government intended to dispose of ACC. However, those plans have seemingly been put on hold with the formation of the Labour-Fianna Fail coalition in January, which in its programme for government talked of a merger with ICC, another state-run bank, rather than a privatisation.</p>

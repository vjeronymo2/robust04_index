			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 16 (AFP) -- Two  heavy artillery shells hit a residential area of the mainly  Moslem industrial town of Tuzla on Monday [16 May], causing  panic as residents fled the streets, witnesses said. [passage  omitted] The shells crashed in mid-afternoon not far from the  town's hotel, which had been hit Sunday night by a large-calibre  shell, and left two craters in a children's play area.  Residents of the town immediately fled the streets, bathed in  early summer sunshine, to take shelter, dragging their children  away from play. No injuries were reported. It was the third  day in succession the northeastern Bosnian town had been  shelled, apparently from Serb positions some four kilometres  (2.5 miles) to the north east. Last Wednesday two people were  killed and four injured in two waves of shelling, prompting  local authorities to close schools. A decision was to be made  later Monday on when to reopen them.

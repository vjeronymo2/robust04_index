			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Steve Walsh, who refuted reports that the Dallas Cowboys want to trade him,  signed a four-year $4.1-million contract and joined another millionaire, Troy  Aikman, in a battle for the starting quarterback job.  </P> <P> "I believe now the Cowboys really want me to compete for the job," said Walsh,  who lost only once in two years as the starter for the University of Miami.  </P> <P> Walsh could be traded to any NFL team this year but can refuse a trade to four  teams he selects next season.  </P> <P> Walsh, who received a $900,000 bonus to sign, was passed over by Atlanta in the  National Football League supplemental draft. The Cowboys took him, although  they had signed UCLA's Aikman to a six-year, $11.037-million contract.  </P></p>

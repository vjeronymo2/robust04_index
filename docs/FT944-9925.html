			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Fall seen in new mortgages Gross mortgage advances in October were lower than in the previous month, underlining the lack of a clear recovery in the market, the mortgage index produced by Barclays Bank shows. This is the second month that the index, which monitors the flow of mortgage advances through solicitors' deposit accounts held with Barclays, has recorded a month-on-month fall. In each case the drop was 6 per cent. However, mortgage advances last month were 6 per cent higher than in October last year.</p>

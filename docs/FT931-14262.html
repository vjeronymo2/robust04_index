			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (17): Citizens sceptical about their prospects - David Gardner finds that ordinary people have yet to feel the benefits of the Community THE YEAR of the completion of the single market has also been the year in which the Maastricht treaty tottered on the brink, mainly because of a loss of confidence by Europe's citizens in the Community's leaders, institutions, and policy-making. 'Ever closer union' among European nations is not widely perceived to be creating a Europe for people - a democratic polity in which sovereign member states work supranationally producing visible benefits for their citizens. The EC is increasingly seen as an organisation which does rather more for business than for people; is undemocratic, intrusive and unaccountable; and which by hyperintensifying competition in European industry contributes to destroying rather than creating jobs. That this is not an altogether accurate, fair or complete picture is beside the point. European Commission president Jacques Delors summarised the situation five days before the Maastricht treaty squeaked through September's referendum in France: 'Either Europe will become more and more democratic . . . or Europe will be no more'. If citizens are not persuaded there is something in it for them, then the game is up. Since 'Europe' came into being 40 years ago, it has been the enterprise of the elites. The Paris weekly, Le Nouvel Observateur, captured how most people visualise its workings just before the French referendum. It published a photograph of a sharp-suited man against a backdrop of the 12-starred EC flag - with a paper bag over his head. In spite of its remoteness and facelessness, the EC's overwhelming benefit to people has been its interlocking of national interests in a way which precludes war between Europe's leading powers. But that benefit is now taken for granted. Modern Europeans have discounted it, and fear EC centralisation. Yet, at the same time, they expect of the Community practical benefits, such as job-creation, which it does not really have the power to deliver. Throughout the almost glacial progress of European integration, the member states have guarded their national prerogatives jealously. As a quasi-federation, the EC has been built up almost back-to-front. Whereas a conventional federal system, such as the US or Germany, starts by pooling obvious central powers such as foreign policy and defence, macroeconomic co-ordination and monetary policy, the EC started with modest items like coal and steel, wheat and milk. Only through the still unratified Maastricht treaty has it broached a common foreign and security policy and a single currency. The relaunch of EC integration, moreover, came through the single market, a battery of 282 measures designed to create a barrier-free economy in Europe. The Twelve organised this exercise centrally, to the extent that not all member states trusted their partners to flatten their part of the level playing field. For the average citizen, however, the experience appears to have been mixed. Many of the single market measures have appeared intrusive, and at first glance often seem more properly the concern of local councils, rather than unelected bureaucrats and national ministers making decisions behind closed doors in Brussels. At one level, there has been a bonanza of tabloid headlines on 'Brussels Euro-lunacies' ranging from alleged plans to suppress prawn cocktail crisps to decrees defining a standard Euro-condom. But alongside the trivia, there is genuine concern about the effect of many of the measures that have been adopted over the past four years. Of the single market's four freedoms - in the movement of capital, goods, services and people - only the first three have been realised. This achievement has increased competition during a European downturn and rising unemployment. Taken together with the failure to agree free movement across borders for people, the overall enterprise looks a lopsided bargain, tilted heavily towards business. EC leaders - most of them unpopular at home and eager to pass the buck to the European Commission for misfired EC measures that national ministers decide on - concluded in the second half of last year that decision-making had to be brought 'closer to the people'. No populists they, the 12 heads of government chose as their primary vehicle 'subsidiarity' - meaning that there should only be action at EC level when national or local measures would be ineffectual. While subsidiarity was never going to enter anybody's vernacular, this debate quickly moved from quasi-theology to naked power politics. Big member states such as the UK and Germany tried - and failed - to use it to emasculate the monopoly right of the Commission to propose measures, which is viewed by the smaller and poorer EC members as the guarantor of their interests in the Community. Then the Euro-sceptical UK, which held the EC presidency in the second half of last year, tried to roll back some 65 laws and proposals strengthening workers' and consumers' rights, and environmental standards. These are the most popular policy areas, particularly in the semi-detached member state of Denmark, for whose voters subsidiarity was put on the agenda after they rejected Maastricht last June. At December's Edinburgh summit, an agreement was reached, preserving the balance of power in the EC. It will make Brussels more cautious about the ideas it brings forward and the closed-door Council of Ministers of the Twelve more user-friendly, since important policy debates will, from February 1, be televised for the press. There is a danger, however, that Brussels will be inhibited in acting in areas such as the environment and free movement for people, for fear of upsetting member governments. The subsidiarity debate was handled with opportunism by governments so that mud stuck to 'Brussels' - synonymous in most people's minds with the whole European enterprise. It also served as a smokescreen to obscure the real issues of democracy and accountability. It is unlikely that the EC can continue for long in this way. This is not because there is some mass movement rattling the Eurocracy's gates demanding to be let in, but because, on the contrary, apathy and resentment are increasingly denying popular legitimacy to the EC - as last year's polls, referenda and restive national parliaments demonstrated. To reverse this, EC decisions will have to be seen to be more open, more scrutinised in the European Parliament and national parliaments. And their content will have to be more popular, if not populist - giving citizens a greater stake in Europe.</p>

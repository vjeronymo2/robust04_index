			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Dealing with late payers (2) Sir, Mr Nigel Wilkins (Letters, November 26) makes an excellent suggestion: that names of directors of failed companies should be publicised. But this should be augmented by names of directors and companies (and of their ultimate holding company) that failed to pay their bills on time - which contributes to business failure. No public honours should be awarded to directors of companies which impose inequitable or untimely payment arrangements on their suppliers. Martin E Simons, 24 Granard Avenue, London SW15 6HJ</p>

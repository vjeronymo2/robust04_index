			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (8): Maramotti, man behind the beacon of efficiency / Profile of Credito Emiliano FEW entrepreneurs are better placed to speak on relations between banks and industry than Mr Achille Maramotti, the self-made millionaire who has built the family-owned Max Mara women's wear group into one of the most successful international fashion names. Mr Maramotti, 65, combines running his group with the vice-chairmanship of Credito Emiliano, the regional bank which stands out as one of the most progressive financial institutions in Italy. Based, like Max Mara, in Reggio Emilia in northern Italy, it is notable for slick customer services and a strong emphasis on marketing. These may be nothing special for foreigners used to smooth-running domestic bank counters, but in Italy, where at most banks the customer often seems to come last, Credito Emiliano is a beacon of efficiency. Often the distinguishing touches are minor. No other Italian bank produces such clear and legible statements. Nor have any competitors woken up to its practice - commonplace abroad - of having just one queue for all the teller desks, reducing the risk of being stuck behind a slow customer. 'We have excellent management who comb the world for the latest ideas,' says Mr Maramotti. 'We always wanted a bank which would be at the forefront of developments in the industry.' At international banking exhibitions, where new ideas in technology and customer services are on display, the Credito Emiliano team is often the only Italian presence. As the biggest single shareholder in the bank, which now has total group assets of L6,400bn and made L28.3bn after tax last year, Mr Maramotti speaks with some authority, While he controls only 27 per cent of the stock, a pact with a rich Torinese family, the second biggest shareholder, and a handful of other local businessmen gives the group control of the bank, which also has about 4,000 small shareholders. Mr Maramotti stresses he is primarily an industrialist, not a financier. 'I am an industrialist who has developed a certain interest in banking,' he says modestly. Day-to-day management is left to a team of professionals. 'I look at this shareholding like one in any other company. But I'm not a silent partner.' Indeed, the deputy chairman clearly takes his job seriously, dividing his time between the bank and Max Mara. That combination gives Mr Maramotti, born and raised in Emilia Romagna, the Italian region synonymous with the small and medium-sized businesses which form the country's economic backbone, a special insight when it comes to talking about banks and industry. Unlike many competitors in clothing, who have regularly blamed excessive interest rates and inefficient banking services for some at least of Italy's economic ills, he does not think the relationship between bank and borrower is unfairly tilted towards the lender. 'Generally speaking, I think the banking system works pretty well for industry,' he says. 'The cost of money is high because the state, with its huge borrowing needs, is the main competitor for funds. Colleagues who complain about shortcomings in the banking system or high interest rates are just looking for excuses. They should run their businesses better instead.' However, Mr Maramotti admits to being atypical of the genre. The growth of Max Mara, which now encompasses 16 lines and consolidated sales of L903bn last year, has come largely from ploughing back profits into the business over the years rather than borrowing money. 'My relationship with the banking system is very anomalous,' he admits. 'Max Mara has never paid dividends and we've always reinvested our earnings, so I tend to deposit money rather than borrow it.' But while no one doubts there is a bright future for unquoted, growing companies such as Max Mara, where the founding family is still very much in charge, what awaits medium-sized banks like Credito Emiliano, with limited branch networks and only regional coverage? Many banking analysts praise the deep local roots and close customer contacts which give such banks their strength. But they are sceptical about longer-term prospects in a European banking system moving steadily towards consolidation and larger, multinational institutions. Mr Maramotti is confident about Credito Emiliano's future. So much so that he and his fellow shareholders recently pumped in fresh cash to support a rights issue to finance its expansion. Apart from opening more branches in its base region of Emilia Romagna, growth has also taken it into new ground in southern Italy. Credito Emiliano has bought a number of sometimes troubled banks in the south. 'As we see ourselves as innovative, we believed we could add bring something new to the banking system in the south. We first looked at Appulia, an economically vibrant region with a less crime-ridden image than some other parts,' Mr Maramotti says. 'When we couldn't find what we wanted, we turned to Sicily instead.' The acquisitions, which have helped push up total branch numbers to 115 in 17 provinces, have now been cleaned up, he says. And the experience gained in the south has left Credito Emiliano poised to make further acquisitions there should the opportunity arise. 'We think there is a future for the bank,' he says. 'We have decided to focus on the medium-upper segment of the market for deposits, while we see smaller and medium-sized companies as our obvious clients for lending.' So far, the strategy has worked. A well-managed, profitable bank like Credito Emiliano is an obvious takeover target, particularly for big foreign banks which are still keen to expand in Italy. 'We hope we've already reached a size which will allow us to remain independent. So we will turn down all offers,' says Mr Maramotti. 'And we also believe the more we plough in to developing the company, the more it will be worth in future.' The bank's limited resources would prevent it from making a really big takeover in the hundreds of billions of lire range. But smaller deals are by no means excluded. 'There are lots of other shareholders like me ready to invest in this company,' says Mr Maramotti confidently.</p>

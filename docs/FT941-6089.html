			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Arts: Part of life's rich pageant - Cinema SHORT CUTS (18) Robert Altman SHADOWLANDS (U) Richard Attenborough THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JO (15) Maggie Greenwald Great cliches, like great mountains, take millennia to form. Consider that old Hollywood favourite, 'All human life is here.' It looks like an inert, ponderous, unavoidable statement: a sloganeer's massif. But how many aeons of PR prehistory conspired to produce its perfectly hewn shape? And what does it take to change that shape? A few seconds: given the right tremor at the right time. We get a 'real' earthquake at the end of Robert Altman's wonderful 3 1/4 -hour fresco of Los Angeles life Short Cuts, based on eight transplanted stories by north-eastern writer Raymond Carver, when the 22 casually intersecting main characters are united, after a fashion, by a shudder from San Andreas. But there is another earthquake in this film. It is Altman the cliche-buster shaking up another mighty cliche. His career began with all those genre movies that were not genre movies. M*A*S*H, The Long Goodbye, McCabe And Mrs Miller, Nashville: private eyes, cowboys, song-and-dance, except that nothing and nobody in these films behaved as Hollywood habit demanded. Goodbye was a film noir shot in sunlight, McCabe a snowbound Western, Nashville a disaster-musical. Short Cuts uses Carver's writing partly to hack away at, and re-shape, the soap opera tradition's spreading empire on the modern screen. If 'all human life' is here, it is served up not in the dainty, well-formed portions of most domestic agony-serials - opera buffet - but in raw, bleeding chunks which we fight over like feeding birds. Here is the housewife (Madeleine Stowe) biting on her unhappiness over an adulterous husband (Tim Robbins). Here are three fishing friends whose weekend is disrupted when they find a corpse in the river. Here is a mentally disturbed baker (Lyle Lovett), who poisons a couple's lives with anonymous phone calls. Here is that couple (Andie McDowell, Bruce Davison) whose son is dying in hospital after a car has knocked him down. Here is the car's waitress driver (Lily Tomlin) and her good-for-nothing chauffeur husband (Tom Waits) . . . Grim but zany, and a little like Nashville without the music. Except that Annie Ross is on hand, singing moody blues in a bar when not squabbling at home with her neurotic cellist daughter Lori Singer. These two figures, though, are the only ones not hewn from Carver's writing  -though Ross's character 'Tess' bears the name of the writer's widow who gave this movie her blessing - and they are the only jarring presences. They seem too programmed-in, their problems at once melodramatic and too hazy. The brilliance of Short Cuts elsewhere lies in its surgical casualness, at once blithe and precise. As everyday life is cut open before our eyes, no one in this biopsy on a blighted Paradise is allowed to escape attention by the excuse of 'insignificance.' All human life for this director means all human life. The audience becomes co-artist with the filmmaker in exploring that uniquely fertile chaos - that Designer Disorder - that Altman creates by giving credible and compelling characters their own fragments of vividly autonomous life. * Shadowlands, by contrast, feels warmed-over from reel one. This film might have been made from the remains of The Remains Of The Day, possibly sprinkled with bits of 84 Charing Cross Road. Here is Sir Anthony Hopkins choking back the emotions again, this time as writer-scholar CS Lewis. And here is the woman who strives to awaken him. Only this time it is Hollywood's Debra Winger rather than Our Emma, and she plays the American divorcee Joy Gresham who died of cancer shortly after rescuing CS from a mouldering Oxford bachelordom. You may have seen the TV and stage play: now see the film. It too is scripted by William Nicholson. It too, to judge by the number of handkerchiefs audibly deployed during the Press show's closing stages, is for many a substantive weepie. I found it to be substantive twaddle, bar the performances. We know director Richard Attenborough is good with actors, having been a good one himself. Here he steers Hopkins and Winger through the deeps and shallows with some skill. But how few the deeps are: mostly a lot of rendered-down Lewisian stuff about the justification of pain in the divine plan. And how plentiful are the shallows. When it comes to imagery, as Gandhi and Cry Freedom taught us, Attenborough seldom conveys a point subtly or obliquely when he can push it in our faces with both hands. CS Lewis was an emotionally arrested man afraid of life and feeling? Then paint his cottage interior in dingy grey-greens with yellowing woodwork and make sure the framed prints and pictures are all in black and white. (Only exception, the childhood favourite by his desk depicting a golden valley). Joy Gresham was a force of life and vitality? Then have Debra Winger do all those noisy, pushy things Americans do in British movies, from hollering across the Randolph Hotel tea room (tsk tsk) to forcing stiff upper Brits to talk about their feelings. Whenever the camera goes outside, trying to aerate Nicholson's script, we are treated to cliches no more welcome for being marginally more scenic: the mandatory strolls through the tourist-brochure quadrangles or - beyond Oxford - to the odd lush margarine-commercial landscape. Ah] the golden Herefordshire valley that CS and Joy discover together (his painting's original), and whose delight-bringing beauty they see as part of the 'deal' with the pain to come. This metaphysical bromide sticks in the filmgoer's throat more than anything. The idea of the 'deal,' a shopkeeper's-ledger view of joy and pain, is also what we bow out on: a specious balm placed on Joy's death and the audience's grief, a contentious comfort clipped from the pages of Lewis's own late philosophy. Shadowlands promises us a true-life tragedy but gives us only a weepie with a message: one that only the actors emerge from with dignity. Amid the encroaching schmaltz, Winger somehow manages a few strong, acerbic, moving strokes. And Hopkins, after much diffident head-bobbing and emotion-parrying in the approved Remains style, has a few final seconds, just before the bell, of real histrionic fighting. * Sometimes a film from one country seems to die and be translated to another. Surely Maggie Greenwald's The Ballad Of Little Jo is 'Orlando Goes West'? Suzy Amis, who could be mistaken on a dark night for Tilda Swinton, plays a young lass who dresses as a man. Choosing to live in wildest 1860s Montana after being thrown out of home for becoming pregnant - child is left to sister - she decides that britches, cropped hair and a self-inflicted cheek scar are a must. She becomes 'Mister' Jo. He/she still falls foul of Ian McKellen, playing a brutish hotblooded Midwestern mine-supervisor. And he/she risks all by pursuing a Politically Correct agenda decades before such things were fashionable. No male chauvinist chit-chat, please, in Jo's presence. And look at the courage with which our hero(ine) rescues from a racists' lynching - and later falls in love with - a Chinaman called Tinman (David Chung), whose name I thought I heard someone say was short for Tiananmen. This is a horse opera with moral-political hindsight. Like any beast with eyes at the wrong end of its person, it fails to get up much forward momentum but does have a loopy charm if you are not in a hurry.</p>

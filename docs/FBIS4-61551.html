			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Bishkek protocol on settlement of the  Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, which was signed Thursday [5 May]  by the heads of parliamentary delegations from Russia, Armenia,  Kyrgyzstan, and representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh, remains  open for signing. Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation  Council, believes that Azerbaijan will also accede to the treaty  soon. RIA reports him as saying this today at a Moscow news  conference.    Vladimir Shumeyko believes that the main obstacle preventing  Azerbaijan from signing the Bishkek agreement is the problem of  de facto recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as an independent party  to the conflict. The leader of the upper house of parliament  considers that a cease-fire in the conflict zone will only be  possible when Azerbaijan recognizes Nagorno-Karabakh's  independence.</p>

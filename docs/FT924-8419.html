			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Too many eggs in one basket: British pension funds may be too dependent on equities As Britain's Pounds 350bn company pension funds seek to repair the damage to confidence caused by the year-old Maxwell scandal, are they ignoring a much bigger danger that may be creeping up on them almost unnoticed? Leading pensions experts are now becoming worried that pension fund trustees are not sufficiently alert to the dangers of the current economic climate. 'Unless the UK and the rest of the world make a sharp recovery from recession, the risks are real and imminent,' according to Mr Tim Gardener, a leading consulting actuary. To an extraordinary extent pension funds are now dependent on the health of equity markets, in which they have nearly 85 per cent of their assets (roughly two-thirds in the UK and one-third abroad). More specifically, pension funds are sensitive to the growth of the dividends of British listed companies. During the 1980s these dividends rose remarkably, averaging increases of 14 per cent a year during the second half of the decade, and effectively generating the huge pension scheme surpluses which have come to be seen as normal. But this growth collapsed to 5 1/2 per cent last year and could be slightly negative for 1992. City analysts talk comfortingly of a recovery to 5 per cent growth next year. But some pensions actuaries wonder what might happen should the recession extend and deepen in 1993, which is scarcely a remote possibility as problems spread to continental Europe and the danger grows of a transatlantic trade war. Mr Gardener, who heads the investment side of Mercer Fraser, one of the top three firms of pension fund actuaries and consultants, warns that the next big pension scandal could be caused by 'the combined effect of optimistic actuarial assumptions and an inappropriate asset strategy'. Some of his fears are shared by Mr Stephen Gooch at a rival firm, Clay &amp; Partners. 'Some actuaries have moved rather too optimistically in their assumptions,' he says. 'The situation could turn in the wrong direction quite quickly.' The crisis, if there is one, will develop through the interplay of three obscure and technical characteristics of the UK corporate pensions industry. The use of special actuarial valuation methods could rebound in certain circumstances. Widespread reliance on median fund benchmarks (in plain English, this means that fund managers copy each others' spread of assets) has driven funds to an unprecedented dependence on risky equities. Many British company schemes are now comparatively mature, which means that they have large and imminent obligations to pay out pensions, but may be receiving a proportionately small flow of contributions from members in employment and sponsoring companies. According to Mr Gardener, the typical actuary is now valuing the assets of pension funds 10 to 25 per cent higher than market prices. This is because share portfolios are valued on the basis of assumed income growth. These methods have served British pension funds splendidly in the past; for example, they sailed through the 1987 stock market crash without even blinking, because dividend growth continued strongly all the while. Such actuarial valuations have been conducted on the basis of what were thought to be prudent projections of nominal dividend growth rates of about 4 1/2 to 5 per cent a year. Until quite recently these assumptions proved in practice to be too cautious in the short run, and much higher actual income growth has led to the appearance of so-called 'surpluses'. These are not piles of cash but only the theoretical result of somewhat arbitrary guesses and calculations about the future. However, there have been very real struggles between companies and workforces over the 'ownership' of these flights of actuarial fancy. There have also been real effects on corporate behaviour, because the surpluses have encouraged companies to cut contributions (many are still enjoying complete 'holidays') and thereby boost their profits and dividends. 'Actuaries have had it easy for 10 years,' says Mr Bryn Davies, an independent actuary who advises trade unions and local authorities. At the same time, 'finance directors have become addicted to pension fund holidays. They have come to regard them as permanent.' Mr Davies calculates a surplus index based upon movements in dividends and employee earnings. Although somewhat theoretical, it clearly shows that schemes coming up for their normal three-year valuations are facing steadily worsening conditions. In fact a virtuous circle developed in the late 1980s - rising dividends led to pension scheme surpluses which in turn encouraged higher dividends and so on. A possible nightmare scenario for the 1990s is that this could be reversed into a disastrous vicious spiral in which profits and dividends chase each other downwards as companies are forced to raise their pension contributions, first to 'normal' levels and then to crisis proportions. A more immediate concern for some actuaries is that 'discontinuance' valuations are beginning to cause problems. The test here does not concern projections of income and expenditure into the distant future, but whether a scheme has enough assets at market values to meet its liabilities in respect of past service should it be wound up tomorrow. In times of mass redundancies and company collapses, these are far from theoretical considerations. As interest rates fall it is becoming more expensive for wound-up schemes to buy insurance policies which will guarantee future pensions. Actuaries say that unless equity market values improve soon the number of technically insolvent funds will increase sharply. In fact the stock market has bounced back since Black Wednesday, but overall growth in share prices for the year so far has been modest and overseas markets have been disappointing too. 'The ethos that equities are the only assets for pension funds is erroneous,' argues one leading manager, whose portfolios have a roughly 70 per cent equity content, against the typical 83 per cent. He would prefer a still lower equity exposure, but considers that the risks of departing from conventional wisdom would be too uncomfortable both for his firm and for his clients,the boards of trustees. The prevalent median benchmark - fund managers are given a target of beating the performance of the typical pension fund - means that asset allocation is backward-looking. Instead of selling overvalued asset classes and buying cheaper ones, fund managers are locked into assets which have performed well in previous years but which they cannot sell because any switches would take them too far away from the benchmark. Mr Richard Fitzalan Howard is in charge of UK pension fund asset allocation at Robert Fleming, a leading City of London manager. He reports that nearly three-quarters of his clients set a median benchmark. 'An increasing number of clients are adopting customised benchmarks suitable for their profiles,' he says. 'But it is taking quite a long time for this to sink in.' The maturity factor could mean that any pensions funding crisis would be more difficult to handle than the last one in the mid-1970s, when pension schemes typically had few immediate liabilities but a great many contributing members, and could make substantial improvements to their solvency through relatively affordable increases in contribution rates. As Mr Gooch of Clays puts it: 'The size of pension fund assets is five times bigger in real terms than in the 1970s. The impact of unexpected investment setbacks will therefore be five times greater.' According to Mr Gardener it is not uncommon these days to find a fund where more than 50 per cent of liabilities relate to pensions currently in payment. It will need a lot of cash year by year to meet these obligations. If dividends fall it could experience some difficulties. He considers that, whereas pension funds are currently configured to protect their assets against the long-term risk of inflation, they are wide open to the short-term risk of economic recession. 'The guns are facing the wrong way,' he says. In fact pension schemes that are immature can continue to stick quite safely with equities, almost whatever happens. In the very long run, history shows that equities give the best return. If there are temporary problems with dividend growth, the problem can be adequately covered by juggling the actuarial assumptions and the contribution rates. But for the majority of schemes there is now a strong argument for diversifying their assets. Essentially this means buying bonds. There will be no shortage: the British government will be selling large quantities of gilt-edged bonds over the next few years, and overseas the US and German governments will be issuing great volumes too. Fund managers will have to be given different benchmarks, probably involving minimum, higher, exposures to bonds. At present, the average fund has a bare 11 per cent in bonds and perhaps this should go up to, say, 25 per cent, which is roughly what the funds had at the beginning of the 1980s, and compares with about 35 per cent at present for US pension funds. Yet this is much easier said than done. It could imply dumping Pounds 35bn of UK equities, with disastrous consequences for prices. Ideally the shift would be managed through cash flow, but the growing maturity of the funds means that cash flow is barely positive. Pension funds have manoeuvred themselves into a position where they own more than 30 per cent of UK equities. They may be helplessly stuck. But perhaps, after all, there is really no problem. Pension funds endured Britain's two uncomfortable years in the European exchange rate mechanism, when bonds significantly outperformed equities, but fund managers made no strategic adjustments. Now they have emerged into an altogether more familiar climate of devaluation and a dash for recovery. Given an improvement in the economy and a modest upturn in dividend growth, the actuaries, trustees and fund managers can relax and pursue their former objectives with renewed confidence. But what if the recovery deepens? Over-optimism could be punished. It may be that the people in the middle of the next big pensions scandal, in which thousands of pensioners will be denied their reasonable expectations, will not be fat and fraudulent financiers but honest and reasonable pension scheme trustees who thought that it was safe and proper to do more or less what everybody else did but in the end were caught looking in completely the wrong direction.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Fenner profits halve FENNER, the diversified Hull-based manufacturing and distribution group, yesterday announced an abrupt end to a period of sustained growth with pre-tax profits nearly halved from Pounds 7.26m to Pounds 3.71m for the first half of 1990/91. The shares fell 4p to 132p underlining the severity and suddenness of the recession which hit UK heavy manufacturing last autumn. Profits in the year 1989/90 rose 21 per cent to Pounds 16.1m, but analysts now expect the total for the current year to be about Pounds 8.5m-Pounds 9m. Turnover for the first half slipped from Pounds 102.5m to Pounds 100.5m. The interim dividend is held at 3.45p. Mr Peter Barker, chairman, said this reflected the strengths of the businesses. Fenner has cut 350 jobs, or some 15% of its workforce, in the current year. This would be reflected by a Pounds 6m provision. On the outlook, Mr Barker said 'signs are apparent that demand levels are now stabilising,' but the economic recovery widely forecast for the latter part of 1991 was unlikely to come in time to influence the outcome in the current year.</p>

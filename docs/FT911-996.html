			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Arts: The Women of Troy - Belgrade Studio, Coventry Euripides' The Women of Troy was first acted in 415 BC, immediately after the Greeks had sacked Melos, and while they prepared for the Sicilian campaign. Its anti-war ethic bears the imprint of its origins; but it is as relevant now as it was during the Peleponnesian War. For this is a play about the aftermath of war: its survivors, refugees, and criminals. The central debate of the play is simple: is it better to survive to face fresh horrors, or better to have died in the war? The Greek levelling of Troy provides the background to the action which, like the current scenes from Zakho or Amadiyah, is unbearable misery. Aristotle believed that tragedy was a work-out for the emotions, exercising the extremes we would not normally find in ourselves; The Women of Troy certainly depends on the pity of others' plight, and fear at their grief. The Greeks saw tragedies in groups of three, and appended a satyr-play to lighten the proceedings. But here, the action is all the more concentrated for being singular. The central figure is Hecuba, mother of Hector and wife of Priam. She hears that her sons are dead; her daughter, Cassandra, enslaved; her son's wife, Andromache, abducted; and her grandson, Astyanax, thrown off the ramparts. She then has the chance to indict Helen, the cause of all the suffering, while a vacillating Menelaus (Helen's first husband) looks on. The play ends as Troy burns and Hecubais taken off to Odysseus' ship. Euripides adds his own sharp ironies: each crop of horrors is prefaced by a sentiment of relative content: 'There is no agony we don't already feel, no abyss of pain we can discover.' He charts the reaction of victims who have to give more for less and less. When Edward Bond wrote his version, The Woman (1978), he followed the Euripidean logic that each new loss should be worse than the last. The Women of Troy pitches headlong into misery. The physical brutalities happen off-stage, but are all meticulously delivered by messengers and chorus. This keeps the mind full of horrors, and lets the eye focus on the issues embodied in the actors on stage. Greek tragedies have no knowledge of 20th-century psychology: here, characters emerge from the plot. A tendency to over-naturalism nags at an otherwise exemplary production at the Belgrade Studio. The cast of six is uniformly excellent; Margaret Robertson (Hecuba), Alison Skilbeck (Andromache) and David Hobbs (Poseidon, Menelaus) in particular find extraordinary range and power. And if Richard Osborne's direction is somewhat anxious, the play's issues are never obscured. But this is a fine account of the play which remains current. Hecuba asks the question: 'How can I suffer this and learn to bear it?' in face of new disasters she has not yet met. Meanwhile, on the Turkish border at Cukurca just north of Amadiyah, the arriving Kurdish refugees  - survivors of cold and hunger - face an outbreak of cholera.</p>

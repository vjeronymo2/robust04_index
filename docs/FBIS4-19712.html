			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mirella Kalostipi from Washington </F> -- live]    [Text] Good evening from Washington. Before discussing the  details of meetings Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias held at  the U.S. State Department, I must say that the minister's  scheduled meeting with Anthony Lake, the U.S. presidential  adviser on national security issues, was canceled. The reason  is that the U.S. National Security Council is conferring today  after U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to escalate attacks  against Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. So Lake probably  had no time to meet Papoulias.    The foreign minister went to the State Department at around  1030 to meet Warren Christopher, his counterpart; Deputy  Secretary of State Strobe Talbott; and Matthew Nimetz, the U.S.  presidential envoy to Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia, FYROM]. Answering a question before meeting  Papoulias, Christopher said: The United States does not intend  to ask Greece to lift the measures against Skopje unilaterally.  At least this will not happen before international mediator  Cyrus Vance and Nimetz conclude their mediation efforts. He  added that Greece will decide whether to lift the measures.  Christopher clarified that there is no disagreement on this  issue between the State Department and the White House. There  have been rumors that the State Department is pressing the White  House to put pressure on Greece to lift the measures against  Skopje.    The U.S. secretary of state said that according to Nimetz's  report, the differences between Greece and the Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia [as heard] appear to be diminishing.  Christopher said he hopes the parties can reach a preliminary  agreement that will lead to lifting the embargo. This is  important because essentially Christopher expressed the hope  that the talks would proceed according to the procedure proposed  by Greece.    After meeting Christopher, Papoulias was asked about this  issue. He expressed very reserved optimism, saying that no  significant progress has been achieved. He explained to  Christopher the Greek Government's positions on smoothing  Athens-Skopje relations. The foreign minister said he did not  ask the United States to postpone establishing diplomatic  relations with Skopje, adding that the United States must  intervene to break Skopje's intransigence. He stressed that the  efforts continue. Papoulias will meet Vance in New York on  Monday morning [25 April].    Papoulias and Christopher discussed the Bosnian crisis, the  Cyprus issue, Greek-Turkish relations, and Greek-Albanian  relations. Afterward, Papoulias met Nimetz and discussed Skopje.  He also explained the Greek side's great concerns about  incidents in Fanari.    Papoulias left open the possibility of Greece taking  additional measures against Albania, over and above the  demarches that have already been made to Van der Stoel, the CSCE  high commissioner on human rights, and the UN Security Council.  On his way to the State Department, Papoulias said that we are  not discussing the deportation of Albanians. In a statement he  made yesterday, referring to the arrests of Greek minority  members by the Albanian authorities, Papoulias expressed the  Greek Government's rage and said that every step will be taken  to defend the Greek minority's internationally respected human  rights.    Papoulias and Christopher discussed Greek-Albanian relations  in the context of respect for the minority's human rights.  Papoulias said later that he asked the United States to  intervene so that human rights in Albania are respected.</p>

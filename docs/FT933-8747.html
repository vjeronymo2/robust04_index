			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Canadian forestry shaken to its roots - The industry faces another bout of upheaval ANY industry which has racked up losses of CDollars 4bn (USDollars 3.1bn) in less than three years is bound to feel some after-shocks. In the case of Canada's forestry sector, the upheaval is shaking many of the biggest companies to their roots. Further evidence of the industry's structural shift came this week with the decision by Canadian Pacific, the transport and energy conglomerate, to unload its entire 61 per cent stake in its lossmaking pulp and paper subsidiary, CP Forest. CP Forest joins a growing list of forestry companies emerging from the sheltered embrace of a controlling shareholder into the more bracing environment of a widely-held public company: Earlier this year, Toronto's Bronfman group spun off its controlling interest in MacMillan Bloedel, the biggest west coast forestry company; An 82 per cent stake in Abitibi-Price, one of North America's biggest newsprint producers, is in the hands of an international banking consortium after the collapse of Olympia &amp; York, the real estate developer. O&amp;Y had pledged the shares as collateral for a large loan. According to one analyst, at least one of the banks has started selling Abitibi shares into the market; New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge is cutting its stake in Fletcher Challenge Canada from 72 per cent to 51 per cent; After 80 years as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune, Quno, an Ontario-based newsprint maker, is now a publicly-traded company in which its former parent has a 49 per cent stake. Meanwhile, a handful of smaller lumber producers have gone public, taking advantage of rocketing timber prices earlier this year. The shake-out is not over. Mr Ken Copeland, director of syndication at Nesbitt Thomson, the securities firm which led the underwriting group for the CP Forest deal, says that 'if you're a private company and you ever thought about going public, the market is very receptive.' Stone Container of Chicago has given notice of plans to spin off part of wholly-owned Stone-Consolidated, a Montreal-based newsprint producer. Mr Richard Kellertas, analyst at McLean McCarthy in Montreal, says that other groups which may be set adrift by key shareholders include Weldwood, controlled by the US group Champion International; Crestbrook Forest Industries, in which Mitsubishi of Japan has a 25 per cent stake; and Domtar, the papermaker controlled by the Caisse de Depot et Placement, the Quebec public-sector pension fund. The turbulence fits a pattern seen in previous cycles in the forestry sector. Parent companies, many of them laden with debt and strapped for cash, have become unable and/or unwilling to keep supporting subsidiaries through quarter after quarter of red ink. CP Forest, for instance, has been a significant drag on Canadian Pacific, pulling down its operating income by CDollars 91.2m in the first six months of this year, and CDollars 152.7m a year earlier. Companies such as CP, Stone and Fletcher Challenge are now running out of patience as they come under pressure from bankers and investors. Prices of newsprint and pulp, the staples of the Canadian forestry industry, are still in the doldrums. While newsprint producers are crossing their fingers for a modest recovery later this year, pulp mills have reconciled themselves to a weak market well into 1994. Many companies' financial strength will continue to be sapped even when the recovery gets underway. Keeping pace with increasingly stringent environmental laws will require heavy spending on recycling and pollution abatement equipment. In contrast to disenchanted parent companies, outside investors are attracted by what may prove to be bargain share prices once commodity markets improve. The Bronfmans' sold their MacMillan Bloedel shares last March for CDollars 17.50 apiece. Earlier this week, they were trading at CDollars 22.62. The transformation from a closely-held entity to one with a widely-dispersed group of public shareholders is also likely to create turbulence within many companies. CP Forest is among those renowned for its slow-moving management. The pressure to perform is now likely to intensify. As Mr Kellertas puts it, these companies 'now have a lot of shareholders to answer to, and shareholders typically vote with their feet if they're not happy.' MacMillan Bloedel has already responded by launching a far-reaching review of its businesses. The review, to be completed around the end of this year, could result in a more focused business strategy. Wide ownership may turn out to be only the first stage of a drawn-out process of change in the industry. Over the next year or two, a wave of mergers, takeovers and asset disposals could separate the trees from the saplings.</p>

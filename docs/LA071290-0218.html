			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DRAGNET FOR N.Y. ZODIAC KILLER FAILS TO FLUSH OUT GUNMAN  </P> <P> An elaborate police dragnet fanned out across the city from midnight to dawn  today in vain as the Zodiac killer who targets his victims by their  astrological signs did not strike.  </P> <P> Hundreds of plainclothes officers were forced to extend their 4  p.m.-to-midnight shifts Wednesday by six hours.  </P> <P> Uniformed officers assigned to Operation Watchdog questioned at least one  suspect but failed to flush out the gunman and called off their search at 6  a.m.  </P> <P> "This guy didn't strike," said Sgt. Diane Kubler, a police spokeswoman.  </P> <P> The astrology-obsessed gunman, who has struck only in the pre-dawn hours on  Thursdays at 21-day intervals, has shot four men at close range since March 8,  killing one.  </P> <P> Investigators from the special 50-detective Zodiac Task Force questioned one  suspect who resembled a police sketch of a man believed to be the killer. After  releasing the man, police gave him a letter certifying that he had been  questioned and he was "not the Zodiac."  </P></p>

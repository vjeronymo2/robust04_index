			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Managing director of Norwegian bank resigns Mr Leif Klevan, managing director of state-owned Fokus Bank, Norway's third-largest commercial bank, yesterday resigned following revelations of alleged irregularities connected to the disposal of a property shareholding. Mr Klevan has led Fokus through a successful restructuring, in which the bank has been cut back to a regional operation serving mid-Norway from a loss-making operation with branches throughout the country. His resignation follows reports in which it emerged that Fokus Eiendom, the bank's property unit which is chaired by Mr Klevan, allegedly sold a 37 per cent stake in a shopping centre in southern Norway, at cost, to close acquaintances of the bank. The report, published last week in Norway, claimed that the buyers of the Farmandstredet shopping centre stood to make a gain of up to NKr20m (Dollars 2.8m) on a re-sale of the property. The board of Fokus held an emergency meeting at the weekend and yesterday announced Mr Klevan's resignation. While the board did not specifically confirm that Mr Klevan had full knowledge of the affair, it said greater caution should have been exercised over the unit's 'informal talks' with the buyers of the Farmandstredet shareholding, and that Mr Klevan should have been sufficiently informed about the disposal. The board has appointed Mr Bjarne Borgersen, an executive with Fokus Bank, as Mr Klevan's interim replacement until a permanent appointment is made. Christiania Bank, Norway's second-largest commercial bank, has entered negotiations to acquire Vestenfjeldeske Bykreditt, a mortgage institution with assets of NKr7.4bn. The parties hope to conclude the discussions as soon as possible, Christiania said. With the mortgage company's preference shares trading at NKr113 each, it has a market value of around NKr320m. Christiania said negotiations with the Vestenfjeldeske's board were continuing but that it had not yet made an offer for the company.</p>

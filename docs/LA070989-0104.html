			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW DEVICE SOUNDS OFF BEFORE QUAKE RUMBLES BY  </P> <P> The classroom of 4-year-olds was observing a morning rest period. The 20 or so  children napped, assembled puzzles at tables or played in a miniature kitchen.  </P> <P> Suddenly, a high-pitched tone pierced through the day-care center. Children  looked up and then ducked beneath their desks as they had been drilled. Their  teacher called out instructions, then moved to a doorway.  </P> <P> Three seconds later, the June 12 earthquake centered beneath Montebello rumbled  through the Culver City Tiny Tots preschool. While the floor shook and windows  rattled in the 4.5-magnitude temblor, children crouched under desks, hands  folded over their necks. At the same time, another class on the playground had  moved away from the building, while a third group ducked below tables in  another part of the school.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Met With Skepticism  </P> <P> The alarm worked again half an hour later for the 4.3 aftershock.  </P> <P> The school's 65 children, ages 2 to 6, had reacted to a new, low-cost  earthquake warning device donated by one student's father.  </P> <P> David Elliot, 38, and two friends are the creators of California QuakeAwake, a  $30-device shaped like a white triangular smoke alarm said to provide up to 30  seconds' warning of approaching temblors.  </P> <P> Although the earthquakes were relatively minor, Elliot and fellow entrepreneurs  Ken Caillat and David Elston believe their product passed a crucial test.  </P> <P> Since it began two years ago as an idea in a Malibu guest house, the device  manufactured by California QuakeAwake Inc. has frequently encountered skeptics.  But, since production began last December, the Century City company has seen  sales slowly climb and has distributed 10,000 QuakeAwake alarms to 200 stores  in California and Utah.  </P> <P> Chain retailers, including Fedco, Home Club and National Lumber, have stocked  alarms, and the entrepreneurs are directing marketing efforts at other  earthquake-leery regions worldwide, including Japan, Mexico, Taiwan and eastern  Europe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Technology Sound  </P> <P> State earthquake experts say the alarm's technology is sound.  </P> <P> "The principle behind these devices is valid," says Wilfred D. Iwan, Caltech  professor of engineering and applied sciences and former chairman of the  California Seismic Safety Commission. Iwan, like all state and academic  officials contacted, does not endorse commercial products.  </P> <P> According to Iwan and the product's makers, the alarm works by sensing seismic  "waves" emitted by earthquakes. There are two kinds of waves: P-waves --  "pressure" or "primary" waves, and S-waves -- "secondary" or "shear" waves.  Seismic waves are analogous to sound waves but travel through the earth rather  than the air.  </P> <P> P-waves travel faster than S-waves and yield about one-fifth of a second  warning for each mile away from the epicenter.  </P> <P> A person on top of a quake's epicenter would receive almost no warning. But if  a quake occurred, say, on the San Andreas Fault, residents of Culver City 45  miles away could expect up to nine seconds of notice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slept Through Aftershock  </P> <P> Elliot, formerly a traveling merchandiser of promotional theater goods, saw the  need for an earthquake alarm when he slept through the 5.4-magnitude aftershock  of the October, 1987, Whittier quake. Staying in a guest room overlooking a  cliff at Caillat's Malibu home, the Culver City resident and father of two  nervously questioned Caillat, 42, about the prospects for a homemade alarm.  </P> <P> He discovered his friend had already tackled the problem: Caillat had taken a  cue from a dining room chandelier and hung a wrench next to a wall as a sort of  detector.  </P> <P> Within a day of the Whittier aftershock, the pair had built an electrical  prototype of the pendulum using the miniature "tilt" component in one of  Caillat's pinball machines. Calling himself a tinkerer and an inventor, Caillat  has designed items such as a talking doorbell and a record production studio.  In 1977, he won a Grammy Award for producing the rock album "Rumours" for  Fleetwood Mac.  </P> <P> By December, 1988, the pair had researched the P-wave, developed a prototype,  raised $40,000 from family investors and brought aboard Elston, 38, a  Connecticut real estate developer who moved to California in 1983. The three  began working out of Elston's Rancho Park apartment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Marketing Challenge  </P> <P> By last month, they were considering marketing strategies. Caillat and Elliot  watch as a mellow voice from the television set asks, "Are you prepared for a  major earthquake?"  </P> <P> Moments later, the answer: "With California QuakeAwake, you are."  </P> <P> Scrutinizing a two-minute video marketing clip, the pair review their latest  promotion. Elston is in New York City meeting potential investors.  </P> <P> Although the two men smile sheepishly at the video -- which ends as a heavy  picture frame drops onto a just-vacated infant's crib during a temblor -- they  are serious about taking advantage of a quake-wary Southern California market  and about their device's potential for saving lives.  </P> <P> Caillat imagines QuakeAwake's possibilities: Alarms in schools, hospitals and  factories. Shop awnings that spring open, sheltering pedestrians from falling  glass of skyscrapers. Window blinds that automatically shut in the home. Lathes  and machinery shutting down seconds before quakes strike, and computer-linked  water and gas lines shutting off in residences and businesses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Safety Issues Studied  </P> <P> After years of not taking commercial concerns seriously, Iwan said, California  authorities and the National Research Council have convened committees to  explore the usefulness of "real-time earthquake monitoring" and other quake  safety issues. The scientist, a member of the national panel, says there is  growing recognition of possibilities for immediate quake detection, especially  in areas of government emergency response.  </P> <P> Private application in homes and businesses, however, "really is a marketing  question," Iwan says.  </P> <P> The circumstances for marketing the product look ideal -- there is only one  competitor in the earthquake alarm field, and its products costs thousands of  dollars because it uses very sensitive technology. But the aspiring  manufacturers also know that at least five other companies have tried without  success to market earthquake detection devices in the United States.  </P> <P> Technological advances, computer communication possibilities and their own  marketing success have convinced the three that their wall-mounted device  offers better applications and reliability at lower cost than the earlier  devices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Rejection  </P> <P> Elliot says he and his partners have come a long way from their first idea for  a commercial product: a red and gold plastic box and pendulum set -- "basically  a Mickey Mouse-looking thing," he says -- that was rejected by the first design  agency they consulted.  </P> <P> And although they do not plan to market QuakeAwake in areas unaccustomed to  earthquakes -- such as New York, says Elston -- they're confident they can sell  their product to anyone willing to listen.  </P> <P> "The first reaction is always a chuckle at first," Elliot says.  </P> <P> "But once we explain what it does, that's when people go, 'Ah, I want one of  those.' "  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELI ARMS FIRMS SWITCH TO PLOWSHARES  </P> <P> Budget cuts at home and shrinking markets abroad under the effects of the Cold  War thaw are forcing arms makers in Israel to convert to civilian production to  avert an unparalleled business crisis.  </P> <P> Swords-to-plowshares, tanks-to-toys planning among Israeli defense industries  mirrors a process under way in the United States, where major contractors are  diversifying and cutting back labor forces in response to reduced military  spending.  </P> <P> In Israel, the success of the adjustment will go a long way to setting the pace  for the country's economic growth in this decade. State and privately owned  arms industries in Israel account for one-quarter of the country's industrial  output. Exports average about $1 billion a year to customers that include the  United States, Canada and Western European nations, as well as Third World  clients as far-flung as Singapore and Guatemala.  </P> <P> Because exports help bankroll the country's domestic industry, a slowdown in  that sector could also affect Israel's relative self-sufficiency in arms.  </P> <P> "You have to follow the market," said Phil Herman, a spokesman for Israel  Aircraft Industries, the country's largest military contractor. "With the  decrease in defense budgets, the military-industrial complex will be looking  for other missions to accomplish."  </P> <P> In its battle against chronic inflation, the government has shaved military  spending during the past several years, and there are calls for deeper cuts.  Michael Bruno, governor of the Bank of Israel, recently called for cuts of at  least $150 million a year from the defense budget.  </P> <P> His call, which set off a storm of debate, was based in part on reports that  Syria, considered Israel's most aggressive adversary, is reducing its defense  spending. The Soviet Union is reported to have told Syria that Moscow would no  longer bankroll Syria's effort to reach arms equality with Israel.  </P> <P> Israel's defense ministry is resisting cutbacks, arguing that the nation can  ill afford the risk of reduced levels of equipment and manpower.  </P> <P> "There are still many people in the defense establishment who believe that even  if peace is some day achieved, Israel's security situation will still be  regarded with the utmost gravity, and Israel will have to maintain its  vigilance," a ministry official told Israeli reporters.  </P> <P> Defense officials note that the struggle to put down the Arab uprising in the  occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank has also cut into outlays for equipment  designed for the defense of Israel's borders. Last year, the army spent about  $200 million on everything from bullets to new jails to battle the intifada, as  the Arab revolt is known. The expenditures were only partially made up for with  extra money from the treasury.  </P> <P> "The intifada has definitely cut into acquisition of new equipment," said  Shalom Eitan, a spokesman for Tadiran, the third-largest private industrial  firm.  </P> <P> Most Israeli defense firms have the advantage of already producing consumer  goods. Tadiran, for instance, makes a variety of appliances, including  refrigerators and microwave ovens.  </P> <P> "At least, Israeli companies won't be starting from scratch," commented Zeev  Eytan, a researcher at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, a defense think  tank.  </P> <P> But the end of the Cold War is compelling changes at a faster pace than  expected.  </P> <P> "No one knew that the Berlin Wall would fall so fast. Our plan, which had been  to move into civilian fields, is going to go faster than anticipated,"  Tadiran's Eitan predicted.  </P> <P> Tadiran began to sense the shifting mood during the final years of the Reagan  Administration when arms agreements showed the way to reduced superpower  tensions, Eitan said. The winding down of the war in Afghanistan and the  Iran-Iraq conflict were further signposts on the road to a new era.  </P> <P> Within Israel, budget cuts began to take hold three years ago, and Tadiran  began a difficult process of cutting its work force to 10,000 from 14,500. Its  current balance of military and civilian production, mainly in communications,  is 50-50. The company plans to move toward a 70%-30% mix in favor of civilian  sales, Eitan said.  </P> <P> Israel Aircraft is also beginning to market goods originally designed for the  military for civilian use.  </P> <P> "The only difference between military and civilian uses, in many cases, is that  the military product goes boom," spokesman Herman quipped.  </P> <P> For example, a pilotless airplane that was built for military reconnaissance is  now being advertised for use in televised monitoring of forest fires, oil  spills and even drug dealers carrying contraband across remote frontiers.  </P> <P> An exception to the trend at Israel Aircraft is its continuing effort to  develop a fighter jet. The company suffered a grave setback two years ago when  its Lavi fighter was canceled after it became clear that the Israeli government  could not afford to pay for development and that Washington, Israel's biggest  aid giver, was not interested in footing the bill. The company laid off about  6,000 of its 22,000 workers and lost tens of millions of dollars.  </P> <P> The new jet under study at Israel Aircraft is a more economical model. Company  officials deny that it is meant to make up for the Lavi cancellation.  </P> <P> "We are in the airplane business, and so we must look ahead. If we find a  customer for it, good," Herman said.  </P> <P> A cheaper fighter jet would seem ready-made for the regional conflicts that  still flourish outside the fading superpower rivalry.  </P> <P> "We can see just in the example of Panama that small conflicts and  low-intensity warfare are still around," Herman said.  </P> <P> The United States is Israel's biggest customer for military goods, with sales  estimated at $150 million, according to the Jaffee Center for Strategic  Studies. Among other top customers are Spain, which buys tank guns, tank fire  control systems and range finders; Chile (tanks and air-to-air missiles);  Brazil (surface-to-surface missiles); Colombia (transport planes and there are  reports of combat planes on order); Ecuador (air-to-air missiles, combat  planes) and South Africa (patrol boats, refueling aircraft, surface-to-surface  missiles and rifles).  </P> <P> Small customers are Haiti (Uzi submachine guns) and Zaire (small arms), and  Israel's government has reportedly embarked on efforts to expand sales to Third  World countries engaged in hostilities. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin recently  hinted that sales to Iran, which is recovering from its costly war with Iraq,  are under consideration. But Muslim Iran considers purchases from the Jewish  state taboo.  </P> <P> Press reports indicate that Israel's recently renewed diplomatic ties with  Ethiopia include supplies of arms to that country, which is trying to put down  a tenacious revolt by separatists.  </P></p>

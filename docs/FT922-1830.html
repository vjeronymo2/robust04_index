			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips on trade figures THE DOLLAR lost more than a pfennig against the D-Mark on the foreign exchange markets yesterday following news of a larger than expected US merchandise trade deficit, writes James Blitz. The deficit widened to Dollars 6.97bn in April from a revised Dollars 5.58bn for March, sending the dollar downwards as the American markets opened. Earlier, in late Asian trading, the US currency had appreciated to above DM1.58 following short-term positioning by dollar investors. Yesterday's trade figures, however, quickly pushed it down to a low of DM1.5630, before ending in London at DM1.5650 against a previous close of DM1.5780. In New York the dollar improved to a DM1.5673 finish. Underlying the dollar's drop is uncertainty about the US economy. A London analyst said he had revised downwards his view that the dollar could bottom out at DM1.56. The economic recovery remains weak and speculation about another easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve hangs over traders. Also playing on nerves is the strong candidacy of Mr Ross Perot for the US Presidency. A serious three-way contest for the American leadership makes it uncertain whether there will be a clear result. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London, said: 'Investors will have little appetite for acquiring dollars before the US election is out of the way.' The dollar's weakness was again a by-product of D-Mark strength. The Irish referendum on European union, the result of which will be known today, continued to worry traders. The Italian lira had a bad afternoon, dipping below L758 to the D-Mark and threatening to test its lower limit in the European Monetary System against the strongest currency, the Portuguese escudo. In response, the Bank of Italy moved up its short-term money market intervention rate by  1/2 percentage point to 14.8 per cent. The D-Mark was stronger against sterling, which closed  1/2 pfennig down at DM2.9200. The French franc was also softer against the German currency, at FFr3.3703 against FFr3.3690. The yen, although finishing firmer against the dollar, was weaker against the D-Mark, prompted by the overnight fall in the Japanese stock market. Stocks ended at a 68-month low, with the Nikkei average barely above 16,000. Suggestions that the leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will call for a higher yen at their summit next month are keeping the currency strong. But that strength may disappear if the Japanese economy weakens further. The yen ended down against the D-Mark at Y80.99, compared to a previous Y80.51.</p>

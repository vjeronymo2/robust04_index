			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / UK Bonds: Debenture holders face controversial default BY THE end of this week the UK debenture market could be faced with a rare and controversial default, the first such event to spring from the weakening UK property market. The case has already prompted many investors to take a closer look at the state of the assets backing their debentures, as well as the wording of the covenants covering their lending. And it has brought scrutiny of how well trustees protect their bond holders' interests. A Pounds 135m issue from London &amp; Provincial Shop, a subsidiary of Randsworth Acquisition, which is in receivership, seems likely to be called into default on Friday, following notice of breach of covenant issued ten days ago by Law Debenture Corporation, the trustee to the issue. Law Debenture's reason for issuing its notice - the sale by London &amp; Provincial in 1990 of a property over which the debenture holders had a charge - is disputed by the company, which claims it acted in accordance with the trust deed. These rival views could yet end up in court. London &amp; Provincial's problems go far beyond this, though. Bondholders were told earlier this month that a valuation in June of the properties backing the bonds had shown total assets to be worth only 1.18 times the Pounds 135m lent, compared with a covenanted agreement that the proportion would not fall below 1.5 times. Since June, the company estimates, its assets have fallen further, leaving it with cover of less than 1.1 times. The company also faces an interest payment to its debenture holders on January 6. Since its recent announcement of losses of Pounds 4.37m in the year to June, that payment has been in doubt. Defaults in the debenture market are few and far between - and even when they happen, investors are normally repaid in full (as happened when Rolls-Royce collapsed 20 years ago). In the past 30 years, only the Prince of Wales Dry Dock in Swansea and Mitchell Construction are thought to have left their debenture holders out of pocket. That helps to account for the tight spread on which debentures trade: MEPC's secured bonds, for instance, trade at a spread of about 110 basis points over gilts, compared with the 220 basis point spread of MEPC's unsecured debt - a difference of 110 basis points. For the strongest credits in the property sector, like Land Securities, the difference is around 55 basis points. The rarity of the situation has prompted debenture investors - mainly insurance companies - to scrutinise their portfolios with renewed interest. So far only Dares Estates, a property investment and development group which is seeking a financial restructuring, has been put on the official sick list. The London &amp; Provincial case has aroused investors' passions for other reasons too. Despite the lack of adequate asset cover, no formal valuation of the properties has been done under the terms of the debenture's trust deed (the June valuation came from the company's own advisers). Only after a formal valuation, and a further six-month period to allow the company to top up the asset cover, would the bondholders be able to call a breach of covenant. Some investors feel the trustee to the issue, Law Debenture, has failed to protect their interests. Six months ago, a substantial proportion of the holders asked the trustee to order a formal valuation, only to have their request rejected. Mr David Norris of Law Debenture still stands by that decision: an attempt by a receiver to sell London &amp; Provincial in full could have been harmed by such a move, if it revealed a low valuation, he says. Also, since the debentures do not mature until well into the next century, it seemed logical to react to a short-term fall in the property market by starting a series of actions which could lead to a technical default. Investors he spoke to afterwards agreed with the reasoning, says Mr Norris. He adds that London &amp; Provincial highlights one of the hazards of being a trustee: you are condemned if you act, and condemned if you do not. Others, though, claim the case raises more important questions. How well do trustees exercise their discretion - and are there other situations where they have effectively turned a blind eye to potential breaches of covenants, potentially to the detriment of investors? THERE is a view abroad in the City that another corner of the domestic sterling bond markets is about to spring into life. Judging by a significant shift in their financing costs, UK local authorities should soon return to the capital markets after a decade-long absence. The overall picture is clear from figures prepared by Baring Sterling Bonds. In 1981, local authorities had more than Pounds 2bn in bonds and loan stocks outstanding. By last year, that had fallen to under Pounds 300m. Authorities could borrow more cheaply from the Public Works Loan Board, which itself is funded through gilt issuance, so why turn to the markets? That picture has changed markedly. PWLB lending counts towards the UK's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, so rates have been pushed up to dissuade authorities from tapping the public purse. That effectively forces them into a form of public sector off-balance sheet finance - borrowings direct from banks or the bond markets. This phenomenon isn't restricted to the UK, but is becoming familiar across Europe as national fiscal positions deteriorate. Why, then, hasn't there already been a stampede of authorities to the sterling bond market? In part, perhaps, because the markets need time to reacquaint themselves with the authorities. In the 10 years since they were last big borrowers, the Hammersmith &amp; Fulham swaps case and a substantial shift in the relationship between central and local government have occurred. Also, authorities tend to move in unison. It seems unlikely that a single authority would move alone, without first having sounded out others: and some authorities may be concerned that, for political reasons, their names are not strong enough to demand an instant following. Logic suggests, though, that the authorities will appear before long.</p>

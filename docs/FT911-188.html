			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Berlin's back against the wall: The struggle to create a European aviation centre and an east-west gateway Pigeons still fly and nest in the large aircraft hangar at the run-down airport of Schoenefeld in what used to be East Berlin. Although Lufthansa has spent DM20m (Pounds 6.7m) modernising the old hangar to turn it into a maintenance base for Boeing 737 jets, the airline has so far failed to remove all the pigeons. The investment reflects both the ambitions and difficulties of Lufthansa, which, in the words of its chairman Mr Heinz Ruhnau, wants to transform Berlin into 'a new centre of European aviation and a gateway between east and west', following the unification of the two Germanys. Lufthansa returned to Berlin last October after a 45-year absence. It was an emotional moment. The airline was founded in Berlin in 1926. After the second world war, it was shut out from its home base with only the allied airlines, including British Airways, Air France and Pan American, allowed to use the three air corridors between Berlin and what was West Germany. The German flag carrier has wasted little time in re-establishing itself in Berlin. 'From zero, we now operate 286 weekly flights into Berlin,' said Mr Ruhnau, whose successor as Lufthansa chairman is expected to be announced tomorrow. But the euphoria has been tempered by the practical difficulties of the reunification process and, in the case of Lufthansa, of recreating a base in the city. Schoenefeld is just one example. 'The hangar was in a dreadful state,' said Mr Karl-Friedrich Rausch, Lufthansa's manager for aircraft maintenance in Berlin. He was walking around the maintenance plant which, until this year, was used by Interflug, the former East German airline which has just stopped its scheduled flights. 'We called in the Rentokil people but there are still some pigeons left,' he added. But the pigeons are the least of Lufthansa's worries in trying to expand its operations. The airline was planning to use Schoenefeld to launch new international services from Berlin because there was no room for expansion at the congested airport of Tegel in the former western part of the city. 'We started a service to New York this year but were forced to drop it. No one wanted to fly from Schoenefeld because of the state of the airport,' explained a Lufthansa official. Plans to improve and modernise Schoenefeld are in limbo. Mr Ruhnau is now campaigning for the construction of an airport 30 miles south of Berlin on the site of the present Soviet military air base of Sperenberg. This would provide the necessary infrastructure to meet the expected growth in air travel demand in the Berlin area. Even if he succeeds in persuading the authorities, it will take years to build the airport. Berlin's problem is acute. At present Tegel handles nearly 7m passengers a year, while Schoenefeld serves about 3m passengers largely with flights operated by east European carriers. 'By the year 2005, we expect demand in Berlin to rise to about 30m,' Mr Ruhnau said. 'Tegel could be enlarged but because it is in the middle of the city it cannot be expanded to handle more than 7m passengers a year. Schoenefeld could be expanded to serve 12m to 13m passengers a year but faces big problems. Berlin basically needs a new airport.' But it is not only the lack of adequate new airport capacity which risks clipping Lufthansa's ambitions. The current state of disarray of the Soviet and east European economies is expected to delay the development of east-west air travel. As the national flag carrier, Lufthansa faces the additional political pressure of helping to provide employment and new economic opportunities for former East Germans. 'The wall has come down but a new economic poverty wall has been erected between the rich west and the poor eastern side,' said a member of the Berlin Senate. Mr Ruhnau originally proposed to acquire a 26 per cent stake in Interflug and to absorb it gradually into the Lufthansa family. But the Treuhand, the body charged with selling or closing east German companies, as well as the German cartel office were opposed to the deal because they feared it would give Lufthansa a monopoly in Berlin. British Airways also showed an interest in buying a large stake in Interflug to help preserve its position in the Berlin market after unification. But BA was never able to see the Interflug accounts to help it decide whether to make such an investment. Instead BA, now facing intense competition from Lufthansa on internal German airline services, plans to form a new German-based airline with German banks and other financial institutions. Lufthansa was not prepared to wait for the Treuhand to change its mind and allow it to buy a stake in Interflug. It decided to develop its new Berlin hub alone. It bought for Dollars 150m the internal German services of Pan Am, the US carrier desperate for cash; negotiated a new agreement with Air France to take over the management of the joint Euro-Berlin airline subsidiary set up three years ago under French control to offer flights out of Berlin; and launched a series of services to Germany and other international destinations. The airline has hired almost 1,000 former Interflug employees, including 450 at its Schoenefeld maintenance facility, to staff its Berlin operations. 'I'm not responsible for Interflug but we have always tried to help the people of Interflug,' Mr Ruhnau said. But with the demise of the former East German airline, Lufthansa is being pressed to hire more Interflug employees. Interflug was heavily over-staffed like other East German enterprises. ' All East German companies had two chains of employment. One was the management, the other the party,' said Mr Ruhnau. 'At Interflug there were four chains: a secret service chain and an army chain as well.' More than 6,000 people were employed by Interflug. There are still about 2,800 who have yet to find new jobs. This includes 215 pilots. 'I don't know how it will be possible to retrain these pilots to fly western aircraft,' Mr Ruhnau said. However, Lufthansa has just set up a company to help retrain Interflug employees with the backing and funding of Germany's national employment organisation. 'The company will make an offer to all employees still with Interflug to get new qualifications to give them a better chance of finding a job in the airline or service-related industries. If air traffic in Berlin picks up and we have a demand for additional people, newly qualified Interflug employees will get priority,' Mr Ruhnau explained. Despite the enormous economic uncertainties facing the fledgling eastern democracies, and the current turmoil in the airline industry, Mr Ruhnau is convinced Lufthansa's strategy of expanding in both east and west Europe will ultimately pay off. He expects the east-west European airline market to show higher than average growth over the next 20 years, of 10.4 per cent a year, compared with about 5-6 per cent for the industry as a whole. 'We are already the market leader and we will strengthen our position because all these countries are our neighbours and Germany already offers the majority of airline seats to east Europe,' he said. Lufthansa is now discussing close co-operation with LOT, the Polish airline, and an agreement is expected this summer. Mr Ruhnau has a long-term vision. 'The old expression of eastern and western Europe will disappear in a few years,' he said. 'Before the war we had a continental Europe or rather a middle Europe which was a source of great wealth. This will appear again and Berlin will be in the middle of it.' 'Look,' he added, 'Czechoslovakia once had the highest living standard in Europe. This will come again. History and tradition are much more important than some short-term thinking. All this opens new opportunities for Lufthansa.' Most of his own senior managers are more cautious. At present, 90 per cent of Berlin traffic is domestic German traffic, explained Mr Klaus Nittinger, the head of Lufthansa's passenger services. The international network out of Berlin remains weak. 'The growth of this network will be gradual. The west Berlin population is only 2m and cannot generate enough traffic to create a big market. The surrounding market is still pretty weak because the money is not there,' he added. But Mr Ruhnau believes he will confound the sceptics once more. At his company's annual meeting in Berlin in 1984, he was ridiculed for saying: 'The day will come when Lufthansa will again fly to an undivided Berlin.' Even if his latest prediction proves correct, Mr Ruhnau, who will be retiring next year, will leave a formidable task for his successor.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / VW advert upsets associate VOLKSWAGEN'S attempts to polish its tarnished corporate image have upset Dresdner Bank, one of its close associates, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. The bank, represented on the VW supervisory board by main board director Mr Bernd Voss, is believed to have complained to the motor group that it took liberties with its analysts' latest report on VW in an advertising campaign. A recent full-page newspaper advertisement touting VW shares drew heavily and selectively on an August 30 study from Dresdner International Advisors, which described the stock as 'under-valued'. The embarrassed bank said yesterday the extracts were taken out of context from a news agency report, and disregarded criticism of poor performance at the group's Seat subsidiary in Spain. The advertisement is part of a corporate campaign apparently designed to offset media criticism and the effects on the group's image of the continuing probe into allegations that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, production director, stole secrets from General Motors, his former employer.</p>

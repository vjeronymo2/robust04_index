			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chan Wai-fong] </F>   [Text] A human rights organization's application for legal  status has been rejected by Shanghai authorities who fear  creating a way for underground democratic movements to go  public. Shanghai's Civil Affairs Bureau told leaders of the  Chinese Human Rights Association that its application to  register had been rejected because it was not a "mass  organisation" according to the law. Association leaders were  told that the new body had to be affiliated with official  organisations such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions  if it wants to become legal.    Association spokesman Yang Zhou, a leading Shanghai  dissident, said: "This evidently contradicts the constitution,  which guarantees people's rights to organise." Mr Yang was  detained during French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's brief  visit to Shanghai last weekend. "Only the Communist Party can  say who is lawful and who is not. And no genuinely independent  mass organisation is allowed, although there are regulations  allowing such associations," Mr Yang said. "You are illegal and  may have to face criminal charges if you do not register. But  when you try to do so, there is no way that you will succeed,"  he said.    Officially submitted in March 1993, the association's  application for legal status has been pending for more than a  year. The group is so far the first non-government mainland  organisation with no official link whatsoever to seek legal  recognition. "They are handling it very carefully because there  is no precedent. And they know that if it is approved, it will  be a gateway for underground democratic activities to go  public," Mr Yang said. If the association became legal, similar  groups could then affiliate with it and register with the  Government which is something the authorities would rather  avoid, he said.    Civil Affairs Bureau officials have agreed to reconsider the  association's application in the future, but Mr Yang said it was  unlikely that approval would be granted this year. Unless there  were big changes in Beijing, the case would just be left hanging  in the air, he said.    But the activist said efforts to legalise the group would  not  be abandoned. "At the moment, we can only learn bits and pieces  about the situation of political prisoners through friends.  There is no way that we can visit prisoners, monitor works of  the judiciary, procuratorate and public security departments, or  make proposals unless we are officially recognised."</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Battle joined for Brazil's telecom market - AT&amp;T's attempt to break into the supply monopoly AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, is attempting to fight its way into Brazil's traditionally protectionist equipment supply market but it is meeting fierce opposition from the local operations of its rivals NEC, Ericsson and Siemens. They maintain that AT&amp;T's move is a 'predatory invasion' and are putting up stiff resistance to the US group's entry. The struggle is regarded as a microcosm of the debate on breaking the country's telecommunications monopoly. The case has provoked controversy, partly because under past military regimes telecommunications was one of Brazil's most sensitive areas and the government insisted on protecting locally based technology. The dispute centres on a contract for 55 switching centres, capable of providing 720,000 new telephone lines, offered for tender by Telebras, the state-controlled telecom company, last November. A surprise last-minute bid from AT&amp;T Network Systems do Brasil, a joint venture between AT&amp;T and a local company, sparked official complaints and legal action from NEC do Brasil, Ericsson Telecomunicacoes and Equitel, a Siemens-linked company, prompting President Itamar Franco to suspend the tender. AT&amp;T's bid is thought to be substantially lower than the three locally based companies. Brazil's telecom equipment market is worth about Dollars 2bn a year but, with a backlog of 10m lines due to under investment by Telebras, it could reach Dollars 5bn-Dollars 7bn by the end of the decade. 'This is just too big a market for us to give up. They might succeed in blocking us temporarily but we're not going away,' says Mr Antonio Carlos Gil, president of AT&amp;T Networks Systems do Brasil. According to Mr Sergio Goldman, research director at brokerage house Baring Securities Brasil, Telebras spends Dollars 3,000 in capital investment for each line installed, compared with Dollars 2,000 in Mexico and Dollars 1,000 in Chile. At least some of that difference is due to higher equipment costs, he says. 'Increasing competition in equipment supply will lower costs but some of the companies are unwilling to accept this competition and unfortunately they are influencing the government,' says Mr Goldman. Telebras's estimated capital spending of Dollars 3.2bn last year is regarded as half of what needs to be spent if demand is to be met and Brazil's very low ratio of 7.4 phone lines per 100 inhabitants, less than Mexico and Argentina, significantly expanded. Locally based companies argue that they invested in Brazilian production in return for a protected market. This system was abolished by former President Fernando Collor in 1990, and they now find themselves threatened by cheaper imports. Mr Verner Dittmer, president of Equitel, accepts that Brazil cannot ignore the world trend towards opening markets: 'I'm in favour of competition but the opening must be gradual. Even in the US there is protection for local industry against predatory invasion.' Mr Gilberto Garbi, president of NEC do Brasil, says other foreign companies, such as Alcatel of France, have entered the market since the abolition of the market reserve but have done so by establishing a local manufacturing base. 'The problem with AT&amp;T is the way it wants to come in, just importing and not contributing to local jobs,' he says. The local companies have threatened to shut down their Brazilian plants and import if AT&amp;T gets the contract. Mr Gil of AT&amp;T Network Systems says the company intends to assemble imported components at its plant in the free-trade zone of Manaus and later manufacture electronic boards there. But he stresses that production will take place 'where it is best for our business plan'. In a move apparently supporting the locally based companies and critical of Telebras, President Franco suspended the bid indefinitely on December 8, calling for a full investigation of AT&amp;T's Network Systems' bid paperwork. He said the tender would be cancelled if any irregularity were discovered by the Telebras inquiry. Shortly afterwards the government issued ordinances offering substantial tax incentives for locally made telecom equipment. For switching centres, local content must be 85 per cent in 1994 to qualify for the fiscal benefits, while AT&amp;T's equipment is initially expected to contain 35 per cent local content. The industry and commerce minister defended the measures, arguing that locally based companies needed more time to adapt to international competition. Mr Gil says AT&amp;T Network Systems is studying 'a number of options' in response to the measures, including speeding up its investment plans and possibly moving its production from Manaus to Curitiba in the south east of Brazil. The new measures will not affect the current contract unless the bid is cancelled and re-tendered, but Mr Garbi of NEC believes it is '99 per cent likely' that the government will cancel the bid and hold it again under the new rules. Even if AT&amp;T loses this battle, in the longer term the market seems likely to be opened. Finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso's proposals to amend the constitution and allow some kind of privatisation of Telebras's local service monopoly to be discussed in the pending constitutional review point to more competition. According to Mr Goldman, the current Telebras row provided another good reason for privatisation 'because a privatised company would not have the same political pressures and would buy from whoever it wanted'.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: LAWYER'S DEFENSE OF BITING NOVEL: THAT'S  ENTERTAINMENT  </P> <P> So what does a hard-charging defense attorney who specializes in notorious  clients and lost causes do in his spare time?  </P> <P> Writes a satiric novel about a hard-charging defense attorney who specializes  in notorious clients and lost causes, naturally.  </P> <P> Enter now "Wilkes: His Life and Crimes" (Ballantine paperback, 352 pages), by  Winston Schoonover, the nom de plume of noted San Diego defense attorney  Charles Sevilla.  </P> <P> It's what Sevilla has been doing when he's not trying to save Robert Alton  Harris from the gas chamber or Roger Hedgecock from the honor camp at Descanso.  </P> <P> "Wilkes" is a wicked and comic sendup of the overheated justice system. No one  escapes.  </P> <P> Not defense attorneys (maniacs), reporters (flacks for the prosecution), the  U.S. attorney ("the Useless Attorney"), cops (liars), psychiatrists (highly  paid liars) or probation officers ("court-designated hit men").  </P> <P> Judges ("black-robed pimps in the whorehouse of justice") get it the worst.  </P> <P> The book's anti-hero, John Wilkes, defender of point shavers, murderers and  lunatic bank robbers, thinks most judges are frustrated prosecutors.  </P> <P> One judge babbles in Latin. Another is heartbroken that he's never gotten to  sentence someone to die.  </P> <P> Most judges never saw a search warrant they didn't like or a criminal defendant  they did. A lady judge has a name that is a pun on female anatomy.  </P> <P> Wilkes to clients: "Will I defend you? I'll defend you to your very last cent."  </P> <P> His clients get depressed: "If they had any morals, they'd be demoralized."  </P> <P> He doesn't apologize for his high fees: "If you've got cancer, you don't go to  a free clinic."  </P> <P> Don't look for thinly disguised San Diego characters. The book's set in New  York City.  </P> <P> Still, Sevilla, 45, is prepared if some locals miss the humor.  </P> <P> "The book was written for entertainment," he said. "If people read it in that  fashion, I think they'll realize it is somewhat tongue-in-cheek.  </P> <P> "If not, tough."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Irish Eyes Are Watching  </P> <P> Here today, here tomorrow.  </P> <P> * Tonight's American Ireland Fund Committee black-tie dinner at the San Diego  Marriott will honor the Rev. Edward Malloy, president of the University of  Notre Dame.  </P> <P> The evening also will be dedicated to slain attorney Daniel Broderick.  </P> <P> And funds raised will help rebuild St. John's Square in Listowel, Ireland, the  Broderick ancestral home.  </P> <P> There's a downside: Marriott security has been alerted to watch for crashers  who may try to stage a demonstration in favor of Broderick's accused killer,  ex-wife Betty.  </P> <P> * Let's see if I have this straight.  </P> <P> Mike Aguirre, beaten by Bob Filner for City Council in 1987, files a lawsuit  that would force "pro-Latino" redistricting.  </P> <P> Not so coincidentally, the Aguirre suit would make Filner's reelection much  more difficult.  </P> <P> Bob Glaser, beaten by Bruce Henderson for City Council in 1987, co-authors a  redistricting map (counter to the Aguirre plan) that would force large-scale  "pro-environment" shifts.  </P> <P> Not so coincidentally, the Glaser map would make Henderson's reelection much  more difficult.  </P> <P> Ah, San Diego politics: where it's never over, even after it's over.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Take Your Sunscreen  </P> <P> It says here.  </P> <P> * The naked truth.  </P> <P> The Camping Bares, a San Diego family nudist group, has an active social  schedule, including a dance (Boogie-in-the-Buff) and river trip (Canuding).  </P> <P> Still, nudism is usually greeted with disapproving glances. Camping Bares  accepts this.  </P> <P> On its letterhead the group is described thusly: "An anarchist disorganization  dedicated to the destruction of the fabric of our society."  </P></p>

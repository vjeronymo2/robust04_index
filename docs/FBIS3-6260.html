The analyst goes on:    Japan's nuclear armament is an obstacle to the process of  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula because it can cause a  new nuclear arms race in this region.    If the situation on the Korean peninsula is to be eased and  denuclearization to be realized, nuclear weapons must be removed  in and around the region, above all. The nuclear armament being  promoted in Japan, however, will inevitably give rise to a new  nuclear arms race in the Korean peninsula and its surroundings.  Moreover, Japan takes the DPRK as the first target of attack for  its overseas aggression.    If the Korean peninsula is to be denuclearized, an  environment and conditions for it must be created in this  region. The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula  presupposes the removal of nuclear threat, and if it is to be  realized substantially, a nuclear threat must be eliminated in  its surroundings. Under the conditions where Japan is stepping  up its nuclear armament, the North-South joint declaration on  denuclearization will be reduced to a good-for-nothing one and  the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will be, in fact,  meaningless.    In actuality, the Japanese reactionaries do not want to see  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula settled, the  North-South joint declaration on denuclearization implemented  and the Korean peninsula turned into a nuclear-free, peace zone,  for they may lose the ground for nuclear armament when the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is fundamentally and  completely settled and this region is turned into a nuclear-free  zone. Their ulterior intention is to oppose the solution of the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, aggravate the military  confrontation and tension in this region and thus step up  Japan's nuclear armament on a legitimate basis.    The Japanese reactionaries must immediately stop their  criminal nuclear armament that snags the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula.</p>

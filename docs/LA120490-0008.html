			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N. APPROVES MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ  </P> <P> In response to "Marine in Growing Group of Enlisted Objectors," Part A, Nov.  27:  </P> <P> Why would anyone claim to be a conscientious objector after enlisting in the  Marine Corp for a six-year period? Don't conscientious objectors search their  souls before they enlist and accept pay, benefits and training or do they  accept military life and pray that they are never called to action? I'm proud  of those who have gone, who are there now, and who may go in the future. Thanks  to each and every one of you!  </P> <P> CLAUDIA SCHWARTZ, Agoura Hills  </P></p>

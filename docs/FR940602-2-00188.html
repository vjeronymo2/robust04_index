Project Reviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Designation of a sole source aquifer authorizes EPA to review federal financially-assisted projects proposed within the designated area. The principal mechanism used by EPA Region 10 to identify projects for review are Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with federal funding agencies. These MOUs outline procedures for screening and referring projects to EPA in order to ensure that only projects which may have a significant impact to ground water quality are reviewed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most projects referred to EPA for review meet all federal, state, and local ground water protection standards and are approved without any additional conditions being imposed. Occasionally, site or project-specific concerns for ground water quality protection lead to specific recommendations or additional pollution prevention requirements as a condition of funding. In rare cases, federal funding has been denied when the applicant has been either unwilling or unable to modify the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whenever feasible, EPA coordinates the review of proposed projects with other offices within EPA and with various federal, state, or local agencies that have a responsibility for ground water quality protection. Relevant information from such sources is given full consideration in the sole source aquifer review process. This coordination of project reviews can complement, support, and strengthen existing ground water protection mechanisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A public notice was issued on March 21, 1994, to request comments on the proposed designation and announce that a public hearing would be held if sufficient interest were expressed to EPA in advance. The hearing was subsequently cancelled due to a lack of interest. Only two written comments were received prior to the expiration of the public comment period on May 10, 1994. One letter was from a part-time Marrowstone Island resident who expressed support for the proposed designation. The other letter was from the president of the Marrowstone Island Community Association and also expressed support for the proposed designation. Neither party requested a public hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This determination affects only the Marrowstone Island Aquifer System located in the State of Washington. As a result of this determination, all federal financially-assisted projects proposed in the designated area will be subject to EPA review to ensure that they do not create a significant hazard to public health. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 19, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Chuck Clarke,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Regional Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;13452 Filed 6&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>   <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

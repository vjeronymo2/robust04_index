			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slightly firmer ahead of Fed meeting US Treasury prices were slightly firmer in light trading yesterday as dealers and investors waited on the sidelines for the results of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting. In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 5/32 at 84 5/16 , yielding 7.585 per cent. The two-year note up  3/32 at 99 25/32 , to yield 6.101 per cent. The market reopened after the July 4 holiday with all eyes on the Fed. The recent fall in the dollar has put pressure on the central bank to protect the currency, and some analysts were predicting the FOMC would decide to raise interest rates. Nervousness about such an outcome was behind an early retreat in bond prices, but the losses were modest and by the end of the morning Treasuries had returned to positive territory. The stability of the dollar also helped the recovery. The consensus on Wall Street remains that the FOMC will not change its stance on monetary policy just because of the dollar. If, however, the June employment report, due to be released on Friday, shows further strengthening in the economy, analysts say the Fed might decide to raise rates again to slow the pace of growth. European government bond markets fell back yesterday in thin, nervous trade as investors waited for the outcome of the FOMC meeting. Remarks by officials that there would be no move by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations to support the weak US dollar at their weekend meeting also put downward pressure on markets. 'Most investors are sidelined, looking for some reassurance that US rates are not moving upwards too far and too quickly and that rates in Europe are still on a downward course,' said Mr Neil Williams of UBS. 'If no signal has come by Monday, after the G7 summit, then there is likely to be a short-term correction downwards,' he said. Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg, said: 'The markets are lower on the prospect of renewed turbulence in the currency markets, if the G7 do nothing to solve the dollar's problems.' UK gilts recovered most of their earlier losses yesterday, largely in relief that no policy statement on interest rates had emerged from the US. Gilts had fallen sharply in early trade in line with the rest of Europe. They were unaffected by data showing a rise in house prices in June following two months of decline. They also shrugged off comments from Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, made at a parliamentary select committee hearing on the Treasury's summer forecast. 'Mr Clarke saying that there was no specific growth figure which would cause him to raise rates could have steepened the yield curve, but had little effect with nervousness about the US dominating,' said Mr Mark Reckless, economist at SG Warburg. The September long gilt future on Liffe was unchanged on the day at 100 9/32 in late trading. Attention today will be focused on the setting of rates for the Bundesbank's securities repurchase tender tomorrow. 'Anything less than a four to five basis point cut in the repo rate will be a disappointment and will indicate a slowing in the pace of rate cuts,' said one analyst. The German September government bond contract on Liffe was down 0.23 points at 91.90 in late trading. The September notional French bond futures contract on Matif closed at 114.2, down 0.9 points on the day. Follow-through buying in the wake of Monday's successful bond auction caused a short-lived rally yesterday in Swedish government bonds. But prices fell back after the meeting between Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, and Mr Goran Persson, economic spokesman for the opposition Social Democrat party, ended without any concrete proposals or agreements on limiting the growth of public sector debt. 'Underlying sentiment in the bond market remains fragile,' said Mr Kokko. Analysts said one of the main reasons why the auction was so successful was that foreign investors were attracted by the weakness of the Swedish krona and the high bond yields. They doubted how long these investors would remain in the Swedish market.</p>

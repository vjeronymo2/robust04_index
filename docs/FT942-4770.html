			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Bizarre British novelty The UK's Euro-campaign is unusual in focusing on European issues According to the conventional wisdom, elections to the European Parliament are not really about the European Parliament at all: they are a series of lukewarm national plebiscites, which have some relevance to national politics but not much to Europe. The voters know little about the Strasbourg assembly, and care rather less, fundamentally because the election of the European Parliament does not lead to the formation of a European government. A Euro-campaign is really just an extension of national politics. That's the conventional wisdom, and as far as it goes it is generally true. In Germany, this week's Euro-vote is a dry run before the federal elections in the autumn; and in France it is the last national vote before the presidential elections next spring. But what's new and interesting is that the conventional wisdom does not seem to be operating quite so well in Britain. This week's vote is supposed to be a plebiscite on the domestic standing of John Major and the Conservative government. But if so, why has the campaign been hijacked by arguments over Europe? Why have the politicians been harping on about the single currency and the opt-outs, about variable geometry and the national veto? Why has Mr Major scarcely been able to let a day pass without giving some new definition of his multispeed, multi-layered vision of Europe? Contrary to the conventional wisdom, this Euro-election campaign has been dominated by European issues. On the face of it, this is a bizarre novelty. In the past, politicians treated Europe as something alien which happened 'over there'. Where it could not be reduced to mercantilist arguments about the British budget rebate, it could safely be trivialised as an atavistic jousting match against all those foreigners. In this year's Euro-debate, however, we have heard much less of such breezy sporting metaphors. And the reason, perhaps, is that it is becoming increasingly clear that the Maastricht treaty, dreadful experience though it may have been, was not the end of the story, not by a long chalk. It was Mr Major, if you recall, who summed up the 253 pages of the treaty in the memorable words: 'Game, set and match to Britain.' The phrase implied a triumphant, or at least a defiant, finality about that marathon. It now seems probable that the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) to revise Maastricht will be even more gruelling than Maastricht. It will be especially gruelling for the UK, because the British government seems to be getting further and further out of step with its major partners. Mr Major is arguing for a fluid, amoeba-like Europe; but the Germans are pressing for a more integrated Europe, and it is they who will set the agenda, because they are now the leaders of the majority of member states. No doubt they will be rejoined by their traditional French allies, once the French have elected a new president and (with luck) resolved the schism over Europe inside the conservative coalition. But for the moment the Germans will call the tune. The tune they are calling is uncompromisingly integrationist. Karl Lamers, the foreign policy spokesman of the ruling Christian Democrat party, openly calls for the drafting of a European constitution to define who does what. British Euro-sceptics tend to pooh-pooh the Lamers line, on the grounds that he is an unrepresentative Euro-federalist; and the people in the chancellor's office in Bonn explicitly disclaim any intention of pressing for a European constitution. But when you listen to what they say in detail, it's hard to see what else they mean. I talked to a very senior official in Germany last week: 'No,' he said, 'we don't want a constitution; we must just make improvements in the Maastricht treaty. But in 1996 we must try to divide the policy competences between the Community and the member states more precisely.' The Germans are no doubt anxious not to set off the alarm bells in London; but this sounds like the beginnings of a federal constitution under another name. In detail, the Germans want a much stronger European Parliament, and a strengthening of foreign policy co-operation. They will also press for much closer co-operation on police, justice and immigration policies, by transforming them from issues of inter-governmental co-operation to full European Union status. Moreover, Chancellor Helmut Kohl remains unrepentantly committed to a single European currency, sooner or later; and now the head of the Bundesbank has called for closer political and monetary links between an inner core of the member states, as a precondition for any further enlargement to the east. In the light of all that is known about the priorities of Germany and a majority of the other member states, it is baffling that John Major should deliberately have manoeuvred himself, in this Euro-election campaign, into a position which guarantees the maximum conflict with Britain's partners in the coming IGC. 'In 1996,' says a very senior Brussels diplomat, 'there are only four possible outcomes. We may have a new tight treaty; and the British will opt out of it. We may have a new loose treaty: and an inner core of states will go ahead without the British. We may have a multispeed treaty; and the British will opt for the slow lane. Or we may have a complete breakdown.' In other words, he already discounts any possibility of Britain keeping up with the pace of integration. This may seem a pity; but at least we are having a debate about it, even in a European Parliament election campaign.</p>

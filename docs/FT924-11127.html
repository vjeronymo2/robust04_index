			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: SC Johnson to acquire Drackett BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, the world's third-biggest pharmaceuticals company, is selling its Drackett household product business for Dollars 1.15bn in cash to SC Johnson &amp; Son, a privately-held consumer products company. Bristol-Myers announced in July it intended to sell Drackett in a move to sharpen its competitive edge in the drugs industry. Drackett contributed about Dollars 600m to Bristol-Myers's Dollars 11.2bn 1991 sales. Analysts had expected the business to fetch about Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.25bn. On Wall Street, shares in Bristol-Myers rose Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 66 5/8 but disappointment with its performance this year has driven the company's share price down from a 52-week high of Dollars 90 1/8 . Bristol-Myers's place in the changing pharmaceuticals market is unclear. The company reported profits growth of only 5 per cent in the first nine months of this year, against Merck's 17 per cent improvement in the same period. The disposal of Drackett is an important step as the company increases its focus on health care. Mr Viren Mehta, partner at Mehta and Isaly in New York, said: 'Drugs companies need to be able to maintain a high-risk high-profit pharmaceuticals business. The Drackett sale will free up the management resources to concentrate on pharmaceuticals.' Drackett's products, including Windex and Drano, have a strong presence in the consumer products market, but sales for the business have been flat to lower this year, and its marketing costs are high. The Drackett sale leaves Clairol as Bristol-Myers's largest non-pharmaceuticals business. Mr Mehta expects the company eventually to divest Clairol, 'but Bristol-Myers management comes from Clairol and there's probably a sentimental attachment to it.' Bristol-Myers expects to record a substantial special gain once the sale of Drackett is completed. The Drackett acquisition will strengthen SC Johnson's position in the home-care industry. The company has annual sales of about Dollars 3.3bn. Its products include Pledge, Shout and Raid. SC Johnson plans to divest Drackett's consumer furniture care and air freshener brands, which are product lines where it already has a strong market presence. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agency, yesterday cut its ratings on SC Johnson's commercial paper and senior debentures to reflect the additional debt to cover the purchase.</p>

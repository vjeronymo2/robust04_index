			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE BUDGET PROPOSAL VERSUS SOCIAL VALUES  </P> <P> Regarding "The Governor's Budget Proposal" (Jan. 11), we are in trouble. This  budget proposal confirms it. This budget report is evidence of the decline of  leadership and continuing mismanagement of social service resources by our  government.  </P> <P> The governor alone is not culpable for the proposal. He is certainly  accountable. But so is the Legislature. And beyond that so are our corporate  and social representatives, including we the people.  </P> <P> This budget and its attack on the impoverished is yet another slap at the  consciousness of society, alerting us to the continuing demise in our social  values and our inability to manage the needs and demands of our materialistic  world.  </P> <P> The governor challenges the Legislature to revise restrictive budget policies  such as "entitlements" or guaranteed annual program increases tied to the rate  of inflation. Individual legislators respond with nonspecific tough talk. None  of our elected leaders are being straightforward and candid with the public.  They have collectively failed to communicate with the public, to educate, to  demonstrate, and to provide the leadership so critical to our social  well-being.  </P> <P> Faced with economic constraint, the governor has taken the easy way out --  delete those line items that will create the minimal public upheaval and  political heat. By his decision, he has attacked the medically indigent, the  aged, blind and disabled. And if he receives legislative pressure, the next in  line are the mentally ill, senior nutrition, alcohol and drug treatment  programs. It is bad enough to be poor -- to be poor and to be sick is  intolerable!  </P> <P> We the people must demand public accountability and a return to social  responsibility.  </P> <P> JOHN J. RETTE  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> Orange County Medical Assn.  </P></p>

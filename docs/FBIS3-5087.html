With political reform settled, the prime minister seems to be  intending to consolidate a foothold for his coalition government  to develop into a long-term full-fledged government by working  on new reform tasks and giving the impression that his coalition  government is in transition to "its second term as a reformist  government." The prime minister seems intended to set up one  private advisory body after another to break away from the  conventional "bureaucrat-led" policy decision formula and set  forth his own policies. Bureaucrats, however, are expected to  resist shifting the policy decision to advisory bodies that are  made of people from the private sector.    Advisory bodies to be established are panels on "the defense  issue," "the 21st century global environment," and "housing and  land" to be placed under the Administrative Reform Promotion  Headquarters (headed by Prime Minister Hosokawa). The "defense  issue panel" is mandated to review the "Guideline for the  Defense Buildup Plan," taking into account the post-Cold War  world situation. The panel, to be presided over by Asahi  Breweries Chairman Hirotaro Higuchi, will hold its first meeting  on 28 February.    The "global environment panel" is to exchange views on how  Japan should contribute to addressing global environmental  problems. In response to the prime minister's intentions, late  last year, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura urged Environment  Agency Director General Wakako Hironaka to establish the panel,  saying: "Let us work together to tackle environmental problems  transcending the jurisdiction of each ministry and agency." The  panel, to be chaired by Japan Academic Council President Kondo  Jiro, is composed of 14 people from the private sector. The  panel will hold its first meeting on 10 March and compile  recommendations within this year.    The "panel on housing and land" under the Administrative  Reform Promotion Headquarters is the first among panels to be  established for the discussion of deregulation. Keio University  Professor Shigeru Ito and five scholars and businessmen will  join the panel as "experts." The panel will be established in  March. Their participation in the panel as "experts" reflects  the prime minister's hope to "allow civilians to participate in  policy decision making." The prime minister intends to promote  the deregulation by overriding resistance from the bureaucracy.    The prime minister is setting up one advisory body after  another before he reshuffles his cabinet. Explaining why the  prime minister is doing so, an aide to the prime minister says:  "With the political reform settled, the Hosokawa government  needs to present its next policy tasks to tackle." The prime  minister seems to intend to keep the centripatal force of his  government from waning after the political reform is put into  effect.    Explaining why the prime minister intends to fill the  advisory bodies with civilians, another aide to the prime  minister says the "prime minister has begun talking about his  distrust in the bureaucracy, saying, `If I get things done in  the way the bureaucracy tells me, I may face failure.'"    Some bureaucrats are criticizing the prime minister for  taking the position of attaching importance to the advisory  bodies, saying: "It is absurd to allow civilians to participate  in the government's policy decision making without making clear  their status and responsibility." Other bureaucrats complain:  "The global environmental problems panel has already been  established in the Environment Agency and the establishment of  another such panel is duplication."    If recommendations to be made by the advisory bodies are  different from policies of each ministry and agency, this will  raise the issue of how the recommendations will be put into  effect. The prime minister's leadership will be questioned from  time to time in the future.</p>

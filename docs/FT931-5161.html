			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Need a quality certificate? Ask Tom, Dick or Harry BRITISH companies are paying thousands of pounds and spending hours of management time to qualify for a quality standard which appears to have a quality control problem of its own. The BS5750 quality standard has already been obtained by about 17,000 companies. But it has now emerged that a loophole in the rules means anyone can award a BS5750, which certifies that a company's internal procedures are properly organised. Consultancies and other organisations which issue and monitor BS5750 certificates are not required to register with the National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies (NACCB), an industry body which ultimately answers to the Department of Trade and Industry. 'There appears to be absolutely no control over the organisations making the award,' said Mr Stephen Halliday, principal lecturer in small business at Buckinghamshire College of Higher Education. 'The government must take steps to ensure that BS5750 can be awarded only by reputable, accredited organisations.' Two dozen organisations have been accredited but the NACCB estimates that up to a dozen which have not registered are actively issuing certificates. Even those wanting to register have to operate for between one and two years without formal accreditation while the NACCB assesses their performance. The NACCB said it thought buyers were sophisticated enough not to be taken in by suppliers sporting certificates issued by 'cowboys.' But the British Standards Institution, which is accredited and which has issued most BS5750 certificates, said it was concerned at this loophole. There is intense commercial competition between the BSI and other certification organisations, not least on price. The discovery that anyone can offer the BS5750 will add to the controversy surrounding the certificate. Some small businesses, which are increasingly being required by large customers to obtain the certificate, complain that its procedures are costly and unduly bureaucratic. Most companies must pay a minimum of several thousand pounds in consultants' and registration fees to prove they meet BS5750 requirements, and up to Pounds 2,000 each year to show they still comply. Smaller companies, especially, also find the process a significant burden on senior management time. Mr Paul Hewlett, secretary of the NACCB, said: 'The professional buyers are pretty well educated to ask if their suppliers have been certified by an accredited organisation. There is not much of a market for the cowboys.' Only accredited certification organisations are allowed to put the NACCB logo, consisting of a tick and crown, alongside the BS5750 logo, Mr Hewlett said. But business organisations are concerned that many smaller companies may not be aware of this distinction or that they have obtained BS5750 from an unaccredited organisation. The British Standards Institution said it had urged the government to impose tighter controls and to give the NACCB greater powers but no action had been taken.</p>

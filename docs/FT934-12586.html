			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Observer: Lotta washing Joao Alves, the Brazilian federal deputy accused of masterminding a huge corruption scheme in the government's budget, seems to be temporarily down on his luck. Giving evidence in front of a special inquiry into the scheme, he explained how 'thanks to God' he had been fortunate with money since the late 1980s. Not surprisingly, there was considerable interest as to how, as a poorly paid congressman, he had built up a personal empire now worth an estimated Dollars 5m, complete with luxury apartments, farms and even a rented Lear jet. Alves did have one explanation for all this good fortune - the local lottery. In the past few years, the lottery company estimates he picked up more than 200 big prizes. Unfortunately for Alves, this in itself may not entirely convince his inquisitors in a country where lotteries are also known to provide opportunities for money laundering.</p>

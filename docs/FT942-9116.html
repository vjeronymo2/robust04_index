			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (4): Trees are being cut down to size - Recycling continues to increase, but can it replace the forest? Waste paper recycling has become a way of life in most industrial countries. But in the process, it has raised issues for the forest-products industry which are far from mundane. The crux of the problem in North America is that mills are concerned about their ability to collect enough waste paper to meet recycling targets. In Europe, the problem is precisely the opposite. Legislative decrees and government subsidies have flooded the market with used paper at rock-bottom prices. The trend towards recovering and recycling used paper is furthest advanced in Germany. By mid-1995, 80 per cent of used packaging paper and paperboard will be collected, and at least 80 per cent of that will be recycled. Legislation is also in the pipeline requiring the collection of 60 per cent of newsprint, magazine and office wastepaper. In the US, the American Forest and Paper Association estimates that, for the first time last year, more paper was recovered than was sent to landfills. Nearly 60 per cent of corrugated materials but only one-third of all packaging paper is recycled. US papermakers aim to recycle half of all waste paper by 2000, compared with about 40 per cent now. Dick Storat, the AFPA's chief economist, estimates that to reach this target, the collection rate for corrugated material will have to reach 80-85 per cent in urban areas. US paper mills find it increasingly difficult, however, to lay their hands on cheap recyclable material. They face stiff competition from local governments and from a growing number of waste-to-energy plants. Mr Storat estimates that about 10 per cent of paper which might normally go to landfills or recycling plants is being channelled into energy generation. Municipalities are eager to collect recyclable materials to help raise money for their waste-management services. The terms of bond issues floated to finance waste-to-energy plants frequently require municipalities to control the flow of combustible materials. The paper companies want free-market forces rather than municipal ordinances to decide what happens to discarded paper. 'Trust us to put it in the products where it makes the most sense,' Mr Storat says. Two cases before the US Supreme Court, involving ordinances passed in California and New York, are expected to help clarify the contentious issue of when a household or business gives up ownership of its waste material. At present, the recycled content of different types of paper varies widely. Recycled fibre makes up more than 90 per cent of low-grade corrugated materials and 80 per cent of board produced in the European Union. But the proportion is only 7 per cent in fine printing and writing papers, where the strength and cleanliness of virgin fibres have so far proved irreplaceable. The degree to which recycled material can continue to replace virgin fibres is a tricky question for forestry companies. Enthusiasm for recycling among Scandinavian and Canadian producers in particular, is tinged with nervousness about the future of their vast investments in trees. 'There's a misunderstanding that recycling can replace the forest,' says Jan Remrod, director-general of the Swedish Pulp and Paper Association. The industry has strong misgivings over a Belgian proposal for an 'eco-tax', which would be levied on virgin materials as a way of pressuring paper producers to raise the recycled content of their products. The forestry companies have so far been able to demonstrate that high-quality papers require a high proportion of clean, strong virgin fibres. Even recycled material needs to be topped up with fresh-from-the-forest fibre. Scientists estimate that cellulose fibres cannot be recycled more than five or six times, even for the lowest-grade paper products. The forestry companies also hope to convince environmental groups and consumers that trees are among nature's most renewable products. Not only do new trees grow where old ones are cut down, but recycled fibres can be used as a fuel when they are too worn, dirty or short for paper-making. The problem for the industry is that the tide is moving towards an ever-higher recycled content in an ever-widening variety of products. The technology to de-ink printed papers is improving by leaps and bounds. The AFPA forecasts that the rate of growth in consumption of all grades of recovered paper will far outstrip new production capacity over the next two years. In the case of printing and writing papers, demand for recovered material is projected to jump by more than a third, compared with a 6 per cent increase in capacity. The recycled-content in these grades is expected to rise from 10 per cent to 15 per cent over the next six years. David Refkin, director of magazine paper purchasing at Time Inc, the big US publisher, predicts that at least three-quarters of the 250,000 tons of paper Time buys each year - mostly lightweight coated groundwood grades - will be recycled stock by 1996. Sensing which way the wind is blowing, Scandinavian and North American companies are now directing the lion's share of their capital spending to facilities based on recycled materials. Commercial common-sense dictates that mills whose main feedstock is waste paper are more likely to be built close to heavily-populated urban centres than to natural forests. The Nordic forestry companies' biggest projects at present are the recycled-newsprint mills being put up by Finland's Enzo-Gutzeit, near Leipzig, Germany, and by SCA of Sweden at Aylesford in the UK. MacMillan Bloedel, of Vancouver, has spent years trying to gain regulatory approval for a CDollars 1bn recycled-newsprint mill near Sacramento, California. A growing number of producers are also moving into waste paper collection as a means of securing their raw-material supplies. In their search for a cheap but reliable source of waste paper, many North American tissue makers now place their own collection bins at strategic points in urban areas.</p>

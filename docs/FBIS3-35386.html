			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bengali </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Are India and Pakistan on the Same Plane?"] </F>   [Text] Robin Raphel, the U.S. assistant secretary of state,  was rebuked by a number of prominent senators when she explained  the Clinton administration's South Asia policy to a Senate  Foreign Relations subcommittee. Republican Senator Hank Brown  asked: What kind of policy disappoints all the parties and  makes everyone America's enemy? He did not stop there. Moving  a little further, he reminded the assistant secretary of the old  saying that sometimes, depending on the situation, it is better  to keep quiet.    Valuable advice indeed, although it is easy to see that it  is  just as difficult for a member of Congress to heed this advise  as it is for a government spokesman. Even the head of the  administration that Robin Raphel represents does not think it is  necessary to be cautious. He freely expresses whatever comes  into his mind, sometimes even in writing. Given this situation,  why should a bureaucrat like Mrs. Raphel restrain herself when  making statements? Mr. Brown's advice to Mrs. Raphel to bridle  her statements came in the context of her 26 October remarks on  Kashmir. Undoubtedly, it was not a casual statement. Rather,  subsequent government statements and behavior have made it clear  that the new U.S. Administration wants to pursue a tougher  policy toward India. It was because of his weakness for India  that Daniel Patrick Moynihan, despite being a Democrat, opted to  criticize Mrs. Raphel and the present Democratic administration.  Moynihan's upcoming visit to India is said to be of special  significance to both Washington and New Delhi. This is natural,  but the question is whether former Ambassador Moynihan can  assure India during his visit that the United States will stop  playing the game of persistently harassing India.    There is no question that the Bush administration's stand --  that a solution to the Kashmir problem should be found under the  Simla Agreement; that is, through bilateral negotiations between  India and Pakistan -- has been abandoned. The impression is  taking hold that Washington wants to place greater importance on  the fictitious or exaggerated stories of human rights violations  by Indian troops in Kashmir, while ignoring Pakistani support  for terrorism and playing down the grisly acts being committed  by terrorists throughout the Kashmir Valley.    It may be of no interest in Washington whether or not New  Delhi likes the declaration that the United States wants to view  India and Pakistan from the same perspective on issue of the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It is natural not to consider  external opinions when formulating a country's policy. One  should wonder, however, if India is perturbed by the excessive  interest being shown by the present U.S. Administration in  releasing Islamabad from the purview of the Pressler Amendment.  The U.S. Administration's attempts to do away with the Pressler  Amendment have been temporarily abandoned. It is no secret,  however, that this was not for lack of trying. The move was  shelved after the extent of Congressional opposition became  clear. Political experts do not hesitate to make substantial  sacrifices whenever they face danger, although they are never  sincere in making such sacrifices. It is difficult to say what  objective will be achieved by placing India and Pakistan on the  same level. This is better known by Robin Raphel, Lynne Davis,  and others. The U.S. Administration's eagerness to abrogate the  Pressler Amendment, though, makes us fear that the pro-Pakistan  advisers scattered throughout the U.S. Administration are trying  to find ways to satisfy Pakistan's appetite for arms. Perhaps  this fear is unfounded, or perhaps the U.S. Administration has  realized its folly; how the whole region was disrupted in the  past when Pakistan was armed against the invasion of communism.  But is South Asia that lucky? The person who has the  experience of past suffering will naturally be alarmed by the  slightest indication of danger.</p>

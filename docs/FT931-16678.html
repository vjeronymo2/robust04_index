			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: World bank unblocks Bolivian mining credit THE WORLD Bank has released the remainder of a Dollars 35m mining credit to Bolivia. It had been withheld since 1989 in protest at the slow pave of change within Comibol, the state mining corporation. According to World Bank officials, the Bolivian government was informed on December 17 that its right to make withdrawals from the fund had been reinstated. As some Dollars 4.3m had been disbursed by October 1992, Dollars 30.8m remains in the fund. Recent actions within Comibol prompted by the World Bank include the signing of an agreement with the Pincock consultancy to undertake a structural review of the corporation. Comibol has also taken steps to reform its board of directors and acquired a new president in July. The long-awaited disbursement of the World Bank credit signals what is widely expected to be the beginning of the end for the state mining corporation. The credit is specifically targeted at encouraging the participation of the private sector investment in Comibol's mine holdings and may eventually lead to the partial, or even full-scale privatisation of the corporation. Two obstacles to this course of action remain however in the form of union opposition and the Bolivian constitution, which currently bars the privatisation of the corporation.</p>

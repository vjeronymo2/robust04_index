			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> VAN GOGH PAINTING SELLS AT RECORD $82.5 MILLION;  </P> <P> ART: 'PORTRAIT OF DR. GACHET' IS AUCTIONED TO A JAPANESE BUYER. THE PREVIOUS  HIGH PRICE WAS $53.9 MILLION.  </P> <P> Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" stunned the art market Tuesday when  it was auctioned for $82.5 million, shattering the world record price for a  painting by more than $28 million.  </P> <P> The price was double the estimate by Christie's, a spokeswoman for the auction  house said.  </P> <P> "This is by far the world's most expensive painting," surpassing the previous  auction record of $53.9 million bid by Australian businessman Alan Bond for Van  Gogh's "Irises" in November, 1987.  </P> <P> The money for Bond's bid was largely borrowed from Sotheby's, the house that  handled the auction. The debt-ridden Bond was eventually forced to sell the  painting for an undisclosed price to the J. Paul Getty Museum of Malibu.  </P> <P> The unidentified Japanese bidder was in the room during the about 10 minutes of  bidding that opened at $20 million, Britman said. Toward the end of bidding,  just two people were vying for the painting, she said.  </P> <P> "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" was painted six weeks before Van Gogh committed  suicide in 1890. Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet tended Van Gogh in the weeks before  his death.  </P> <P> The record price quashed all reports of an art market in recession after last  week's disappointing contemporary sales. More than 35% of the works had gone  unsold last week.  </P> <P> The crowd gasped when the bidding reached $50 million.  </P> <P> It had been expected to fetch between $40 million and $50 million at a sale of  major works by Impressionist and Modern artists.  </P> <P> "It's a great painting," said Manhattan art dealer Richard Feigen. "It's by a  rare artist. It's in fine condition. There are practically no paintings like it  in private hands."  </P> <P> After the bidding, which was tensely conducted between the Japanese dealer and  a telephone bidder, the jam-packed gallery broke into a standing ovation,  prompting auctioneer Christopher Burge to pound his gavel to control the house.  </P> <P> The painting was lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1984. It is from the  collection of Siegfried Kramarsky, a German-born New York banker who died in  1961. It was put on the block by a trust created under his will.  </P> <P> In a letter to artist Paul Gauguin, Van Gogh wrote on June 16 that he had  painted Gachet "with the heart-broken expression of our time" and that it was  "not destined to be understood."  </P> <P> Gachet, a practitioner of homeopathic medicine, was Van Gogh's friend and  physician. He was also close to other Impressionist painters of the time.  </P> <P> Van Gogh painted a second, slightly larger version of the portrait, which hangs  in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. It lacks the details of the Kramarsky painting  and its colors are flatter.  </P> <P> Another Van Gogh from the Kramarsky collection was auctioned in 1987 for $20.24  million. It too had been lent to the Metropolitan.  </P> <P> The next-highest prices paid for paintings at the world's major auction houses  are:  </P> <P>  -- "Les Noches de Pierrette" (Pierrette's Wedding) by Pablo Picasso, $48.9  million, sold by Drouot-Montaigne, Paris (bid from the Bunkamura Shibuya  auction house in Toyko in a televised satellite hook-up), Nov. 30, 1989.  </P> <P>  -- "Yo Picasso" by Pablo Picasso; $47.85 million, sold by Sotheby's, New York,  May 9, 1989.  </P> <P>  -- "Au Lapin Agile" by Pablo Picasso; $40.7 million, sold by Sotheby's, New  York, Nov. 15, 1989.  </P> <P>  -- "Sunflowers" by Vincent van Gogh; $39.9 million, sold by Christie's,  London, March 30, 1987.  </P> <P>  -- "Acrobat and Young Harlequin" by Pablo Picasso; $38.46 million, sold by  Christie's, London, Nov. 28, 1988.  </P> <P>  -- "The Mirror" by Pablo Picasso; $26.4 million, sold by Sotheby's, New York,  Nov. 15, 1989.  </P> <P>  -- "Maternity" by Pablo Picasso; $24.75 million, sold by Christie's, New York,  Nov. 14, 1988.  </P> <P>  -- "Dans La Prairie" ("In the Meadow") by Claude Monet; $24.59 million, sold  by Sotheby's, London, June 28, 1988.  </P> <P>  -- "Mata Mua (In Olden Times)" by Paul Gauguin; $24.2 million, sold by  Sotheby's, New York, May 9, 1989.  </P> <P>  -- "Interchange" by Willem de Kooning; $20.6 million, sold by Sotheby's, New  York, Nov. 8, 1989.  </P> <P>  -- "The Trinquetaille Bridge" by Vincent van Gogh; $20.24 million, sold by  Christie's, London, June 29, 1987.  </P> <P>  -- "Mere et Enfant" by Pablo Picasso; $18.7 million, sold by Sotheby's, New  York, Nov. 15, 1989.  </P> <P>  -- "La Promenade" by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, $17.6 million, sold by Sotheby's,  London, April 3, 1989.  </P> <P>  -- "False Start" by Jasper Johns; $17.05 million, sold by Sotheby's, New York,  Nov. 10, 1988.  </P></p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Steel division lifts Sandvik SANDVIK, the Swedish engineering group, boosted first-half profits by 10 per cent to SKr994m (Dollars 123.5m) as a sharp rise at its steel division offset continued weak demand. It said it remained on course to increase 1993 profits above last year's SKr1.53bn, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The stronger Swedish krona helped the group lift sales by 25 per cent to SKr10.7bn, while orders rose 28 per cent to SKr11.3bn. The group's steel division was the star performer where profits rose to SKr231m from SKr95m on revenues up 24 per cent to SKr3.25bn.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Clinton presses Congress for gun controls PRESIDENT Bill Clinton pressed the US Congress yesterday to impose a waiting period before handgun purchases as 'the first step' to controlling violent crime, AP reports from Washington. 'I think it's going to be very difficult for the Congress to justify continued inaction on what millions of Americans believe is the No. 1 problem in their lives,' the president said. He appeared with Mr Jim Brady, former White House press secretary to President Ronald Reagan. Mr Brady and his wife, Sarah, are leaders of Handgun Control, an anti-gun lobbying group. He was badly wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt against Mr Reagan. Mr Brady's espousal of handgun controls had left him estranged from the Republican administrations of Mr Reagan and Mr George Bush. He was welcomed back to the Oval Office he once frequented to help Mr Clinton build support for the Brady Bill, which calls for a waiting period on handgun purchases of five business days, when a background check would be required. Mr Clinton predicted the bill would pass this year. It passed a House Judiciary subcommittee last week. Mr Clinton hoped the full judiciary committee would complete work on it this week. He said that it would be brought up in the Senate as a separate issue, apart from a crime bill, 'so that no one will be able to hide behind other issues and try to find clever ways to filibuster it'.</p>

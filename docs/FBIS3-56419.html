President Makes His  Choice"]    [Text] According to an INTERFAX report, which was  confirmed by a government source, Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of  the State Property Committee, has been appointed deputy head of  the Council of Ministers by presidential edict. By doing so  Boris Yeltsin veered away from his edict No. 66 signed 10  January, whereby Viktor Chernomyrdin was to name the candidacies  of his two first deputies and two "ordinary" deputies by 17  January. Boris Yeltsin moved Anatoliy Chubays outside the  edict's scope by effectively making him the head of government's  fifth deputy.    According to trustworthy reports, initially the prime  minister did not consider the State Property Committee chairman  as a candidate for his "deputy." Moreover, under that same  edict No. 66, the status of the State Property Committee in the  government structure was lower than that of a ministry; this  meant that its chief would "fall" by as many as two rungs. It  seems that there were two reasons for Boris Yeltsin's somewhat  unexpected decision. First, Anatoliy Chubays has told the  president and the prime minister, apparently off the record,  that he did not want to be reduced to a figure that is moved too  energetically on the political board. All the more so because  presently the State Property Committee has to cope with a  plethora of reforms: the completion of the small and  large-scale privatization programs, including the voucher-based  stage that must end by 1 July; the establishment of control over  state-owned enterprises; and the introduction of the  restructuring and bankruptcy procedures. Second, Boris  Yeltsin's edict coincided with the visit of Bill Clinton, whose  delegation includes Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Both  American guests have repeatedly admired in public the scale and  pace of Russian privatization.    Meanwhile, the situation with Finance Minister Boris Fedorov  has so far remained unresolved. It has transpired from those  same government sources that he would not accept even the status  of a deputy prime minister, if Aleksandr Zaveryukha is a  government member in that same capacity and Viktor Gerashchenko  remains Central Bank chairman. The much-publicized differences  of these people's views on the goals and content of reform have  rendered their cohabitation within one government virtually  impossible.</p>

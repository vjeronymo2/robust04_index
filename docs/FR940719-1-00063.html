			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency would expect that, at a minimum, the maintenance program would include the following: (1) Checks to assure that all components of the methane monitor are securely attached to the machine on which it is mounted and that all packing glands are properly packed and secured; (2) Checks to assure that the sensor head is installed as close to the face end of the machine as practicable and that the vent holes and filter(s) on the sensor head are not clogged with water, dust, or other material; and (3) Checks to assure that the warning device can be seen or heard by the machine operator at all locations from which the machine is operated and that the lens(es) protecting the meter and indicating lamps is not cracked or broken. The maintenance program should also make provisions to assure that the methane monitor meter or readout assembly is properly adjusted to indicate zero percent methane when no methane is present and that it is not possible to defeat the monitor by holding or blocking the machine's reset switch in the start position. The program should also specify the procedure for assuring that a warning is given when 1 percent methane is indicated on the meter or readout assembly and that all motors and lights on the machine are automatically deenergized when 2 percent methane is indicated on the meter or readout assembly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During informational meetings and subsequent discussions, MSHA heard suggestions that without a requirement for a record to be maintained of calibration tests, similar to that required by the previous regulation, there would be no way for the Agency or miners to verify that the tests were made. Upon reconsideration, and in light of the Southmountain explosion investigation, MSHA agrees that records of calibration tests would be beneficial and is therefore proposing, in paragraph (a)(4)(iii), that a record of all calibration tests be kept in a book maintained for this purpose on the surface at the mine. Like other records required by this proposal, the records of methane monitor calibration tests are to be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. This is being proposed to reduce the likelihood that pages or records could be lost or misplaced. Comments are solicited on the use of this type of recordkeeping book and on an alternative approach wherein the Agency would develop, in coordination with the states, books specific for the required records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of the proposal, the records would be required to be retained for at least 1 year at a surface location at the mine and be made available for inspection by representative of miners and by authorized representatives of the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.344&blank;Compressors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This standard specifies requirements for compressors in underground coal mines. The proposal would revise paragraph (a)(1), redesignate existing (b)(2) as (b)(3) and add new (b)(2) and (e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Improperly used or maintained compressors can present a significant risk of fire. To minimize this hazard to miners, the existing regulation addresses the detection and suppression of compressor fires, and specifies installation and operation requirements for compressors. The Agency has stayed paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;75.344 of the existing regulation, which requires all compressors to be located in noncombustible structures or areas. During the informational meetings, it was brought to MSHA's attention that in some instances requiring such a structure could present a fire hazard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal recognizes in paragraph (a)(1) that it is possible to provide the desired level of protection by permitting compressors to be operated while attended, rather than requiring that they be located in noncombustible structures or areas. Commenters pointed out that requiring all compressors, including portable compressors, to be located in noncombustible structures or areas might result in a fire hazard. The primary hazard identified in these instances is the buildup of heat within the structure if sufficient ventilation for cooling is not provided. Another hazard identified during discussions on this section is potential delay in roof bolting during construction of a suitable structure or area for the compressor used for bolting. Recognizing these potential hazards, the proposal would require compressors to be located in noncombustible structures or areas, provided adequate ventilation is maintained for cooling or, as an alternative, would require compressors to operate while attended. If the compressor is operated while attended, it is the Agency's intention that the person be able to see the compressor and recognize a problem and is close enough to activate the required fire suppression system and assure that the compressor is deenergized or shut off. This would not preclude the individual from performing other duties, including those involving the use of the compressor. However, it would require that the individual be in close proximity to the compressor. The Agency solicits comments on whether the standard should specify a distance and what that appropriate distance would be. If a specific distance is recommended, the commenters should also provide the rationale for that distance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

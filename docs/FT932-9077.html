			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Unilever rises 7% in first quarter UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company, yesterday reported first quarter profits slightly below expectations and said its US sales were affected by tight competition. Pre-tax profits increased 7 per cent from Pounds 393m to Pounds 420m in the three months to March 31. The results were affected by sterling's weakness against the comparable period. Unilever said net profits, after tax and minorities, increased 21 per cent in sterling terms but only 2 per cent in guilders. Turnover increased 7 per cent to Pounds 6.03bn, including a Pounds 112m gain from acquisitions. Operating profits increased 6 per cent to Pounds 443m. European operating profits fell Pounds 1m to Pounds 269m, which included unexplained exceptionals of less than Pounds 10m. North American profits increased 6 per cent to Pounds 18m. They were adversely affected by increased marketing costs and a Pounds 4m charge for post-retirement health care benefits, following a switch to the accruals basis of accounting. The switch is likely to cost Pounds 20m for the full year. Operating profits from operations in the rest of the world increased 18 per cent, helped by acquisitions, although margins slipped slightly to 10.3 per cent. Interest costs fell slightly from Pounds 39m to Pounds 31m, reflecting lower interest rates and a fall in net borrowings from Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds 1.6bn. Earnings per share were 15.8p (13.09p).

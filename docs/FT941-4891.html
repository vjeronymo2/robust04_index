			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Leading Article: How Europe can compete The European Union plc is not engaged in a zero-sum struggle for economic survival with the US, Japan, or even China Inc. On the contrary, peaceful economic relations with other economies offer opportunities for mutual enrichment. The question is whether Europe can take advantage of those opportunities. Only thus can it hope to offer a steadily rising standard of living to all Europeans. The EU has much upon which to build. Its member states possess only 6 1/2 per cent of world population, but generate 25 per cent of global economic output at market exchange rates, and 18 per cent even at purchasing power parity. Its disproportionate share in global economic activity, though bound to fall, demonstrates how large is the reservoir of physical capital, skills and knowledge on which it is able to draw. Nor has recent overall performance been notably dismal: total EU output has risen 30 per cent since 1980, the increase being almost as large as China's total gross domestic product in 1990. Current gloom is exaggerated, this being partly because of the recession. But there is reason for gloom, all the same, as the FT series on European competitiveness, concluded today, has shown. Total EU employment is, for example, up only 6 per cent since 1980, against 18 per cent in the US; output of manufactures is up 18 per cent over the same period, against 36 per cent in the US; and the share of EU external exports in world exports of manufactures is down from 22 per cent in 1980 to 18 per cent in 1992. Patent filings in Europe have not increased since 1987, while in the US they have risen by 30 per cent. European spending on research and development has declined over the 1980s, relative to that in the US and Japan. High technology products account for nearly a third of US exports, but less than a fifth of those from western Europe. To this picture should be added the odd telling vignette. General Electric of the US targets European competitors, but avoids Japanese ones, while airline operating costs are 48 per cent higher than in the US. Europe suffers from high unemployment and poor job generation. European firms tend to be weakest in the world's most dynamic industries. And the European economy's poorest performance is in industries most exposed to international competition. National champions What lies behind the failures? First, far too much of the European economy remains shielded from competitive pressures. Second, European monetary policy has occasionally been seriously misjudged. Third, labour costs are too high and the labour market as a whole too heavily regulated and taxed. Finally, business has too often failed to respond to the challenges of the market place. Solutions must be found partly at the level of the EU as a whole, partly by the individual member states and partly by businesses. Too many sectors of the European economy remain protected from effective foreign competition and balkanised by the provision of state aids, the promotion of national champions, the persistence of regulatory barriers and use of discriminatory public procurement. At least one and often several of these limitations on competition apply to industries as important and diverse as agriculture, textiles and clothing, steel, aerospace and defence equipment, motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, financial services, telecommunications, energy supply and civil aviation. Virtually all of them need to be subjected to greater competition and less protection, a job that falls to the EU as a whole. Monetary policy is still a matter for member states, but under the ERM and now the Maastricht treaty, it is also increasingly a matter for the EU. Here serious errors have been made, with the current recession partly the result of an over rigid response to German unification. But now that both inflation and inflationary expectation in core countries of the EU have been lowered, the cost of disinflation should not need to be repeated. Liberal approach Management of the labour market, training and the welfare state is a task for member states. They are in a position to choose among elements of liberal and corporatist approaches to reform. The liberal approach, often labelled the 'Anglo-Saxon' model, would be based on labour market deregulation and lower taxes. Its main benefit is likely to be greater growth of part-time service sector jobs. Its main defect is likely to be less overall investment in skills and greater inequality in pay. The corporatist approach, sometimes called the 'Rhine model', would emphasise a shift in the tax burden from unskilled to skilled labour, combined with subsidies to unskilled labour and training, and an effort to keep the growth of real wages below the growth of labour productivity. The main benefit of this approach is likely to be more investment in skills and greater equality among working people. The main drawback is likely to be less job generation. What is needed here is more experimentation. Each country can learn from others. But it can do so only if it is allowed to diverge from the others. The danger of the EU's social programme is that this desirable diversity might be prevented. Finally, searching out market opportunities, exploitation of new scientific discoveries, linking up with institutions of learning, training workers and responding to competition fall largely on business itself. Too many businesses have remained dependent on the state. They must learn to become dependent on themselves. There is a great challenge confronting the member states of the EU. It is, in President Clinton's phrase to 'compete, not retreat'. Much has already been achieved, in the single market programme, in the moves towards privatisation and liberalisation, and in the lowering of inflation. But much also remains to be done. The temptation to believe that Europeans cannot meet the new global competition will be strong. But it must be resisted, since a retreat into the cosy world of protection would doom Europe to rapid relative decline. Europe will never possess the uniform mass market of the US or the homogeneous culture of Japan. Its strength lies in its diversity, now contained within the integrating edifice of the EU. The task facing politicians is to find effective means of exploiting that diversity in order to serve the common ends of all its citizens.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- The Japanese economy is  heading in a better direction with "slight changes in nuance"  evident in assessments of its performance, Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [7 Jun].    Industrial output is near to bottoming out and inventory  adjustments are also improving, Fujii told a news conference  after a morning cabinet meeting.    Fujii had been saying that the economy is mixed with good  and  bad signs and that experts were split in their assessments.    The cabinet adopted a monthly economic report at the morning  meeting.    The June report prepared by the Economic Planning Agency  stressed emergence of improving areas in the still-sluggish  economy. The previous report had emphasized the sluggishness of  the economy although noting some signs of improvement.    Fujii also said that international organizations are  forecasting a recovery in the second half of 1994 for the  Japanese economy in their latest economy reports.    He particularly cited reports by the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Monday and by the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April.    The two institutions said in separate reports that the  Japanese economy will pick up in the second half from sluggish  growth in the first half to post a real 2 percent growth in 1994  before staging a full recovery in 1995.    To back up the improving outlook at home and abroad at "this  delicate time," Fujii stressed the importance of steadily  implementing the fiscal 1994 budget and the government's record  15.25 trillion yen stimulus package launched in February.    The long-delayed budget for the current year that started  April 1 is expected to pass the House of Representatives on  Wednesday, with deliberations in the House of Councillors to  begin the same day. The government is now running under a  provisional budget.    Turning to the issue of possible economic sanctions against  North Korea, Fujii said it all depends on the UN Security  Council.    He cited the move to stop bank remittances to Iraq during  the  Persian Gulf War in 1990 as an example of the Finance Ministry's  experience in complying with UN resolutions.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Interest rise and strong wholesale broking help push MAI ahead 2% MAI, the broking, financial services and information group, yesterday announced interim pre-tax profits up 2 per cent after a strong performance from wholesale broking and higher interest payments on its Pounds 100m cash pile. Lord Hollick, the managing director ennobled last year as a Labour life peer, said most core businesses saw progress. 'This is a good performance in a recession,' he said. Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 29.6m) in the six months to end-December. Turnover improved 13 per cent to Pounds 187.2m (Pounds 166.4m). Earnings firmed to 5.8p (5.7p) and the interim dividend is again 1.4p. Operating profits from wholesale broking increased to Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 16m). About one third of the increase was due to favourable exchange rates. 'We've also been quite successful in gaining market share and moving into new markets,' Lord Hollick said. Net interest receivable increased to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 4.1m). Most of the company's Pounds 100m cash came from the sale last year of part of its stake in Avenir, the French media group. MAI has retained 15.2 per cent of the company, worth Pounds 44m. MAI is the majority shareholder in Meridian, which last year won control of the ITV franchise held by TVS Entertainment. Meridian has acquired freehold land, studios and equipment from TVS. This will reduce Meridian's expected investment from Pounds 35m to Pounds 25m, Lord Hollick said. COMMENT Lord Hollick is one of few City figures hoping for a Labour victory. Actually, a hung parliament would be the best outcome for his media division since it would mean yet more polling for NOP. But longer term, MAI is relatively immune from the swings of party politics. With the new government, whatever the party, likely to be faced with a higher PSBR, MAI's inter dealer brokerage in the gilts market will be active. The retail financial services and information divisions, meanwhile, need an economic upturn rather than a change of government. With full year profits forecast for Pounds 70m, the shares are on less than 9 times earnings. The low rating has been partly due to worries about spending on Meridian, but given the savings from the TVS deal, MAI's shares now look undervalued.</p>

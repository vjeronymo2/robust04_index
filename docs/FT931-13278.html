			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Malay sultans sense an end to the high life: Government's gloves are off in the fight to limit royal powers THERE are few things as upsetting as seeing your own obituary in the newspapers. Recently life has been a bit like that for Malaysia's nine sultans, or hereditary rulers, who take turns as king. The royalty is involved in a bruising battle with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's powerful prime minister. Over the weekend one of the country's national newspapers pointedly printed a list of the world's monarchs who had fallen by the proletarian wayside since the war. The sultans sit in their palaces, bombarded by adverse publicity, sensing that their days of high living could be at an end. Dr Mahathir wants to limit the sultans' powers. Last week the prime minister introduced a bill to parliament that would do away with constitutional provisions giving the royalty immunity from prosecution. The move followed an incident in which the sultan of the southern state of Johor is alleged to have abused, then beaten up, a sports official. But Dr Mahathir has a problem. The constitution stipulates that any action which alters the position of the royalty must be approved by the sultans themselves. Persuasive techniques have been applied to make the sultans agree to the constitutional changes. Stories of royal high living and various alleged abuses of royal power began to appear in the media. The sultans seemed persuaded. But then, at the last minute, they turned on Dr Mahathir, unanimously rejecting the constitutional changes. Since then, the government gloves have come off. The government started by announcing that relatively trivial royal benefits, like special licence plates for their lavish fleets of cars, must go. Special wards in hospitals reserved for the royalty would be opened to the public. Dr Mahathir would no longer seek a weekly audience with the king. There would be no more state funds for the upkeep of royal yachts, and no more allocations for work on royal homes. By the end of last week Dr Mahathir had moved forward the big guns. In future, he said, funds would be given to the royalty only in strict accordance with the regulations. In effect, this means the withdrawal of many millions of dollars from the royals' purses. Each day fuller stories of alleged royal misdemeanours have emerged. One sultan is said to have been in the habit of opening fire on vehicles careless enough to come close to royal motorcades. Another is said to have sold timber concessions worth millions of dollars pay gambling debts. There have been tales of manslaughter and, in one case, murder, with allegations made in parliament that a sultan killed his golf caddie. The sultans are not entirely defenceless against this government directed barrage. Some sultans are extremely wealthy and able to cope with the tighter financial times. They are still revered by many who see them as symbols of Malay identity. There are also those who also point to what they see as the lavish lifestyle of Malaysia's 'new rajas' - some government ministers themselves. Dr Mahathir insists he does not want to do away with the monarchy. But there are fears that the prime minister is seeking to add to his powers. Parliament has passed Dr Mahathir's constitutional amendments. They now go to the king for approval. Dr Mahathir says he is determined to make the amendments law. But if the rulers continue to withhold their consent then a constitutional crisis will develop.</p>

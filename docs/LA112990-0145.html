			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RUBELLA OUTBREAK TAKING TOLL ON NEWBORNS;  </P> <P> HEALTH: CASES ARE RUNNING FAR AHEAD OF LAST YEAR'S COUNTY TOTAL. IT CAN CAUSE  BIRTH DEFECTS IF CONTRACTED DURING PREGNANCY.  </P> <P> An epidemic of rubella -- a mild respiratory illness that can cause birth  defects if contracted during pregnancy -- has swept Orange County and the state  this year, and the disease is taking its toll on babies, public health  officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, an Orange County baby was born with cataracts after his  mother contracted rubella during pregnancy, and Los Angeles health officials  suspect eight babies born there since June have rubella-related birth defects.  </P> <P> The incidence of rubella in Orange County and statewide appears finally to be  waning, with just six cases reported in all of California in September. But  public health officials said this was probably a seasonal drop and cases may  rise again in January.  </P> <P> California health officials have reported 521 cases between Jan. 1 and Oct. 31,  compared with 160 in all of 1989.  </P> <P> Overall, Orange County's cases are running more than "five times ahead of last  year's," said Dr. Hildy Meyers, epidemiologist for the Orange County Health  Care Agency. Through September, doctors here reported 73 rubella cases compared  with only 11 last year.  </P> <P> The outbreak has been worst in Stanislaus County, Southern California, the San  Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley, said Dr. Loring Dales, chief of the  immunization unit at the California Department of Health Services.  </P> <P> In these areas, local health officials have battled seven rubella outbreaks in  jails or prisons, he noted. In April, 28 Orange County jail inmates contracted  rubella.  </P> <P> Concerned about the epidemic, Dales in October issued a statewide alert to  pediatricians, asking them to watch for "congenital rubella syndrome."  </P> <P> "We had this upsurge" of rubella cases, particularly from March to June, Dales  said. "We expect rubella babies in early October."  </P> <P> For children and adults, rubella -- also known as German measles -- is usually  a mild disease, characterized by painful lymph nodes, a rash that lasts one to  three days, joint pains and unusual sensitivity to light.  </P> <P> But mothers who contract the disease during pregnancy pass it on to their  fetuses. The outcome, especially when the mother contracts rubella during the  first five months of pregnancy, can be grim. Babies may be born with cataracts,  glaucoma, mental retardation, deafness, heart defects and a high incidence of  diabetes -- and in some cases, the babies may not survive.  </P> <P> It could be easy to miss the fact that a child with a birth defect was exposed  to rubella in the womb, Dales noted.  </P> <P> "If a child is born with a moderate hearing loss, you might never think back,  'Oh, boy, this is from the rash I had in pregnancy,' " Dales said.  </P> <P> Dales also warned that babies born with congenital rubella syndrome "keep  shedding the virus up to a year, a year and half," so pediatricians need to  watch for these children and make sure they do not infect others.  </P> <P> State and local health officials say they do not know the cause of this year's  outbreak. Unlike the statewide measles epidemic, which has hit Latino families  hard, this outbreak appears to affect nearly all ethnic groups equally, Dales  said.  </P> <P> He noted one exception -- fewer cases involve blacks. But he added, "the darker  your skin, a mild infection, a mild rash is hard to track."  </P> <P> About 70% of the cases involve adults between the age of 20 and 40, and the  rest are preschoolers, Dales said.  </P> <P> While state health officials are concerned about the rubella outbreak, it still  pales when compared to the continuing statewide measles epidemic -- a  longer-lasting, more severe infection that can cause brain damage and death. So  far, California's measles epidemic has resulted in 12,000 measles cases and 55  deaths, two in Orange County, Dales said.  </P> <P> RUBELLA EPIDEMIC  </P> <P> California is in the midst of an epidemic of rubella, also known as German  measles. If contracted during pregnancy, the disease can cause numerous birth  defects, including mental retardation, diabetes and deafness. The epidemic  appears to be waning, however. The number of cases reported each month has  steadily dropped since June.  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.56IN:2.66IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Reported Cases  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 521  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 160  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 85  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 140  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 242  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1985  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 138  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1984  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 195  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: California Department of Health Services  </P> <P> </P></p>

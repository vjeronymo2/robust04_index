			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Management: Power to the people - Andrew Adonis describes how one council has broken itself into pieces Big ceased to be beautiful long ago in Britain's town halls. For more than a decade, decentralisation has been the craze in local government. But no authority has taken it so far - or so fast - as Tower Hamlets, the Liberal Democrat-controlled borough in London's East End. The Liberals have divided the borough, London's poorest, into seven 'neighbourhood councils'. Each has its own staff, budget, offices and elected committee responsible for executing most of the borough's functions in its territory. 'Tower Hamlets only exists in name,' says Eric Flounders, the Liberals' former leader - now chairman of Bow neighbourhood - who carried out the dissection after defeating Labour in the 1986 borough elections. 'But that was true before we acted: the constituent neighbourhoods were always the real local communities.' Tower Hamlets is a 1960s amalgamation of Bethnal Green, Stepney and Poplar. Those names adorn three of the new neighbourhoods, but all seven are carved from their territory. With 34,000 residents, the largest - Poplar - covers a population greater than that of 27 district councils across the UK and would be on the large side as a first-tier authority in France or Germany. But with the smallest a mere 15,000-strong, even sympathetic observers think there are a few neighbourhoods too many. How was it done? At a stroke - almost literally. Amid uproar, the first council meeting after the 1986 elections saw Flounders move sheaves of amendments to council standing orders - creating the neighbourhoods and disbanding most of the council's central committees. The central administration was stripped to the bone and chief officers were obliged to become neighbourhood chief executives. Few stayed long. Neighbourhood units are not unique to Tower Hamlets. The model for less radical reformers is Islington, in north London. Under a progressive Labour administration, it has set up 24 neighbourhood offices across the borough: all residents are within quarter of a mile of an office; each has a staff to deal with queries - mainly housing - along with a small budget, and a forum of local residents which meets every six weeks to discuss issues in its area. Yet Islington's central committee and administrative structure are still intact. Tower Hamlets has largely disbanded both. Education, overall budget-making and social service strategy remain with the centre; standard terms and conditions are observed for employment contracts; beyond that, everything - planning, parks-recreation, housing, highways, environmental health, libraries, even most lawyers and accountants - has been handed down. Political and administrative control within those spheres lies with the neighbourhood councils, two of which are controlled by the 'opposition' Labour party. Each neighbourhood has autonomy within its devolved sphere unless its chief executive believes it 'is not in a sufficient state of readiness' to implement a decision. Even the direct labour-force has been divided, with seven separate depots. Each neighbourhood has control over its own contracts: most have stayed in-house, but Bethnal Green has awarded some to the private sector. 'It's a sham, of course', says John Biggs, the borough's Labour leader. 'We run two neighbourhoods, but they set the annual budget, and that's clearly fixed against us.' He condemns the devolved structure as 'massively bureaucratic', pointing to the Pounds 700,000 salary bill for the borough's chief executives alone. Flounders denies the first claim: funds are allocated by formula, and losers include Liberal neighbourhoods. He concedes that devolution may have increased the administrative staff, but claims that this is balanced by savings elsewhere. 'The positive advantages are enormous', he claims, citing the borough's rent arrears. In 1985/6 arrears stood at the London average of 13 per cent of the rent collectable. Now they are down to 6 per cent. 'It comes down to an argument about the cost of democracy itself', says Paul Hoggett of Bristol University, who has made a detailed study. 'Neighbourhood councils have to be serviced and administrative costs have gone up. But service-delivery costs appear to be lower and the evidence suggests the experiment has improved the quality of local democracy.' That is undeniable, if turnout in local elections is a reliable guide: it is up from 31 per cent in 1982 to 47 per cent in 1990 - a shift from well below to well above the London average. Clive Jacotine, Bow neighbourhood's chief executive and former assistant director of housing in Lewisham, believes the experiment makes sound management sense. 'The ability to bring everyone together easily, without having to get involved in inter-departmental processes, is a great advantage,' he says. Politics has changed too: 'The major conflict is between the neighbourhoods and the centre, not between the political parties'. Bow's management team comprises Jacotine and six 'service heads' - for planning, highways, environmental services, economic development, housing, and general-support services, including libraries. They all operate from the Bow neighbourhood centre - a purpose-built block off Roman Road, which also houses the local library, and a GP's practice. A gym and sauna are coming soon. The relationship between each neighbourhood's chief executive and committee chairman is necessarily close. Flounders and Jacotine meet at least once a fortnight. 'We get on well', says Jacotine. 'But if we didn't, I'd soon be out: personal rapport is much more important than between a committee chairman and a chief officer in a traditional authority.' Chief executives are on three-year rolling contracts, renewable annually. Tower Hamlets took control of eduction in the borough on the abolition of the Inner London Education Authority in 1990. Under local management of schools, most funds go direct to schools with the centre responsible for strategy, inspection, and ensuring adequate servicing. But neighbourhoods are still in the picture: they control the borough's Pounds 6m community education budget, subject to oversight and inspection. They also provide personnel and payroll services through 'service level agreements' with the education department. 'But the position is clear,' says Anne Sofer, chief education officer: 'The buck stops with the centre.' Six years on, other councils have yet to copy Tower Hamlets. Even Liberal Richmond, at the other, affluent end of the District Line, refuses to follow suit. 'It's snobbery as much as anything', says Flounders. 'But don't worry: give it a decade, and they'll all be doing it.'  ----------------------------------------------------------          TOWER HAMLETS NEIGHBOURHOOD COUNCILS  ----------------------------------------------------------                      Population      Party control  ---------------------------------------------------------- Bethnal Green            28,102            Lib Dem Bow                      19,756            Lib Dem Globe Town               14,860            Lib Dem Isle of Dogs             19,492             Labour Poplar                   33,986            Lib Dem Stepney                  21,619            Lib Dem Wapping                  22,594             Labour  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

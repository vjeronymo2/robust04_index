			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petition and other information available to the Service indicate that the Berkeley ground cricket is known from four localities in the San Francisco Bay area of California (Rehn and Hebard 1918, Weissman and Rentz 1977, Vickery and Weissman 1989). A population is protected at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve and another population is unprotected in a heavily grazed pasture on Stanford University (Weissman and Rentz 1977). The petitioner stated that grazing may benefit the species. Beyond the information described above, the petition presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Antioch shield-backed katydid is known only from a single male specimen collected in 1937 at the Antioch sand dunes in Contra Costa County, California (Rentz 1977). Though the dunes historically covered an estimated 190 acres, only 70 acres remain (United States Fish and Wildlife Service 1984). The natural habitats in this area have been adversely effected by industrialization, sand mining, urbanization, agricultural land conversion, off-road vehicles, wildfire, and other human impacts. As suggested by its specific epithet, the Antioch shield-backed katydid is presumed extinct, given the extent of habitat loss and absence of any observations since 1937. Diligent searches for this animal have been conducted by numerous professional and amateur entomologists over a period of several decades but no further individuals have been located (Powell 1978, Rentz 1977). Conversely, if the species is still extant on the sand dunes, it likely would be protected because most of the remaining natural dunes are secured by the Service's ownership and management of the Antioch Dunes National Wildlife Refuge. This refuge was created to protect the endangered Lange's metalmark butterfly ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Apodemia mormo langei <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Contra Costa wallflower ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Erysimum capitatum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> angustatum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and the Antioch Dunes evening primrose ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oenothera deltoides  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> howellii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal, which is possibly extinct. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The San Bernardino Mountains grasshopper is known only from Vivian and High Creeks in the San Bernardino Mountains of San Bernardino County, California (Otte 1984, Rentz and Weissman 1984). The species inhabits ponderosa pine forest at altitudes of 1820 to 2743 meters (Rentz and Weissman 1984). Little information is available on the specific localities, habitat requirements, or status of this species. No threats to this animal were cited in the petition or are otherwise known to the Service. Beyond the information described above, the petition presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Lompoc grasshopper is known from Lompoc in Santa Barbara County and Paso Robles in San Luis Obispo County during the month of August (Otte 1984). No data are available to the Service on the specific localities, habitat requirements, or status of this animal. No threats to this species were cited in the petition or are otherwise known to the Service. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Santa Monica Mountains grasshopper is known only from the western Santa Monica Mountains in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. This species has been found on bare hillsides and along dirt trails in chaparral (Rentz and Weissman 1981). The petitioner did not cite any threats, but noted that two locations inhabited by this species have been destroyed by development. Little information exists on the habitat requirements or status of this species. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Central Valley grasshopper is known from four localities in the Central Valley and the Delta region of California (Otte 1984, Strohecker  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1968). The petitioner stated that this species has not been collected since 1953. The Central Valley grasshopper has been found on low, dry desert flats during the months of July and August in the vicinity of Bakersfield, Ceres, and Turlock (Otte 1984). No data are available to the Service on the specific localities, habitat requirements, or status of the Central Valley grasshopper. No threats to this animal were cited in the petition or are otherwise known to the Service. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

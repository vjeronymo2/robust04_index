			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F> Democrats, by Noemi Sumegi; place and date not given: "The  Details Will Not Be Published Later, Either -- Ivan Peto on the  Deputy Prime Ministerial Post, the Need To Prove, and the  Cohabitation Agreement"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Sumegi] Before the  elections, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] often  mentioned the lack of unity in the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP], and that your cooperation with them would depend a lot  on which of these forces would dominate in the MSZP.    [Peto] During the talks, it has become clear that the MSZP's  coalition intention is serious and this cannot at the moment be  doubted by the SZDSZ. The coalition will obviously increase the  chance that policies that are acceptable to the SZDSZ prevail in  the country, and it is no secret that this was one of the  factors that influenced us. Therefore, if we had and have  worries about the possible existence of various intentions in  the MSZP, we will be able to influence these intentions through  the coalition. I do not think that this needs to be kept  secret. [passage omitted]    [Sumegi] You have often mentioned the example of Germany,  where the Free Democrats, in spite of their few mandates, occupy  an important position in the government. Is it possible that  the SZDSZ will get the positions of foreign minister, interior  minister, and justice minister in Hungary?    [Peto] If we only looked at the speculation then the whole  government would belong to us because it has already been  suggested regardomg all ministries that we insist on having it.  We do not wish to talk about this in public during the talks.  [passage omitted]    [Sumegi] Returning to the German example, is it possible  that, whoever acquires majority, the SZDSZ can always be a  governmental factor?    [Peto] Hungarian political life consists of three lines and  practically none of the political forces can form a government  on its own -- although the MSZP has now acquired the absolute  majority. I assume that this situation will be prolonged and  that a similar landslide-like victory cannot be expected at the  next elections. Therefore, at least two forces will always have  to work together. The SZDSZ is a serious factor in political  life and, at the next elections, it can be one of the parties  that will choose coalition partners.    [Sumegi] Do you even think cooperation with the conservative  parties possible?    [Peto] On the basis of statements made by some leaders of  the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], I assume that there is a  chance that the MDF will conduct moderate politics in  opposition. It is not necessary for our relations to remain the  way they have been in the past few years. I can imagine that  the Hungarian political life will be like the German one where  there are joining points between the various political forces.  [passage omitted]    [Sumegi] The SZDSZ, which has so far been open about its  politics, appears to be more hostile to the press.    [Peto] We consider it extremely important to inform the  public but we also have other obligations. If our convention  had been public then our debate could not have been so open. A  decision that will determine a party's life in the long run does  not necessarily have to be made before the public, and the same  applies to the coalition talks. The negotiations would not  achieve their objective if we were also trying to adapt to the  needs of publicity. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER REPORT: RECREATIONAL VEHICLES MAKING MAJOR INROADS;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: RV AND MOTOR-HOME RENTAL VACATIONS ARE GROWING IN POPULARITY.  THEIRAPPEAL IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN ATTRACTING MORE THAN JUST RETIREES.  </P> <P> A growing vacation experience sought by families or small groups is the renting  of a recreational vehicle or motor home, either independently or as part of a  package tour.  </P> <P> "Rentals are the fastest-growing segment of the RV market, and have been  basically doubling annually over the past several years," said Karen Mason of  the Recreational Vehicle Industry Assn. "Of the 25-million RVers in the United  States, about 3 million are renters."  </P> <P> A type of RV tour called "caravaning" enables groups to travel along designated  routes at the individual's own pace during the day. At night, participants meet  at a predetermined area.  </P> <P> As with standard escorted tours, a professional guide called "wagonmaster" or  "caravan master" goes along.  </P> <P> Unlike other kinds of tours, these RV packages may also have a person, called  the "tailgunner," traveling behind the caravan. The tailgunner handles  mechanical problems.  </P> <P> Such RV caravan packages are available in the United States, Canada, Mexico,  Europe, Australia and New Zealand.  </P> <P> "In the continental United States, our packages are for people who own RVs, but  in Alaska and abroad we use rentals," said Shirley Cliff, a spokeswoman for  Compass RV Tours of Greenville, Mich.  </P> <P> "We limit the number of vehicles to 15, so they can be spread out and not on  top of each other. It's sort of a loose procession, and people can go off on  their own for special sightseeing."  </P> <P> New Orleans-based Creative World Rallies and Caravans offers packages in  several parts of the world, including Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "Everyone gets a trip log, indicating points of interest on the route," said  company President Bill LaGrange. "They can proceed as they wish on what we call  a 'scattered caravan.' They have a phone number to call at the evening  rendezvous in case they decide not to show up that night."  </P> <P> Participants also receive standard sightseeing tours in key cities. "The usual  sightseeing buses pick up and return people to the campsites we use," LaGrange  added.  </P> <P> Costs may include rental, vehicle and personal insurance, RV park reservations  and site fees, round-trip air fare to pickup point, ferry or train  reservations, emergency roadside assistance and itineraries and road  guides/route information. Some meals may be part of the program. Visas and  permits also are provided.  </P> <P> Some packages may include other forms of travel. For example, Compass RV Tours  offers an Alaska package that features a four-night cruise along the Inside  Passage, and a South Pacific program that uses motor homes in New Zealand and  hotels in Australia.  </P> <P> The caravans can encompass a variety of activities, including visits to  sightseeing attractions, entertainment and group meals at campsites and  restaurants. Special-interest caravans, such as for fishing, bird watching and  photography, also are available.  </P> <P> RVs also are offered on an independent basis. In the past, RVs were used  primarily by retirees. According to the Travel Industry Assn. of America,  however, the 35-to-54 age group is expected to make a dent in RV trips in the  1990s.  </P> <P> Advantages of RV travel are the saving of hotel costs, eating out, and the  convenience of almost no packing and unpacking. Generally, the cost of an RV  package can average less than the daily combined cost of hotels and meals.  </P> <P> RV/motor homes, available in various sizes, have kitchen facilities. Food can  be stored in a refrigerator unit. Microwave ovens also are often available.  There's also dining and sleeping space and bathrooms. Televisions,  videocassette players and stereos may also be part of the package.  </P> <P> Driving large RV vehicles may seem scary to some, but may be easier that one  thinks.  </P> <P> "Many people think the RV is too big to drive," said Bill Calderone, director  of marketing for Miami-based Cruise America. "They don't realize that the RVs  come with power steering and brakes as well as automatic transmission.  Generally, no special driver's license is needed. It's not like driving a big  truck."  </P> <P> More than 20,000 public and private campgrounds and RV resorts are scattered  around the United States. Some of these campgrounds include tennis courts, golf  courses and health spas -- with prices to match, naturally.  </P> <P> But before rushing out to rent an RV, consider these points: Renting an RV is  more complicated than renting a car. The application forms involve more  questions. Unlike car rentals, you have to pay up front. Credit cards, however,  can be used.  </P> <P> Computation of charges is based on the number of days of the rental agreement  and estimates of the distance to be traveled, with differences in the actual  cost refunded upon return of the vehicle.  </P> <P> Expect to pay several deposits on the vehicle. According to the RVIA, security  deposits average about $500; cleaning deposits of $50 are common, and  sanitizing fees of $50 may also be imposed.  </P> <P> Rental firms may have a minimum of days (one to seven days) that you can rent  the RV. The summer and holiday periods are likely to involve the need for  longer rentals. Reservations are important.  </P> <P> Find out what your insurance coverage costs and what it covers. Some rentals  include special insurance provisions with extra protection that you can buy.  Check to see if your automobile insurance covers you in any way. Basic  insurance coverage averages $10 to $15 a day.  </P> <P> Also, some RV-rental companies require drivers to be at least 25 years old.  </P> <P> "Our age limit for drivers is 21. All additional drivers have to be identified  at the time of rental," Calderone said.  </P> <P> In addition, find out if you get free mileage included in the rental price.  Free mileage per day can be 100 miles or less. After the free mileage, a charge  of 25 to 50 cents per mile can be charged to the rental costs.  </P> <P> "Our free mileage depends on the length of the rental," said Teresa Toney, a  spokeswoman for U-Haul International's RV rental division. "The longer the  rental, the more free mileage that may be allowed."  </P> <P> Be sure to ask questions before you sign an agreement. Everyone will have some.  </P> <P> The questions can cover orientation sessions, equipment and appliances. Also,  the items that come with the rental, such as towels, linens and kitchen  utensils or housekeeping packages.  </P> <P> Prices may vary from a $50-to-$100 flat fee to $30 per person per trip.  Travelers flying to their pickup point for the RVs may want to rent a  housekeeping package to avoid packing essentials.  </P> <P> Check to see if the RV-rental firm offers any perks with its rentals, such as  discounts at campgrounds and sightseeing attractions.  </P> <P> Is there a hot line phone number to call in case of need? Will such a number be  toll-free? And during what hours will the line be operating?  </P> <P> Newcomers to this form of travel should test it first before taking long trips.  Go for a weekend getaway.  </P> <P> Sources of information on RV travel:  </P> <P> Compass RV Tours, (800-346-7572).  </P> <P> Creative World Rallies and Caravans, (800) 732-8337).  </P> <P> Cruise America, (800) 327-7778).  </P> <P> U-Haul International, RV Rental Division, (800) 821-2172).  </P> <P> Recreational Vehicle Industry Assn., 1896 Preston White Drive, Reston, Va.  22090, (703) 620-6003).  </P></p>

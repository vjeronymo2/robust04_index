Curbelo will  assume office in the next few days.    LA JORNADA cites statements by outgoing diplomat Jose  Fernandez de Cossio, who said that "the appointment of the new  Mexican ambassador to Cuba, Carlos Tello, was approved three  days ago and that the appointment of the new Cuban ambassador to  Mexico was also approved."    According to Ambassador Fernandez de Cossio, ties between  the  two countries "are fine in every sense and there is excellent  communication. These ties are longstanding and very strong."    The Cuban ambassador said Abelardo Curbelo is currently the  Cuban ambassador to Uruguay, and "will travel to Mexico City  shortly."    Fernandez de Cossio hosted an official farewell reception  for  the diplomatic corps accredited in Mexico. Fernandez de Cossio  has been ambassador to Mexico for the past 10 years.    Mexican Tourism Secretary Jesus Silva Herzog; Cuauhtemoc  Cardenas, presidential candidate for the opposition Party of the  Democratic Revolution; and Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia  Marquez were among those attending the farewell reception.    Fernandez de Cossio stressed that "for reasons of mutual  geographic interest, proximity, and cultural and historic  similarities, the ties between Cuba and Mexico have always been  particularly strong."    The Cuban ambassador also recalled the high degree of  awareness the two countries have regarding the international  situation and the role the United Nations should play, as well  as other important matters of current interest.    "We must thank Mexico for the position it has maintained at  the various international forums against all attempts to isolate  my small island. This position has been an expression of  friendship and solidarity which we value highly," Fernandez de  Cossio said.    In conclusion, the Cuban ambassador reiterated the  expressions of love and affection he has received in the  approximately 10 years of being in this country. "I take with me  memories and experiences that in these past few days have been  heightened by the many expressions of affection I have been  receiving and which can be summed up by the fact that I have  been awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle."</p>

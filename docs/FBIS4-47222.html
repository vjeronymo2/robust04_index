			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with writer Olzhas Suleymenov, leader of </F> Kazakhstan's People's Congress, by MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI  correspondents Sanobar Shermatova and Viktor Kiyanits; place and  date not given: "The Russian Problem Cannot Be Resolved by  Reshaping the Borders"]    [Text] [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Various political forces in  Russia are expressing themselves on the problem of Russians in  Kazakhstan, and the spectrum of opinions is broad--from  Zhirinovskiy to Solzhenitsyn. How do you, a Kazakh, see this  problem, and does a solution exist?    [Suleymenov] It seems to me that the statements of such an  authoritative writer as Solzhenitsyn are far more dangerous for  peace between Russia and Kazakhstan than Zhirinovskiy's  provincial [mestechkovyy] imperialism. Solzhenitsyn is a  remarkable writer and a distinguished personality, but  geopolitics is not his specialty, and he has already proven  this. It is hardly likely that the problem of Russians in  Kazakhstan can be resolved by reshaping the borders.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] The principle of the firmness of  borders now, when the status of Nagornyy Karabakh, Abkhazia, and  the Dniester region is being decided, is being put to a serious  test. The states of Central Asia, where the current borders were  drawn in the 1920's rather arbitrarily, have territorial claims  on one another, including Russia on Kazakhstan. What should be  done about this?    [Suleymenov] Every forced reshaping of borders--this is a  lot  of blood, war, and death. The border problem can be discussed in  negotiations, and an agreement can be reached. This is a long  process, but it is the only acceptable one, if we want peace. I  think that we nevertheless will take Europe's path, where  borders are rather conditional. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, and  Uzbekistan took a step in this direction, when they eased  customs rules. Border questions with Russia can be resolved in  exactly the same way. One of the main ones--the problem of  citizenship for Russians and Kazakhs in our countries--can be  resolved within the framework of a Eurasian Union. This idea is  now being worked out in Kazakhstan.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you support it?    [Suleymenov] The sore subjects of our societies, in  particular of the Russian-speaking population, can be resolved  only in the close integration of Kazakhstan and Russia. I do not  see in this an infringement on Kazakhstan's sovereignty. Just  exactly as I do not see an infringement on the national dignity  of Kazakhs in the event that the Russian language receives  official language status.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you consider this practical?    [Suleymenov] Why not? The ratio of the Kazakh and Slavic  populations in Kazakhstan is almost proportional; therefore, it  is quite logical that the two languages should have official  status. No sensible person will reject the language that he  knows. And practically every Kazakh speaks Russian. Why and to  what purpose should we reject the Russian language, which gives  us definite advantages in the sphere of culture and  international relations? Kazakhstan and Russia are fated to live  as neighbors, and it depends on us, Kazakhs, Russians, all  citizens, whether it will be at odds or well and in harmony.</p>

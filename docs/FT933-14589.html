			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / German cabinet passes draft law on labour flexibility A DRAFT law on flexible working hours in German industry was approved yesterday by the German cabinet. The draft, which will replace 28 existing laws and regulations on working hours, was hailed by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economy minister, as a leap towards deregulation and improving the competitiveness of German industry. Among a series of moves to introduce flexibility, the draft law would allow companies to cite cheap foreign competition as a reason for requiring extra production shifts on Sundays and holidays. The reforms are intended to give individual enterprises and their workers more responsibility for negotiating their own working hours, within limits prescribed by the law. While the normal working day for wage-earners remains fixed at eight hours, they may work up to 10 hours a day taking time off to compensate for the overtime over a period of six months. Hitherto they have been required to take the time off within two weeks. Workers and employers at individual enterprises will be allowed to negotiate a compensation period of longer than six months, if they wish. There will be a significant extension of the exemptions to allow for Sunday and holiday working. As far as foreign competition is concerned, employers can appeal for the right to introduce Sunday and holiday shifts if they can prove that jobs are threatened by cheaper manufacturers in other countries, where labour hours and other social conditions reduce their costs. The law, which has to be passed by the German parliament, will also remove existing discrimination on women's working hours, such as night-shift working, although it will continue to outlaw female labour in underground mining. Mr Norbert Blum, the labour minister, called on both workers and employers to use all the available flexibility to decide their own working hours. 'We need more creativity and more imagination in fixing working time,' he said. 'That could produce a significant improvement in productivity.' He insisted, however, that the law would not mean a dramatic change in the enforcement of Sundays and holidays as rest days. 'Sunday should not be a day like all the other days,' he said. 'People would lose all sense of direction if they worked in a continuous grey time-porridge.'</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Company to consult investors over sale MB-CARADON, the building products and security printing group, is to ask shareholders for authority to sell its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the Franco-British packaging group. The stake, worth Pounds 549m at last night's closing share price of Pounds 26.75p, up 62p, dates back to the April 1989 merger between Metalbox Packaging, then a subsidiary, and Carnaud, the French group. MB-Caradon's shares initially rose on the news but fell back to close unchanged at 310p. Shareholders' approval is required because of the size of the stake and an extraordinary meeting is being called for March 4. Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive of MB-Caradon, said obtaining approval in advance would improve the company's negotiating position. No minimum price was mentioned. CGIP, the French industrial holding company which also holds a 25.3 per cent of CarnaudMetalbox, said yesterday that it might increase its stake if the French stock market authorities allow it to do so without making a full bid. Paris analysts were doubtful that CGIP could afford to buy the whole of the stake. 'CGIP would have to go into debt to buy the MB-Caradon stake in CMB, or even a large part of it,' said Ms Christiane Marcellier, an analyst with James Capel. 'The financial return on the investment just would not justify doing that.' MB-Caradon said that though the CarnaudMetalbox stake accounted for a significant part of its assets and earnings, the dividends received were modest, and were not a tax efficient source of income. It plans to reinvest the proceeds of a sale in 'businesses under its direct control and management'. Lex, Page 18</p>

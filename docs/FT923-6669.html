			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Falling dollar sends Dow into reverse Wall Street THE PLUMMETING dollar sent US stock markets into sharp decline yesterday after President Bush's speech at the Republican convention failed to give equity sentiment much of a lift, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 50.79 at 3,254.10, its lowest since April 9 and the biggest single-day decline of the year. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 3.39 at 414.87, the Amex composite was 1.56 lower at 384.31 and the Nasdaq composite was down 4.15 at 563.71. Turnover on the New York SE was heavy at 204m shares. The main influence on the markets was the dollar which, despite concerted intervention by central banks worldwide, fell to its lowest point ever against the Deutschmark at DM1.4310. Although currency factors rarely effect the stock markets, the dollar weakness means the Federal Reserve has almost no room to cut interest rates again if it believes the economy needs more help. The falling dollar also sent bond prices into reverse, which also upset equity investors. Sentiment was not aided by reaction to Mr Bush's acceptance speech at the Houston convention. Although it was a political success, economists did not rate highly his proposals to boost the economy. Among individual stocks, USX-Marathon fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 18 1/4 in turnover of 2.9m shares on speculation that tight cash flows might force the energy company to cut its high-yield dividend, due to be paid at Dollars 1.40 a share. Goodrich dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 in heavy trading on reports that the sector analyst at top investment bank Goldman Sachs had reduced his estimate for the company's earnings. Presley dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 2 7/8 on reports that a securities class action lawsuit had been filed against the housebuilder relating to its initial public offering last year. On the Nasdaq market Autodesk bucked the trend with a gain of Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 45 1/8 on Thursday's late news that the company would sell its two subsidiaries that make up the information systems division. Hadco was another rare gainer, climbing Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 5 5/8 after the company's board authorised the purchase of up to Dollars 4m of common shares in the open market. Canada TORONTO stocks ended the week on a losing note, in continued moderate trading. The composite index fell 13.34 points, or 0.39%, to 3,390.32. On the week, the index was up about 22 points. Losing issues edged winners by 258 to 240, volume rose to 23.745m shares from 22.978m and trading value was CDollars 341.5m against CDollars 266.9m. Mexico's stock market lost 4.0 to 1,435.0 by 10.30 am yesterday, its lowest this year and 25 per cent off the 1992 high, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. Investors are concerned about the slowdown in the economy, uncertainty in the US elections and accordingly tentative prospects for the North American Free Trade Agreement. High interest rates are also attracting money from the equity market into the money markets.</p>

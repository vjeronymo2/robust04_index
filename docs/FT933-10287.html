			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Honda enlists Stadco in expansion drive - Components venture expects sales of Y1bn HONDA Engineering, part of the Japanese motor group, has chosen Stadco of the UK as its partner in a venture to design and make systems for automotive components manufacture and assembly lines in Europe. The deal is the first such alliance signed by Stadco, the automotive pressings and production equipment subsidiary of Hall Engineering (Holdings). It is an important step in Stadco's strategy to move into the top tier of European automotive production equipment suppliers. Honda expects annual sales of Y1bn (Pounds 6.4m) from the alliance, which it said would extend later to regions such as south-east Asia and Africa. It forms part of Honda efforts to expand supplies of its engineering equipment outside the group's own factories. The link-up is a further boost for Stadco, which in March announced its first order from a German-owned car company when Volkswagen's Audi unit signed up for Pounds 21m of vehicle assembly equipment and tooling. Germany is home to Thyssen and Kuka, two of Europe's leading suppliers of such machinery. Mr Alan Mace, Stadco's managing director, said the deal would strengthen the company through access to Honda's research and development, and technology for 'lean' manufacturing systems. It would also give Stadco extra credibility as it sought orders from European car manufacturers. Access to Honda Engineering's manufacturing capability would allow Stadco to get its name on bidding lists for larger contracts than was now possible, at least in the short and medium term, Mr Mace said. In the UK Stadco has supplied both Honda - last year it installed body manufacturing equipment at the Japanese company's new Swindon plant - and Rover Group, in which Honda has a 20 per cent stake. Stadco's sales have grown from Pounds 11m in 1983 to Pounds 45m-Pounds 50m in each of the past two years. It accounts for about a third of Hall, which is best known for its steel stockholding and construction product interests.</p>

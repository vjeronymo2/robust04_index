			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / NatWest to launch German storecard NATIONAL Westminster Bank is to introduce the storecard to Germany as part of a fresh expansion by British financial services companies into continental Europe. The bank is setting up an operation to offer retailers the credit cards under its Comfort brand, which operates in Holland and Belgium, it said yesterday. The establishment of NatWest's German card company is expected to employ about 300 people by 1997. Although banks have been hit by high provisions against bad debts in operations such as mortgage lending in France and Spain, they are keen to offer British products such as store credit cards in markets where they are less known. NatWest said yesterday that the use of store credit cards, now the dominant means of buying consumer durables such as washing machines and freezers in the UK, had not yet developed in Germany, or some other European countries. Mr John Morgan, marketing director of the personal finance operation of NatWest's Lombard North Central finance house subsidiary, said the bank had already received expressions of interest from some 3,000 German retailers. NatWest will not charge German retailers for providing their branded credit cards. Although the store's name appears on cards, the bank lends money and makes interest charges on the amount borrowed, as well as assessing risks. German retailers have until now relied on generic credit cards such as MasterCard and Visa as well as debit cards. The transaction charges paid by retailers each time one of these cards is used have acted as a disincentive. NatWest said it was forming a venture called Comfort Card GMBH, based in Dusseldorf. A similar operation opened in Holland in 1985 is used in 6,000 retail outlets, while NatWest opened a branch office in Belgium last year. Mr Morgan said the bank had carefully researched the risks of bad debt in Germany, and concluded that consumers were 'cautious about the way they spend their money, and prudent in the need to repay what is borrowed'. He said NatWest might extend branded cards to other EC countries.</p>

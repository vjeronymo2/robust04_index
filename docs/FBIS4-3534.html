			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 21 (XINHUA) -- A spokesman for Russian  President Boris Yeltsin announced here today that the Russian,  U.S. presidents and representatives from United Nations and  European Union will probably meet within a month over the  Bosnian crisis.    Yeltsin's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov made the  announcement at a press conference in the Kremlin today.    According to Kostikov, President Yeltsin talked with U.S.  President Bill Clinton for 40 minutes over telephone late last  night.    He said President Yeltsin firmly opposes NATO air strikes at  the Bosnian Serb Forces without consulting with Russia.    Kostikov added that President Clinton had promised to act  with caution in dealing with such matters in the future.    Yeltsin on Tuesday [19 April] called on the Serbs to  withdraw  from around the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, Eastern Bosnia, to  allow the deployment of U.N. Peacekeepers.</p>

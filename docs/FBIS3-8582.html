He said the view was not held only by him, as Kovac's  candidacy resulted from preliminary agreements of the opposition  parties and groups in the case of the no-confidence vote in  Meciar's government.    Until recently, Roman Kovac held the post of deputy premier.  He was, however, dismissed by Meciar as he stood up against him.</p>

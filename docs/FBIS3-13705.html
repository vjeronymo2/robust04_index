			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Yasir 'Arafat has renewed the PLO's  appeal to the co-sponsors of the peace conference and the  members of the Security Council to respond to the Palestinian  people's request for international protection in the occupied  territories. 'Arafat renewed this appeal when he received  Jean-Louis Tauran, official in charge of foreign affairs at the  Vatican, in Tunis yesterday.    The Palestinian president also insisted on the need for the  Security Council to adopt a resolution condemning the massacre  at the Tomb of the Patriarchs and providing international  protection for the Palestinian people. In reply to a question  on the Palestinian response to President Clinton's call for a  resumption of talks, 'Arafat said that he wants a frank reply  before making any answer on the Palestinian position on this  matter.    The Palestinian news agency reported yesterday evening that  President 'Arafat and the Vatican envoy discussed ways of  strengthening relations between the Palestinians and the Vatican  and providing international protection for the Palestinian  people from the attacks and massacres perpetrated by Israeli  settlers. They also discussed the role of the Vatican in  supporting the peace process on the basis of safeguarding  Palestinian rights, particularly the issue of holy Jerusalem,  which is important to Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims, and  Christians alike.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Nakuru, 17 March (KNA) -- Two journalists with  THE STANDARD newspaper were today charged before a Nakuru court  with writing a subversive report prejudicial to state security.  Mr. James Ngumo, who is THE STANDARD bureau chief in Nakuru,  and Peter Rianga, the paper's correspondent based in Kisii,  appeared before the senior principal magistrate, Mr. William  Tuiyot, but were not allowed to plead to the charge as consent  to prosecute them has not been given by the attorney general.  The court remanded them in custody until 31st March when they  will renew their application for bail.    They were accused that with subversive intention they  published a report in THE STANDARD Wednesday [16 March] edition  alleging that tribal clashes had erupted in Molo division,  during which nine people were killed and hundreds displaced, a  report calculated to promote hatred and enemity between  different communities.

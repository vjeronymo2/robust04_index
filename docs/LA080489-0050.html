			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> TEXAS ENACTS FLAG LAW TO COUNTER COURT  </P> <P> Texas Gov. Bill Clements signed a bill establishing a new state flag  desecration law to replace the one thrown out by the Supreme Court. The  measure, similar to one pending in Congress, makes it a crime to desecrate the  American flag and does not include language that the Supreme Court found  objectionable when it ruled in June that flag burning was a protected form of  free speech. The new Texas law also makes it a crime to desecrate the state  flag. President Bush has argued that the court's ruling cannot be overturned  with a simple bill, either at the state or federal level, contending that a  constitutional amendment is needed to give the states and the Congress the  power to draft bills against flag desecration. The Texas Legislature has also  passed a resolution urging Congress to approve the constitutional change.  </P></p>

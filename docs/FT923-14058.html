			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Investment trusts drop short of target THORNTON Investment Management yesterday announced that its European Smaller Companies investment trust had raised Pounds 35.5m, barely a third of its original Pounds 100m target. It said the launch had been hit by the gloomy sentiment which afflicted the market at the end of June, following the abandonment of the GPA Group flotation and disappointment with the MFI Furniture Group and The Telegraph launches. Thornton's offer period opened on June 15 and closed last Monday. Thornton's trust was chaired by Mr Peter Walker, the former cabinet minister who was created a life peer in the dissolution honours list. The trust also had an ambitious fund management structure, with duties split between Thornton in the UK, BNP in France, and Dresdner in Germany. It was marketed to institutions and retail consumers in all three countries. Mr David Harding, institutional marketing manager at Thornton, said take-up had been strongest on the retail side, particularly in Germany where the issue had strong support from Dresdner's branch network. UK institutions accounted for the most disappointing figures. He said: 'Our original target was higher and I think we would have made it if it hadn't been for the sharp deterioration in the UK new issues market in the weeks coming up to the launch. Maybe they are taking an enlightened view of the markets in Europe.' Henderson Administration reported a similar problem with its newly launched EuroTrust investment trust, whose offer period ended last week. It aimed for 'at least Pounds 20m', and forecast Pounds 25m, but raised only Pounds 17.3m. A sudden outbreak of gloomy sentiment caused by failed new issues and the BP boardroom coup was blamed. Mr Alan Gadd, director of investment trusts at Henderson, said: 'I have never experienced such a change in sentiment as we saw among stockbrokers in the last 10 days of June. That was remarkable, and there's no doubt that is the reason why we were under what we had anticipated.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, June 29, (TURAN)--"The usage of Gabala  Radio-Locating Station and other military objects situated on  Azerbaijan's territory is possible if they are not harmful to  ecology, economy and interests of the republic", reads the  statement distributed by the members of political parties and  public organizations of Azerbaijan yesterday.    The results of the Commission of the Milli Mejlis for Gabala  Radio-Locating Station were read out in the headquarters of  Musavat party on Saturday.    The Commission stated that the station radiates  high-frequency electric magnetic waves, which are very harmful  for flora, fauna and population of the region.    In accordance with the Presidential Decree from December 16,  1991 and the resolution of the Milli Mejlis from April 8, 1992,  all military objects on the territory of Azerbaijan have been  nationalized. However, the Gabala Radio-Locating Station is  still runned by Russian servicemen. Azerbaijan and Russia have  not reached an agreement concerning this issue.    An employee of Russian Embassy in Azerbaijan, Colonel  Vladimir Pavlenko, mentioned that few are the stations in the  world like the Gabala Radio-Locating Station, which work in  automatic regime. According to Pavlenko, the station is able to  follow the space objects within the distance of 10,000  kilometres. The Gabala RadioLocating Station is of strategic  importance in the system of anti-air defense.    Pavlenko said that the Radio-Locating Station has resources  for 20-25 upcoming years. "The station is not harmful for  fauna, flora and the population, on the contrary, it can be very  useful", said Vladimir Pavlenko.    An employee of the State Committee for ecology, Fikret  Jafarov, however, said that the station works in a freezing  regime. "It is a common knowledge that this regime is used with  highfrequency electric magnetic waves, which are very harmful",  said Jafarov.</p>

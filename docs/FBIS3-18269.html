			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Han Halevi, PLO delegate to the Socialist </F> International in Paris, by Henri Vernet; place and date not  given: "`Israel Must Disarm Settlers and Evacuate Settlements'"]    [Text] Han Halevi, the PLO delegate to the Socialist  International in Paris, was one of the key figures in the  rapprochement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, which  last year ended up with the secret agreement in Oslo. In his  opinion, the only way to save the peace process is to initiate  talks immediately on the fate of the Jewish settlements in the  occupied territories, and to begin evacuating them. "The  settlers," Halevi feels, "have got it into their head to prevent  the application" of the interim autonomy agreements and the  "Israeli Government has so far not had the courage to prove them  wrong." That is what must now change.    [Vernet] According to the Israelis, the Hebron massacre was  an "isolated act," and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin even called  the person responsible for it a "psychopath." The PLO, however,  sees in it a plot involving some 30 settlers. Why?    [Halevi] Since yesterday morning, Palestinian witnesses have  reported that there were "several gunmen." In addition, it is  difficult to believe that a lone gunman, even with a machine  gun, could have left so many victims. That is the first point.    The second suspicious aspect is the speed and insistence  with  which the Israelis -- from the head of government to the  ambassadors, like the one here in Paris -- tried to push through  the version that this was the act of a lone madman. And they  did this before the inquiry had even gotten under way there!    [Vernet] Who could be implicated in this attack? Do the  settlers have links with the Israeli Army?    [Halevi] I believe that there are elements within the  Israeli  Army which are seeking to add fuel to the flames. The country's  press has already mentioned it. There are officers capable of  doing this kind of thing in an effort to derail the peace  process.    [Vernet] Do you feel that the responsibility for the  massacre  lies at this level?    [Halevi] No, it is the Israeli Government itself which is  clearly responsible. Since the signing of the  Israeli-Palestinian declaration of principle in Washington, the  Rabin government has made no clear statements about the  settlers. Even worse, it has let the settlers believe that they  have the power to block the peace process. They demonstrated  this bloodily yesterday.    [Vernet] Did they succeed? Is the Oslo process definitively  grounded?    [Halevi] Everything depends on the reaction and attitude of  the Israeli Government. The ball is in its court, not in the  settlers'. Rabin cannot be content with making condemnations,  there must be suppression, arrests, imprisonments, and sentences  so that light can be shed on any collusion wherever it may be  found. And of course the settlers must be disarmed. Otherwise,  the entire peace process will be discredited once and for all.    [Vernet] Exactly, so should we not once again question the  feasibility of the Oslo agreement?    [Halevi] The great weakness in this agreement is primarily  the fact that the way was left clear for the Israelis to  postpone "sine die" the talks on the future of the settlements  and the status of the settlers. This is what they have been  seeking since the beginning: Gaining time on the ground and not  tackling the matter before the final phase of the negotiations,  which will be lay down the definitive status of the occupied  territories, because the Rabin government fears nothing more  than a wide-ranging public debate by Israeli society on these  settlements.    It had been noticed well before yesterday's massacre that it  is the presence of the settlers that is the main obstacle to the  application of the Oslo agreement.    [Vernet] Why this hesitancy?    [Halevi] For so many years, their leaders have hammered home  to the Israelis that by settling in the occupied territories  they were merely exercising their "sacred right." For Likud and  the religious groups, it was the sacred right to the land. For  the Labor Party and the pragmatists, it was the Israeli people's  right to security and self-defense. That is how they justified  the supposedly irreversible fait accompli of the settlements.    Today, the government has to explain to the Israelis that it  always lied to them and that they have no divine right to occupy  the land of others.    [Vernet] In concrete terms, do the Palestinian negotiators  have the resources to force their Israeli counterparts to  discuss the fate of the Jewish settlements?    [Halevi] Yes, because according to the terms of the Oslo  agreement, i.e., the declaration of principle signed on 13  September at the White House, the negotiations on the definitive  status must begin "as soon as possible" -- and in any case no  later than two years after the implementation of the interim  autonomy agreement. So, the soonest possible is today. We must  begin these talks and begin evacuating the settlements before  this problem blows up in our faces once and for all.    [Vernet] Is that the substance of the appeal made by 'Arafat  to the United Nations?    [Halevi] The immediate objective of taking recourse to the  United Nations is to have emergency measures taken to protect  the Palestinians not only from the settlers, but also from the  Israeli Army. The Europeans must assume their responsibility  within the Security Council -- and the Americans must not use  their veto -- in order to define the ways and means for  international intervention in the occupied territories.    [Vernet] So far, the Security Council, although it has  recently passed resolutions condemning Israel, has never passed  any sanctions against it. It has never imposed any decisions on  the Jewish state which Israel feels are unacceptable...as the  deployment of an peace-keeping force might be?    [Halevi] This odious massacre could give the international  community the chance to tell the Israeli leadership clearly and  firmly: Do not indulge the settlers or be weak with them, and  make a commitment to evacuating the occupied territories. In  short, the Security Council must prevent the Israelis from  sabotaging that which they themselves have committed themselves  to doing. As early as last 13 December, Israel showed the world  that it does not keep its word, by flouting the schedule  provided for in the Oslo agreement (which made provisions for  the beginning of Israeli's military withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho on 13 December.)    [Vernet] Two years ago, U.S. President George Bush refused  to  grant credit guarantees to the Jewish state, precisely because  the Shamir (then in power in Jerusalem) government's  continuation of the settlement process threatened the peace  process. Will Bill Clinton prove to be just as firm?    [Halevi] That is hard to say, especially since the Clinton  administration has granted credits to Shamir's successor, Rabin.  Yet, Rabin has only met half of the American demands which were  based on -- it must not be forgotten -- international law.  Indeed, the celebrated "freeze" decided by the Labor Party only  regards one part of the settlements, since settlements are  continuing in so-called security zones, and especially in  "greater Jerusalem." Nevertheless, we must hope that the Clinton  administration will prove to be firm toward its protege.</p>

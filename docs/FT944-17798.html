			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hewden Stuart surges to Pounds 16m - Increased demand and improved prices behind 78% advance Hewden Stuart, the UK's biggest independent plant hire group, said increased demand and improved prices had helped it to increase pre-tax profits by 78 per cent from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 16.2m in the six months to July 31. Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman, said trading was continuing at a high level and he expected that pre-tax profits in the second half would be 'substantially ahead' of the Pounds 10m achieved last time. Analysts upgraded their full-year forecasts from Pounds 27m to about Pounds 32m. Turnover rose by 40 per cent to Pounds 128m (Pounds 91.7m). The group said recovery from recession had increased the plant hire division's contribution by 39 per cent to Pounds 81.6m, while the merchandising division's input rose 40 per cent to Pounds 46.4m. The crane hire division saw less buoyant conditions than elsewhere, but moved from losses to an operating profit of Pounds 200,000. Sir Matthew said trading was slow in Scotland, but became stronger further south. The group had kept open all but one of the 41 depots acquired last year when it paid Pounds 11m for the Hireplant assets of BET. In spite of the sharp increase in turnover, the total number of employees increased only marginally, from 3,650 to 3,786. Capital expenditure in the first half exceeded Pounds 34m, bringing to Pounds 100m investment in the past 18 months. Mr Sandy Findlay, chief executive, said investment of not less than Pounds 25m was expected in the second half and about Pounds 60m next year. The investment came out of cashflow of Pounds 35m. The group said that by the summer cashflow was running at more than Pounds 1.5m per week. The chairman said: 'The rate of our cashflow is such that we will be able to continue to fund our programme from the group resources, thus ensuring that our policy of avoiding dilution of shareholders' interests by rights issues is maintained.' Earnings increased by 65 per cent to 4.94p (3p). The interim dividend was 0.825p (0.75p). COMMENT Sir Matthew was understandably jubilant over these results, which he described as 'quite superb' and promised analysts 'you ain't seen anything yet.' The strong recovery in profitability vindicates the group's decision last summer to step up its investment in new plant. The performance is all the more impressive considering that there are still areas of weakness - such as crane towers and site accommodation. The shares were unchanged yesterday at 146 1/2 p - a considerable achievement on a day the market plunged. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 32m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 15. The 8 per cent premium to the market does not look excessive for a group with this sort of track record and prospects.</p>

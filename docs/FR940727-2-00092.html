The Employer is a Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business located in Chicago, Illinois. The Plans are all defined contribution plans. The estimated number of participants in each of the Plans as of December 31, 1993 is:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Bally's Employee Savings Trust for Administrative Employees: 729  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Bally's Employees Savings Trust for Club Employees: 4,775  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Bally's Grand, Inc.

Retirement Savings Voluntary Participation Plan: 1,164  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. The Amended and Restated Bally's Park Place, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan: 2,162  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The assets of all five Plans are held in the Master Trust. Each Plan holds units of participation representing an undivided interest in the assets of the Master Trust. As of December 31, 1993, the total amount of Plan assets held in the Master Trust was approximately $95,000,000. The terms of the Plans permit participants to direct the investment of their accounts under the Plans. Each of the Plans provides its participants the option of investing in any of six mutual funds managed by Fidelity Management and Research Company, including the Interest Income Fund. The GICs, which were acquired directly by the Master Trust, are considered part of the Interest Income Fund. The Interest Income Fund has investments in several guaranteed investment contracts. On April 4, 1989, the Master Trust acquired GIC A ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CGO 1318 A3A) from Executive Life for $4,000,000. GIC A provided for annual, guaranteed interest at the rate of 10.13%, with a maturity date of October 15, 1992. On July 3, 1989, the Master Trust acquired GIC B ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CGO 1331 A3A) from Executive Life for $3,000,000. GIC B provided for annual guaranteed interest at the rate of 9.01%, with a maturity date of October 15, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On April 11, 1991, Executive Life was placed into conservatorship by the Insurance Commissioner of the State of California. The Employer represents that Executive Life ceased payments on the GICs upon commencement of the conservatorship. The effect of the conservatorship has been to freeze all assets invested in the GICs. This freeze has prevented Plan participants from exercising their rights under the Plans to request distributions, loans, withdrawals and investment transfers with respect to amounts currently invested in the GICs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Department notes that the decisions to acquire and hold the GICs are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of Part 4, Subtitle B, Title I of the Act.

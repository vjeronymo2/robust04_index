			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Man in the News: A figure of frugality - Andre Middelhoek Poring over European Union accounts is a pastime that Mr Andre Middelhoek finds so gripping that he even makes a few hours on a Sunday afternoon for the sport. In the smart Luxembourg suburb of Heisdorf, he surrounds himself with papers chronicling the minutiae of how the EU eats up around Ecu70bn (Pounds 55bn) of European taxpayers' money each year. But not everyone is grateful for his diligence. This week, in his capacity as president of the Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors, the EU's main financial watchdog, Mr Middelhoek caught the headlines with a report on mismanagement, fraud and waste in EU spending. Packed with examples of lax spending controls, in areas from building to wine production, the 484-page annual report has raised the hackles of officials at the European Commission. 'He is more a seeker of publicity than of solutions,' said one senior European Commission official. The 62-year-old Dutch economist, a former budget director in the Dutch ministry of finance, has worked at the court since its inception in 1977 and has been president since January 1993. His main aim has been to increase the court's authority over the financial operations of the Commission and the member states - and, according to a colleague, to 'show to European citizens that someone is looking after their money'. As a job, Mr Middelhoek's is close to impossible. No-one can say how much EU fraud exists, he says, although experts reckon that between 2 per cent and 10 per cent of the budget is wasted either through poor controls or criminal actions. But his task is made more difficult by the peculiarly unwieldy nature of the court itself. Although many observers believe it is meant to detect fraud, its remit is 'to monitor the management of (EU) funds and point out areas within this field where improvements need to be made'. About half the EU budget is spent on farm subsidies via the common agricultural policy - an area said to involve some 70m cash transactions a year - while another quarter goes on regional spending aimed at boosting the economies of the EU's poorer countries. Monitoring these kinds of flows means scouring mountains of paperwork, and interviewing hundreds of government officials from the member countries who spend most of the EU's budget. It is the court's 430 staff, roughly half of whom are professional auditors, who perform this seemingly endless task. They aim to look at each main item of the EU budget in reasonable detail every five years. In November the court publishes its findings in its annual report, and every month or two it publishes documents looking at specific issues, such as the cash spent on tobacco farming or cotton. What the court looks at, and when, is decided by a panel of 12 nominally independent officials, one from each EU member state, who work full-time in Luxembourg on renewable six-year contracts. They come from backgrounds in law, politics or government service, and every three years they elect one of their number as president. The panel also draws conclusions on where things need to be improved, and negotiates these changes. It is in this area that Mr Middelhoek's record has been most criticised. Combining the panel's disparate officials into a single efficient operation has proved particularly difficult. The then British court member, Mr Jo Carey, said two years ago that the institution often seemed like a 'rudderless ship'. Mr Middelhoek's efforts to improve matters through sessions for strategic thinking have helped a little, although doubts remain over the organisation's cohesion. Although gifted with a sharp mind and unflagging energy, Mr Middelhoek is also said to lack the diplomatic skills needed to win acceptance from the Commission and member states for new procedures to control spending. 'Middelhoek's good at banging the drum about fraud and waste, but he's not so good at establishing the relationships to start putting things right,' said one EU official. Officials at the court do not disguise that their relationships with the commission are poor, and commission insiders suggest Mr Middelhoek's lack of finesse has been responsible for much of this. He has, for example, had a stand-up row with Mr Bruce Millan, the blunt Brussels commissioner for regional aid, who felt he was being lectured. Mr Middelhoek is unhappy that he has never had a proper discussion with Mr Jacques Delors, the outgoing Commission president. But the absence of a meeting is put down on the commission side to the court president's prickliness. Even Mr Middelhoek's supporters, though praising his dedication and his ability to work for 18 hours a day, say the Dutchman can sometimes lose patience with those around him. 'He's not always the most charming boy,' said one. Mr Middelhoek certainly does have a combative side, asserting that no EU member state is keen enough to combat waste and mismanagement. His row with Mr Carey was particularly bitter. In response to Mr Carey's comments about the court's lack of direction, he said earlier this year: 'We have read it all and say (rude noise).' Mr Carey last year left the court, and is now involved in mediating between the commission and member governments on disputes over agricultural spending. To many, Mr Middelhoek's qualities would seem ideally suited to a mission to seek out impropriety and push for change. However, the last two years have shown that, in his particular job, diplomacy is as essential as determination. Mr Middelhoek is in the van of those pressing the Commission to introduce hefty fines on member governments that lack sufficiently tough spending controls. Many would argue Brussels also needs to introduce more auditors into its policy directorates to ensure cash is spent wisely. Mr Middelhoek has just one year left in office to persuade the new crop of commissioners that he is not just out to grab the headlines, but is also working at solutions.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Leading Article: War and peace During the past 10 days, the world has glimpsed the possibility that the Bosnian army will retake by force some of the territory which it has failed to gain by diplomacy. If the Bosnian government gains are sustained - and this is still in the balance - that may possibly be one of the least bad developments in that terrible situation. Western leaders will no doubt deplore further death and destruction and rightly condemn the Bosnian army if it violates UN safe havens. But having recognised the Sarajevo authorities as the legitimate rulers of an independent state, the world cannot, with any consistency, condemn the Bosnian army for winning back some of the land taken from it. The west may also hope that the latest battles will create a better chance of a viable settlement than has existed since the Serbs seized control of about 70 per cent of Bosnia. Until recently, the Serbs had little incentive to negotiate a peace on terms which others might consider reasonable; the Bosnian army's successes make this somewhat more likely. If peace negotiations should indeed result, the cautious strategy of the five-nation contact group for bringing the parties together will prove to have been partially vindicated. If the west had intervened directly, either with its own air power or conspicuous deliveries of big guns, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, would have come under stronger pressure to rescue the Bosnian Serbs. Although Mr Milosevic is widely blamed for starting the war, his decision to isolate the Bosnian Serbs has contributed to the recent successes of their enemies. Even if a more even balance of forces can eventually bring the conflict to an end, there is no ground for complacency. Worse horrors may be in store. The United Nations forces in the region are trying to mitigate the effects of the fighting on civilians by distributing aid and maintaining safe havens. The new fighting redoubles the moral imperative to demilitarise and protect the six UN-designated safe areas, a task which should not be confused with any ambition to influence the course of the war. These efforts by the UN have been undermined by all the parties, including the Bosnian government. The UN deserves support in facing down, by all means at its disposal, any challenges to agreed peacekeeping arrangements The outside world's moral influence over Bosnia's leaders is weak, given that it failed to stop the atrocities by the Serbs. However, if the Sarajevo authorities wish to retain the sympathy they have gained among western nations, they must address two questions: will they help their own civilians by co-operating more with the UN? And will they show mercy to Serb civilians in their army's path?</p>

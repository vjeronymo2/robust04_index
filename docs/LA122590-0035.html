			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IS IT JUST MUZAK OR MUSICAL MIND CONTROL?  </P> <P> If the purpose of Muzak ("Humming Right Along," Dec. 19) is to "reduce stress  and increase job efficiency," then why do I feel like killing somebody after  being exposed to it for a few minutes?  </P> <P> Face it. The whole idea behind Muzak is nothing but thought control. It's a  wonder that Hitler or Stalin never thought of it.  </P> <P> As for me, I would just as soon hear the ear-shattering garble from some  idiot's boom box.  </P> <P> FRANK. G.

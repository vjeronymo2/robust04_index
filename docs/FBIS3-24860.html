The soldiers moved for the first time against the  protesters who had put up roadblocks in the northern Ngagara  district of the capital for the third day running, an AFP  correspondent said. Army chief of staff Lieutenant-Colonel Jean  Bikomagu earlier said soldiers had "used the means of  discussion" to make people go back to their homes, but warned  that "if they refuse and the situation worsens, we have other  means." [passage omitted]    Opposition leaders on Tuesday refused to meet Prime Minister  Sylvie Kinigi, a Tutsi, to try to settle the dispute. On  Wednesday, one party leader, Joseph Nzeyimana of the Rally for  Democracy and Economic and Social Development, said on the radio  that "the opposition refuses to talk to a government which has  made itself both prosecutor and jury in this affair." [passage  omitted]    In the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, a gathering of foreign  ministers in the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) on  Wednesday denounced what they called "negative actions" aimed at  "torpedoing efforts to bring peace" to Burundi. In a statement,  the OAU ministers expressed their "full support for the OAU in  its backing for the legitimate government in Burundi."    The pan-African body has agreed to deploy a  confidence-building and protection mission of 200 men, including  180 soldiers, in the country, but the opposition has vowed to  oppose this move.    Kinigi's government asked for international help after it  was  forced into hiding in foreign missions for several weeks during  the strife that followed the murder of Ndadaye, the first  elected Hutu president, and some of his aides.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- A policy accord newly  reached by the ruling coalition parties will spur discussions of  a comprehensive tax reform to include income tax cuts and  consumption and other indirect tax hikes, the head of a  government tax panel said Friday [22 April].    "The agreement is in the same direction with the panel's  discussions... and confirmed that the tax reform will be decided  in June and enacted at the Diet by the end of the year," Kan  Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, told reporters after a  panel meeting.    The coalition reached the accord earlier in the day as a  basis for forming a new cabinet, with Foreign Minister and  Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata selected as the coalition's  candidate to succeed Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Under the accord, the coalition parties agreed on a plan to  revamp the tax system while seeking "public understanding." The  plan calls for revision or elimination of the 3 percent  consumption tax while raising indirect taxes.    The chairman of the advisory panel to the prime minister  interpreted the accord as calling for cutting direct taxes and  raising indirect taxes.    Hosokawa asked the panel when it began its discussions  earlier this month for income tax cuts and net tax increases to  realize a balanced tax system for income, assets and consumption  to cope with the coming aged society in the 21st century.    Panel members did not bring up the coalition accord at  Friday's meeting, Kato said.    The panel will speed up its discussions by holding meetings  on Tuesdays and Fridays from next week to compile a report with  various options for the parties to decide in June, Kato said.    The meeting centered on administrative reform, with many  panelists calling for further slimming of the government and its  affiliated companies and institutions to win public support for  net tax increases, he said.</p>

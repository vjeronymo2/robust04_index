			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Britain isolated over HDTV plan THE UK has become increasingly isolated among European Community members in the debate over the EC's proposed subsidy to television broadcasters for the development of a European high definition television standard. Most members are reported to be moving closer to finalising a plan for Ecu 850m (Pounds 680m) in subsidies to help broadcasters in the transit-ion from conventional to high definition broadcast-ing. Agreement on most aspects of the plan, apart from the most contentious issue of the level of the proposed subsidy, is expected within the next few days. Such agreement paves the way for discussions at a forthcoming meeting of European telecommunications ministers in Brussels next month to focus on the issue of the level of subsidy. The UK, however, is opposed to any subsidy and is in the minority on this issue, in spite of its presidency of the Community. At a meeting of the EC's Telecommunications Council in June, the UK opposed the EC's proposal for a subsidy to broadcasters of Ecu 850m as 'totally unacceptable'. 'We will oppose any expenditure until we see . . . a convincing business case (for a subsidy),' Mr Edward Leigh, the technology minister, said at the time. That business case was put forward in the form of a report prepared for the commission which was on the whole favourably received by member countries. While the level of subsidy is likely to be a source of debate among member countries, the UK appears to be alone in remaining fundament-ally opposed to the sub-sidy. 'We are working on coming up with a response to the commission's study,' a spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry said. Meanwhile, a consortium including Dixons, the electrical retailer, Sony, the consumer electronics manufacturer, and BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, has proposed a lower level of subsidy to broadcasters which could be a compromise solut-ion. However, a level of subsidy significantly lower than the proposed Ecu 850m is unlikely to achieve the objective of the commission's action plan to create a critical mass of broadcasts to stimulate the market for high definition TV.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo May 3 TASS -- Russia considers the PLO-Israeli  document signing as the first major step towards comprehensive  Mideastern settlement and historic reconciliation of Israel with  its Arab neighbours, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  said in a brief statement at the Cairo airport today.    "We will continue doing everything to help the  implementation  of the agreements," he said. In his words, the PLO and Israeli  leaders have managed to reach the agreement with the  international support on the part of Russia and the United  States, the co-chairmen of the peace process, as well as active  mediating efforts of Egypt. The recent Moscow visits of the PLO  leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  boosted the ceremony.    Kozyrev stressed this is not his first visit to Egypt and  described as "friendly" the relations between Russia and Egypt.  He said he has brought a personal message of Boris Yeltsin to  Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak.    "The Russian initiative to convene the Mideastern peace  conference of the Madrid type remains valid. Its implementation  at a corresponding stage would enable an additional impetus to  the whole Mideastern settlement process," Kozyrev told ITAR-TASS  in response to a question about the prospects for the Madrid-2  forum.    "We suggested this at a time when the Arab-Israeli  negotiations faced certain difficulties. There was a need for  initiatives to unblock the deadend. At the same time, we  considers an agreement on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  -- first treaty a priority," he said.    After the agreement is signed, Madrid-2 may become an  important step towards peace, said the Russian foreign minister.</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL MEN UNDERDOGS IN SCIAC RACE  </P> <P> The Occidental College men's basketball team will begin play in the Southern  California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference tonight at 8 when the Tigers  play host to Claremont.  </P> <P> Occidental (5-8) has not won an SCIAC title since 1983, and the prospects this  year appear slim; Claremont, Redlands and La Verne all open conference play  with 10-3 records.  </P> <P> "I can't remember there ever being three teams in our league with those kinds  of records going in," Occidental Coach Brian Newhall said. "Usually, we're all  kind of beat up, record-wise.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, I think all three of those teams are for real."  </P> <P> Occidental, defending conference champion Pomona (5-8), Caltech (2-7) and  Whittier (3-11) are hoping a new start translates into greater success.  Occidental's fate might be determined early. After Claremont, it plays Whittier  and La Verne at home. "We need to come out of that stretch at least 2-1 to be  in the race," Newhall said.

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCRIPPS CLINIC, MEMORIAL HOSPITALS TO MERGE  </P> <P> After a whirlwind courtship, Scripps Memorial Hospitals and Scripps Clinic  &amp; Research Foundation have agreed to unify next Jan. 1, leaving Sharp  HealthCare as the jilted party in a health-care triangle.  </P> <P> The surprise union announced Friday would create the largest health-care  concern in San Diego County, an $820-million-a-year conglomerate that would be  the county's No. 2 non-governmental employer.  </P> <P> It also effectively scuttles Scripps Clinic-Sharp HealthCare merger talks that  had been going on for a year. There had been reports in the health-care  community over the last month that those talks had broken down.  </P> <P> A Sharp spokeswoman tersely said Friday that Sharp was surprised by the move.  </P> <P> "We didn't participate in the (Scripps-Scripps) deliberations, nor were we  advised of them. We had continued our discussions with the clinic regarding  development of joint clinical programs literally until today," said Cindy  Cohagen.  </P> <P> She said she had no comment on the future of the joint organ transplant program  that Sharp and Scripps Clinic inaugurated last year.  </P> <P> Ironically, it was publicity in early June about the potential Scripps  Clinic-Sharp merger that helped bring about the subsequent talks between the  two Scripps facilities.  </P> <P> After reading in the newspaper about the Sharp merger talks, trustees of the  two Scrippses began talking informally later in June, said Ames S. Early,  president of Scripps Memorial.  </P> <P> The discussions quickly snowballed. Over the last two weeks, administrators  entered the talks and the agreement was forged, Early said.  </P> <P> Discussions moved so quickly, he added, because Scripps Memorial and Scripps  Clinic share a common corporate culture from their roots in the philanthropy of  Ellen Browning Scripps.  </P> <P> The newspaper heiress established both the hospital and the research foundation  jointly in 1924 but they split in 1946.  </P></p>

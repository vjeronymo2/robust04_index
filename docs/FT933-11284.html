			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Concern at court funds fraud MORE THAN 50 cases of attempted or successful fraud involving about Pounds 1m in the Court Funds Office were uncovered between 1988 and 1992, a report by the National Audit Office yesterday says. The Court Funds Office, part of the Public Trust Office, administers and manages funds deposited in the courts on behalf of minors and mental patients and by suitors in litigation. Systems and procedures have been reviewed and strengthened but because of the complexity of the work and inability to identify the culprits 'there remain some continuing unavoidable risks and concerns', the report says.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Accountancy Column: 'True and fair' debate moves to the insurance sector - A look at the implications of an EC directive due for implementation next year Truth and fairness have been a requirement for most company accounts for over 40 years, but it will be a new challenge for life assurance companies in 1995 when the EC Insurance Accounts Directive is at last implemented. With little time to go, there is still debate among accountants, and also actuaries, on how to achieve 'true and fair' in an industry characterised by long-term contracts, uncertainty, and high initial costs which are recouped by subsequent revenue. In the past, life assurance companies' accounts have used the figures in the financial statements submitted to DTI - the 'DTI Returns' - which are geared to ensuring they remain solvent. Here the actuary compares the value of a company's assets with the value of its liabilities from all the policies on its books. He has to allow for adverse deviations in investment returns, rates of mortality, and must test a number of extreme circumstances, such as a 25 per cent drop in the value of shares. This is fine for protecting policyholders, but is likely to lead the accountant to say that the liabilities are overstated if the new objective of the accounts is that they be true and fair. The problems are greatest for proprietary companies which are reporting profits to their shareholders. The 'statutory solvency method', described above, will typically understate profits for a growing company as unreported profits are being built up, to be released later, for example when bonuses are paid at the time a policy matures. And the writing of new policies, with high expenses, typically depresses profits as a result of the regulations underlying the DTI Returns. How can we be more realistic? What many life assurance companies are now focusing on is the 'embedded value'. To calculate this, actuaries first make an estimate of the future stream of statutory solvency profits expected to arise from the policies already written, using assumptions about future mortality, investment returns, policies lapsing, etc. Then these profits, lasting 25 years or more, are discounted to the present. To cope with the uncertainty about the future assumptions such as lapses, the discount rate may be increased to reflect this. The present value of these profits is known as the embedded value. This is a capital measure which is a good indicator of the company's progress in improving profits. It is important information for management, and providing incentives to increase embedded value is generally good for shareholders. However, the difficulties come when it is proposed that the increase in the embedded value constitutes profit. Actuaries have been looking at the principles underlying accounts, one of which is that profits should reflect the past and not future performance of the firm. This ties in with the ED Directive which requires profits to have been 'made', UK law that profits be 'realised', and also the principles of the Accounting Standards Board. The difficulty for the accounts is that the embedded value includes profits from future performance, ie the insurance and investment management services which the company provides for its policyholders in future years. Basically there are two parts to the embedded value. First there are the profits that have been made (in accounting terms) from services already provided to policyholders but not passed to the shareholders because of the way the solvency rules work. This is the 'Shareholders' Accrued Interest'. Second, we have the discounted value of profits expected to be made from future services on policies already written. True and fair accounting requires the former, but not the latter, to be taken into account. However, since embedded values are important to shareholders, there is merit if they are shown in company accounts, though only as supplementary information rather than implying that they represent profits which have been made. How can we determine the Shareholders' Accrued Interest in a away which is true and fair? One suggestion is the 'accruals method', put forward as an experimental approach, though it has attracted only limited support. This method basically calculates the Shareholders' Accrued Interest by subtracting the value of estimated profits relating to future services from the embedded value. However, the technique to achieve this - 'planned profit margins' - has been criticised by many accountants and actuaries as too subjective. Such margins are typically not planned and cannot be verified; neither can they easily be applied to with-profits business. Along with other problems about the treatment of risks and tax rates, it is not easy to see the result being true and fair. The disparity of views has drawn together some life assurance companies in an attempt to design an accounting method capable of encompassing both embedded values and the accruals method. Another task is to ensure that this can be expressed in the accounting format prescribed by the directives. These proposals have yet to be presented, but it is hard to see how they can overcome the many concerns already expressed about both accruals and embedded values. So where is the solution? In fact it is not too difficult; we can revert to calculating assets and liabilities but avoid the artificialities of the statutory solvency method. This approach is called the Earned Profits method, which I presented to the Institute of Actuaries last month. It is based on a set of accounting principles specifically adapted to the nature of the life assurance business. In particular:- Provisions should be assessed prudently but without 'hidden reserves'. Prudence requires that the liability on a policy should not generally be less than the surrender value. Where the shareholders have an interest in future bonuses, then monies already held for bonuses should be partly attributed to shareholders. Future losses expected on existing policies should be capitalised, but future profits should not. Initial expenses such as commission should be matched against corresponding revenue, as where the policyholder forgoes an allocation to units in the first two years, to produce a deferred acquisition cost asset. The going concern principle to be applied. This approach is consistent with the ASB's standards, and fits conveniently with the EC directive. It means that the increase in the excess of assets over liabilities, the Earned Profit, reflects what the company has earned in the year. It equates to what policyholders have paid for the services which the company has provided, less the costs incurred. The earned profits method avoids the artificialities of profits reported under the statutory solvency method. For with-profits business there is no longer a markedly high profit in the last year of a policy when the terminal bonus is paid; the effect is accrued over the term. For unit-linked business the artificial loss arising from high initial expenses in the first year is eliminated. The Association of British Insurance is currently drafting an accounting practice which will be a modification of the statutory solvency method. Based on a calculation of assets and liabilities, it should recognise, for example, that the provisions required by the solvency test for the expenses should the company be closed to new business are inconsistent with the 'going concern' principle. It is to be hoped that the constraints of the DTI's solvency rules are replaced by ordinary accounting principles applied to life assurance as in the Earned Profits method. The outcome will be an application of both actuarial and accounting techniques, which is surely the right way forward for life assurance accounts to show a true and fair view.

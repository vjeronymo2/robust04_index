			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / People: Young promoted at Wolseley The question of who will succeed Jeremy Lancaster, the chairman and managing director of Wolseley, the world's biggest distributor of heating and plumbing products, has found a partial answer in John Young's appointment as group deputy managing director. Lancaster, 58, a publicity-shy figure who took over from his father, Norman Lancaster, in 1976, has transformed Droitwich-based Wolseley from a poorly-performing builders' merchants into one of Britain's most admired companies. In terms of its market capitalisation of Pounds 2.2bn, it is now over 50 per cent bigger than Tarmac which once tried to take it over in the 1970s. Although Lancaster has not formally said when he intends to retire, it is widely believed that he may hand in his notice when he reaches 60, hence the growing interest in the succession. The assumption is that the company will recruit a non-executive chairman and a new chief executive will be promoted from within. However, several of the obvious candidates are close to retirement. Richard Ireland, Wolseley's finance director who has also been standing in as non-executive chairman of Severn Trent, is expected to retire after the annual meeting later this year and William Ferris, chief executive of Wolseley's engineering, electrical and plastics operations, died in April. In some respects Young, 49, comes from a similar background to Lancaster who did his apprenticeship at GKN before joining the family company in 1961. Young trained as an apprentice at TI Group before joining Wolseley in 1978 when his family business of PJ Parmiter was bought for Pounds 1.8m. He was promoted to the board in 1982 when he was made responsible for the agricultural division and subsequently became responsible for the photographic and technical services operations. Young is the most senior of several new appointments to the Wolseley board. It has already been announced that Steve Webster, a partner in Price Waterhouse, is joining the board at the end of the month as deputy group finance director. Gerard Pinault, president directeur general, Brossette BTI, and Andrew Hutton, managing director Wolseley Centers, are also joining the board.</p>

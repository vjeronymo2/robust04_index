The officers and men of Inner Mongolia's armed border police  fight and live on the Gobi grassland and in desert forests,  where the environment is harsh and the climate is miserable year  in and year out. They shoulder very difficult border defense  tasks. According to the requirements of public security and  frontier defense work on the building of Army units under the  new circumstances, the frontier corps party committee made  strenuous efforts in grassroots building, improved the working  and living conditions of officers and men, and helped bring the  building of the force and its professionalism to a new height.    This frontier corps has also been working hard to serve the  autonomous region's economic construction. Over the past three  years, they have reformed some means and methods of management  that are out of pace with the situation and impede the economic  development of the border region and have simplified the  procedures for the granting of entry/exit permits and border  inspection. They have brought into full play the advantages of  border defense and have taken advantage of their contacts with  the border defense departments of Russia and Mongolia to build  connections for the development of border trade, tourism,  investment, and exploitation between localities. Statistics  have shown that, during those three years, the border inspection  stations had over 900 meetings and talks with parties in Russia  and Mongolia and quite successfully accomplished the tasks  assigned by the governments at various levels and the relevant  departments, for which they were praised by local party  committees and governments.</p>

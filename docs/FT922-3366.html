			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Racal confirms October deadline for Chubb float SIR Ernest Harrison, Racal Electronics chairman, yesterday set an October deadline for the demerger of Racal Chubb, its security division. Shares in the floated Chubb, which yesterday reported a 20 per cent jump in operating profits last year, will be distributed to Racal shareholders after details are published in September. The demerger will follow a similar pattern to last year's successful distribution of Racal's stake in Vodafone, the cellular telephone network operator, a move Sir Ernest initiated after what he said was the market's consistent undervaluation of Racal's non-Vodafone businesses. Confirmation of the demerger came as Racal reported annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 55.6m, up from a loss of Pounds 21.8m last year and comfortably ahead of a forecast it made at the height of its successful defence against a hostile bid from Williams Holdings last winter. Racal not only reported sharply higher profits at Chubb, but also almost halved debt to Pounds 121m after strong cash flow in its operations and a tightening of controls on working capital. This debt will be split between Chubb and the Racal rump ahead of the demerger and is among details being worked out with the company's advisers. Sir Ernest will become chairman of the quoted Chubb while Mr David Peacock will remain chief executive. The Pounds 55.6m pre-tax profit was achieved on sales of Pounds 1.61bn, up only 3.6 per cent on 1990-91. They were struck after exceptional items of Pounds 29.76m relating to reorganisation and redundancy costs. More controversially, Racal made an extraordinary charge of Pounds 53.83m, about Pounds 22.4m relating to the cost of demerging Vodafone and defending the Williams bid. About Pounds 18m, however, related to a provision for the disposal and closures in 1992-93 of loss-making overseas businesses. Application of a new accounting standard, now in a draft form and likely to come into force next year, might have included some of these costs above the line. A further Pounds 12.17m relating to the businesses which will be sold or closed was written back through reserves to shareholders' funds. The extent to which Racal's debt fell during the year surprised analysts, and led to a sharp increase in forecasts for profits this year of more than Pounds 100m. Racal's share price rose 4.5p to 69.5p. Results, Page 25; Lex, Page 22</p>

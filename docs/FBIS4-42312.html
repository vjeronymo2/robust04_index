			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From DDP/ADN's "Wirtschaftdienst-Ost" economic service] </F>   [Text] Berlin (ADN) -- Germany will continue to give  support to research in Russia. This will be mainly through  cooperation and material support, Bernd Neumann, parliamentary  state secretary in the German Research Ministry, said on  Deutschlandfunk Berlin on Thursday [2 June]. The aim of the aid  is to ensure that Russia's research potential, which is in some  areas considerable, does not deteriorate completely. Neumann,  who is now in Moscow, said many research institutions there are  threatened with collapse because salaries can no longer be paid  and there is no money for energy and material.</p>

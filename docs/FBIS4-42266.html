			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Ankara Ignores Iranian Proposal </F> for Joint Operation. Turkish Officials Make Arrangements for  Meeting With Iraqi Kurdish Leaders"]    [Text] London -- Iran appears to have failed to convince  Turkey of the possibility of a joint operation inside the Iraqi  Kurdish areas which have, over the past three weeks, witnessed  an armed conflict between the two largest parties there.  According to identical reports from the Kurdistan Democratic  Party [KDP] led by Mas'ud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan [PUK] led by Jalal Talabani, Turkish Government  officials have intensified their contacts with the two Kurdish  leaders to help them bridge their views and end the estrangement  resulting from the recent fighting between them.    Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Turkish  officials are making arrangements for a tripartite meeting in  Turkey to be attended by representatives of the Turkish  Government and the two Kurdish parties, and probably by PUK  Secretary General Jalal Talabani who is now in Damascus.    The Turkish sources said that the discussions at the meeting  would not be confined to the tension between Barzani and  Talabani but would also cover relations between Ankara and the  Kurdish administration in northern Iraq and the situation  resulting from the exodus of thousands of Turkish Kurds to Iraqi  Kurdistan to escape the military operations carried out by the  Turkish Army in the Kurdish areas adjacent to the border with  Iraq against fighters of the outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan  [PKK].    The sources expected the meeting to be held after the 'Id  al-Adha holiday. The Turkish press reported last week that a  visiting Iranian delegation had suggested to Ankara that a joint  operation be launched to put an end to the fighting in Iraqi  Kurdistan.    According to PUK sources, Iranian Revolutionary Guard  elements are taking part in the operations against PUK forces in  areas near the border with Iran, and Iranian artillery is  shelling Iraqi Kurdish areas from across the border. Other  Kurdish forces and international relief officials have confirmed  these reports but KDP sources have not.    Iran has accused Talabani's party of providing shelter and  aid for the Kurdish parties opposed to the Iranian Government.    Turkey feels that instability in northern Iraq suits the  PKK,  which has been fighting the Turkish state for 10 years, in that  it enables the PKK to set up bases and staging posts in the  mountainous areas near the border with Turkey.    It is worth noting that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel  announced at a press conference last Monday [23 May] that Turkey  intended to contact Barzani and Talabani "to promote a peaceful  solution between them."    As regards the armed conflict between the parties of Barzani  and Talabani, sources of the two parties in the areas where the  clashes started early this month say that the situation there  ranges from guarded calm to limited clashes in isolated spots.  The sources are cautious when it comes to the question of  whether or not the current truce would develop into a firm peace.    Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that earlier this week  Barzani and Talabani spoke to each other by telephone, for the  first time in several days, and, the sources say, they also  exchanged fax messages focusing on the cease-fire agreements  reached by their two parties and "emphasizing the importance of  Talabani's presence in Kurdistan alongside Barzani to implement  these agreements."</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Ministry emerges virtually unscathed - Defence The Ministry of Defence emerged almost unscathed from this year's public expenditure round, having suffered heavy losses in last year's Budget. Cuts of the order of Pounds 250m over each of the next three years are planned because inflation has proved lower than expected, but no large equipment programmes are threatened by yesterday's announcement. However, plans to privatise the MoD's housing stock were still left in doubt. Buoyed by a painless spending round, the MoD announced new equipment orders for frigates and missiles for the RAF. Invitations to tender for a final batch of up to three more Type 23 anti-submarine frigates will be issued. Favourite to win the Pounds 450m frigate order is the Yarrow shipyard on the Clyde owned by GEC, which is currently vying with British Aerospace for control of the submarine maker VSEL. Yarrow has built nine of the 13 Type 23 ships so far ordered. Two new missiles were also confirmed for the RAF. A long-range conventional attack missile will be ordered in 1996 at a cost of about Pounds 750m. This will allow Tornados, Harriers and Eurofighters to attack targets up to 250km away with high accuracy. The idea for the missile came from the Gulf war where US forces used advanced munitions to great effect with their fighters able to stand off at safe distances. There are several possible competitors for the contract. Leading contenders are the French company Matra with its Apache missile, McDonnell Douglas of the US with its GrandSLAM and the UK team of GEC and BAe offering the Pegasus missile. The other missile for the RAF is a Pounds 700m anti-tank weapon primarily intended to be launched from the Tornado and the Harrier. It is intended to knock out tanks and armoured personnel carriers in combination with the anti-tank helicopters the army is currently considering. GEC is offering its version of the US Hellfire missile while British Aerospace is offering an adaptation of its Asraam anti-aircraft missile for the competition. The one issue which remained unresolved for the MoD in the Budget was the gap in its funding for next year which would be caused by its failure to sell its housing stock. The ministry is relying on getting up to Pounds 500m for house sales in 1995-96 but has run into technical difficulties. Yesterday it was still confident that the money would be raised in time.</p>

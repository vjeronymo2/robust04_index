			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Technology: Olive-grove innovators - Kerin Hope reports on Greece's efforts to build on its scientific successes by forging closer links with industry, in a continuing research series The Research Centre of Crete keeps a low profile on an island best known for its beaches and ancient ruins. Concealed among olive groves outside Heraklion, the capital, it is staffed mostly by Greek scientists who returned from jobs abroad with a brief to focus on applied as much as basic research. However, Eleftherios Economou, who heads the centre, acknowledges that building links with industry is a struggle in Greece, 'where company practice of taking the short-term view and importing technology in a black box is only just starting to change'. Greece spends only 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product on research, the lowest percentage in the European Union. The government provides about half the funds allocated, with less than one-tenth coming from the private sector. Dimitris Daskalopoulos, chairman of Delta Dairies, Greece's biggest food processor, summed up the prevailing attitude: 'The perception is that researchers aren't really worth much because they work too slowly and aren't truly product-oriented. It's only among companies that want to be competitive on a European scale that you find more awareness.' Delta's own R&amp;D department has become a key part of the company's operations, Daskalopoulos says, since it decided to build a Dr16bn (Dollars 64m) yoghurt plant near Athens, with the aim of developing high-quality products for distribution in the rest of the EU. 'It's no longer enough just to pay royalties for know-how.' The centre in Heraklion houses four out of the seven institutes belonging to the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas. Forth was set up in the mid-1980s with government funds to improve Greece's research capability and develop collaborative projects with industry. It was deliberately hived off from Greek universities and other government-backed research institutes which were reputed to disdain projects with commercial applications, in order to foster a new, more practical, scientific culture in Greece. The institutes on Crete have attracted high-calibre researchers and a sizeable percentage of non-government funding, including increasing amounts of EU money - about Dr2bn this year. But their relative isolation is a handicap. Growth in tourism and agriculture has overshadowed industrial development in Crete in the past decade, while the difficulties of keeping in close touch with Athens and Thessaloniki, the country's main manufacturing centres, proved a deterrent to forming partnerships with industry. Given the shortage of potential collaborators, scientists at the centre decided to set up several locally-based companies to handle product development and sales. While some products won recognition for innovation, Economou says, the centre has been unable to penetrate markets effectively - 'you can't necessarily guarantee that you'll have both scientific and entrepreneurial talent simultaneously'. The centre's institute for molecular biology, which has come up with several biomedical products, has transferred responsibility for marketing and exports to a commercial partner, whose expertise and contacts in Greece and abroad should speed up product development in the future. The experience suggests that research with medical applications may hold the greatest potential for Greece, Economou says. 'It's one area where we have the resources to leapfrog existing weaknesses in R&amp;D, and it's a fast-growing market that doesn't need heavy investment.' Biomedical companies based in Greece can tap the skills of a relatively large number of scientists trained abroad, while salaries for research staff are still less than half those in the rest of the EU. The molecular biology institute has set up a joint venture with an Athens-based company that distributes diagnostic products in Greece and abroad. Nida Biometria makes and sells veterinary diagnostic kits, including pregnancy tests for cows and pigs, as well as kits for screening viruses in potatoes, carnations and young fruit trees. Pavlos Leakos, managing director of Biometria, the parent company, says: 'The animal pregnancy tests are practical for this region as they're designed to be carried out by small labs with minimal equipment. The plant virus tests are timesavers as one kit can test hundreds of samples in less than an hour.' The institute is also developing links with another Athens-based company, Diagnostic Genetic Centre, which offers testing services for genetic disorders such as Mediterranean anaemia or cystic fibrosis; until recently, these were not available in Greece to local physicians. Costas Pangalos, the medical geneticist who set up DGC, says the aim is for the researchers on Crete to develop a set of probes - small sections of DNA serving as markers to detect mutations that cannot be directly determined - that can help identify genetic disorders. 'It should be the right interchange, with us supplying laboratory testing facilities and the capacity to make their products commercial.' However, the centre has not given up efforts to forge links with companies on Crete. It has set up a technology park outside Heraklion, due to start operating later this year. Six companies, both Crete- and Athens-based, are already committed to participating. Plastika Kritis, a Heraklion-based company that makes plastic sheeting for greenhouses and polyethylene pipes for drip irrigation systems, was among the first to join the technology park. The company says it spent 2 per cent of turnover amounting to Dr5.6bn last year on R&amp;D. Manolis Lembidakis, managing director, says: 'To develop high value-added products in our sector, you can't depend on other people's technology.' Next week: South Korea.</p>

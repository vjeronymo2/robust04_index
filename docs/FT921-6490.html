			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / World Bank letter imperils Indian minister DR Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, saw his political authority severely undermined yesterday when he was forced to disclose to parliament the conditions of a Dollars 500m (Pounds 285.7m) structural adjustment loan from the World Bank agreed in November. Dr Singh was forced by the Speaker to disclose the text of the letter setting out the terms of the loan, after two days' battering from the opposition. MPs accused the finance minister of a breach of parliamentary privilege in disclosing to the bank budget policy details that should have first been presented to parliament. The attack on Dr Singh came on the eve of the budget, due to be go before parliament on Saturday. It raised doubts about his long-term political future and ability to steer his budget through without substantial amendments. The opposition is likely to seek Dr Singh's resignation on the grounds the letter was 'dictated' by the World Bank and the IMF and discussed with them before being presented to the cabinet and MPs. Mr Chandra Shekhar, the former Prime Minister who himself sought help from the IMF last year, said the letter compromised India's dignity and sovereignty. 'The government has no right to continue,' he declared. The Indian Express, which leaked details of the letter, was last night set to publish other alleged correspondence between Dr Singh and the institutions. Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, was expected to back his finance minister. But Mr Rao's position is difficult because of strong opposition to structural change and cuts in government spending within his Congress party. The letter follows the standard pattern of declarations of policy intent by governments seeking structural adjustment loans. But it spells out more clearly than the government has cared to say so far its policy on issues such as tariff reduction, public sector closures and privatisation. The letter says the government intends over the next five years to bring down tariffs - India has one of the world's highest tariff regimes - 'to rates comparable to other industrialising developing countries'. This exercise is expected to begin in this week's budget. It makes clear that at least 47 public sector companies making losses and employing 310,000 people face closure.</p>

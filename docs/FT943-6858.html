			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Undaunted by hit to newspaper profits: A UK price war that looks set to continue into next year News International, Mr Rupert Murdoch's main UK operating company, has set its sights on taking The Times to a circulation of more than 1m. In a further indication that price wars in the UK national newspaper industry are likely to continue, Mr Gus Fischer, News International's chief executive, said: 'Obviously we would like to push it (The Times) to the same level as The Telegraph and beyond.' The 20p Times has increased its circulation by more than 200,000 to its current level of approaching 600,000 and The Daily Telegraph, after reducing its cover price to 30p on weekdays, has increased its circulation from 993,000 to about 1.07m copies. 'We think we have proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that newspapers are price sensitive,' Mr Fischer said yesterday. He insisted that pricing policy would be kept continually under review. However, in a sign that News International is growing increasingly confident in its current pricing policy, the newspaper group - which owns five UK national newspapers - said it was increasing its advertising rates by 15 per cent on three of them. The rates are increasing on both the Sun, now selling at 22p, and the Times. The group will give advertisers a guaranteed 600,000 circulation for The Times until the end of this year and a 4m guarantee for the Sun. The latter is selling around 4.2m despite this week's 2p price increase. The Sun's price was cut from 25p to 20p last summer. Advertising rates are also increasing by 15 per cent on the News of the World, although there is no sign that News International plans to reduce the price of its popular Sunday tabloid or its other market-leading title, The Sunday Times. Although News International could give advertisers rebates if the minimum circulation guarantees are not met, the move on rates implies that the newspaper price war is likely to last for the rest of this year and probably well into next. This means continuing difficulties for The Telegraph group, which admitted on Wednesday that its price cut had cost Pounds 1m for just the first six days included in its latest reporting period. In addition, discount vouchers had cost Pounds 1m and Pounds 8m had been spent on promotion. News International's commitment to its radical pricing policy emerged as the News Corp subsidiary announced its results for the year to the end of June. Its operating profits of Pounds 96.2m fell Pounds 44.7m below its 1992-93 performance. The main reason for the difference was the impact of the price cuts, but News International declined to give the precise figure attributable to the pricing policy. Mr Fischer said: 'The UK newspaper industry market has never been so competitive and I can't see that changing.' News International's turnover increased from Pounds 708.1m to Pounds 733.5m and profit after minorities soared from Pounds 146.4m to Pounds 359.3m. The large increase was, however, attributable to a number of non-operating factors. A Pounds 78.6m contribution from associates came largely from BSkyB, the satellite television venture 50 per cent owned by News Corp. There was also a book profit of Pounds 90m on the disposal of fixed assets - the transfer within the group, it is believed, of shares in Reuters, the news and information group, and in Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Net interest income amounted to Pounds 85.9m, up from Pounds 1.6m, again helped by transactions within the group. Special dividend shareholders of News International will receive a final dividend of the sterling equivalent of 1.5 Australian cents a share.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Average Daily Sales                          (million)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Quality market:            1994*            1993*        % change  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The Times                   0.51             0.36         40.0 Daily Telegraph             1.01             1.02         -0.7 The Guardian                0.40             0.41         -2.7 The Independent             0.28             0.34        -19.8 Financial Times             0.30             0.29          2.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Middle market: Today                       0.59             0.54          9.5 Daily Express               1.36             1.49         -8.8 Daily Mail                  1.80             1.77          1.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Popular market: The Sun                     4.10             3.53         16.3 Daily Mirror                2.50             2.67         -6.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Within the Grass Creek RMP planning area there are varied and intermingled land surface ownerships and overlapping mineral ownerships. Therefore, the administrative jurisdictions for land use planning and for managing the land surface and minerals are also varied, intermingled, and sometimes overlapping. For this reason, it is important to understand that the draft EIS does not address management of lands (about 302,000 acres) or minerals (about 8,000 acres) within the planning area that are privately-owned or owned by the State of Wyoming or local Governments. It also does not address those Federally-owned minerals within the planning area that are under Federal land surface managed by other agencies (about 4,700 acres).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The draft EIS for the Grass Creek RMP presents four alternative, multiple use resource management plans for managing the BLM-administered public lands in the planning area. Alternative A (continuation of current management) and three other alternatives that suggest different combinations and emphases for managing the various resource and land uses on the BLM-administered public lands, on the basis of needs, opportunities, and public demand. The four alternative plans focus on allocating public lands and resources among their valid uses and prescribing general management actions that would be taken. The preferred alternative is a combination of parts of alternatives A, B, and C and represents what BLM believes is the best balance between the public lands and resource uses and environmental protection in the planning area. The various impacts that would be expected from implementing each of the alternatives is also presented in the draft EIS.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Alan L.

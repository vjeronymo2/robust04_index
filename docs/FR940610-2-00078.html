The Center(s) will have two primary responsibilities: (1) to provide technical assistance to SPNS grantees in designing and implementing evaluation studies and dissemination activities for their individual projects; and, (2) to develop and coordinate the implementation of cross-cutting evaluations within groups of similar projects. HRSA staff will offer advice and guidance and participate in each of these areas as well as monitor the Center's work to assure its progress is in accordance with program objectives and Federal requirements. HRSA staff may accomplish this task, in part, through an advisory panel composed of Federal employees and external consultants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inclusion of a request for additional funding for the SPNS Evaluation and Dissemination Center is not a mandatory requirement of the application. Those applications not requesting this additional funding will be given equal consideration for service delivery model funding. All applications, regardless of inclusion of a request for evaluation center funding, will be scored first only on the applicant's proposal for the service delivery model. Service delivery model applications which are approved for funding will then be reviewed for interest in the additional funding. Only then will proposals for an evaluation and dissemination be reviewed and scored according to the following. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Review Criteria: Additional Funding for SPNS Evaluation &amp; Dissemination Center(s) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Those successful service delivery model applications which include a request for funding for the SPNS Evaluation and Dissemination Center (Part B) will be eligible for review and rating by an objective review panel of that part of the application. Applications will be considered for funding on the basis of overall technical merit as determined through the review process, and the proposed center's suitability for working with the funded SPNS projects. Factors for the technical review of Part B of the applications will include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Factor 1 (25 points).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Qualifications and experience of the principal investigator, the proposed staff and consultants in designing and conducting health service evaluation studies, disseminating study findings and in providing technical assistance on evaluation and dissemination issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Factor 2 (30 points).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Adequacy of plans for providing technical assistance to SPNS grantees on program evaluation and information dissemination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Factor 3 (25 points).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Adequacy of plans for designing and implementing cross-cutting evaluations within groups of similar projects and for assuring data quality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Factor 4 (20 points).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appropriateness of budget, staffing plans, facilities and information management resources, and time frame for implementing the project's operational and programmatic objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Role of Federal Staff in Cooperative Agreements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cooperative agreement mechanism allows for substantial post-award programmatic participation by SPNS staff in the projects' operations. In addition to the project officer's monitoring function, SPNS staff will be active participants in the operations of the HIV service delivery model demonstration projects and the SPNS evaluation and dissemination center. SPNS staff will facilitate the exchange of relevant information among the HIV service delivery model projects and provide support for training and consultation. SPNS staff will also monitor the function and activities of the center, assuring satisfactory progress and timely reporting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Substantial programmatic participation'' means that SPNS staff will provide guidance and coordination for certain programmatic activities to a degree beyond their customary stewardship responsibilities in grants administration. This may include, but is not limited to, the following: participating in the design and direction of activities to develop cross-cutting evaluation studies; assisting in the selection of project director and/or other key staff; assisting in the selection of contractors; participating in the analysis of data; coordinating or providing training of project staff; participating in selection and approval of analysis mechanisms; participating in selection of results for publication; and providing assistance in the management and technical performance of the project's activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

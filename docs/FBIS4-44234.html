			<p>BFN     [Text] DISI [Democratic Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis and  AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] Secretary General  Dhimitrios Khristofias left for Strasbourg this morning. The  two officials and Liberals Party Chairman Nikolaos Rolandhis  will participate in a hearing between Greek Cypriot and Turkish  Cypriot political parties that will be held before the political  committee of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly.    In a statement made to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation  shortly before leaving for Strasbourg, Matsis said the presence  of the Greek Cypriot parties was necessary, since Turkish  Cypriot leaders have also been invited. He added: In this way,  the Greek Cypriot parties will be able to present the current  reality 20 years after the continuing occupation. Matsis said  the political committee's meeting will basically deal with the  introduction of Lord Finsberg's report on the Cyprus issue,  adding that within the framework of this evaluation, views will  be expressed on the overall Cyprus issue and the  confidence-building measures [CBM's].    Khristofias noted that the belief of all parliamentary  parties is that nonparliamentary parties should also have been  invited to express their views to the committee, since Turkish  Cypriot parties that participate in the pseudoparliament have  been invited. He said this was not accomplished and added that  several parties have sent their positions in writing.  Khristofias stressed that an effort will be made in Strasbourg  so that the Council of Europe does not set a precedence because  of the official invitation to the pseudoparliament. He  described as a weak point the fact that during the hearing each  party is only allocated 10 minutes to express its views on the  CBM's and the Cyprus issue in general.    An interparty parliamentary delegation is in Strasbourg  under  House of Representatives President Alexis Galanos to participate  in the work of the Council of Europe parliamentary assembly's  summer session. Deputies Takis Khatzidhimitriou, Dhoros  Khristodhoulidhis, Rina Katseli, and Nikolaos Rolandhis are part  of the delegation. The assembly's meeting opened yesterday and  will conclude on Friday.</p>

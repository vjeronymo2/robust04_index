			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 30 Apr -- Boris Yeltsin, president of the  Russian Federation, has issued an edict approving a program  developed by the top staff of the Institute of State and Law of  the Russian Academy of Sciences concerning carrying out in  1994-95 a comprehensive political and legal study on "Ways and  Forms of Strengthening the Russian State." He also approved the  main directions of the program for this study. An ITAR-TASS  correspondent was informed of this today by the press service of  the president of the Russian Federation.    According to this information, the main directions of the  research program comprises six sections, the priority one being  the development of the legal system of the Russian Federation  following the adoption of the new constitution of the Russian  Federation. It was noted that first and foremost it was  necessary to ensure that such principles of a rule-of-law state  as the state being bound by law, the supremacy of law, the  guarantee of human rights and freedoms, the division and mutual  restraint of powers are consistently executed in the  constitutional and present legislation of the Russian  Federation.    Preparation of a whole package of legislation on social and  legal protection for citizens is urgently needed now that Russia  is a social-oriented state. This is said in the section called  "The Individual in the World Today -- State Guarantees of  Constitutional Status" of the document on basic directions.    It stressed that confirmation of the individual, his rights  and freedoms, is a supreme value in the Russian Federation.  This, along with the recognition that the state's main  obligation is to protect the rights and freedoms of the  individual and the citizen predetermine the necessity to perfect  existing legislature and to work out and adopt new normative  acts (which are either directly envisaged by the constitution of  the Russian Federation, or are implied by them).    Further work on a federal anti-crime program is considered  extremely important along with the adoption of a new criminal  and civil procedure code, of a code on abuse of office, of laws  against organized crime and corruption - needed to protect the  individual from criminal arbitrariness. The research program  draws attention to the fact that the institute of president, of  head of state in Russia has acquired new state and legal  substance. A parliament - a Federal Assembly - has been formed.  The legal status of the Government, its place in the division  of power, has been fundamentally changed. Judicial reform is  under way, aimed at transforming the court into a genuinely  independent "branch" of state power. One of the priority tasks  of legal reform is to make federal state power an institution in  legislation. In this sphere, it is necessary, it says in the  political and legal research project, to work out and adopt such  acts as a Law on the Government of the Russian Federation, a  law, or general clause, on federal ministries, state committees  and other federal bodies of executive power (including  territorial), laws on the bases for setting up executive power  bodies within the components of the Russian Federation, on  federal bureaucracy, the judicial system, the Constitutional  Court of the Russian Federation, the Supreme Court of the  Russian Federation and a number of other laws.    Seeing Russia as a federative state based on the principle  of  the unity of the basic parts of the state system, on the  principle of equality between the entities of the Russian  Federation, of the supremacy of federal law, it is proposed that  we also work out and adopt a number of laws, in particular, on  the procedure for changing the constitutional status of an  entity of the Russian Federation, on forming a new entity of the  Russian Federation, and on registering a new entity in the  Russian Federation. The authors of the program believe the  Russian Federation should set out in legislation the principles  for delimiting the areas of authority and the terms for mutual  delegation (transfer) of power "along vertical lines," from the  federation to entities within the federation and the other way  round.    The idea has been put forward of transforming the territory  of the former USSR into a single humanitarian area, where the  rights of the Russian-speaking population - in countries of the  "near abroad" - are guaranteed. Such an area would help solve  the problem of forced migration. A Eurasian Commission for  Human Rights and a Eurasian Court of Human Rights could serve as  instruments supporting such a legal structure, the authors of  the basic directions believe. They also say a Eurasian Charter  (Convention) of human rights and rights of peoples should be  prepared and adopted.    The research program also attributes importance to the  Russian state's economic role and to Russia's role in the world  community.</p>

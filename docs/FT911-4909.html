			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Reduced competition lifts BFCE BANQUE Francaise du Commerce Exterieur (BFCE), the French foreign trade bank, recovered strongly last year due to slightly less intense competition from other banks, writes George Graham in Paris. Gross operating profit rose 38 per cent to FFr391m (Dollars 69m), on net banking income 7 per cent higher at FFr1.79bn. Average lending margins, which had fallen by a percentage point over the previous four years, increased slightly to 64 basis points last year, and the bank is experiencing a stronger improvement in the early months of this year. Without a deposit base, BFCE has faced fierce competition in the corporate market from high street banks. However, all last year's income was used to boost BFCE's provisions for bad debts, where the bank is still trying to improve its cover. BFCE received FFr1.38bn last year from its shareholders to cover its sovereign debt risks, as part of a capital restructuring. That resulted in Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the state-owned insurer, becoming its main shareholder with 43 per cent, alongside Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank, with 24 per cent. However, the bank devoted more than FFr200m extra to sovereign risk provisions at the end of the year from its earnings, and FFr153m for specific customer provisions and FFr30m to cover falls in the value of its securities portfolio. This brings BFCE's provisions to 51 per cent of its sovereign debt exposure, less than most other major French banks but enough to enable it to take its third world debt portfolio off its balance sheet. The bank now plans to do this by the end of this year, using a combination of an offshore trust backed by US Treasury bonds, and a system of options to sell. BFCE is currently turning its corporate finance division into a subsidiary, and is looking for partners from Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK to take stakes of about FFr80m to FFr100m each. Then BFCE plans to seek a major foreign bank which might take a stake in the parent company.</p>

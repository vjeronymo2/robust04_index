Tun Said said he met Pairin at the latter's  request at 0915 AM today and had refused the chief minister's  request to dissolve the three-week-old assembly. He said this  [words indistinct] is done in accordance with the Yang Dipertuan  Negeri's discretionary powers under Article 10 of the Sabah  state constitution and in accordance with established  constitution convention.    Tun Said said this in a statement signed by him and faxed to  BERNAMA in Kuala Lumpur tonight. On the document produced by  Pairin signifying his consent, Tun Said said he did not sign any  such document.</p>

On 29 January, after  listening to briefings given by the provincial Discipline  Inspection Commission and relevant departments on keeping  themselves honest and clean during the Spring Festival and on  consolidating the achievements in anticorruption struggle, Cheng  Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed  out: Although expected achievements have been made in the  anticorruption struggle, we still need to do lots of work to  consolidate and develop this hard-earned achievements. Although  some passive and corrupt phenomena and unhealthy trends have  been screened and straightened out, they will reappear if we  slightly slacken our efforts in this aspect. Particularly, the  unhealthy trends of using public funds to entertain guests and  send gifts, giving money or coupons as gifts, and arbitrarily  issuing bonuses or articles will occur very easily during the  Spring Festival period. Party committees and governments at all  levels must never lower their guard.    Li Zhanshu, member of the standing committee of the  provincial party committee and secretary general, also listened  to the briefings.    Cheng Weigao stressed: This year is for carrying out package  reform with breakthroughs in key areas, and all reform tasks  will be very complicated and heavy. If leading cadres at all  levels can keep themselves honest and clean, maintain close ties  with the masses, and have profound affection towards the masses,  all reform measures that issued will be supported by the masses,  and the problems that appeared will be easily solved, the  political situation will be stable, and reform will be smoothly  carried out. Party committees and governments at all levels  should always attend to the work of combating corruption and  maintaining honesty and grasp it as a political task.  Currently, it is necessary to attend to honesty work during the  Spring Festival period.    Cheng Weigao reaffirmed: Leading cadres at all levels should  strictly implement the five stipulations of the party Central  Committee on keeping clean and self-disciplined and the "10  prohibitions" proposed by the provincial party committee.  During the Spring Festival period, all localities, departments,  and units are not allowed to send native or speical products,  purchasing certificates, money or all sorts of gifts to the  higher organs or leading cadres; higher organs or leading cadres  should decline the offer of gifts or money from the lower  levels, and should not ask for gifts from them. All units are  not allowed to use public funds for lavish dining and wining or  to engage in extravagance and waste; and during the Spring  Festival period, all tea parties, receptions, forums, and  gatherings must be held in frugal way. All localities,  departments, and units must not violate the stipulations and  issue bonuses, subsidies, purchasing certificates, and articles  under any pretext or forms. All people are not permitted to use  public funds for holding recreation activities that spend lots  of money. Appropriate entertainments may be held during the  festive period, but we must guard against the appearance of  unhealthy influence. Party members and cadres, particularly the  leading cadres, should not be allowed to participate in any kind  of gambling, to engage in feudal or superstitious activities, or  to drink excessively.    Cheng Weigao called on leading cadres at all levels to set  examples with their own conduct, take the lead in maintaining  honesty, realistically attend to the honest administration of  their respective localities, departments, and units during the  festive period, establish the responsibility system, and enable  one level to take charge of the work of the next level and  assume responsibility. If serious problems emerge in a  locaility, a department, or a unit, we should first pursue the  responsibility of the principal leading cadres.    Cheng Weigao said in conclusion: Even though the demands we  have set forth are very clear and definite, some cadres who are  unaware of them will still engage in unhealthy practice because  the legal system is not perfect and there are loopholes in  management. The discipline inspection and supervision  departments at all levels should strengthen supervision and  inspection, immediately organize strength to investigate the  problems reported by the masses and the problems discovered, and  deal with them strictly in a timely manner.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe gains extended The prospect of re-entry into the FT-SE 100 list of quoted companies, confirmed after the market close, brought further demand for shares of British Aerospace. The stock jumped a further 14 to 423p in brisk trade of 8.5m. Sentiment was further boosted by another spate of brokers' recommendations, including one from Strauss Turnbull which said: 'Our long-term target is over Pounds 10. That is what British Aerospace is worth.' The recent slide in the drug shares was partly arrested, with both classes of Zeneca stock staging a strong recovery as marketmakers were caught short of stock. Investors focused on the good yield offered by the shares and some of the action funds switched out of recently outperforming ICI into Zeneca. The 'old' ran up 8 to 620p on hefty turnover of 8.2m, while the 'new' spiralled upwards to end 6 ahead at 20 1/2 p. ICI, on the other hand, eased 2 to 695p on moderate turnover of 3.5m. SmithKline Beecham's move to sell its bath and bodycare brands to Sara Lee Corporation, of the US, for Dollars 320m helped SmithKline shares stabilise and rally to close well above the day's low. The stock finished a net 6 off at 429p, after 425p, on turnover of 4.1m. Mr James Culverwell, pharmaceuticals analyst at Hoare Govett, described the move as 'a good deal at a premium to sales and in line with the company's strategy of focusing on its core healthcare business'. Wellcome, bruised by the criticism of its anti-Aids drug Retrovir at the Berlin Aids conference, dropped to 712p before staging a rally to finish only 2 off at 726p. Lasmo's relegation to the FT-SE Mid 250 Index upset the share price and inspired a strong rise in Enterprise Oil, as the big institutions switched out of the former and into the latter as it became the only means of playing the exploration and production sector in the FT-SE 100 Index. Lasmo shares receded 3 1/2 to 159 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 7.6m - and were said to be looking under strong downside pressure after the close - while Enterprise jumped 11 to 478p on 1.5m. Burmah Castrol lost 5 more to 690p as the market continued to react to bearish news on industrial lubricants in Germany, where sales are thought to be down by some 8 to 10 per cent. Boots managed to make up some of the ground lost on the previous day with a gain of 2 to 437p in volume of 3m. Marks and Spencer, which announced that it was raising Pounds 150m through an issue of sterling notes, finished just 1 higher at 343p after firming to 345p in earlier trading. Volume came to 4.1m shares. Dixons moved up 6 to 214p. A programme trade was reported to be behind King- fisher's early gain of 10. The group finished a net 6 up at 604p on 2.3m shares traded. Great Universal Stores 'A' pushed up to 1650p, a rise of 20 on the day. WH Smith 'A' advanced 7 to end at 449p. Against the upward trend of the stores sector, Dunhill Holdings fell back 3 to finish at 341p, a slight rallying after greater losses in mid-trading. Great Portland Estates, fresh from its cash call success, slipped back 1 to end at 196p. Land Securities pushed ahead 8 to 595p in thin trading and MEPC added 4 to reach 445p, again in low volume. Warner Estates and Bradford Properties took bruisings in early trading, with Warner falling 9 to end the day at 224p and Bradford losing 7 to 200p. Persistent buying by one institution and an absence of sellers was thought to be behind the climb of 10 by Frogmore Estates to 434p. One analyst thought it would not be out of step for Frogmore to be looking towards acquisitions. Rumours circulated in the market last week that the company would soon join the swell of property companies turning to shareholders for extra funds. In a generally upbeat sector, Mansfield Brewery moved ahead 15 to 800p after announcing an increase in pre-tax profits. Mr David Thompson of Kleinwort Benson is bullish about the drinks industry. 'The sector is very good value. A lot of recent fears, especially in the US over drink taxes, have been overdone. Profits forecasts are likely to be upgraded rather than downgraded.' Another analyst forecasted increased demand for second-line brewery stocks, perhaps at the expense of the larger and more debt-exposed players. Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries moved up 8 to 460p in modest volume; Allied-Lyons made a gain of 8 to 542p in a volume of 1.6m shares. Further strength in the property sector continued to boost P &amp; O and the shares raced forward another 18 to 648p on volume of 2.4m. The strong market trend helped British Airways bounce 6 to 296p in trade of 6.5m. A recommendation from NatWest Securities boosted Tate &amp; Lyle, the shares closing 9 up at 371p. Kwik Save, which lost its place in the FT-SE 100 Index, declined 8 to 742p ahead of that confirmation. Shares in MB-Caradon fell 16 to 277p as Tuesday's profits downgrading from Goldman Sachs, following a profits warning by a US competitor, continued to exact a toll. The prospect of new orders at the Paris Air Show and the sentiment in BAe boosted Rolls-Royce and the stock added 3 1/2 at 150p. Strong demand for British Steel made it the day's most actively traded stock. The shares firmed 2 1/2 to 104 3/4 p on turnover of 14m. APV weakened 6 to 98p after Smith New Court downgraded profits expectations. Johnson Matthey moved forward 8 to 458p after reporting results at the top end of market forecasts.

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Banking plan for low-income families The Post Office and high street retailers offer the best prospect of providing basic banking facilities for low-income households, including the provision of low-cost loans, according to a study carried out for the Social Security Advisory Committee which was published yesterday. The service could be made financially viable if social security payments were made directly into accounts operated by them, the paper says. It should include a facility to deal with cheques addressed to the payee's account, and might also have to take in measures to ensure that buying the retailer's goods was not a condition of providing the service. The research by the Policy Studies Institute, an independent think-tank, shows that although one in five households were without a current account, this was not entirely because people were excluded from banking facilities. Instead some chose to close their accounts and manage their budget in cash. Of the households without current accounts, 40 per cent were pensioners, and a further 40 per cent had incomes of less than Pounds 150 a week. They were mostly lone parents or people who were unemployed. Mr Michael Bett, chairman of the committee, which advises the government on a range of social security matters, welcomed the paper's proposals. The study noted consumer resistance to the payment of social security benefits by automated cash transfer - an essential element of the scheme in order to avoid the need for subsidy. Since it was not clear whether the problem lay with automatic transfer itself or with the reluctance of people on benefit to use a bank or building society account, there was a need for further research, it added.

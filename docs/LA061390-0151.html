			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> INTELSAT TO PAY U.S. FOR MANNED SHUTTLE TO RESCUE SATELLITE  </P> <P> The owners of a stranded communications satellite today said they will pay NASA  for a shuttle rescue mission with spacewalking astronauts.  </P> <P> Intelsat's board of governors authorized the rescue effort, which will cost  millions of dollars, during a weeklong meeting in Barbados that ended today.  </P> <P> The uninsured $157-million satellite is orbiting uselessly about 345 miles up.  It ended up 22,000 miles lower than intended when it failed to separate  properly from a Titan 3 rocket March 14.  </P> <P> Martin Marietta Corp., which conducted the $272-million commercial launch,  blamed an engineering design error in the rocket.  </P> <P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration last month said it would send  up a shuttle to rescue the Intelsat VI satellite if Intelsat paid for it.  </P></p>

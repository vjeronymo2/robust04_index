			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pentos in reverse premia disclosure Pentos, the specialist retailer that owns the Dillons, Ryman and Athena chains, yesterday disclosed that its accounts for 1992, which showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 4m, had included reverse premia of Pounds 6.3m. At the same time, it announced the sale of 53 retail sites, trading as Ryman Computer Stores, for Pounds 100,000. Reverse premia are upfront payments by landlords, made when a client takes on a new property. Pentos included the figure among other operating expenses, which totalled Pounds 88.6m in 1992. The company expects reverse premia for the 1993 year to be about Pounds 3.2m. It does not expect any further figure for 1994 or the foreseeable future. The Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog, yesterday said it had been concerned about the adequacy of the company's accounting treatment on reverse premia. Directors had 'shared the Panel's view that it would be helpful to bring forward the company's clarification of its accounting policy and information in respect of amounts included in the 1992 accounts.' The Panel is drawing the question of accounting for reverse premia to the attention of the Accounting Standards Board. It said existing legal and accounting requirements 'did not provide unequivocal guidance.' Pentos has agreed to describe in greater detail the existing accounting policy in the accounts for the year ended December 1993. The group is due to complete at the end of this month a strategic review ordered by Mr Bill McGrath, who formally took over as chief executive at the beginning of the year. Yesterday it said the review had already determined that there was little prospect of returning Ryman Computer Stores to profit without substantial investment. Pentos is selling the stores to Cellular Communications Corporation, which trades as Peoples Phone, a leading independent mobile telephone company. It will treat the Pounds 3.9m cost of the sale as an exceptional item in the 1993 accounts. The computer chain last year incurred an estimated loss of Pounds 700,000 and had a net cash outflow of Pounds 1.6m. Peoples Phone is taking on the 160-strong workforce. The disposal marks the beginning of the group's plans to cut its debt, analysts suggested yesterday. They are expecting pre-tax losses of about Pounds 40m for 1993, including about Pounds 30m of exceptional charges.</p>

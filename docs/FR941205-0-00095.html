In a related matter, we find it appropriate to require cable operators to notify a broadcaster of any change in service that will have an unexpected change on the amount of copyright reimbursement that will be required to maintain its must-carry status. For example, as petitioners point out, there are some circumstances where a permitted signal subject to a .563% royalty rate may become a penalty station and require a payment of 3.75% of the system's gross revenues. We believe it is reasonable to expect a cable operator to inform a must-carry station when the estimated cost of continued carriage may change. We also agree with NAB that it is inappropriate for broadcasters whose stations do not cause a copyright liability for the cable system to be required to commit to indemnification before such liability is actually incurred. In both cases, a change in a station's potential copyright liability may affect its decision whether to retain its must-carry status by indemnifying the cable operator or to cede its must-carry rights. Accordingly, we will require cable operators to notify broadcast stations at least 60 days prior to any unexpected change on their copyright status. This will allow sufficient time for the station to determine whether it wishes to continue carriage and, if not, it will give the cable operator enough time to send out the required notice of deletion of a signal. However, the broadcast station must indemnify the cable operator for costs incurred during that copyright accounting period, but not for additional costs once the broadcaster has notified the cable operator that it will discontinue must-carry status in light of changes proposed, but not yet effectuated, by the cable operator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calculation of station liability. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  INTV and NAB request clarification regarding the method for determining the incremental copyright liability attributable to a particular station. We indicated in the Report and Order that increased copyright liability should be specifically associated with the carriage of each station and further that ``stations should be counted in the order they satisfy all the necessary conditions for attaining must-carry status.'' However, this statement does not accurately reflect the reality of copyright liability, nor does it adequately address the concern that cable operators may have the ability to manipulate the liability of stations which have been historically carried on the system, or which are added pursuant to must-carry. We note that NAB is correct in stating that the copyright liability is determined according to the sequence by which the signal is added to the system. Section 111(d) of Title 17 provides the method for calculating copyright royalties to be paid by a cable system. In addition, the copyright rules provide specific information regarding statements of account and methods of computation for the payment of copyright royalties. We agree with NCTA that the copyright rules determine the manner in which the cable operator will have to pay royalties for each station carried. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50. In an effort to eliminate confusion in making the determination of increased liability associated with each station, we believe that stations which were carried prior to the implementation of must-carry should continue to be accounted in the same manner with respect to the sequence of signal carriage. Stations which were or are added by the system should have their copyright liability based on the sequence by which the signal was or is added to the system. In the event multiple signals are added on the same day, the sequence of incremental increase in liability should be based on the order in which the stations met all necessary conditions for attaining must-carry status. We anticipate that providing the station with the statement of account filed with the Copyright Office will ensure the station the opportunity to review how this process is achieved. Therefore, we decline to adopt an alternative system for determining the copyright liability of individual stations' carriage on a cable system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

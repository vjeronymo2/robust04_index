			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Focus" by Keiko Tatsuta: "Dollar-Buying Central Bank </F> Intervention Seen Makeshift]    [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Despite the Bank of  Japan's efforts to pin the dollar above the 100 yen level, the  fragile currency finally surrendered the psychological barrier  during Tokyo trading hours Monday [27 June] for the first time  since the end of World War II.    Even after last Friday's concerted intervention overseas by  some 16 major central banks, the dollar's weak trend has  continued.    After hitting a new global postwar low of 99.50 yen in  morning Tokyo trading, the dollar closed Monday at 99.93 yen,  easily renewing its previous Tokyo closing low of 100.40 yen  recorded last Friday.    The Bank of Japan actively stepped into the market from the  opening to buy up the dollar for the yen in large amounts, which  momentarily pushed it up back to 100.30 yen but failed to keep  it above 100 yen at the closing.    The effect of Monday's intervention by the Bank of Japan was  "so- so," considering the somewhat smaller amount than last  week, said Kazuo Takayama, foreign exchange director at  Barclay's Bank.    Coordinated central bank intervention, however, could have  impact only in combination with cooperation on monetary policy,  Takayama said    Washington's stance to defend the dollar was not clear yet  with the concerted intervention Friday night, Takayama said.    Takayama suggested there is a need for the United States to  raise its key interest rates and for Japan and Germany to lower  theirs to support the dollar.    Considering the dollar's current weakness, vigorous  concerted  intervention in may turned out to be ineffective in the long  run, said Yuko Fukakusa, manager of the treasury division at  Tokai Bank.    Last Friday's coordinated intervention was also futile, or  otherwise created the best chance for selling, because the  timing was premature, Fukakusa said.    To stop the dollar's further slip, however, intermittent  central bank intervention may be a must, Fukakusa said.    Although another dive in the dollar could be expected from a  short-term point of view, such intervention may have gradual  effect to brace the dollar, she said.    There is a growing view that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board  will finally decide to raise its base interest rates to prevent  the dollar's further drop, market watchers said.    A strategist at Daiwa Institute of Research said there is a  need for U.S. monetary authorities to either abandon the present  policy of keeping interest rates extremely low, or carry out  large-scale concerted intervention.    He said, however, since the possibility is remote that the  U.S. will hike interest rates, Japan may be forced to cut its  official discount rate as an emergency measure.    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told reporters Monday that  Japan will take "aggressive" action to stem the yen's rise in  cooperation with the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations.    Fujii declined to comment on possible joint G-7 actions on  credit policies, however, saying, "monetary measures are for the  central bank to decide."    Government officials tried to react calmly but firmly to the  dollar's fall below 100 yen, with one official saying, "We will  not make a fuss about the yen's appreciation and remain calm."    "Our being upset will adversely affect the exchange rate,"  the official said, while noting that immediate concerted  intervention is the only way to check the yen's further rise.</p>

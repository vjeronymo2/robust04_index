The dividend is being lifted from NKr1.75 to NKr2.50 a share. Hafslund also plans to boost share capital by an estimated Dollars 100m, by issuing new class-B shares. The group, best known for its radiology products, improved pre-tax profits by 26 per cent to NKr1.31bn (Dollars 211m) for 1991. Hafslund Transport, the shipping division, is to be de-merged through an offer to existing shareholders. The shipping operation, to be renamed Actinor Shipping, comprises 13 ships and a 50 per cent shareholding in an offshore accommodation rig. It has a combined book value of NKr2.6bn. Hafslund said that, for the time being, it would retain a 25 per cent share in Actinor Shipping and underwrite a limited portion of its debt, to ensure satisfactory loan terms. Shareholders in Hafslund Nycomed will receive one share in Actinor for every 200 shares in Hafslund Nycomed, resulting in a split of the new shares. Also, the company will seek to increase share capital by up to 4.5m class-B shares (corresponding to 2.9m old shares), to be used for a possible share offering in connection with aNew York share listing.</p>

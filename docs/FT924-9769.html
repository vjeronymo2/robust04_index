			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Thailand moves to reduce military's political power THE CABINET of Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Thai prime minister elected in September in the aftermath of a bloody confrontation between the army and pro-democracy forces, yesterday revoked laws that had given the military sweeping powers, Reuter reports from Bangkok. 'From now on, for all military operations that deal with civilian or political rallies, the armed forces must seek approval from the cabinet,' Major-General Sombat Rodphothong, the deputy defence minister, told reporters. The Internal Security Act was promulgated in 1979 after a coup. It empowered the armed forces chief to mobilise troops and order military operations throughout the country. When mass protests erupted in May against the military's domination of politics, military chiefs used the law to crush demonstrations. Dozens of people were killed and hundreds wounded. General Suchinda Kraprayoon, the unelected prime minister and leader of a coup in 1991, was forced to resign in disgrace. An interim government removed other senior commanders. Pro-democracy parties forged a coalition after elections to return the country to democracy in September.</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Franco denies dithering BRAZIL's new President Itamar Franco has strongly defended himself against mounting criticism he is spending his time on trivia rather than the central economic problems confronting the country. In his first lengthy press conference since taking office two months ago, Mr Franco said: 'Society wants the president sometimes to put aside macrothinking and descend to the microlevel of rents, medicines, schools and trying to improve everyday life.' His focus on such issues has led his administration to be labelled 'the Cheese Muffin Republic', a reference to the muffins that are a staple diet of many of Brazil's poor. The president was to outline his plans for government in his first national address on Wednesday but cancelled it to visit his sick mother. Instead he made clear some of his views, declaring war on financial speculators who have been leaving the stockmarket and buying gold and dollars. 'As long as I'm President there will be war without mercy until they learn the productive system is more important for the country than speculation.' Referring to Mr Collor's recent comments that he was dragging Brazil into the fifth world, Mr Franco said 'the misery we have today puts us far below the fifth world. Two and a half years of Collor's high interest rates and violent monetary policy have left us with deep recession and millions and millions of unemployed Brazilians living in absolute poverty.'</p>

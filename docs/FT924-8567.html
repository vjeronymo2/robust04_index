			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (5): Markets start to multiply - Cheap technology means trading is becoming fragmented EVER thought of setting up your own stock market? Thanks to advances in information technology, it has never been cheaper - as evidenced by a proliferation of new trading systems, each fighting for a share of turnover in the international equity markets. The new wave of technology poses some difficult questions for policy makers, however. Do the users of stock markets - investors and companies wanting to raise capital - benefit from competition or are their interests harmed by the resulting fragmentation of stock market trading? Is computing power actually reducing or distorting competition in stock markets, for instance by allowing some big broker-dealers effectively to run their own private markets? That technology has brought down the cost of running a market is shown by the plans of Tradepoint, a company seeking to raise Dollars 11m to finance a trading system to take on the London Stock Exchange. The annual running costs of Tradepoint will amount to around Dollars 5m, says Mr Peter Bennett, chief executive and himself a former director of the London exchange. That means, to break even, the system needs to capture just 1.5 per cent of institutional share trading in London, he estimates. Compare that with the London exchange, which has cut back on staff in the past two years yet still faced running and costs of Pounds 170m last year. Of course, the exchange does not only run a trading system: for instance, it sells information, settles share trades and acts as a regulator of share issues. But, faced with having to work with the technology it already has, rather than being able to start afresh, the exchange's technology costs are inevitably higher than its newer rivals. It operates with six different mainframe computer types and eight different programming languages. It employs eight separate networks using four different protocols and 11 suppliers. This - and the weight of its history and regulatory responsibilities - means the exchange looks slow to react to technological change compared with its faster-footed rivals. It faces one other big handicap: being owned by broker-dealers, it is under pressure to develop trading systems which benefit broker-dealers. Yet technological development should make it easier for investors to trade directly, cutting out the middlemen altogether. Apart from Tradepoint, the exchange's rivals include Instinet, the Reuters-owned trading system which has built considerable market share in the US but has yet to develop a strong following in Europe. Both systems are intended to bring institutional investors into contact with each other, allowing them to trade directly and so by-pass the costs of intermediaries such as broker-dealers and stock exchanges. Both recognise, though, that active traders are needed to make their markets function, and so try to harness the risk-taking of broker-dealers to provide a more continuous market. Bringing investors together in this way is, technologically speaking, fairly simple. Tradepoint's system, which uses software developed by the Vancouver Stock Exchange, routes investors' buy or sell orders on to a central order board; other investors can then deal against these orders at will. Tradepoint also plans periodic computer auctions of less-actively traded stocks. Instinet, on the other hand, allows users to negotiate over price before reaching a deal. This growing competition in the European equities market already has its parallel in the US. The New York Stock Exchange has been under attack for some years, as evidenced by the fall in its market share of equity trading in the US. It remains the centre for trading in NYSE-listed stocks, but a number of alternative trading systems have discovered a profitable niche operating around the market's fringes. This technological revolution poses one of the most difficult questions for stock markets and the policy makers responsible for them. Is it beneficial to fragment trading in this way, or has technology made markets less efficient for investors? Exchanges complain that, outside their markets, trading is often done by reference to their market prices: yet because these trades are not brought to the market, they cannot influence the central market price, making the central market itself less efficient. Arguably, such fragmentation started taking place in London, even before the advent of systems such as Tradepoint. Big securities houses, such as BZW, have developed systems for capturing and feeding orders through to their in-house market makers, who promise to trade at the 'best price' available. In effect, these houses are already running their own private markets. Stock market regulators have allowed technology to shape the markets in this way, so are unlikely to to try to prevent further fragmentation. The launch of new trading systems - and a move by London and continental exchanges, to fight back with their own new technology - will mean a proliferation of trading screens in brokers' and investors' offices. Instinet and Tradepoint add to this diversity. Not all are likely to survive. By definition, markets are only successful if they attract enough trading activity to make other traders want to use them. Those that do not establish this critical mass will wither away as traders focus their attention on the marketplaces where the action is. For those electronic markets that win, the future could be very profitable indeed.</p>

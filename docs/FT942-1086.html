			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Gardening: Be wary of Blairi - give cistus a vote - Robin Lane Fox finds that sun roses can leave their rivals in the shade Flowers are everywhere and it seems mad to waste a weekend in a town. Roses have even been keeping pace with the news. I have no doubt about my sight of the week: it confronted me on an old brick wall in Oxfordshire with an allegorical message. All over the brickwork ran the opulent flowers of the old-fashioned rose known as Blairi Number Two. Watch out, you fellow travellers, to judge from this rose's petals. The outer edges are a soft and appealing pink but the centres are a deep rose red, verging on bloodstains. Blair's Number Two is a class act as a climber, like the lesser-known Number One. Perhaps we will see it in party buttonholes in 1997. But you might be reassured to know that it is extremely prone to rot when looking its most promising, and that it never performs if it is given its head. It looks best on a scaffold of wood or bamboo. This weekend, the elusive Blairi Number One can be seen at its best in the great rose garden of Mottisfont Abbey in Hampshire (where I think I remember it on the wall in the far left-hand corner as you enter the first walled square). Number One is nothing but a pale powder-pink, and I have to say that Number Two has eclipsed it. Roses of this type hate my soil; they show signs of distress and quickly lose their leaves. In order to hide them, I look to the other great shrubs of high summer in the home counties. Three mild winters have done wonders for them and, this weekend, the best have never looked better. On a poor soil for roses, try sun roses instead. These are the evergreen family of cistus which will leave Blairi Numbers One and Two looking very parochial if you ever transplant them to gardens further south. Cistuses conjure up two different settings which the post-war intake of gardeners are busily uniting. With one eye, I picture them on the chalk soils of Hampshire, spilling out of borders below the mallow-flowered abutilons which have come safely through the recent frosts between Winchester and Newbury. With the other, I picture them where they grow wild: in the gardens of expatriate-built holes within reach of the Mediterranean. If I was banished from Britain, Blair's roses would be no good at all: I would switch over in quantity to cistuses (a plant which gardeners in France, Spain and Italy still use unimaginatively). Cistuses, like horses, have run through my adult life, some staying longer than others. By now, I know which ones look best. Go for the white-flowered forms with dark, chocolate blotches and leaves with a sticky surface and a resinous smell. I never understand why many gardeners, especially in hot climates, choose the pink-flowered forms instead: varieties such as Silver Pink or Sunset are much the least interesting. The first choice has to be Cistus cyprius, which is surprisingly hardy in Britain and magnificent in French or Italian settings. It puts up with awful drought and soon reaches 6-7ft, needing enough room to spread itself. But be sure that you site it correctly because you cannot move it later. Indeed, the one golden rule for cistus growers is never to transplant an established bush. This spring I broke the rule, just to test it; the result is a dead C. cyprius, just as the books promise. If cyprius is too big for your taste, you might like to risk others that are denied to those of us in colder gardens. In light shade, there is a white-flowered cistus, called palinhae, which will flourish unexpectedly under tall trees. I first saw it at Wisley and then checked its performance with Graham Thomas, the living master of ground cover. C. palinhae really does spread in light shade, although it will look messy if you have the sort of trees which drip anything sticky on to the ground. It makes low bushes (up to 2ft) and is a much older and grander alternative to yet more hardy geraniums. Anyone with shade in a sheltered garden should try two or three bushes and, if they survive the winter, take dozens of cuttings next year. Cistuses are extraordinarily easy to multiply, as you can prove for yourself this very weekend. Now is exactly the moment to strike. Simply pull off some of the soft shoots which are not flowering at the tips of a plant, and pot them up in a light, sandy soil. They will be well-rooted by September so long as you water them. Londoners and expatriates also have the choice of two lovely forms which lack sufficient hardiness for me. The best is lusitanicus decumbens, which has white flowers with crimson eyes and lasts as a broad, spreading bush for a very long season. It ought to be exploited everywhere in its native Spain and Portugal, but gardeners seem stuck with exotic South African daisies and foreign bedding plants. Against a sunny wall in a warm city, it will last for many years; it is my pick of the main family. I would match it with a hybrid, raised in Hampshire: Halimio cistus wintonensis which has small, grey-green leaves and cream-yellow flowers with a chocolate zone in its prettiest named variety, Merrist Wood Cream. Be warned, however, that it has never survived moderate frost in sheltered corners of Oxford and is emphatically a plant for a pot or a warm garden here or abroad. Years of losses have taught me there are few certainties in the world of the cistus, but that the taller and smaller-flowered white laurifolius is one of them. It remains a backbone of summer borders and banks, even in places where the frost is relatively sharp. Since 1987, I have rallied to an alternative, the broader and bigger-flowered Snow White (its elderly raiser kindly wrote to me when last I alluded to it in the FT). One or two branches have died back since then, but I continue to think it the most under-rated of the hardy forms - and if you saw it right now, you could only agree. The petals fall nightly from the passing flowers but buds keep on opening and the entire plant now has a spread of 6ft without any sign of distress. Surprisingly few nurseries either list or know it. Hunt out those which the The Plant Finder recognises and then propagate Snow White from cuttings; they root with wonderful ease.</p>

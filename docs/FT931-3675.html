			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Election '93: Apathy marks French poll THE conservative opposition alliance is heading for a resounding victory in the French parliamentary elections on Sunday and March 28, but the level of abstention is likely to be a record, according to the final opinion poll of the campaign. Violence erupted yesterday at a public meeting at Gardanne, near Marseilles, addressed by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of the far-right National Front. Police had confiscated knives and missiles from NF supporters. Four people were injured when protesters pelted the police with bottles and vegetables. This was a rare outburst in the French election campaign, which has been notable for a subdued tone. This hints at a high rate of abstentions which an IFOP opinion poll in Journal du Dimanche yesterday reckoned could be 26 per cent - some six points above the norm. Political pundits this weekend said that the high level of abstentions, with voting intentions having changed little since campaigning began, was indicative of the electorate's apathy. 'Everything suggests the campaign has washed over the electorate like water off a duck's back,' said Liberation newspaper. The final IFOP poll confirmed these views by suggesting that the conservatives would win 42 per cent of the votes, against 43 per cent in a January sounding, leaving them with more than 400 of the 577 National Assembly seats. The ruling Socialist camp is expected to emerge with 89-109 seats after mustering 20.5 per cent of the votes. The ecologists, who had been gaining ground in the campaign, have slipped. The poll yesterday suggests they will attract 14.5 per cent of the votes, making them the largest protest grouping, ahead of the NF with 10.5 per cent, and the Communists with 9.5 per cent.</p>

One year ago, He Kehui, member of the  provincial party committee's Standing Committee, was elected  chief procurator by provincial People's Congress deputies.  After assuming office, she undertook the heavy task of severely  punishing economic crimes and criminal offenses.    Procuratorates throughout the province are facing this  situation: On the one hand, there are difficulties in economic  development, reform achievements have not been easy, and 10  million people are still in poverty. On the other hand, a small  number of people are abusing their power for personal gain,  trading power away for personal benefit, and lining their  pockets at others' expense. What a sharp contrast! So her  responsibility is even heavier.    Last year, together with other comrades of the  procuratorates, she handled 952 major cases each involving more  than 10,000 yuan, dealt with 18 major criminal cases involving  cadres at the county sectional level and above. The arrests of  Yan Jianhong, former board chairman of the provincial  international trust and investment corporation; Guo Zhengmin,  former chief of the provincial public security department; and  Ma Yongqing, former general manager of the Guizhou Airline  Company afforded general satisfaction.    Procuratorates throughout the province has made breakthrough  progress in dealing with economic crime, recovering an economic  loss of 58.95 million yuan for the state and collectives. In  the meantime, procuratorates throughout the province have meted  out punishments to major criminal offenders, thus protecting  reform, opening up, and the masses.    On the work in 1994, He Kehui said: This year is a year of  conscientiously implementing instructions of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and of developing the  socialist market economy, during which reform will enter a  crucial period. It is also a year in which the fight against  corruption will develop in depth. Procuratorates throughout the  province should profoundly conduct the struggle against  corruption. Above all, they should concentrate on examining and  handling major and important cases, uphold the principle of  severe crackdown, safeguard the country's political stability  and social tranquility, strengthen their supervision over law  enforcement, and continue to change the situation where law is  not observed or law enforcement is not strict. The people trust  the people's procurators.    In the auditorium of the provincial people's government  yesterday afternoon, Xie Jinhan, who has worked for decades on  the judicial front, came up to the rostrum of the provincial  People's Congress meeting to report on the work of the Guizhou  Provincial Higher People's Court. Last year courts throughout  the province conscientiously implemented the party Central  Committee's instructions on preserving social stability, further  strengthened their function in exercising dictatorship over  enemies, and resolutely dealt with all kinds of criminals  according to the law, thus puncturing the their arrogance and  providing a powerful guarantee for the province's stability.    In addition, courts throughout the province followed the  party Central Committee's arrangements in carrying out combat  against corruption. Focusing on major and important cases, they  increased the momentum of strikes at economic crimes. Last  year, they handled 1,755 economic cases. Through trial, they  recovered an economic loss of 1.18 million yuan for the state  and collectives.    In the course of curbing economic crimes, courts throughout  the province focused their blows on government functionaries,  particularly leading cadres, who abused their power for  corruption, bribery, and embezzlement of public money. Last  year, they handled 515 corruption, bribery, and public money  embezzlement cases and punished 636 criminals. Following the  deepening of the fight against corruption, more economic  criminal cases were unearthed and dealt with one after another.  More economic criminal cases will be submitted to courts.    For this reason, Xie Jinhan pointed out in his report:  Courts throughout the province should make the necessary  preparations both mentally and in terms of having adequate court  personnel. Major corruption and bribery cases must be  thoroughly examined and severely punished, no matter who is  involved.    On the work in 1994, Xie Jinhan said: The general  requirement for this year is to produce good results in  crackdowns on major and important cases and to make big headway  in adjusting economic relations. For the interests of the  country and the people, for the dignity of law, courts  throughout the province must, under the supervision of party  committees, leaders, and people's congresses at all levels, make  important contributions to the fight against corruption.</p>

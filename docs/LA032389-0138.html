			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PATRICK HENRY IN LIONS SEMIFINAL  </P> <P> The curveball was giving Patrick Henry High School catcher Mike Coleman fits.  </P> <P> "I've just had a lot of trouble hitting left-handers' curveballs," Coleman said  after Wednesday's 15-3 victory over Monte Vista, which put the Patriots into  the AAA Division semifinals of the 39th Mike Morrow/Lions tournament.  </P> <P> Coleman's problem is now in the past tense. He pulled two home runs over the  right-field fence against two left-handers Wednesday at Monte Vista.  </P> <P> And both times, he picked on a curveball.  </P> <P> Coleman's first home run came in the second on a 1-0 pitch. It was the second  consecutive curve Jason Beckstrand had tried to sneak by him.  </P> <P> "I recognized the spin on the second pitch," Coleman said. "I didn't think he'd  throw me another curve."  </P> <P> Coleman waited on it and drove the ball high onto the bank beyond the  right-field fence.  </P> <P> In the sixth, Coleman hit a two-run homer off Jack Rickey.  </P> <P> "I was guessing curveball all the way there," Coleman said. "And once I  recognized the spin, I just waited on it and . . . "  </P> <P> Coleman didn't need to finish the sentence. The ball ended up near where the  first one had landed, some 25 feet up the embankment.  </P> <P> Patrick Henry also got home runs from Brian Simmons in the second and Shannon  Webb, to the opposite field, in the fourth.  </P> <P> "I knew this team could hit," Coach Bob Imlay said. "I knew we could swing the  bat, but I thought my pitching would be a lot better. We're throwing a lot of  balls."  </P> <P> Patrick Henry pitchers issued seven walk. Two of Monte Vista's runs were scored  by runners who reached base on walks.  </P> <P> But the Patriots' pitching has been good enough to get them into today's 10:30  a.m. semifinal game against San Dieguito, which will match hot hitting against  a well-rested pitcher.  </P> <P> The Mustangs will go with Erik Luna, who is 3-0 and has not pitched since  Friday.  </P> <P> "It'll be a good test for us," said Imlay, whose team had lost five in a row  coming into the tournament.

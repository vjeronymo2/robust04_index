			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Cars rise by a third in 10 years THE NUMBER of cars licensed to drive on British roads has risen by more than a third from just over 15m in 1980 to 20.23m last year, according to the latest annual vehicle census, published yesterday by the Department of Transport. During the same period, the number of motor cycles, mopeds and scooters fell 39 per cent from 1.37m to to 833,000. The number of public transport vehicles increased by 5 per cent to 115,000, but that is 13 per cent below its peak of 132,000 vehicles in 1988. Licensed goods vehicles on the road, including most types of lorries and vans, fell by 4.5 per cent compared with 1989. Figures have varied during the decade, often in common with the state of the economy. The number of cars on the road, by comparison, has risen every year since 1980 increasing by 3 per cent in 1990. Simon Holberton writes: There are still significant benefits for employees receiving company cars, but the recent tax changes in the Budget mean companies and employees will have to be much more selective in future, according to the top pay unit of Income Data Services, a pay research organisation. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, increased tax charges on company cars by 20 per cent in his March Budget, making employers liable to National Insurance on the benefit derived by employees. Tax changes appear to have favoured those who receive a car as a benefit and handicapped those provided with a car as a working tool. IDS, 193 St John Street, London, EC1V 4LS.</p>

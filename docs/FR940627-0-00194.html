			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consideration of exposure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA retains discretion to consider, in addition to available toxicity data, any Tier 1 data on potential exposures to emissions from a particular fuel or fuel additive (or group of fuels and/or fuel additives) in determining whether to require Tier 3 testing. EPA may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Types and emission rates of speciated emission components;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Types and emission rates of combinations of compounds or elements of concern;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Historical and/or projected production volumes and market distributions; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Estimated population and/or environmental exposures obtained through extrapolation, modeling, or literature search findings on ambient, occupational, or epidemiological exposures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) EPA will determine whether Tier 3 testing is necessary upon receipt of a manufacturer's (or group's) submittal as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescribed under &sect;79.51(d). If EPA determines on the basis of the Tier 1 and 2 data submission and any other available information that further testing is necessary, EPA will require the responsible manufacturer(s) to conduct testing as described elsewhere in this section. EPA will notify the manufacturer (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group) by certified letter of the purpose and nature of any proposed testing and of the proposed deadline for completing the testing. A copy of the letter will be placed in the public record. EPA will provide the manufacturer a 60-day comment period after the manufacturer's receipt of such notice. EPA may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extend the comment period if it appears from the nature of the issues raised that further discussion is warranted. In the event that no comment is received by EPA from the manufacturer (or group) within the comment period, the manufacturer (or group) shall be deemed to have consented to the adoption by EPA of the proposed Tier 3 requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) EPA will issue a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of its intent to require testing under Tier 3 for a particular fuel or additive manufacturer and that a copy of the letter to the manufacturer outlining the Tier 3 testing for that manufacturer is available in the public record for review and comment. The public shall have a minimum of thirty (30) days after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication of this notice to comment on the proposed Tier 3 testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) EPA will include in the public record a copy of any timely comments concerning the proposed Tier 3 testing requirements received from the affected manufacturer or group or from the public, and the responses of EPA to such comments. After reviewing all such comments received, EPA will adopt final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 3 requirements by sending a certified letter describing such final requirements to the manufacturer or group. EPA will also issue a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcing that it has adopted such final Tier 3 requirements and that a copy of the letter adopting the requirements has been included in the public record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Prior to beginning any required Tier 3 testing, the manufacturer shall submit detailed test protocols to EPA for approval. Once EPA has determined the Tier 3 testing requirements and approves the test protocols, any modification to the requirements shall be governed by &sect;79.51(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Carcinogenicity and Mutagenicity Testing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) A potential need for Tier 3 carcinogenicity and/or mutagenicity testing may be indicated if the results of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In vivo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Micronucleus Assay, required under &sect;79.64, the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In vivo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay, required under &sect;79.65, the Salmonella mutagenicity assay required under &sect;79.68, or relevant pathologic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> findings under &sect;79.62 demonstrate a statistically significant dose-related positive response as compared with appropriate controls. Alternatively, Tier 3 carcinogenicity testing and/or mutagenicity testing may be required if there are positive outcomes for at least one concentration in two or more of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests required under &sect;&sect;79.64, 79.65, and 79.68.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The testing for carcinogenicity required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion, be conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 798.3300 or 798.3320, or their equivalents (see suggested references following each health effects testing guideline). The testing for mutagenicity required under this paragraph may likewise be conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 798.5195, 798.5500, 798.5955, 798.7100, and/or other suitable equivalent testing (see suggested references following each health effects testing guideline). EPA may supplement or modify guidelines as required to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas of concern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reproductive and Teratological Effects Testing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) A potential need for Tier 3 testing may be indicated if the results of the Fertility Assessment/Teratology study required under &sect;79.63 or relevant findings under &sect;79.62 demonstrate, in comparison with appropriate controls, a statistically significant dose-related positive response in one or more of the possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test outcomes. Similarly, Tier 3 testing may be indicated if statistically significant positive results are confined to either sex, or to the fetus as opposed to the pregnant adult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The testing for reproductive and teratological effects required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion, be conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 798.4700 and/or by performance of a reproductive assay by continuous breeding. These guidelines may be modified or supplemented by EPA as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas of concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Shadow of guilt falls across derivatives - The weakness of the Japanese market A SEARCH by the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) for the culprits behind the chronic weakness of Japanese share prices has led back to one of the usual suspects, derivatives, and to the foreign brokerages most adept in dealing in derivative markets. Inspired by share prices at their lowest since October 1990, the TSE has announced that a task force will examine tighter controls over stock index futures and options trading. Exchange officials say new controls are necessary because the futures market is primarily used for speculation and is the source of violent price movements in the cash market. But the liberalisation of financial markets which brought large-scale stock futures trading from 1988 has also diversified the vested interests within Japan. The TSE said the task force would be established jointly with the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE), but Osaka authorities said yesterday that they will conduct their own review. The bulk of Japan's stock futures trading is done on the Osaka exchange, although its index is based on Tokyo cash prices. Having been more successful than Tokyo in derivative trading, officials at the OSE, the second largest exchange, argue that trading there is not to blame for Tokyo's problems. Friction between the two exchanges is in addition to the conflicting interests of large and small Japanese brokers - the latter are dependent on individual investors for commissions and tend not to play the derivative markets. Then there are the differences between the TSE and the Ministry of Finance, which, in the wake of the securities scandals last year, is under pressure to be seen to be regulating the industry. And there is the sometimes testy relationship between Japanese brokers and the foreign securities houses. The Big Four Japanese brokers reported profit falls of more than 64 per cent in the first half to end-September, while a few foreign brokers booked large increases in Tokyo profits partly because of their skill in playing the derivative markets. Trading in the Osaka-based Nikkei 225 futures index rose 2.7 times last year, and accounted for 56.2 per cent of the trading revenue earned by the OSE. At the same time, futures trading in Tokyo on the TSE's own Topix index accounted for only 2.6 per cent of the exchange's trading revenue. While Tokyo officials have pointed the finger at foreign brokers for having led the 'abnormal' surge in derivative trading, larger Japanese brokers are developing their expertise in the area. Mr Atsushi Saito, the executive managing director of Nomura Securities, is critical of 'speculation' in the futures markets, but urged authorities to refrain from introducing new restrictions. 'Restrictions will increase the inefficiency of the futures market,' he said, adding that 80 per cent of Nomura's futures deals are done on customers' accounts, suggesting that it is not a 'speculator' - about 56 per cent of Osaka futures dealing is done on brokers' own accounts. But Mr Saito said that the securities industry's priority must be to restore investor confidence in the cash market. Investor confidence is an important issue in the debate over derivatives. The TSE and smaller brokers are determined to lure individual investors back to the cash market, but Mr Minoru Nagaoka, the TSE president, argues that they are intimidated by the sharp price movements generated by arbitrage trading - the profiting from price differences between the cash and futures markets. But Japanese investors have other, very sound, reasons to be wary of the Tokyo market. A speculative swirl in the cash market took the Nikkei index to 38,915.87 in late 1989, but the index was below 21,000 yesterday, with some signs that the market may get worse as stocks are sold off before the close of the financial year in March. Individuals were also shaken by the stock market scandals of the past year which showed that Japanese brokerages favoured larger corporate clients by compensating them for trading losses. Meanwhile, Japan's meagre dividend levels are no incentive to buy stocks, and investors have realised that stock prices can no longer defy gravity. Mr Jason James, a stock strategist at James Capel Pacific, said that the Osaka exchange scored a victory by backing the Nikkei 225 index, which is more vulnerable to price movements than Tokyo's Topix and is thus more attractive to investors. But he said the targeting of arbitrage as the cause of the Tokyo cash market's problems is an attempt to 'find a scapegoat'. The TSE's frustration has been heightened by low trading volumes on the cash market, down 22.9 per cent last year, with the daily average at 372.8m shares, below 400m for the first time in seven years. Mr Nagaoka complained that the value of turnover for stock index futures in Tokyo and Osaka last year was more than five times that of the Tokyo cash market's first section. So far the OSE and TSE have compromised on measures to 'reform' the derivative markets. The OSE has argued against dramatic changes, but agreed to the lifting of margin requirements three times last year, increasing the amount of money deposited at the exchange when a trade is made. An OSE official said the cash market's weakness is not necessarily linked to futures trading: 'If we find there is a problem, we will do something, but it will not be easy to change the nature of the index.' The OSE says that it will study trading hours, brokers' trading on their own accounts, information disclosure, and the fixing of futures settlement prices. The TSE said it will consider long and short-term reforms of futures trading, and a US broker suggested that the Tokyo task force could recommend various changes in the calculation of the Nikkei index. He said the enthusiasm for reform will be linked to the market's strength when the review is completed - if the Nikkei index has risen, the pressure for change will have eased. Tokyo could impose a ceiling on brokers' dealing in futures on their own account - foreign brokers would be disadvantaged if that ceiling were calculated on the basis of the asset value of operations in Japan. The review panel could also recommend that tighter limits be placed on the price movements of illiquid stocks within the Nikkei 225. The composition of the Nikkei 225 lends itself to sudden price fluctuations. A surge of trading in thinly-traded stocks moves the price-based Nikkei index more sharply than the capital-weighted Topix index, a difference that has encouraged futures trading on the Osaka market. Some of the more illiquid stocks have been already removed from the Nikkei 225, but the task force may recommend that a larger number of illiquid stocks are replaced on a regular basis. And the exchanges could again increase the margin deposit requirements in an attempt to curb trading volume. But another UK broker suggested that if the TSE task force is objective in its assessment of the derivative markets, it will come to the conclusion that to clamp down would be merely to 'shoot the messenger'.</p>

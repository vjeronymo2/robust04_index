			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Laporte/Evode Laporte has made a generous offer to Evode's shareholders to win the recommendation of their board. Whether it has been as kind to its own shareholders, though, remains open to doubt. Mr Ken Minton is adamant that the deal will enhance earnings within the first full year of ownership. But he places touching faith in how quickly Laporte can get to grips with Evode's lacklustre businesses. After repaying Evode's preference shares and assuming its debt, Laporte will be faced with a total cost of more than Pounds 200m. That is a lot for a business that made pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.2m last year. The financial challenge has been made all the harder for Laporte by its accompanying share placing. Although this lowers the risk for the company, it also lessens the immediate rewards for shareholders. Yet perhaps it does not do to quibble. The longer-term opportunities are clear enough. If Laporte can push Evode's margins up from 4 per cent to the 14 per cent the predator enjoys, shareholders will be amply rewarded. The process can start rapidly by knocking out overhead costs, squeezing suppliers and pushing through selective price increases. Provided they have the patience, Evode's shareholders may do well to opt for Laporte's paper rather than take the cash. As for Wassall, which has limped away from the fray, it now rejoins the unhappy ranks of frustrated conglomerates scouring for prey. But perhaps such predators have missed their main chance. Recently the market has been all too active in bidding up the prices of highly-geared recovery stocks that form the likeliest acquisition fodder.</p>

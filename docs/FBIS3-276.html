			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mozambican Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance]  movement has expressed concern about the latest government  decision to demobilize its troops as soon as possible regardless  of whether or not Renamo is ready to do the same.    Renamo said the demobilization of troops from both sides  will  start simultaneously and in line with a set timetable. The  demobilization should have begun two days ago, but the United  Nations did not submit a list of names of Renamo soldiers  waiting to be demobilized.    Meanwhile, the United Nations special representative to  Mozambique, Mr. Aldo Ajello, has reaffirmed that Mozambique's  first multiparty elections will only be held if troops from both  sides are demobilized. He dismissed earlier reports that the  United Nations might allow the elections to take place even if  the Mozambican Government and Renamo still have their respective  armies.</p>

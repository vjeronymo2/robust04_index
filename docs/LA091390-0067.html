			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FOUNDRY VIOLATES EMISSIONS LIMITS  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District says a Torrance foundry has  violated a court order limiting its emissions of airborne lead particles.  </P> <P> AQMD prosecutor Joseph Panasiti said two samples taken last week outside the  Martin Brass Foundry at 2341 Jefferson St. show lead concentrations exceeding 4  micrograms per liter of air. The foundry is under a court injunction to keep  its lead emissions below 3 micrograms per liter.  </P> <P> Panasiti said Wednesday that he will request a hearing on the issue in Los  Angeles Superior Court. Charles Ivie, an attorney representing the foundry,  said he considers the court-ordered limit on lead emissions too stringent and  will ask that it be increased.  </P></p>

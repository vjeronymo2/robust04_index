			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Arben Djaferi, president of the Party for </F> Democratic Prosperity, by Panta Dzambazovski; place and date not  given: "Macedonia Has a Future If a Historic Agreement Is  Reached"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Dzambazovski] How do you  view The Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM], with autonomy for the Albanians, with  cantons, or the way it is now?    [Arben] In this matter, we want the Albanians to be a  constitutive element. We ask Macedonia to cultivate a democracy  of consensus. We see the possibility for equality in  constructing special institutions of education, culture, and so  on, as well as a kind of a broader autonomy for the communes,  according to European standards.    [Dzambazovski] Do you mean communes according to the map of  the so-called "Ilirida?"    [Arben] To be honest, I do not know what that map looks  like, but I know that the people who have engaged themselves in  that matter have a grotesque approach to policy. I know that  the man elected for president of such an autonomous region is  now president of a parallel branch in Gostivar. That makes it  clear how much those people with their list of wishes are  lacking in seriousness, and they do not know the mechanisms.    [Dzambazovski] Compared to your faction?    [Arben] First of all, we are not a faction, we are the PDP  [Party for Democratic Prosperity]. The answer to your question  is positive because we are a serious party and serious  politicians.    [Dzambazovski] You mentioned equal representation of the  Albanians in the institutions. In number, from the professional  viewpoint, or how?    [Arben] I have a different approach. A historic agreement  is needed. Without such an agreement we can continue the agony  and waste our energy. History shows that after such agreements  a period of great stability has come about in many countries.  It is easy to operate after an agreement.    [Dzambazovski] If there is such a climate and if your  proposals are acceptable?    [Arben] It is wrong to think that. The agreement will  certainly stop the confusion. The Europeanization of the region  is our long-term goal, while our short-term goals are issues  that we can solve through policy, like the introduction of  institutions into the Albanian way of life, starting from  kindergarten.    [Dzambazovski] Does this imply that you think the Albanians  are endangered?    [Arben] I think we are. There have been many decadent  processes within the Albanian people, which must become a  concern of the Macedonians, too.    [Dzambazovski] Do you personally feel you are endangered?    [Arben] I can be very flexible as an individual, and when I  feel I am endangered, I can slow down. However, we are changing  the identity of the collective -- the cultural identity, which  is not the same as that in Albania, where there are all the  necessary institutions, or in Kosovo, where there used to be  such institutions. We are endangered because we do not create  values, and we create bad values, wasting our time on vain  projects. I think there are many political goals that we can  realize without including the Macedonian political factor. We  shall work toward conquering that political space, we shall  create values that depend exclusively on ourselves. We must  introduce into the Albanians' lives institutions that must not  present an obstacle for any political party, because we shall be  engaged in our own political space.  <H5>  Outside the Macedonian Space? </H5>   [Dzambazovski] However, you cannot bypass the Macedonian  parliament, speaking of such issues.    [Arben] That is why we are taking one step at a time. We  must reach a historic agreement, and the way to do so is through  terms that we shall have to agree on, about who is going to  create what. We are not asking to enter the Macedonian space.    [Dzambazovski] It sounds like creating parallel institutions  in the state.    [Arben] No. I am talking about the fair competition that we  must have, from culture to sports. The Macedonians in the area  where they are dominant are competitive, and thus new values are  created. However, the Macedonians in western Macedonia, for  instance, are the same as the Serbs in Kosovo -- they are not  competing, because they are "genetically disposed" to having the  values, to being employed, to getting a flat, and so on. The  Macedonians in eastern Macedonia have to strive to achieve the  same advantages. It is absurd, but it is true that the  Albanians have a better understanding with the Macedonians in  eastern, than in western Macedonia. It is no wonder that the  Macedonians in the western part are working hard to maintain the  present relations between the Albanians and the Macedonians. I  also wish to say that the danger for the Macedonians does not  come from the Albanians or Albania, but from Serbia and  Bulgaria, which only sees the country in terms of territory.    [Dzambazovski] It is true that official Albania supported  your faction in the long process of divisions within the PDP.  Why?    [Arben] That is how it looks from the outside. If we  analyze the pictures, we come to that impression. Albania's  influence I think, must be relevant in Macedonia, because it is  a stabilizing factor in the Balkans, and it affects some  stabilizing political processes. I think we have the right to  communicate with the political factors in the Balkans,  particularly with Albania.    [Dzambazovski] Yet, you did not say why Albania supports  you.    [Arben] Certainly because we are more serious and because we  have constructed a political vision for Macedonia, without  projects like just employment in the system's institutions.    [Dzambazovski] However, it is true that the PDP is an  indigenous party, active in Macedonia with its program.    [Arben] Yes, it is true, but the PDP also asks for  legitimacy in the Albanian tissue in the Balkans, and that is  natural, as it is for the Macedonian parties related to the  diaspora. I think that if we have the support of Albania, we  are on the right road, because the whole Albanian political  course in the Balkans has demonstrated political maturity in the  latest crisis.    [Dzambazovski] There is one view that the affair of the  paramilitary formations of Albanians in Macedonia lies behind  this support.    [Arben] That is political intrigue. And finally, why do you  not talk about the so-called affair with those who are involved  in it -- some Albanians and the Macedonian authorities, who  certainly know more. Taci and I, as well as the others, have no  connection with it.    [Dzambazovski] Why do you make so many remarks regarding the  work of the delegates and ministers?    [Arben] There is a transition going on in Macedonia, but  with people who used to be in positions, including the  Albanians. It is a kind of a silky communist transition. Our  demands are deeply human, they are not irrational, and we hope  to find people who think the transition must be better.  Tensions must be avoided.    [Dzambazovski] Can they also be created by you?    [Arben] Yes, if Macedonia does not establish a European  system of values. Then such tensions arrive. We shall ask for  support from the foreign factor, and we shall ask for the right  to self- organization, which starts with the political  organization of the political structure. We will gain  efficiency in our political activity if there is a strong  political organization, a public one. At this stage we are  trying to strengthen a political structure that was not strong.  There was a political elite in the system, and the other  political subjects were on the fringes, for instance the  delegates who have much stronger political semantics.  <H5>  [Box, p 15] </H5> <H5>  "If There Is a War in Kosovo, I Shall Volunteer" </H5>   The vice president of the faction, Menduh Taci, also made a  statement at the interview with Arben Djaferi. Here is a part  of that statement:    "I stated the following for the London OBSERVER: If there is  any destabilization, it will be as a result of the Macedonian  authority's mistake, the Macedonians, because the Macedonians  are the majority.    "Some Greek Dzambazovski asked my opinion about the name of  the state. I said that the citizens of Republic Macedonia must  decide about the name, and that the Albanians should be included  in the dispute with Greece.    "The Albanians do not want bloodshed. The Macedonians should  know who their friends are. Certainly not Serbia, nor  Bulgaria, because it does not want to hear of the existence of  the Macedonian people, and we know about Greece. So who is left?    "We are constantly accused of being radicals. I shall say,  in principle -- in constitutional and legal principles, if we  have agreed on a matter, we want to have a definite term for its  realization. If the Government wishes to make policy with  `representatives of the people,' it is doing its people wrong.  The times of such tricks belong to the Turkish era.    "Will we organize assistance and volunteers if there is a  war  in Kosovo? It is not just a positive answer, but I also state  that I, personally, will go to Kosovo as a volunteer -- that is  my right and nobody can stop me.    "The issue on autonomy will depend on the Macedonian  parliament and the attitude of the Macedonian authority. And  `Ilirida' is an empty project of delegate Mersim Polozani, from  the time when his rating was decreasing.    "The document shown by Naser Ziberi on A1 Television  Broadcast looks like a `headquarters document of Lazar Mojsov.'  Let us see the record -- it is not my signature, neither are  the alleged tasks for cooling down interethnic relations, and so  on. Nevertheless, I do not want to sue him, because I do not  want to adopt his or Djeladin Murati's manners.    "It is a public secret how Muhamed Halili became a candidate  and how he won the elections. I conducted the campaign. If he  thinks he has confidence in the constituency now, let him come,  we shall present a candidature."</p>

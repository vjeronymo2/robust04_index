			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUINS LEAVE THEMSELVES OPEN FOR QUESTIONING  </P> <P> Everyone knows that because Trevor Wilson cannot make two consecutive free  throws, he is the UCLA player to foul in the clutch.  </P> <P> Given that: 1) Why was Wilson in the Stanford game with nine seconds left, and  2) even if he was in, why did he get the ball?  </P> <P> Also, after missing the first free throw, why didn't he purposely miss the  second? And, once he made the second, why wasn't a Stanford player immediately  fouled?  </P> <P> Isn't there one answer, heretofore unmentionable, to the above four questions?  </P> <P> FRANKLIN S. ADLER, Beverly Hills  </P></p>

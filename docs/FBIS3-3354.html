			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By John Kohut] </F>   [Text] Chinese police defused a potentially explosive  protest yesterday by detaining more than 100, mainly elderly  people, as they attempted to demonstrate against Japan on the  eve of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's arrival in Beijing  today, according to witnesses and sources close to the protest.  Scores of elderly people, some in their 80s, seeking reparation  for Japan's occupation of China during the 1930s and 1940s,  began descending upon the Japanese embassy in Beijing just after  it opened yesterday morning.    The authorities had apparently been tipped off about the  protest and surrounded the embassy with about three dozen  uniformed policemen and several times that many plain-clothes  police.    Protesters from across the country were supposed to converge  on the embassy at 10 am, but they started arriving much earlier  and were bundled off into jeeps and taken to a police station  near the embassy, according to the sources. They said some 300  petitioners appeared at the embassy and more than 100 were taken  away by police. Some of the protesters detained were carrying  letters addressed to Prime Minister Hosokawa.    Gao Minke, 82, who works in a hospital in southern China,  wrote in a protest letter that Japan should apologise for war  crimes and compensate relatives of the victims. Mr Gao, who was  detained, said he lost more than 10 relatives at the hands of  Japanese soldiers in a rural part of Jiangsu Province in 1938.  An estimated 10 million Chinese died during the occupation.    Others tried to deliver copies of a letter signed by the  Preparatory Committee of Chinese Civilians Seeking Reparations  from Japan saying "problems left over by Japan's war of  aggression have not been solved". "We representing 500,000  living sufferers and relatives of the dead victims, resolutely  request that you give a formal apology to the Chinese people and  a definite reply to the reparation demands of the Chinese  civilian victims," the letter to Mr Hosokawa said.    Police also intercepted more than 100 protesters at a train  station in the southern part of the city, the sources said.    Tong Zeng, a researcher in his 30s who has been one of those  behind the movement for Chinese civiliansto get billions of  dollars in war reparations, was reportedly taken into custody  yesterday. When contacted last night, his family said: "He is  out and will be away for a few days ... They have taken him  away."    Those detained came from as far afield as Hubei, Jiangsu,  and  Zhejiang in the south and Liaoning Province in the northeast.  Most were in their 60s and 70s. It was not clear whether they  were still being held last night. "They didn't really  understand why they were detained. They thought, they were just  delivering a letter and expressing their opinion. It's totally  legal," said a source close to the protest.    Diplomats inside the embassy said they were unaware of the  protesters' presence.    China gave up all claims to war reparations from Japan when  the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1972.  Still many ordinary Chinese believe their government was wrong  to do so. During this session of the National People's Congress,  32 representatives from the province of Hubei presented a war  reparation proposal to the motions department of the  rubber-stamp parliament calling for a Japanese apology and  reparations. The delegates argue that while their government  has given up its rights to reparations, there is nothing in any  accord with Japan which rules out civilian compensation. The  delegates and followers of the preparatory reparations committee  demand US$180 billion in compensation.    Mr Hosokawa is expected to meet Prime Minister Li Peng  today,  and President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji tomorrow.</p>

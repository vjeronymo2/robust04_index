The application must show that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The subsidiary carrier's parent company issues publicly traded common-stock equity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The subsidiary carrier's parent company owns 90 percent or more of the subsidiary's voting shares of stock; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The business and the financial risks of the subsidiary carrier and the parent company are similar.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The similarity of the parent company's and subsidiary carrier's business risk shall be evaluated by examining the degree to which the consolidated system's profits, revenues, and expenses are composed of those of the subsidiary carrier, and the extent to which the parent's holdings are diversified into lines of business unrelated to those of the subsidiary carrier, and/or other indicators of business risk deemed appropriate by the Commission. The similarity of the parent company's and subsidiary carrier's financial risk shall be evaluated by examining the consolidated system's and the subsidiary's total capitalization ratios, debt-to-equity ratios, investment quality rankings on short- and long-term debt instruments, times-interest-earned ratios, fixed charges coverage ratios (calculated to include both FMC and non-FMC regulated operations), and/or other measures of financial risk deemed appropriate by the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) When the consolidated capital structure is used, the consolidated system's cost of common-stock equity capital (issued by the parent company), the consolidated system's cost of long-term debt capital, the consolidated system's cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital, and the consolidated system's composite statutory corporate income tax rate shall also be used in estimating the subsidiary's BTWACC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Where the Commission has approved the use of a consolidated capital structure, such use will not be subject to challenge in a subsequent rate investigation brought under section (3) of the Intercoastal Act, 1933.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Book-value, average capitalization ratios. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Capitalization ratios representing the capital structure used in deriving a carrier's BTWACC shall be computed on the basis of average projected book value outstanding over the 12-month period used to calculate projected midyear rate base in &sect;552.2 (f)(1)(ii). The average amount of any class of capital outstanding used in determining the capitalization ratios is computed by adding the amount of a particular type of capital expected to be outstanding as of the beginning of the 12-month period to the amount of that same type of capital expected to be outstanding as of the end of the 12-month period, and dividing the sum of the two amounts outstanding by two.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Capitalization amounts and ratios (Schedules F&hyph;I and F&hyph;I(A)).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A carrier shall show its long-term debt, preferred stock, and common-stock equity capitalization amounts outstanding, stated in book value terms, as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to calculate projected midyear rate base, and the average amounts and average ratios for that 12-month period. Where a carrier is a subsidiary of a parent company, the carrier shall show its own capitalization amounts and ratios unless the carrier applies for and receives permission from the Commission to use a consolidated capital structure in computing the BTWACC. Where such permission is granted, the carrier shall show instead the consolidated system's capitalization amounts and ratios.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cost of long-term debt capital (Schedules F&hyph;II, F&hyph;II(A), F&hyph;III, and F&hyph;III(A)).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) The cost of long-term debt capital <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  shall be calculated by the carrier for the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base on the basis of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The cost of sinking fund preferred stock shall be computed in accordance with the regulations in this section for calculating the cost of long-term debt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Embedded cost for existing long-term debt; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Current cost for any new long-term debt expected to be issued on or before the final day of the 12-month period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The arithmetic average annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital calculated on the basis of all issues of long-term debt expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base shall be the cost of long-term debt capital used in computing the BTWACC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital for all issues of long-term debt expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base shall be calculated separately for the two dates by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Multiplying the cost of money for each issue under paragraph (e)(7)(v)(A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of this section by the principal amount outstanding for each issue, which yields the annual dollar cost for each issue; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Adding the annual dollar cost of each issue to obtain the total dollar cost for all issues, which is divided by the total principal amount outstanding for all issues to obtain the annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital for all issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The arithmetic average annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital for all issues to be used as the cost of long-term debt capital in computing the BTWACC shall be calculated by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Adding the total annual dollar cost for all issues of long-term debt capital expected to be outstanding as of the beginning of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base to the total annual dollar cost for all issues of long-term debt capital expected to be outstanding as of the end of the 12-month period, and dividing the resulting sum by two, which yields the average total annual dollar cost of long-term debt for all issues for the 12-month period;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

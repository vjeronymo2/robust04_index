			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gregorio Salazar] </F>   [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez admitted  yesterday, upon returning from the United States, that a  significant portion of the funds obtained as a result of  currency devaluation will be used to pay the foreign debt. As  Minister Sosa was about to get into his car, which by the way  has a private license plate, he was approached by a reporter who  asked:    [Unidentified Reporter] What will the government do with the  additional income obtained from the sale of dollars?    [Sosa] Well, there are various aspects. First of all, the  Central Bank of Venezuela [BCV] is trying to reduce liquidity  through the zero coupon bond mechanism and is trying to  establish a more permanent method. On the other hand, you must  remember that our budgets include foreign debt servicing which  must be paid in dollars, which means that it will cost us more  bolivares. So we already know where those bolivares will go.    [Reporter] Can those bolivares be used to pay the debt?    [Sosa] Obviously ...    Previously, Sosa had answered several questions from  reporters who inquired about the differences between the  auctioning of dollars and foreign exchange controls. "The  auctioning of dollars and foreign exchange controls are two  completely different things. The word auction itself implies  that there are no controls, because I understand it means that  you can offer `two,' I can offer `three,' and another person can  offer `two and a half.' Controls would mean that if I say `two'  that is it."    Sosa said there will be no alternate to the BCV as a source  of dollars.    [Reporter] Is the BCV also trying to control the large  number  of dollars being sold?    [Sosa] Evidently, it is trying to handle this -- price and  volume -- step by step. I believe, however, that it is being  handled beyond the normal needs.    He had previously been asked whether the mechanism to  auction  foreign exchange would be permanent or temporary. "I think it  will last for some time. BCV is always trying to establish the  measures that best fit the circumstances. For instance, the  system the bank used a little more than a year ago, the  "crawling peg standard" -- I do not know how to translate that,  it sounds like a spider climbing a wall -- was different from  the one used previously. The new mechanism fits reality more  closely, and I think it will work just fine.    Sosa turned philosophical when he was asked what he had  meant  when he said the auctioning of U.S. dollars would be permanent.  "God is the only permanent concept in life. All of the material  things and man do not last forever, and whoever says the  opposite is wrong. I meant that the system would last one year,  maybe longer."    Someone told him that, according to National Convergence  Deputy Jose Miguel Uzcategui, auctioning is the best exchange  control. "Well, I will ask him to explain that to me when I see  him."    Sosa expressed confidence in the auction mechanism  established by BCV. He regards the system as convenient because  financial markets are gradually returning to tranquillity.  According to the finance minister, the Economic Cabinet  discussed his trip to Washington and divided the cabinet into  four sectors: political, social, infrastructure, and economic.    He said that in the United States, he met people willing to  enter joint ventures with CVG [Venezuelan Guayana Corporation]  in aluminum and steel manufacturing. He also thinks that another  plant for manufacturing methanol for export could be built in  Venezuela. Sosa, who is always optimistic, confidently expects  inflation to decline and interest rates to fall by the end of  the year.    Later, he said flatly that Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.  [PDVSA]  will not be privatized. "There are very good possibilities for  foreign capital, with technology, resources, and market  potential, to join PDVSA subsidiaries in certain projects." A  very large investment is required in the Orinoco Strip, Orinoco  Delta, eastern Monagas, and the southern Sucre projects, which  are open for investment. "This does not mean that PDVSA  subsidiaries or PDVSA itself will be privatized," he said.    Asked how international reserves will be affected, he  answered: "Let us hope that trust will make them increase. I do  not think this system will affect the reserves. If they are  affected in any way, it will be for the better."</p>

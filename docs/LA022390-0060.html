			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HAWTHORNE EXTENDS APARTMENT LIMITS  </P> <P> The Hawthorne City Council voted unanimously Thursday to extend by 10 months  and 15 days a moratorium on building apartments with four or more units.  </P> <P> The moratorium, which took effect when it was approved at a special council  meeting Thursday, extends a 45-day moratorium that the council approved on Jan.  8. The action is intended to give the city time to draft construction standards  that would decrease density and increase parking and open space.  </P> <P> Mayor Betty J. Ainsworth said the moratorium was prompted by residents'  complaints about the increasing density in apartment projects throughout the  city. The moratorium, which will run until January, 1991, applies to all  projects currently being reviewed by the city Planning Department.  </P></p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 My idea of heaven may not be the gloriously coloured and earthy Africa of Abdulrasak Gurnah (Paradise, Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 14.99), but Mr Gurnah certainly does write like an angel. Where others would have been content to have their novels glisten with the charm of the 'native', Gurnah's novel throbs with the passion of a visionary. His style is reminiscent of VS Naipaul - perhaps not as comical as the early Naipaul, but not as bitter as the current writings, either. In the non-fiction stakes: Tony Benn's Diaries 1940-1962 (Hutchinson, Pounds 25) reveal another visionary, one whose devotion to the people and commitment to public duty reduces one to exhaustion and to feeling one-inch tall. Harold Wilson once said of Benn that 'he immatures with age'. What was meant as a put-down turns out to be the key to Benn's continuing hold on the nation's emotional imagination: he brings youthful energy and enthusiasm to the arduous and often unrewarding task of standing popular convictions on their heads. A truly humbling man. Hubris rather than humility stalks the corridors of Westminster providing Auberon Waugh with much of his inspiration for the columns collected in Way of the World (Century, Pounds 15.99).

He said that  although the Thai Government tried to solve the problem and  arrested the Thai businessmen for sending workers to Libya  without official permits, there has been no change in the  situation.    The three companies are: the SPC Suphachok, or SPC  Supertrade; V and M Engineering; and an affiliated firm of  Wintrade and Winman. The ambassador said the three will be  barred from doing business with American companies.    Wirot Sakunmuthita, owner of the V and M Engineering  Company,  has denied the charges, but admitted designing and overseeing  the construction of a "safety bunker" in a complex which the  United States believes is the chemical weapons factory. Wirot  said his arrest was politically motivated and carried out under  U.S. pressure. He said he has cancelled all contracts to build  "safety bunkers" in Libya.    Following the arrest in October of Thai businesses sending  workers to Libya, Libyan Leader Mu'ammar Al-Qadhdhafi threatened  to expel Thai workers from his country. Although no concrete  action was taken afterwards, hundreds of Thai workers left Libya  for home. There are about 20,000 Thai workers left in Libya.</p>

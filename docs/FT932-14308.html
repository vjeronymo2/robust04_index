			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Prices increase sharply in China INFLATION in China's biggest cities surged in the first quarter, prompting fears that economic overheating could bring tighter credit curbs and direct government intervention to slow imports. China's state statistical bureau reported that prices in the country's 35 biggest cities jumped on average 15.7 per cent in the three months to March compared with the same period last year. Shanghai and Guangzhou, where the economic boom has been most marked, recorded the highest rates: 16.7 per cent and 17.2 per cent respectively. Prices rose 14.6 per cent in Beijing and 12.3 per cent in Tianjin. The price surge is certain to strengthen arguments in the leadership of conservatives who have been urging measures to cool an overheated economy. Reformists have been resisting these pressures, but may now feel obliged to take more rigorous action to restrain activity. China recorded average growth last year of 12.8 per cent. Economic activity has continued unabated in the first quarter of this year in spite of credit curbs. These seem certain to be strengthened along with efforts to slow growth in the money supply. Mr Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank, recently cautioned Beijing about the dangers of the economy running out of control. He said China's economy could sustain rates of growth of between 7.5 and 8 per cent without risking the stop-go cycle of the 1980s. Then, the leadership resorted to draconian credit curbs and import restraint to slow activity. 'The need to sustain growth within the bounds of what the physical and institutional structures can handle is paramount in their minds,' said Mr Preston after meeting top officials. Chinese officials insist that these latest inflationary pressures are different from those of the 1980s that threatened the reform programme. These derive less from rampant borrowing and excessive imports, they say, than structural changes that have led to sharp increase in basic commodities such as foodstuffs and fuel. But western economists say the leadership cannot afford to be sanguine about a wage-price spiral that may prove difficult to control without resorting to measures that might threaten the economic reforms themselves. These officials note that wages have also surged in line with price rises.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Commerzbank unveils details of rights issue COMMERZBANK, the smallest of Germany's big three commercial banks, yesterday unveiled the details of its long-awaited rights issue. This will be Commerzbank's first rights issue since 1986. The bank said it would be offering one new share for every 11 held at a price of DM200 per share. Yesterday, the company's shares responded by falling DM1.9 on the Frankfurt bourse to close at DM241.10. The rights issue - which is likely to raise DM500m (Dollars 314.4m) cash for the bank - has been expected since last May when shareholders gave Commerzbank the right to raise nominal capital by DM400m. The rights issue is worth a nominal DM125m, or 2.5m new shares. In spite of strong growth in profits last year, the bank has lower capital ratios than its competitors. Analysts said yesterday that this issue would take core equity capital above the threshold set for new capital adequacy ratios which took effect at the beginning of the year. Total equity capital of the bank will be DM9.7bn after the issue. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUDGET REQUESTS UNDERSCORE COUNTY'S UNMET NEEDS  </P> <P> A homeless man asked for an increase in his $312 monthly welfare check. A woman  who tearfully admitted to beating her 8-year-old daughter urged continuation of  a treatment program for child abusers. And dozens of bureaucrats requested just  about everything, from more gloves to protect the coroner's staff from AIDS and  other infectious diseases to an additional agricultural inspector to check  traps for killer bees.  </P> <P> They were among the scores of people who traveled to the county Hall of  Administration this week to speak for four minutes each at the Board of  Supervisors' budget hearings. Some came alone and politely asked the  supervisors for more money. Others, including a hundred social workers upset  about proposed increases in their already heavy caseloads, staged noisy  demonstrations.  </P> <P> The nature of the requests portrayed a county government overwhelmed with unmet  needs of the poor and the mentally ill and a jail system that has been forced  to release offenders because of chronic overcrowding.  </P> <P> The problems facing the supervisors came to light amid continued uncertainty  over how much the county will receive of the new-found $2.5-billion state  surplus. Actual deliberations on the county's proposed $9.2-billion spending  plan will not begin until July, after supervisors know how much the county will  receive from the state. But that decision will be made hundreds of miles away  in the corridors, meeting rooms and private offices of the state Capitol.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revenue Sources  </P> <P> The county relies on a mix of local revenue sources, including property taxes  and special assessments, plus money from the state. The state money is used to  run the courts, hospitals for the poor, mental health clinics and jails. But  the state has reduced the amount of money available for such programs, even  though costs have risen with the growing numbers of the mentally ill and the  poor and increased arrests by law enforcement  </P> <P> Supervisors have some money -- at least $750 million -- which they can spend as  they see fit. The conservative-dominated board in recent years has chosen to  spend more for law enforcement and less on social programs. The proposed  1989-90 budget, drafted by the chief administrative officer, reflects that  priority.  </P> <P> In the hearings, Chief Administrative Officer Richard Dixon expressed optimism  that the county will receive enough of the state surplus to avert many, if not  all, of the threatened cuts in health and other services.  </P> <P> But even if the state provides additional money, "it will not be enough to meet  all of the problems that (supervisors) are agonizing over," Dixon said.  </P> <P> "It's still not a bright picture because of all the unmet needs," said  Supervisor Ed Edelman, a member of the board's liberal minority.  </P> <P> Which programs will receive more funding will depend on how much the state  provides and whether the money is earmarked for specific purposes. If the money  comes with no strings attached, supervisors can spend it as they please.  </P> <P> The week's public hearings, which ended Thursday, were required by law.  Supervisors said they hoped the hearings would draw the attention of state  leaders to the county's problems, though the event most widely covered by  television was an earthquake that sent the crowd sprinting to the exits.  </P> <P> The supervisors listened politely to advocates for the mentally ill and the  poor, doctors and patients from county hospitals and mental health clinics,  county labor union leaders and bureaucrats..  </P> <P> "Thanks for speaking," Supervisor Kenneth Hahn said before anyone took the  microphone. "But we have no money."  </P> <P> He repeatedly implored speakers to "go to Sacramento" to lobby state officials  for more aid to the county.  </P> <P> County welfare director Eddy Tanaka underscored the supervisors' dilemma.  </P> <P> State law requires the county to provide general relief for indigents who are  not eligible for other programs. However, the state does not provide any money  to pay for the program. There are about 49,000 people on general relief and the  number is growing, Tanaka told supervisors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Office Closings  </P> <P> To meet this increase -- and provide a $10 increase in the $312-a-month  allowance -- Tanaka has proposed closing four welfare offices.  </P> <P> "Overcrowded lobbies, long waits for service and increased complaints regarding  service are predictable," he told supervisors, assessing the impact of the  proposed closures. "It is predictable that we will have an increase in the  number of disturbances due to hostile clients."  </P> <P> Supervisors also heard from a homeless man and from legal aid attorneys who  asked for an increase in the general relief allowance.  </P> <P> "You present a real problem," Hahn said to one of the speakers. "The only  rentals are on Skid Row, and they're $300 a month, and the (housing allowance)  is only $200 a month."  </P> <P> Parents of sexually abused children also urged supervisors in emotional  testimony to save a program that provides treatment to the children and their  families.  </P> <P> "Perpetrators are being healed in your program," said the mother of a  6-year-old sexually abused child.  </P> <P> The woman who beat her 8-year-old daughter, who is now in a foster home, said  that by court order her daughter cannot visit her home unless the family is  enrolled in the program.  </P> <P> "I want to know which one of you," she told supervisors while sobbing, "will  tell my daughter she cannot come home."  </P> <P> Some of the requests to supervisors dealt with more obscure areas of county  government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pollutes Bay  </P> <P> An environmentalist urged supervisors to spend more to clean out the clutter  that gathers in storm drains and pollutes Santa Monica Bay.  </P> <P> Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy asked for money to hire an additional  inspector to check traps for the Africanized honey bee, also known as the  killer bee. He warned that the bee, reportedly headed toward California, can  wreak havoc with domestic bee colonies and has been known to attack humans.  </P> <P> Some of those who spoke at the hearings questioned whether their testimony will  have any impact on supervisors, who have their own pet programs. Supervisor  Pete Schabarum, for example, has pledged to fight proposed cuts in the Museum  of Natural History budget. Edelman has said he will seek to increase funding  for drug treatment programs.  </P> <P> Several speakers complained about the absence of Supervisor Mike Antonovich  from most of the four days of hearings. Antonovich was in Switzerland attending  a conference on refugee relief. An aide said the supervisor will review a  transcript of the hearings.  </P></p>

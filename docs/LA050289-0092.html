			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FBI AGENT SAYS SILBERMAN TOLD OF PAYMENT TO PROBE FIGURE  </P> <P> Moments after his arrest on April 7 in an alleged money-laundering scheme,  Richard T. Silberman told federal agents that he gave a reputed mobster $6,500  in cash as compensation for introducing him to a man Silberman believed was  connected to Colombian drug dealers, according to testimony Monday in federal  court.  </P> <P> The testimony by an FBI agent, which came during a probation revocation hearing  for the alleged mobster, Chris Petti, suggests that Silberman, a powerful San  Diego businessman and political fund-raiser, acknowledged key details about his  reported involvement and that of Petti and two others in the money-laundering  case.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., interviewed after the court  hearing, was asked if the testimony indicated that Silberman "confessed" to any  of the charges against him and the others after he was arrested.  </P> <P> "That's an inference a reasonable person would make," Gorder said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Comment From Lawyer  </P> <P> Oscar Goodman, a Las Vegas attorney who is representing Petti and is known for  his outspoken criticism of federal prosecutors, was unusually close-mouthed  after the Monday court session. He refused to comment on whether Silberman may  have confessed to some of the allegations in the indictment against him and the  other three defendants.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to say anything about it," Goodman said, leaving the courtroom  and heading straight for the elevators. "And this is big-mouth Goodman saying  that."  </P> <P> In other court action Monday, James J. Brosnahan, a prominent San Francisco  attorney, was presented as Silberman's attorney in the money-laundering case.  </P> <P> Brosnahan, 55, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Kennedy and Johnson  administrations, joined several others in 1986 in testifying against the  confirmation of Justice William H. Rehnquist as chief justice of the United  States.  </P> <P> Silberman and Petti are charged with conspiring to launder $300,000 they  allegedly believed came from Colombian drug traffickers. The money actually  came from an undercover FBI agent posing as a middleman.  </P> <P> Also charged in the complex case are Darryl Nakatsuka of Los Angeles, described  as a "bag man" in the money-laundering operation, and Jack N. Myers of Malibu,  who has been associated with Silberman since the days when both raised campaign  funds for former California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.  </P> <P> All four defendants have pleaded not guilty in the case and all but Petti are  free on bail.  </P> <P> The hearing on Monday centered on whether Petti, who remains in the  Metropolitan Correctional Center, has violated terms of his probation on an  earlier bookmaking conviction by not reporting to authorities that he received  the $6,500 from Silberman during the alleged money-laundering scheme.  </P> <P> But Goodman said that any money Petti may have received from Silberman was  later given to Robert Benjamin, a longtime associate of Petti's who turned  government informant to help the FBI in its 2 1/2-year investigation of Petti.  That investigation later ensnared Silberman and the other defendants.  </P> <P> The judge in the probation revocation hearing continued the matter until  Friday, when Benjamin is scheduled to testify about the alleged transfer of  money from Silberman to Petti.  </P> <P> Charles B. Walker, the FBI agent who supervised the Petti-Silberman case,  described from the witness stand how agents arrested Silberman at the Hyatt  Islandia hotel while he was allegedly negotiating to launder $1.1 million that  an undercover agent had told him were illegal drug proceeds.  </P> <P> Walker said Silberman was taken inside Room 719 of the hotel, was told why he  was being arrested, and advised of his Miranda rights. He said Silberman at  that time "made a statement."  </P> <P> "Mr. Silberman told me that he paid Chris Petti approximately $6,500 for having  introduced him to the special (undercover) agent whom he knew as Peter  Carmassi," Walker testified.  </P> <P> "He told me the $6,500 was given to Chris Petti during a meeting at the Denny's  restaurant. And he told me he did not give money to Mr. Benjamin because he  told me Mr. Benjamin would be paid by Mr. Carmassi."  </P> <P> On April 3, federal agents had observed a meeting at the downtown Denny's  restaurant between Petti and Silberman.  </P> <P> "Mr. Petti and Mr. Silberman were observed at the counter at the Denny's that  day," Walker testified in describing the FBI surveillance of that meeting.  </P> <P> "Mr. Silberman was observed giving a package to Mr. Petti, who put it in his  pocket. It was a small envelope."  </P> <P> The government contends that the package contained part of the money paid by  Silberman to Petti as a fee for Petti's introducing him to the undercover  agent.  </P> <P> The government alleges that Silberman assumed all along that the undercover  agent was a middleman trying to hide money for Colombia drug dealers.  </P></p>

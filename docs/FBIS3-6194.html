Under the contract between the two cities, China will be  responsible for construction and profits are to be divided  equally, trade and shipping industry sources here said Tuesday.    China has promised to put up 65 million U.S. dollars while  guaranteeing to supply North Korea with 10 freight cars, one  3-ton truck, one 16-passenger bus, two 44-passenger buses, one  jeep and 1,000 tons of wheat flour.    North Korea, in return, will lease out a 10,000-square-meter  storage site at 90 cents per square meter a year.    The contract also states that North Korea will open Chongjin  port to all foreign vessels and allow enterpot [as received]  freight transporation regardless of the cargo's origin.    Trade officials said mutual interest brought about the  contract since Yanbian Korean autonomous prefecture wanted to  use the North Korean port to cut the transport distance for 400  South Korean manufacturers in the region on the current route  from Dalian, while the North Koreans were in need of foreign  currency.    They confirmed that Chongjin-Hoeryong road construction is  under way from their Chinese trade partners.    Shipping industry sources said it has been easy to transport  South Korean goods on vessels from other nations, but it would  still be difficult for South Korean flagged-ships to enter the  North Korean port directly due to complicated procedures at home.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> L.A. GAMES;  </P> <P> MORNINGSIDE GIRLS ADVANCE IN BASKETBALL  </P> <P> The girls basketball team from defending state Division I champion Morningside  High School may be the most talented group in California and because four  starters return, big things are expected from the Monarchs.  </P> <P> Morningside is living up to those expectations in the 22nd L.A. Games.  </P> <P> Saturday morning at El Camino, Morningside proved it is still the team to beat  by defeating Division III champion Brea-Olinda, 42-35, in the quarterfinals of  the 64-team girls tournament.  </P> <P> The Monarchs advance to the semifinal round against Lynwood today at 9 a.m. The  championship will be played later this afternoon.  </P> <P> "Everyone on this team is bound to improve, and I don't see anyone out there  stopping us if we play up to our capabilities," said Morningside's All-American  center Lisa Leslie, who was recently named to the Junior National team after  tryouts in Colorado Springs, Colo. "I think we'll be even better once the  season starts and we start getting back into our rhythm."  </P> <P> However, if there is one kink in the Morningside armor, it is the absence of  point guard JoJo Witherspoon, who graduated and moved on to play at the  University of Kansas. Witherspoon was a catalyst on offense and Morningside's  best defensive player. Monarchs Coach Frank Scott has asked sophomore Sherell  Young and junior Princess Murray to step into Witherspoon's spot, but it is a  considerable request.  </P> <P> "Right now it (Witherspoon's graduation) is affecting us a lot," Scott said.  "She was a great defensive player, she was probably the quickest guard in  California and she pushed the ball upcourt for us."  </P> <P> Against Brea-Olinda, Murray scored six points, but Young was held scoreless.  The Monarchs also had trouble bringing the ball upcourt, committing 21  turnovers, including 14 in the second half when Brea-Olinda cut Morningside's  14-point lead to 3 with 2 minutes left in the game.  </P> <P> Morningside has 6-foot-1 forward Janet Davis, who started every game last year  as a freshman. Davis scored 10 points Saturday, yanked down nine rebounds and  blocked four shots.  </P> <P> But when it counts, Morningside still has the 6-foot-5 Leslie, who is probably  California's best basketball player. She led all scorers with 17 points, 19  rebounds and six blocked shots.  </P> <P> After scoring 12 points in the first half, Leslie was silent for the first 18  minutes of the second frame when Brea-Olinda, trailing 31-17, cut the  Morningside lead to 35-32 with 2:10 remaining.  </P> <P> In the next 20 seconds, Leslie took over. She drove the lane for a layup, was  fouled and converted the free throw for a three-point play.  </P> <P> On the other end of the court, Leslie blocked Tammy Blackburn's shot, grabbed  the loose ball and fired a pass to Akiba Flanagan, whose shot rolled off the  rim. Leslie got the rebound, was fouled and made both shots to give the  Monarchs a more comfortable 40-32 advantage.  </P> <P> "The first thing we have to do is get our confidence level back up," Leslie  said. "And then we have to keep getting more intense on defense. If we keep  playing hard, giving 110%, we'll be all right.  </P> <P> "I like the fact that we're playing well together as a team and the defense is  hanging in there."  </P> <P> Leslie goes to Colorado Springs in two weeks and will join her Junior National  teammates on a basketball tour of Europe.  </P> <P> The L.A. Games kick off the summer basketball season, and Morningside will play  in three tournaments and in a league in Culver City.  </P> <P> But they'll play most of their games without Leslie, Davis, who will attend AAU  camp in Virginia, and Flanagan, who along with Witherspoon will participate in  team handball at the National Sports Festival in Oklahoma City next month.  </P> <P> "That's what the summer is all about," Scott said. "You get a chance to see  what you need to work on and see how your youngsters can perform."  </P> <P> In other sports action:  </P> <P> Two of three South Bay teams advanced in the early basketball games Saturday  only to be eliminated later in the afternoon.  </P> <P> Carson dumped Marina of Huntington Beach, 52-37, Saturday morning at Locke  High, but was beaten by Lynwood, 56-54, in the later game. In its first game of  the day Lynwood beat Westchester, 61-57, in overtime.  </P> <P> Also at Locke, Rolling Hills, which beat Camarillo, 62-48, Saturday morning,  lost to Dorsey, 63-51, in the afternoon round.  </P> <P> Two South Bay teams will face each other this morning in the passing football  semifinals at El Camino College.  </P> <P> North Torrance squeaked by Bellflower, 20-19, and earned the right to face  Westchester, which beat L.A. Baptist, 7-6.  </P> <P> Muir beat West Torrance, 21-7.  </P> <P> West Torrance advanced to today's softball championship game with a 5-1 victory  over Hart of Newhall. The Warriors face Thousand Oaks, which beat Rolling  Hills, 7-6, in a game that was decided by two tiebreakers.  </P></p>

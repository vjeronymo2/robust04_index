This was 3,300 more enterprises  than the number registered before the beginning of 1993.    The number of employees who work in this sector came to  approximately 261,000 at the beginning of 1994 (in 1992--2.3  percent fewer), or one-quarter of all individuals employed in  the sphere of small business and 4.3 percent of those employed  in the industry of Ukraine (last year this indicator came to 3.9  percent).    The volume of total proceeds from the sale of products,  work,  and services in prices in effect exceeded 4 trillion karbovantsy  in 1993. Products of small industrial enterprises worth 562  billion karbovantsy (17.9 percent of the receipts) were sold to  the population.    The ownership arrangements of small industrial enterprises  and the ratio of their share to the total volume of product  sales: Some 7,300 enterprises are private--47.4 percent; 5,200  are collective enterprises--42.3 percent; 750 enterprises are  state-owned--7.3 percent.    The main sectors in which small industrial enterprises  operate are machine building and metal working (37.2 percent of  the total number of small industrial enterprises), light  industry (15.2 percent), wood processing and the pulp and paper  industry (8.8 percent), the production of building materials  (7.5 percent), and food processing (3.7 percent). This sectoral  breakdown of small industrial enterprises is characteristic of  all regions of Ukraine.    Outlays on product manufacturing at the small industrial  enterprises exceeded 2 trillion karbovantsy in 1993. Some 983  billion karbovantsy (42.6 percent) was used to buy raw and other  materials, and 420 billion karbovantsy (18.1 percent) was used  for wages. Outlays accounted for 0.58 karbovantsy per each  karbovanets of the products sold.    For the most part, the small industrial enterprises have  their own production assets, the value of which came to 793  billion karbovantsy as of the beginning of 1994.

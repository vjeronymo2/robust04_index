He wants his fellow-fighter Bagrat  Asatryan, one of the active doers of the leading Armenian  National Movement [Armenian Pannational Movement] party, [to]  hold a post instead of the existing Chairman of the Central Bank  Isahak Isahakyan. Armen Darbinyan, a representative of the  Armenian National Movement, deputy Head of the Economic  Department, is expected for the position of the deputy head of  the Central Bank of Armenia.    Experts are of the opinion that in many respects the  political reasons caused changes in the Central Bank directors.  Isahak Isahakyan holds the position for a period of 10 years  and is the only representative of the old, the so-called  communist nomenclature within the new leadership. His  experience -- the experience of professional and often an  obstinate banker -- was necessary till the Republic was in  direct dependence on Russia. The national currency  introduction brought to no necessity of such a dependence.  Besides, the last-week debates on the Central Bank's submission  to the Armenian Government showed that the Armenian Government  wants to control over the Central Bank's activity.</p>

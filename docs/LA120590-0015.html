			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> SHELL HAS NO USE FOR RUN-AND-SHOOT  </P> <P> Coach Art Shell doesn't like the run-and-shoot offense that the Raiders will  face when they play the Detroit Lions at the Pontiac Silverdome Monday night,  and he's not sure how to stop it.  </P> <P> "They have a lot of people running all over the place," he said of the Lions.  </P> <P> "They've got four wide receivers running all over the place, and it seems when  you watch them, somebody's always open. You've got to make sure you confuse the  quarterback a bit, and always be aware of where Mr. (tailback Barry) Sanders  is."  </P> <P> Bo Jackson's 117 yards rushing Sunday during the Raiders' 23-20 victory over  the Broncos in Denver was his first 100-yard effort of the season. . . . With  his eight-yard sack of the Broncos' John Elway, Greg Townsend has tied his  career-best sack mark of 11 1/2 in a season. He has four games remaining.  Townsend finished with 11 1/2 sacks in 1988 and 1986. CHRIS DUFRESNE  </P></p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Panama in debt swap THE government of Panama has agreed with a US environmental group to what may be the largest swap of commercial bank debt to finance an environmental project, reports Stephen Fidler. Nature Conservancy, a non-profit body based in Arlington, Virginia, will aim to buy at least Dollars 30m face value of Panamanian debt at a discount. The debt will then be swapped for Dollars 30m of 'ecology' bonds. The bonds will earn up to Dollars 2.5m a year, part of which will support government activities and the rest community projects to stop encroachment of the rain forest by poor farmers. The funds will be spent mainly in two big designated national parks, in one of which is located the source waters for the Panama Canal. Some environmentalists say that the forest degradation there has contributed to a worrying drop of water levels in the canal. Nature Conservancy will have up to Dollars 10m available to purchase debt, Dollars 8m of which has been pledged by the US government, and will also solicit donations from banks and other holders. At the current secondary market price of 27 cents for every dollar face value of debt, some Dollars 37m of debt could be purchased. Some 22 commercial debt-for-nature swaps have been completed, the largest involving Dollars 33m of Costa Rican debt.</p>

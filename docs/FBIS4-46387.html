			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Najwa 'Abd-al-'Aziz] </F>   [Text] Counselor 'Abd-al-Sami' Sharaf-al-Din, Public  Attorney at the Higher State Security Prosecution Office,  yesterday decided to remand in custody members of a Muslim  Brotherhood [MB] organization for 15 days pending  investigations. He ordered the items seized with the members to  be sent for examination by forensic and laboratory experts.    Security men have arrested 11 members of the organization in  several governorates. They include doctors, education experts,  furniture dealers, students, and civil servants. Investigations  conducted by District Attorney Sharif 'Abd-al-Nabi and Hisham  Badawi with the organization members have uncovered secret cells  formed by the organization in four governorates. According to  the investigations, the new organization is an extension of the  "Salsabil" organization uncovered a few years ago. The  prosecutors charged members of the new organization with forming  a consultative council, planning the overthrow of the regime,  and preparing antiregime organizational documents and leaflets.  The members used computers to keep information, and computer  discs have been seized. The defendants informed officials on the  remaining members of the organization in the other governorates.  The prosecutors charged them with joining a secret organization  that seeks to overthrow the regime.</p>

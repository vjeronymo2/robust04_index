			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Nerves frayed as storm clouds gather - London By the time the expected Wall Street hurricane had swept across the Atlantic and reached a cowed London market last Monday, it was no bigger than a sizeable squall. It caused havoc in the market that morning but there was no real structural damage, apart from that to some frayed nerves on London's trading desks. But there are plenty of storm clouds gathering over the UK market, many whipped up by unfortunate goings on in the Conservative Party. The latest disaster, the death of Mr Stephen Milligan, MP for Eastleigh, means the government's majority in the House of Commons is now down to 15. And the Tories face some big hurdles in the next few months. The most important dates are May 5, which brings the UK local elections and June 9 - 12, which sees elections for the European parliament. There are very real fears that the government will face crushing defeats in both elections, putting even greater pressure on the prime minister's tenancy at 10 Downing Street. Markets detest uncertainty and will not be happy until the elections are out of the way. As the stock market was absorbing the Wall Street-inspired slide caused by the US interest rate rise, the Bank of England caught dealers on the hop again by lopping  1/4 of a percentage point off its base rate ahead of an optimistic quarterly report. After an initial sharp rise the market fell back as strategists questioned whether there had been an element of political influence in the move. If the market has had to withstand some selling onslaughts of late, and there were more of the same on Friday, there is still scope for further damage this week, which sees the start of a two-week account and brings a deluge of economic data from home and abroad. And the February reporting season continues with numbers from such big names as British Airways, Hanson and Glaxo. Last week's results from two super-heavyweights, BT and BP, provided more than a few crumbs of comfort; BT's figures were better than expected while BP spiced its numbers with details of a big oil discovery west of the Shetlands. The US bond market remains the key to the UK equity market. If bonds continue on their recent downward trend, strategists say, then UK gilts will similarly come under pressure, dragging equities with them. Despite the change of direction by leading UK indices this week, there is no shortage of bullish commentators. NatWest Securities sticks with its view that UK interest rates will be cut to 4.5 per cent by the middle of the year. It is even more bullish on the market's second-line stocks, forecasting an end-1994 FT-SE 250 level of 4,800. In contrast, a most bullish observer of recent years, Mr Nick Knight of Nomura, the Japanese stockbroker, caused a stir at the end of last week. Although maintaining his year-end FT-SE 100 forecast at 4,000, he said the index could, in what is expected to be a turbulent year, drop to as low as 3,200.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from "Comment and Opinion" page: "Cyril, Roelf, </F> Think Carefully"; published in English]    [Text] A non-racial election has happened, which despite  its serious irregularities, has persuaded many that there are no  longer real conflicts left in South Africa.    This is combined with a good deal of politically correct  propaganda, much of it originating from the state media, that we  have broken with the problems of the past, and are all together  marching towards peace and happiness.    Unfortunately this is not all true. Whilst the Government of  National Unity is a compromise wherein participants pledge  co-operation for the common good, fundamental conflicts still  exist.    Now that the election is behind us it is time to get back to  resolving these issues. They were only temporarily set  aside--on the understanding that they would be dealt with once  the election was over.  <H5>  Burning Issue </H5>   These issues are the constitutional differences between the  ANC and NP [National Party] on the one hand, and the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] on the other.    Before the election it was agreed that there be further  international mediation around the question of federalism and  powers for regions.    This is probably the most effective method of defining the  positions of the main parties relatively quickly, and  establishing whether there is any possibility of bridging them.    Otherwise we will only revisit the history of constitutional  negotiations before April 27. A history which, for the most  part, was about stringing the federalists along in a pointless  process, whilst Cyril Ramaphosa, and the lets pretend opposition  of Roelf Meyer, tried to manipulate public perception to their  own benefit.  <H5>  Real Opposition </H5>   The IFP's insistence on international mediation signals that  it is the real constitutional opponent of the ANC. In this it  might be supported by the DP [Democratic Party], whilst impulses  towards stronger regional powers may also come from some of the  ANC's provincial premiers.    The NP, as has been clear for a long time, is not a  constitutional opponent. Its centre-right rhetoric, which it  mouths but does not properly understand, is mostly intended as  carving out a niche within South Africa's political system, from  which power and position can be preserved.  <H5>  Old Duo </H5>   The old duo of Ramaphosa and Meyer already appear to be  backing away from an agreement reached with the IFP prior to the  election, that international mediation would occur.    Perhaps they feel, now the IFP is in the process as they  define it, that further attempts to humour that party are  unjustified.    If so they are wrong. At the heart of the Government of  National Unity is a compromise which has not yet been fully  reached, and which is in important respects implied by the  promise of mediation of the burning question of regional power.    Unwillingness to address this issue could make the genuinely  multi-party nature of the national unity government short lived.</p>

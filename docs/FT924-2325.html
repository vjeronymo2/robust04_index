			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Books: Yeats with the paintbrush 'AN AGED man is but a paltry thing . . .' wrote WB Yeats. That surely was not true of his brother Jack the painter who died at the ripe old age of 85 in 1957, active as an artist to the end. 'His last drawing,' his biographer Hilary Pyle tells us was done 48 hours before his death, 'a tiny gay swirling sketch of two roundabout ponies'. Jack Yeats was in his sixties when he painted some of the great works on which his reputation rests and which may now be located through use of the three volumes of the definitive catalogue of his work in oil. It has been compiled in the wake of her biography of the artist (1970, revised edition 1989) by Hilary Pyle. Yeats was acclaimed in 1945 by the Irish art critic Thomas MacGreevy as Ireland's greatest painter - 'the national painter', he affirmed 'in the sense that Rembrandt and Velasquez and Watteau were national painters'. While not wholly disagreeing, Samuel Beckett - also a passionate admirer - jibbed at the attempt to confine Yeats's genius within nationalistic boundaries. 'He is', wrote Beckett, 'with the great of our time, Kandinsky and Klee, Ballmer and Bram van Velde, Rouault and Braque, because he brings light, to the issueless predicament of existence, reduces the dark where there might have been, mathematically at least, a door'. Is such rhetoric more relevant to Beckett's plays than to Yeats's painting? Extravagantly phrased as the encomium is, some of the colour plates of the late oil paintings reproduced here go far to justify it. Yeats began as an illustrator, working as a young man for Punch and other journals, turning to water-colours and drawings, and then into a bold fluent exponent of the medium of oil. His late manner is as different from the work of his youthful period as is Dubliners from Finnegans Wake. He moved in 1917 to Ireland from England where he was born and lived there for the rest of his time. He loved the landscape and the country people in whose life he found an inexhaustible vein of inspiration. His work was rich in studies of the Irish landscape with its rivers, sea, cliffs and beaches. In his old age these natural forms with the human and animal figures that inhabit them are transformed by a luminous palette richly applied to give us a transcendental vision. Yeats's closest kinship - in his maturity - is with the chromatic canvases of Turner and the apocalyptic fugues of Kokoshka. His painting 'Tinkers' Encampment; The Blood of Abel' (1940) has a crimson patch of blood in the foreground lit up by a small girl in blue with a torch. Figures of men and donkeys are converging on it from the crowded camp sited on a mountainous strip on the far side of a river. Painted during the Second World War, it was the closest Yeats ever came to a direct political statement. More typical of the late manner is 'Come' in which a farmer stretches out his arms beckoning a horse towards him. Man and beast are shown linked in a strange, wild amity. Yeats bore witness in his paintings and his eccentric fictional writings to the survival of that romantic Ireland which his brother lamented was dead and gone. He produced a fine set of illustrations for Synge's The Aran Islands. But the most frequent subjects in the vast body of work now catalogued are horses. There are times when Yeats makes Munnings seem like an amateur. When the Irish Free State evolved WB Yeats became a senator, 'a smiling public man', Jack remained a republican; but although the brothers diverged in their affiliations, their admiration and support for each other's art never wavered. Pyle has been both thorough and scholarly. It was the greatest stroke of luck that the dealer Waddington had a gallery in Dublin and discovered Yeats comparatively early. Yeats had his first exhibition with Waddington in 1943, and stayed with him for the rest of his career. This catalogue, for which the Waddington Gallery has provided much of the information, is inscribed in Victor Waddington's memory. Jack B. Yeats: A Catalogue Raisonne of the Oil Paintings by Hilary Pyle. A limited edition of 1,550 copies, three volumes in a slip-case. Andre Deutsch, Pounds 395.00 the set</p>

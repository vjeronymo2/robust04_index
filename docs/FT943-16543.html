			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Observer: Wind of change Something peculiar is happening to South Africa's currency, the rand, mid-air over the Atlantic Ocean. It suddenly devalues from the rate offered by banks - R5.6 to Pounds 1 - to R12 to Pounds 1. Or at least, it does if you fly with British Airways. BA cabin staff on the London-Johannesburg flight have been told that, with effect from July 1, the airline's duty free prices are calculated at R12 to Pounds 1. Thus a passenger on Saturday's flight to London found his R130 were worth only Pounds 10.86. A sympathetic purser encouraged him to complain: 'We don't understand either'. Well, someone has to foot BA's recent legal bills.</p>

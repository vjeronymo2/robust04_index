			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: GA shares drop 19p as net assets fall sharply Shares in General Accident, the Scotland-based composite insurer, fell 19p yesterday after results showing the group's net asset value had been hit by poor performing world financial markets and a weak dollar. The drop in the share price to 565p, against a rising market, came despite a jump in pre-tax profits in the first nine months of 1994 to Pounds 321.6m (Pounds 206.5m). Net assets per ordinary share fell to 410p, against 545p at the end of last year. GA blamed conditions on world equity markets and the weak dollar, but Mr John Chester, insurance analyst at SG Warburg, said the figures also reflected the high proportion of long term US bonds in its portfolio. Earnings were boosted by a strong performance in the UK, particularly on property insurance. Total premium income increased to Pounds 3.8bn (Pounds 3.7bn). GA's underwriting profits confirmed the buoyancy of the UK insurance market, though Mr Nelson Robertson, group chief executive, acknowledged that the favourable conditions were unlikely to continue. He said GA was prepared, if necessary, to see segments of its businesses contract if competition was particularly fierce, in order to preserve its profitability. For example, the group has decided not to promote heavily sales of private motor insurance via GA Direct, its direct selling operation which continues to serve about a fifth of GA's motor policy holders, because competitors are cutting prices to unprofitable levels. However, GA has succeeded in expand its household insurance business. Premium income on personal household insurance policies jumped 25 per cent to Pounds 267.4m in the first nine months, while personal motor premium income fell 5 per cent to Pounds 182.7m. Similarly premium income from commercial property policies increased by more than 20 per cent, but commercial motor premium income shrank by 8 per cent. GA also bucked the trend in the UK life industry, increasing new annual premiums by 3 per cent to Pounds 40.9m and single premiums by 46 per cent to Pounds 375.7m. Mr Robertson said GA expected its Pacific and east Asian operations to provide growth opportunities and the group is looking for possible small or medium size acquisitions in the region. However, GA's overseas underwriting results remained lacklustre. US and Canada reported underwriting deficits of Pounds 94.4m (Pounds 107.2m) and Pounds 54.4m (Pounds 26.1m) respectively in the first nine months. Mr Robertson blamed the figures on the impact of catastrophe losses.</p>

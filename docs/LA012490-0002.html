			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN, BLACK NAMED TO S.D. PORT DISTRICT  </P> <P> Breaking the all-white, all-male lock on the San Diego Unified Port District,  the San Diego City Council on Tuesday appointed a black investment-firm  executive and a woman attorney to the wealthy and influential agency that  controls state tidelands around San Diego Bay.  </P> <P> Clifford Graves, former chief administrative officer for San Diego County, and  Lynn Schenk, the only woman ever to head the state Business, Transportation and  Housing Agency, were selected on the second ballot, after they and labor leader  Joseph Francis fell one vote short of the five-vote majority needed for  selection in the first round of voting.  </P> <P> When he takes over Feb. 8, Graves will become the first black on the board  since the tenure of Alois Smith ended in 1980 and only the second appointed in  the agency's 28 years of existence. Schenk will be the third woman to serve on  the seven-member panel and the first since Maureen O'Connor was denied  reappointment to a second term in 1985.  </P> <P> After the vote, Schenk said her top priorities will be the relocation of  Lindbergh Field -- which the Port District controls -- pollution in San Diego  Bay and promoting more opportunity for employment of women and minorities,  including contractors. The Port District has been criticized for a poor record  of hiring Latinos and blacks.  </P> <P> Graves said he wants to begin by examining the balance between tourist-related  industries and commercial and industrial concerns under Port District control.  He added the airport relocation issue and municipal demands for a share of the  port's sizable revenues as top issues.  </P> <P> The appointments end -- for now -- weeks of back-corridor jockeying for the  prestigious posts and satisfy the longstanding demand of minority activists for  representation on the Port District, a demand that grew louder when the panel  last year refused the City Council's request to name the city's new bayfront  convention center for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> The appointment "sends a signal back to blacks and Hispanics, and, with the  appointment of Lynn, to others, that the City Council has heard their concerns  and is responding," Graves told reporters.  </P> <P> "It was time for a change," said Councilman Wes Pratt, who had nominated Graves  for the post.  </P> <P> The choices -- and Francis' showing -- also reflect the substantial shift in  the council's leanings since the defeat of Ed Struiksma and Gloria McColl in  last year's elections. Building industry lobbyist Paul Peterson and former  Councilman Bill Cleator, Establishment candidates who might have expected to be  leading contenders for the Port District posts if last year's moderate to  conservative bloc were still in control, were never really in the running  Tuesday. Cleator did not even show up for Tuesday's public hearing and vote.  </P> <P> But the council still faces two potentially divisive related issues. The  council deferred a decision on which appointee will replace which outgoing port  commissioner, Louis Wolfsheimer and William Rick. Wolfsheimer's term expires  Jan. 2, 1991, less than a year after either Graves or Schenk takes over his  spot. Commissioner William Rick's tenure is scheduled to end Jan. 2, 1993,  giving his replacement a longer first term.  </P> <P> Rick and Wolfsheimer were given special permission by the council to serve  third terms to complete construction of the San Diego Convention Center. Both  agreed at the time of their reappointments that they would step down when the  convention center was completed.  </P> <P> The matter was sent to the council's Rules Committee and could come up Feb. 7,  the same day that the committee is scheduled to discuss whether the council has  the authority to oust W. Daniel Larsen, its third appointee to the seven-  member panel. City Atty. John Witt ruled Friday that the council cannot take  that action without demonstrating misconduct by Larsen, but at least three  council members disagree.  </P> <P> The cities of Coronado, Imperial Beach, National City and Chula Vista each have  one appointee on the Board of Port Commissioners.  </P> <P> With each council member entitled to two votes Tuesday, Graves won his spot  with the support of Ron Roberts, John Hartley, Pratt, Linda Bernhardt and Bob  Filner. Schenk received her five votes from council members Abbe Wolfsheimer,  Roberts, Pratt, Bernhardt and Filner.  </P> <P> Filner cinched Graves' appointment by dropping his first-ballot allegiance to  his nominee, attorney Daniel Guevara, after Guevara received just one vote on  the first round. Roberts provided Schenk's fifth vote on the second round after  casting his first ballot for his nominee, attorney John Davies, who also  received only one vote on the first ballot.  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who had said she would not participate in the vote  because she believes port commissioners should be elected, was attending a U.S.  Conference of Mayors meeting in Washington.  </P> <P> The council's questioning of the eight nominees for the coveted posts was  genteel throughout a hearing that began late Tuesday morning and continued,  after the council's two-hour lunch recess, into the mid-afternoon.  </P> <P> Graves, for example, was not asked about his 1985 resignation from the top  county job under pressure after a major scandal over a telephone contract that  led to the indictment of 13 people, and allegations of mismanagement involving  his appointed department directors.  </P> <P> Schenk's bitter feud with County Supervisor Susan Golding, which culminated in  Schenk winning a $150,000 out-of-court settlement in 1988 of her slander  lawsuit against Golding, never surfaced, either. The 1984 legal action stemmed  from a campaign mailer from Golding about opponent Schenk the day before the  November election in which Golding was first elected to the Board of  Supervisors.  </P> <P> Instead, the hearing served as a summation of the major issues facing the Port  District, including the Lindbergh relocation, pollution of San Diego Bay, the  port's responsiveness to the public, equal opportunity, shared funding, an  expected lawsuit by the convention center contractor and San Diego's ambition  to be a center of international trade.  </P> <P> Most candidates offered little in the way of concrete solutions, stressing  their qualifications and commitment to delve into the issues.  </P></p>

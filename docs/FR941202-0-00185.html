Section 629(a) added section 6327 to title 5, United States Code, to provide employees with an entitlement to 7 days of paid leave each calendar year (in addition to annual and sick leave) to serve as a bone-marrow or organ donor. The law provides that an employee is entitled to use this leave without loss of or reduction in pay, leave to which otherwise entitled, credit for time or service, or performance or efficiency rating. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) does not believe regulations are needed to administer section 6327. Agencies are responsible for notifying employees of this new entitlement to paid leave. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The length of absence for such purposes will vary depending upon the medical circumstances of each case. For medical procedures and recuperation requiring absences longer than 7 days, agencies are encouraged to continue to accommodate employees by granting additional time off in the form of excused absence, accrued sick leave and/or annual leave, as appropriate; leave without pay; and advanced sick and/or annual leave. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 629(b) amended 5 U.S.C. 6307 to permit an employee to use sick leave for purposes related to the adoption of a child. (Conforming technical changes were also made in 5 U.S.C. 6129.) This change was recommended in the Report of the National Performance Review on September 7, 1993. Section 629(b) also directs OPM to prescribe regulations to allow an employee to substitute sick leave retroactively for all or any portion of any annual leave used by an employee for adoption-related purposes between September 30, 1991, and September 30, 1994. (September 30, 1991, was the ending date of the former 1-year experimental program created by Public Law 101&hyph;509 to test the feasibility of granting sick leave for adoption-related purposes.) If an employee elects to make this substitution, the employing agency must adjust the employee's leave accounts to reflect the amount of annual leave and sick leave, respectively, that would remain had sick leave been used instead of all or any portion of the annual leave actually used, as designated by the employee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Sick Leave for Adoption <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OPM's sick leave regulations at 5 CFR 630.401 have been amended to permit employees to use accrued or accumulated sick leave for purposes relating to the adoption of a child. In addition, &sect;630.402 has been revised to require employees to request, to the extent possible, advance approval to use sick leave for adoption-related purposes. This is consistent with current requirements related to the advance approval of sick leave for medical, dental, and optical examination or treatment and to provide care for a family member. When required by the exigencies of the situation, an agency may advance up to 30 days of sick leave for adoption-related purposes under 5 U.S.C. 6307(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purposes of which an adoptive parent may request sick leave include appointments with adoption agencies, social workers, and attorneys; court proceedings; required travel; and any other activities necessary to allow the adoption to proceed. Since adoption procedures and requirements differ among jurisdictions and adoption agencies, the interim regulations do not attempt to specify all of the circumstances in which the use of sick leave would be appropriate. For example, sick leave may be granted for any periods during which an adoptive parent is ordered or required by the adoption agency or by a court to be absent from work to care for the adopted child. Agencies are reminded that this new entitlement to use sick leave for purposes relating to the adoption of a child is in addition to an employee's entitlement to unpaid leave for the placement of a child with an employee for adoption under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;3, February 5, 1993). (See 5 CFR 630.1203.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

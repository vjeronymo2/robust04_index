			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / PM asks DPP to examine notes The director of public prosecutions has been asked by Mr John Major to examine notes of a meeting between the prime minister and an intermediary, who was allegedly acting on behalf of Mr Mohamed Fayed and supplied allegations about payments to MPs. Mr Major disclosed the involvement of the DPP in response to suggestions from Sir Peter Tapsell, a Conservative backbencher, that Mr Fayed should be prosecuted for blackmail. Mr Major told MPs that the unnamed intermediary had made allegations against several ministers, and requested a meeting between the prime minister and Mr Fayed to discuss the Trade and Industry department's critical report into the acquisition of House of Fraser, Harrods' parent company, by Mr Fayed and his brother Ali. The allegations were dismissed by Mr Fayed: 'In my life, I have never authorised anyone to issue an ultimatum on my behalf,' he said. Mr Fayed threatened to sue Sir Peter if he 'repeats his suggestion outside of the Palace of Westminster'. However, he said that in a meeting on September 22 with Mr Ian Greer, the lobbyist who is said to have arranged the payments to MPs on Mr Fayed's behalf, Mr Greer had 'said he could arrange a meeting with the prime minister and offered to do so'. Mr Fayed said he had 'rejected his offer'. Mr Greer last night denied having made such an offer and did not know why Mr Fayed was seeking to implicate him. Quoting from a report by Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary, Mr Major told MPs: 'The informant said that Mr Al-Fayed wanted a meeting with the prime minister, principally because of Mr Al-Fayed's wish to have the DTI inspector's report on the takeover of the House of Fraser revised or withdrawn.' Mr Major said it had been impossible for him to see Mr Fayed in such circumstances. 'If ministers had been guilty of wrongdoing, as Mr Al-Fayed alleged, I was not going to make any sort of deal, regardless of the cost to the government's reputation,' he said. Mr Fayed said he was acutely aware that the DTI report could not be withdrawn or publicly disavowed by the government. Officials said the note of the meeting between Mr Major and the intermediary had been passed to Mrs Barbara Mills, the DPP, 'pretty recently'. Mr Fayed said he had wanted Mr Major to 'know of my experiences (in paying MPs) in order that he could take action against malpractice wherever it exists'.</p>

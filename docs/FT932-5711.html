			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Bund prices slip as hopes fade of lower German rates EUROPEAN government bonds fell back yesterday with Germany leading the decline. The quarter-point slide in bund prices was mainly futures-driven, dealers said, pointing out that many market participants were still on holiday. The fall reflects concern that the Bundesbank will be unable to lower interest rates in the near term, given the poor money supply data released recently. The Bundesbank council is due to hold its regular meeting tomorrow, but dealers do not expect to see signs of easing. At this week's repo, the lowest accepted two-week repo rate is expected to remain unchanged at last week's level of 7.60 per cent. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 94.08, reached a high of 94.22 and then dropped to a low of 93.72. The future picked up a little and traded at 93.83 by late afternoon, on volume of 57,000 contracts. The Bundesbank announced yesterday that the German government was launching a new five-year note, due May 20 1998. Dealers said the news added to supply concerns in the market and led to some flattening in the yield curve. THE fall in Germany helped to pull down other European government bond markets, with French bonds slipping back to close lower on the day. On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the June bond futures contract fell 0.38 to 116.46. The spread between the 10-year OAT and the 10-year bund was unchanged at 38 basis points. The French Treasury announced it would sell between FFr20bn and FFr22bn of new bonds at its monthly auction of OATs tomorrow. AMONG the high-yielding bond markets, Spain fell back as hopes of lower interest rates across Europe subsided and the peseta remained relatively weak. The Meffsa futures contract fell from 88.51 to 88.21. In the Italian market, the bond futures contract slipped despite some favourable news on inflation, with consumer prices rising a provisional 4 per cent higher year-on-year in May after a 4.2 per cent rise in April. The Liffe June BTP contract settled at 99.09 against 99.18 at the previous close. UK government bond prices ended between  1/8 and  1/4 point higher than their previous close, buoyed by speculation of an interest rate cut following last week's sacking of Mr Norman Lamont and the appointment of Mr Kenneth Clarke as chancellor of the exchequer. 'Rumours of base rate cuts gave short-dated gilts a boost,' said Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, adding that the speculation probably contributed to sterling's weakness against the D-Mark and dollar yesterday. The 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 rose  1/4 to trade at 100 21/32 by late afternoon, while the 8 per cent gilt due 2003 rose  5/32 to 99 17/32 . LONG-term US Treasury securities soared yesterday on bullish inflation and employment data that came with a generally weak May purchasing managers' report and a steep fall in gold prices. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 5/16 at 103 3/32 , yielding 6.876 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also firmer, up  3/16 at 99 15/16 , to yield 4.141 per cent. The market opened a busy, holiday-shortened week in a positive mood, due to a National Association of Purchasing Management report which showed its index of manufacturing activity up only slightly to 51.1 in May, and its employment and inflation components both down. The employment number was particularly closely watched, because it could prove a precursor of the May jobs report, due out this Friday. The economic data aside, attention was also fixed on the passage of President Clinton's deficit-reduction package through Congress. Yesterday's early price gains were partly attributed to reports over the weekend that compromises struck between the White House and leading Congressmen had made it more likely that the package would be approved by the Senate. Later in the day, the long end added substantially to its morning gains after gold prices began falling steeply. Treasury investors welcome falling gold prices because they are viewed as a reflection of a brighter inflation outlook. THE yen's continued strength against the US dollar provided support for Japanese government bond prices yesterday, and the market ended slightly firmer. The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB opened at 4.575 per cent and moved to 4.54 per cent before ending at 4.55 per cent. The September futures closed 0.12 higher at 107.18 after rising as high as 107.40. Dealers attributed the market's firmness to the continued rise of the Japanese currency, as the dollar broke through the Y107.00 level and reached a new post-war low of Y106.50 yesterday. THE Dutch finance ministry will go ahead as scheduled to reopen its current tap issue of 30-year 7.5 per cent government bonds tomorrow, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam. Subscription lists for the long bonds in the one-day offering will close at 08.00 GMT, with results of the tender being made public a few hours later. Yesterday previously issued 30-year bonds were changing hands in the secondary market at 102.89 to 103.14 to yield 7.26 to 7.24 per cent. This week's auction will be the fourth of the scheduled six tranches of sales of the 30-year bonds. The most recent issue was on April 1, when the ministry accepted Fl 950m of bids at a price of 104.50 to yield 7.13 per cent. In the first three tranches of the 30-year issues, the government raised Fl 5.45bn of funding. It aims to attract close to Fl 10bn of funding through the entire six tranche tap issue. In total, the government has raised Fl 23.45bn via 30-year, 10-year and 15-year public bonds this year and an unspecified amount via private placements.</p>

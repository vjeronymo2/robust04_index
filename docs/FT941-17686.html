			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Healthcare shares suspended Healthcare Holdings is currently in talks with several parties which may lead to a 'significant corporate transaction' in the first quarter of 1994. At the same time, directors are in talks with the company's secured lenders and certain unsecured creditors regarding a possible restructuring of its obligations. Given the 'substantial impact' the discussions may have upon the company's finances and trading prospects, directors have decided to delay the publication of results for the 18 months ended June 30 last, pending their completion, and have requested a suspension in dealings in the ordinary and preference shares.</p>

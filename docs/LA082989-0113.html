			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPAQ WILL CUT PRICE OF SOME DESKTOP COMPUTERS  </P> <P> Bowing to competitive pressure, Compaq Computer Corp. said Monday that it is  cutting the price of some of its high-end desktop models introduced last year.  </P> <P> The company's decision follows similar price reductions by smaller, rival  manufacturers and lower prices for computer memory chips, analysts said.  </P> <P> Houston-based Compaq is one of the major makers of IBM-compatible computers.  </P> <P> Compaq said it is cutting prices on its higher-end Deskpro 386/25 and its  386/20e machines by 3.5% to 12.5% to maintain their competitive position  against other 80386-based machines.  </P> <P> The price reductions were the first for the Compaq product lines based on the  80386 Intel Corp. microprocessor, one of the fastest processors in the  industry.  </P> <P> "It's just common sense -- they can't live in a vacuum," said Edmund Spelman,  an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "It's obvious that there's a lot more  competition in the 386 chip. I don't think it's a signal that they're seeing  any hidden weakness," he said.  </P> <P> "Last year, we had a very unusual personal computer market, with strong DRAM  (dynamic random access memory) prices, plus exuberant demand, plus conversion  to 386 machines," said Nikko Securities International analyst Michael Geran.  </P> <P> David Wu, an analyst at S. G. Warburg, Rowe &amp; Pitman, Akroyd Inc., said  Compaq's price cuts on most machines were well within the expected yearly  range, with only one, the Deskpro 386/20e, cut more than 12.5%.  </P> <P> "Several off-brand companies started the price moving downhill. When the price  of materials goes down, Compaq usually takes prices down," Wu said. "Prices in  the PC business go down every year."  </P> <P> Analysts also said the new pricing will make the Compaq products more  competitive.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Nearly 60 percent  of the members of Hong Kong's 19 district boards (DB) issued a  joint statement Tuesday [22 February], calling on Governor Chris  Patten to withdraw his political bill already tabled to the  Legislative Council.    The statement was signed by 256 of the 441 members of the 19  district boards, including the chairmen of 18 district boards.    The signatories said in the statement, "we sincerely ask the  governor to take back his political bill already tabled to the  Legislative Council so that the Sino-British talks can be  resumed."    As a result of the termination of the Sino-British talks,  they said, the membership of the three-tier councils can not  straddle 1997. "This would harm Hong Kong's stable transition  and the smooth transfer of power in 1997, we are deeply  concerned about that," they said.    "For the sake of stability and prosperity of Hong Kong in  the  future," the DB members said, "we hope for an early resumption  of Sino-British talks to reach an agreement."    The origin of the statement is to be presented to Governor  Chris Patten, while its copies will be submitted to Chinese Vice  Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his British  counterpart Douglas Richard HUrd as well as other Chinese and  British officials concerned.</p>

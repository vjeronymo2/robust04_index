Japan's International Trade Policy Bureau  [ITPB] recently extended a formal invitation to Huang Yen-chao,  director general of the Board of Foreign Trade [BOFT] in which  it expressed the hope of facilitating unrestricted, two-way  visits and exchanges, and of establishing a pattern for  dialogue. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economic Affairs [MOEA]  has also completed a plan concerning the appropriate tactics  aimed at coping with the possible impact on Sino-Japanese trade  of the ROC's applying for GATT membership. The following is a  report filed by Huang Mei-ting:    [Begin Huang Mei-ting recording] The ROC and Japan have made  very good progress in promoting official contacts on economic  and trade issues following the ROC's vigorous efforts to rejoin  the international community. The level of visiting Japanese  officials increased from the former departmental-head level to  the current ITPB-director level. The two countries recently saw  a new breakthrough in the pattern of their exchanges. The BOFT  under the MOEA said: In the past, the two sides used to hold  annual economic meetings through the Association of East Asian  Relations and the Chinese-Japanese Interchange Association;  however, because of their semiofficial nature, the meetings were  usually more important in form than in substance.    Japan's ITPB recently reached a tacit mutual understanding  with the MOEA's BOFT on mutual visits by ITPB and BOFT directors  at irregular intervals every year for discussions on removing  obstacles to Sino-Japanese trade. Japan's ITPB extended a  formal invitation to BOFT Director General Huang Yen-chao to  [words indistinct] visit Japan this year. This signaled a  breakthrough beyond the former need of ROC officials to stress  the private and informal nature of their visits to Japan.    In addition to the issue of the ROC's trade deficit with  Japan, the ROC's application for GATT membership will also  change the form of trade between the two countries.  Departmental Head Chu Wei-cheng of the BOFT said: The ROC has  completed an assessment of the ranking of priority items for  negotiations with Japan on trade obstacles. Before obtaining  GATT membership, the ROC will still focus its negotiations with  Japan on readjusting the ROC's economic and trade system; after  obtaining GATT membership, we shall then request Japan to scrap  its discriminative measures against us in economic relations and  trade.    [Chu Wei-cheng] Now we must deal with the matter by dividing  it into two aspects. One aspect is our application for GATT  membership. Possibly this is purely a request made of us by the  other side. However, on the other hand, we hope to establish a  channel for consultations to state our requirements to Japan and  to negotiate with it in the future.    [Huang] Departmental Head Chu Wei-cheng said: The  Sino-Japanese trade deficit may very likely increase due to the  cancellation of trade restrictions on the importing of cars and  other goods. The BOFT believes that the fundamental solution to  the problem lies in beefing up the basic materials at home [as  received]. In addition, enhancing the competitiveness of ROC  products in Japan's market by lifting the ban on and increasing  the imports of semifinished products from the mainland and by  implementing a cross-strait division-of-labor system are another  way for the government to reduce its trade deficit with Japan.    This is a report by Huang Mei-ting, Broadcasting Corporation  of China correspondent, at the MOEA. [end recording]</p>

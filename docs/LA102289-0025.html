			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOLL ROAD WARRIOR  </P> <P> "Toll Road Warrior" Bob Poole will never win over the opposition as long as he  continues to deflect his critics with comments such as: What's so bad about  letting "fat cats in their BMWs willingly pay a bunch of extra money to use  their cars?" I happen to be a BMW owner, and I am neither wealthy nor  extravagant, as implied by his remark. I am already paying "a bunch of extra  money" to use my car through higher license fees, higher insurance and higher  maintenance costs, and these are not monies I spend willingly. What makes him  think I would willingly pay to make use of his proposed toll roads? The only  reason I will make use of the toll roads he proposes will be because my time  has a higher value used somewhere other than sitting in stop-and-go traffic on  the freeway. Even then, it will be done unwillingly.  </P> <P> CAROL BAKER, Reseda  </P></p>

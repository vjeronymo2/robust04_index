			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mr. Balladur Withdrew CIP To `Avoid </F> Unnecessary Divisions'"]    [Text] In his first public address since the withdrawal of  his youth wage measure (CIP), Edouard Balladur acknowledged on  Tuesday, 5 April, during the 1930 newscast on France-3  television that there "had been a misunderstanding between some  of the country's youth and the government." He explained that  he had abandoned the measure in order to remain "true to (his)  philosophy" of "fostering unity among the French as much as  possible" and "avoiding any unnecessary divisions."    The prime minister said that he was "worried" by the  violence  which tainted a number of demonstrations and stated that  "resorting to violence in a society is extremely dangerous. In  Paris and a number of other cities, we have witnessed  unacceptable violence for which, incidentally, the vast majority  of young demonstrators were not to blame." He added: "This is  a sign that we now face problems of moral, social, and national  cohesion in our country, in particular in a number of cities,  problems which we must address." Therefore, according to the  prime minister, "together with unemployment and jobs, with  training for young people, the problem of major cities, of  integration into French society and [the promotion of] its  values is a major challenge for our future."    Mr. Balladur also stated that general implementation of the  five-year legislationt [on job creation] will take place "within  a month," after all relevant orders have been published. He  added that he had "requested that, from now on, the people  affected be informed ahead of time, that they be given the  opportunity to voice their opinion, in short, that things be  done as part of a consultation process."</p>

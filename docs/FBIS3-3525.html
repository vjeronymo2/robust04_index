Ningbo, once a renowned trading port from where pottery and  porcelain ware were transported to other countries for over a  thousand years, did not take off again until 1984, when it  became one of the 14 open port cities in China.    Since then the port has been exploiting its advantage in  marine transport and a nearby harbor called Beilun.    Dai Longyue, director of the local committee for foreign  trade, said that an economic and technological development zone  had been quickly set up, followed by a free trade zone.    Imports and exports soared to the present 1.6 billion U.S.  dollars from 50 million in 1988.    Every year, Ningbo holds a number of trade talks and  commodity fairs with businessmen from all over the world. This  helped expand the city's overseas market. Its exports now cover  119 countries and regions, including Arab and African countries.    Last year Ningbo imported goods worth 580 million U.S.  dollars, a 170 percent increase over the year before.    Ningbo has a strong connection with families of overseas  Chinese merchants who went abroad when the city became one of  the country's five open commercial ports after China lost the  Opium War in 1840. Now it is forging ahead to build itself into  "the most important trading port in east China", as charted by  the central government.    It is striving to establish itself as a center connecting  China's interior and the Chang Jiang River regions with the  international market, the official said.    Work is in full swing to enlarge the handling capacity of  the  port.    With the growth of trade, foreign capital also poured in.  Ningbo has 2,088 overseas-funded firms now, with a total  investment of 4.63 billion U.S. dollars.    The Concord Group, a U.S. transnational corporation run by  overseas Chinese, launched a petrochemical project that includes  wharfs, a power plant and other support units.    In using foreign capital, emphasis is given to renovate old  enterprises. As many as 1,262 enterprises have been upgraded so  far. More importantly, such financial aid has turned  inefficient establishments around and thrust them forward to  compete in the world market, said Dai.    The growing contacts with the rest of the world have  rekindled Ningbo people's historic abilities to "venture into  the world and prosper." To date, businessmen from Ningbo,  including ones from rural and private establishments, have  formed 61 firms in 25 countries and regions.    Dai said that a new Ningbo, with better qualified personnel  and sharpened market consciousness, was aiming high to emerge as  a strong competitor on the international market in the near  future.</p>

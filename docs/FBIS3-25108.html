Reacting to reported remarks by the National Peacekeeping  Force [NPKF] commanding officer, Brig Gabriel Ramushwana, that  the NPKF would not be ready for deployment before and during the  April general elections, Gen Holomisa said: "South African  political leaders have no other option but to approach African,  Asian or Western powers for the assembling of a force to keep  peace in South Africa or approach the United Nations Security  Council for the deployment of a UN peace keeping force in the  country while we are still training and sorting out the current  problems of the National Peacekeeping Force."    He added: "We need to send an SOS call to our friends  outside South Africa. If we need their capital for investment  and related assistance, I see no reason why we cannot have  confidence in them when it comes to security matters. What is  needed is to agree on the rules and regulations as to how they  will be involved. The Namibian and Zimbabwean transitional  arrangements can be used as a model."    The general added it was clear the South African Government  had no interest in seeing the NPKF take off. A total of 10,000  soliders for the force was the target "but the RSA [Republic of  South Africa] government saw to it that a mere 3,700 were being  trained for the purpose. This low number cannot even cordon off  Soweto when violence flares up."</p>

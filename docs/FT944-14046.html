			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / East Midlands to pay out Pounds 186m: Special interim dividend of 85p is largest distribution to investors by cash-rich regional electricity groups East Midlands Electricity is to give Pounds 186m back to its shareholders in a special interim dividend payment. The pay-out, which brings to nearly Pounds 1bn the amounts returned to shareholders by privatised electricity companies this year, drew a call from Labour for a government inquiry into 'profiteering'. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'East Midlands consumers have been forced to pay 20 per cent more for their electricity since privatisation and the government and the regulator have done nothing about it.' The Nottingham-based regional distributor is to pay 85p net per share to shareholders who owned their shares before trading started yesterday morning. To offset the effects of this cash outlay - the largest in the sector so far - the company will also consolidate every 25 shares into 22 new ones. East Midlands will retain the right to buy up to 10 per cent of its shares. The plan, which will be put to shareholders on November 18, marks a new departure in the industry's efforts to distribute surplus cash to shareholders. Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, said the payment was more fair than share buy-backs announced by other regional electricity companies. All investors would benefit, he said, rather than just large ones. The special dividend and the share consolidation will also benefit employees who are either outright shareholders or members of savings schemes which confer options to buy shares at a set price in the future. The dividend will carry a tax credit, which means gross funds will be able to reclaim tax, bringing their total receipts to more than Pounds 1 a share. East Midlands' decision was influenced by the new strategy it adopted earlier this year of concentrating on its core business and returning surplus cash directly to shareholders. This followed serious losses on diversification ventures and a top level management upheaval. Mr Rudd said yesterday that the underlying business was strong and generating good cash flows. East Midlands shares fell sharply as the shares immediately went ex-special dividend, closing down 45p at 666p, although analysts said the overall impact should be neutral. But the electricity sector as a whole gained on hopes of pay-outs by other companies. Attention focused particularly on Yorkshire Electricity and Southern Electric, the only two distributors which have not so far bought back shares. Another candidate was Eastern Electricity which completed its buy-back early this year, before the August review by Prof. Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, which set a new price formula for the next five years.

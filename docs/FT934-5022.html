			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Law change to exchange gains The chancellor proposes to change the legislation on foreign exchange gains and losses, introduced in the Finance Act 1993. The changes will allow non-monetary assets to be matched with currency contracts (rather than just borrowings in foreign currency) in determining when exchange differences on the contracts are to be taken into account. They will also extend the rules on currency contracts to cover contracts which provide for net payments rather than an actual exchange of amounts of principal, and enable oil companies which account for their oil and gas related activities in different currencies to compute taxable trading profits by reference to those currencies. The changes will also ensure that, where assets acquired or disposed of by transfer are accounted for under normal accountancy practice by reference to the date of delivery rather than the contract date, this may be followed in calculating exchange gains and losses.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In all of the above cases, the Court's decisions turned on whether energy flowed in interstate commerce as a technical matter. The decisions did not turn on whether the energy flowing in interstate commerce was being sold for resale or was being sold to an end user. However, under FPA section 201(b), the Commission does not have jurisdiction over facilities used in local distribution. In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> CL&amp;P <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Court stated that local distribution facilities are exempt from Commission jurisdiction even if those facilities ``carry no energy except extra-state energy.'' 324 U.S. at 531. The Court rejected the argument that transmission and local distribution facilities could be distinguished by the proportion or amount of interstate energy that they carried:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> We do not find that Congress has conditioned the jurisdiction of the Commission upon any particular volume or proportion of interstate energy involved, and we do not think it would be appropriate to supply such a jurisdictional limitation by construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 324 U.S. at 536. The determination of whether facilities are local distribution facilities remains a factual matter to be decided in the first instance by the Commission.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> See FPC  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Southern California Edison Co.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 376 U.S. 205 (1964).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the precise demarcation between transmission and local distribution remains unclear, and the Commission has not yet definitively addressed this issue, there is nothing in the statute, its legislative history, or the case law to indicate that the Commission's jurisdiction over rates, terms and conditions of transmission in interstate commerce extends only to wholesale transmission and not retail transmission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) Treatment of Retail Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the Commission has jurisdiction over the rates, terms and conditions of both wholesale and retail transmission services in interstate commerce by public utilities, arguably it may allow retail stranded cost recovery in rates for either wholesale or retail transmission services. There nevertheless may be important legal or policy reasons to exclude retail stranded costs from transmission rates. As noted earlier, however, the Commission has been presented only with the question of whether it should permit public utilities to seek recovery in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> wholesale  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> transmission rates of stranded investment costs incurred to serve former retail customers (Scenario 2, section III.A.). The Commission has not been presented with the question of whether it should permit public utilities to seek recovery in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> retail  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> transmission rates of stranded costs incurred to serve the customer when it was a retail customer (Scenario 3, section III.A.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While we believe the Commission has the authority to address retail stranded costs through its jurisdiction over the rates, terms and conditions of interstate transmission services used by retail or newly-created wholesale customers, we also believe that the recovery of the costs of transition to competition at the retail level is a matter that should be addressed by State authorities. This is because retail stranded costs will occur primarily as a result of State and local decisionmaking regarding retail franchise areas and the creation of new wholesale entities. In particular, the Commission believes it is incumbent upon states to deal with the consequences of stranded costs that occur as a result of retail wheeling. Our strong policy preference is that states explicitly address the issue. State and local decisionmakers have a first-hand understanding of the regulatory bargain with respect to stranded costs incurred to serve retail customers, and they are familiar with the planning, investment and purchase activities of the utilities they regulate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are a number of procedural mechanisms which we believe States can use to address retail stranded costs. For example, a State that permits a retail franchise customer to become a wholesale entity may consider whether to impose an exit fee prior to, or as a condition of, creating the wholesale entity. Similarly, a State may consider whether to require payment of an exit fee prior to a franchise customer being permitted to obtain unbundled retail wheeling. In situations in which local distribution facilities are used by a retail wheeling customer, the State may consider whether to allow recovery of stranded costs through rates for local distribution services. If a State decides not to impose exit fees, or a surcharge through distribution rates, it may consider whether to allow recovery of stranded costs from remaining customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In situations in which a new wholesale entity obtains ownership or control of a franchise utility's transmission or distribution facilities, it is possible that State condemnation proceedings will provide a forum for a utility to seek recovery of any stranded costs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> What types of payments, if any, do new municipal utilities make to prior service providers? Do these reimbursements allow for recovery of stranded generation costs? Is there variation among the States as to the legal ability of local entities to municipalize? Is there variation among the States as to the payments made by new municipal utilities to previous suppliers?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There may, of course, be other mechanisms which States can use to determine whether to allow stranded cost recovery, and from whom to allow recovery. The Commission solicits comments on what other mechanisms might be used, and whether these mechanisms are adequate to deal with retail stranded costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While our strong preference is for States to address retail stranded costs in whatever way they deem appropriate, we are willing to explore whether there are circumstances under which this Commission should consider claims for recovery of retail stranded costs. We will therefore present two proposed alternatives regarding retail stranded costs, and seek comment on both.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, as noted above, we express no preference in favor of either alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

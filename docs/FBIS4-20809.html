			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague March 18 (CTK) -- The Immunology and  Microbiology Institute based in Techonin, East Bohemia, has  focused only on the defence research of the regulation of  immunite reactions and of anti-viral and immunomodulative  preparations, not on bacteriological weapons, Professor Josef  Fusek told CTK today.    Fusek, the rector of the Military Medical Academy, to which  the Techonin institute belongs, was reacting to articles  published by the Czech press on Thursday [17 March] and today,  according to which the institute developed dangerous species of  bacteria and viruses destined for the production of biological  weapons.    The right-leaning daily CESKY DENIK reports that such  substances have been stored in several places in the Czech  Republic.    "Biological weapons have never been developed, produced or  stored here. The institute was not constructed for such  activities. The institute has never been asked to do such  work," Fusek said.    The Czech Republic has fulfilled -- without exception -- the  convention which bound it not to develop, produce or store  chemical weapons. The premises of the mentioned institute were  opened to an international inspection in May 1990, he stressed.    Fusek also dismissed the allegation by CESKY DENIK that  germs  of cholera, plague and other dangerous substances were used in  the institute.    The Czech Defence Ministry has not so far commented on the  issue, which, according to a ministry spokesperson, will be  taken up at a ministry press conference today.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Tribunal told of 'cover-up' on forex deals Concerns raised by a London bank officer when she was asked to destroy suspicious foreign exchange deal notes went unheeded by management, an industrial tribunal was told yesterday.

She had been given a formal warning for carrying out unauthorised money transfers from her own account at the bank. Ms Humphreys said she made the transactions without knowing it was against bank procedures.

She had also informed the then finance director Mr Jeremy Lowry, who has since left the bank. She said she was told by foreign exchange dealers to destroy deal confirmation notes because the deals had been cancelled.

After the hearing, he said he referred Ms Humphreys to Mr Lowry as the appropriate person to deal with her concerns. 'It had absolutely no relevance to her dismissal case.'</p>

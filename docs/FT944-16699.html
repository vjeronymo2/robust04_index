			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Observer: If only. . . Observer doesn't want to deflate yesterday's excellent figures from Barings. But they could have been better if it had played its cards right. Some time ago Jardine Matheson, the ancient Hong Kong trading house, was looking for a partner for a new Hong Kong merchant bank. Apparently, Barings was offered the chance but let the idea slip. Robert Fleming stepped in. For a total investment of less than Pounds 1m, Fleming now owns a half share in the Far East's most profitable merchant bank. Jardine Fleming today contributes about 40 per cent of Fleming's total profits, which were more than double those of Barings last year.</p>

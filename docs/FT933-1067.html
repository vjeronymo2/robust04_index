The three divisions generated Dollars 808.6m in revenues in 1991-92. In a surprise move, Ralston added several other marginal businesses to the spin-off package, which it had proposed last month. These include two Colorado ski resorts, Breckenridge and Keystone. The spin-off is subject to US government approval.</p>

The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving a fishery management plan or amendment, immediately publish a notice that the fishery management plan or amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments received during the comment period in determining public comments received during the comment period in determining whether to approve the FMP or amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment 32 would establish a plan to rebuild stocks of the rockfish Pacific ocean perch (POP) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sebastes alutus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). POP is a highly valued groundfish. It was heavily exploited by a foreign trawl fleet from the early 1960's until the mid-1980's. Thereafter, a domestic at-sea processing fleet harvested POP at a substantially lower rate. Catches of POP peaked in 1965 when an estimated 350,000 metric tons (mt) were harvested by the foreign fleet; catches declined sharply in the late 1960's. From 1961&hyph;1977, annual POP landings averaged over 40,000 mt; after 1977, landings averaged 6,000 mt. In the domestic fishery, POP was managed as part of a larger slope rockfish assemblage of about 20 species until 1991, when POP was established as a separate target species category to prevent possible overfishing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of increased concern about the status of POP stocks, biomass assessment methodology has been improved and domestic harvest levels have been reduced. The 1993 total allowable catch (TAC) of 2,560 mt was available only as incidental catch in other groundfish fisheries. In recent years POP has been managed as a single species, harvest levels have been reduced, and directed fisheries have been restricted or eliminated. In spite of this conservative management in recent years, POP biomass has increased only slightly and remains depressed from historic levels. The current spawner biomass of about 71,000 mt is estimated to be 15&hyph;20 percent of the level observed during the 1960's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council believes that increasing the biomass of POP to a level closer to historical amounts is necessary to achieve optimum yield in the POP fishery. Factors other than fishing mortality contribute to the continued depressed state of the POP resource. Ecosystem changes or other biological factors may preclude rebuilding success. Nevertheless, the Council considers minimizing POP mortality necessary to maximize the probability of rebuilding success in a realistic time period. Additionally, decreasing POP mortality should minimize resource waste associated with low TACs that do not fully accommodate incidental catch needs of existing fisheries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

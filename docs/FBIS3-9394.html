			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus by Ivo Slavik </F> in Bratislava on 16 March: "The Third Way Is a Chimera"]    [Text] [Slavik] What kind of economic policies does your  government intend to give priority to?    [Filkus] We need to swiftly stabilize the macrosphere. We  have to abandon the idea that there is a third way toward the  market. We have slowed down privatization in Slovakia by our  speculations about a third way. Because we have already taken  steps associated with a restrictive macroeconomic policy of a  budgetary and monetary character, we cannot fall back. We have  to continue to liberalize prices and to maintain our currency's  internal convertibility. It is also necessary to speed up and  depoliticize privatization, mainly because it was used as a  means of concentrating political power. We have to prepare the  second wave of coupon privatization by fall, at the latest. The  economic microsphere appears to be the most risky area. The  enterprises are surviving on their equity and not from the fact  that they are efficient. The necessary changes are again  associated with speeding up privatization.    We will try to establish and develop the, to date, small  capital market. That is, we should improve the microsphere by  means of the capital market. Of course, there are also  matter-of-fact problems that can be resolved by restructuring,  but not the kind that would be undertaken by the center. The  microsphere must also be supported, to a substantial degree, by  the influx of foreign capital.    [Slavik] Was the recently introduced import surcharge really  necessary?    [Filkus] This is a normal instrument of a market economy.  It is intended to protect the domestic market. The market left  open, however, should be filled by domestic products. Other  systemic measures also have to be put into effect for this,  though. If they are not put into effect, the consumer would pay  more and more for goods, regardless of the surcharge.    [Slavik] There are rumors about state property being looted  by the previous government. Is this true?    [Filkus] Many privatization projects were approved with  unusual speed during the past three government sessions.    [Slavik] According to some deputies, they were on the verge  of legality. Is the successor government going to investigate  them?    [Filkus] Yes. Such a proposal has already been made in  parliament. Before we address the citizens, we have to take  inventory and tell them under what conditions we are taking over  the economy.    [Slavik] Could the split within the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] continue?    [Filkus] Everything suggests that the process of dissolution  is continuing. It was recently announced that the leadership of  the HZDS Deputies' Club is again being changed.    [Slavik] Do you think Vladimir Meciar will win again in the  early elections?    [Filkus] No. I am convinced of this.    [Slavik] What do you think of the reactions by the police  following the assault on certain journalists by demonstrators?    [Filkus] I condemn them. If this was intended as a test of  the police officers and their commanders, it was a complete  failure.</p>

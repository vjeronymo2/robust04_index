			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Where to get the most for your money  -Worried about falling interest rates and lower income? / A look at the options for the best return on your capital GENERATING income has become a tough business for those who rely on their savings. The era of low interest rates might be good for borrowers but the effect of the drop in base rates from 15 per cent in 1990 to 6 per cent now has battered savers' incomes. While they can take some comfort from the fall in inflation they are still having to pay more for goods and services out of less income. The prospect of a further base rate cut this year will shrink their savings pot further. The easiest (and safest) way to earn income from 1988-92, when base rates were 10 per cent or more, was to leave money in a high-interest account at a reputable bank or building society. But savers in search of high income now have to work harder and take more risk for lower returns. Financial institutions have produced a succession of ever more complicated high-income packages. The main danger for investors is that they may not know all the risks involved, particularly that capital may be eroded to provide income. Broadly, the choice is between deposits, bonds and equity-based products. You can also choose between fixed or variable rates. While the former give protection against a further drop in rates, usually they do not offer the highest returns and mean that investors lose out if interest rates rise. If you want monthly income, the choice is more limited, and the rates usually are lower than for annual rates. CASH-BASED DEPOSITS Bank and building society accounts These are convenient but, to get the highest rates, you need a minimum of at least Pounds 10,000. The highest rates are shown in the table provided by Moneyfacts on page VI; this includes a section on monthly rates. Postal accounts usually offer the highest interest rates. Bradford &amp; Bingley's Direct Notice postal account will pay 7.5 per cent gross on a Pounds 10,000 minimum and 7.75 per cent on Pounds 25,000 and above. Chelsea building society is promising to hold the rate of 9 per cent gross (or 8.65 monthly) until October 1 on a minimum deposit of Pounds 10,000 in its Premier VIII account. The money must be left in until September 30 1995, although withdrawals are allowed subject to 30 days' notice and a penalty of 45 days' interest. Offshore accounts These offer income gross, which is useful for non-taxpayers, and often pay rates which are fractionally higher than those onshore. Taxpayers usually can delay payment of tax. On a minimum of Pounds 10,000, Woolwich International (Guernsey) will pay 6.5 per cent gross compared with 5.6 per cent gross on its onshore Prime Gold account; both offer instant access. Cash unit trusts These invest in the money markets, where money is bought and sold for short periods by institutions and rates change daily. Yields are quoted net of charges. The main advantage is that a higher rate is paid on a lower minimum than can easily be found at bank or building societies. Speed of access is similar to a postal account. Fidelity's cash trust has a yield of 5.4 per cent gross on a minimum of Pounds 1,000; the yield on a Pounds 2,000 minimum minimum on Govett's MIS cash fund is 5.1 per cent gross. Prudential's Cash Haven yields 4.7 per cent gross on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. There is a chequebook attached to the Fidelity trust for those who keep a balance of Pounds 5,000 (cheques must be for a minimum of Pounds 250). Non-taxpayers should be aware that income is paid net, so tax has to be reclaimed. National Savings NS income bonds pay monthly interest at a variable rate, now 7 per cent gross. The minimum purchase is Pounds 2,000 up to a maximum holding of Pounds 50,000. You will need to give at least three months' notice to cash them and only half the rate of interest will be paid on a bond cashed in the first year. BONDS Gilts These IOUs issued by the government offer a fixed return for a set period. They can be bought through the National Savings stock register at post offices and income is usually paid twice a year. There is no capital risk to an investor who buys a newly-issued gilt and holds it to maturity, but gilts are tradeable and you might not be able to match the price you paid when you sell. Many are trading above face value, so you would make a capital loss if you held them until maturity. Gilts are exempt from CGT but you will will not be able to offset any capital losses against gains elsewhere. Redemption yields vary between 5.1 per cent at the short end to 8.2 per cent at the long. Bond funds Many investors may prefer to buy gilts through a bond fund to take the worry out of buying the right gilt at the right time. Bond funds are unit trusts investing in gilts and other fixed-interest securities. But if a fund has a very high yield, it is likely to be eating up the capital. CGT can be charged on profits from bond funds, unlike gilts bought directly. You will have to pay for the service, although some funds have been cutting the initial charge of 5-6 per cent. The annual management fee is in the region of 1 per cent. The fund with the highest yield at the beginning of July was Eagle Star's UK Preference &amp; Fixed Interest trust (8.8 per cent gross), but it was ranked 51 out of 55 for one-year performance, according to Micropal. The largest fund, Barclays Unicorn Gilt &amp; Fixed Interest trust, with an 8.2 per cent gross yield, was ranked 13 over the year to July 1. International bond funds offer more choice of investments and have the additional element of currency plays (which also makes them riskier than UK bond funds), but yields are lower than for UK funds. Perpetual's Global fund is top of its sector over the year to July 1 with a yield of 6.2 per cent gross, according to Micropal. Offshore bond funds are similar to international bonds funds but are based outside the UK. They pay income gross and this can be rolled up for tax planning purposes. Permanent interest bearing shares Despite their name, these fixed-interest instruments are more like bonds than shares, since they are issued by building societies to raise capital. They carry no redemption date, so investors must sell them to get their cash and thus will receive the prevailing market price. The greater risk of buying a bond from a building society rather than the government is reflected in their relative high yields. These are between 9.5 per cent gross for Halifax (Pounds 50,000 minimum investment) to 10.96 per cent for First National. Interest is paid twice yearly net of basic-rate tax and gains are not liable to CGT (unless held in a collective fund). EQUITY INVESTMENTS Unit and investment trusts The yield on the FT All-Share is around 4 per cent gross but collective funds can offer much higher yields. Split capital investment trusts divide the capital growth and income of the trust between different classes of shares. In March, Schroder launched its Split fund with an 8 per cent gross yield on the income shares after charges. Take advice before investing in income shares because there are different types. In February, Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial launched a unit trust with an eye-catching yield of 10 per cent a year after charges. The Higher Income plan uses options to earn a higher income, but at the expense of capital growth. Guaranteed equity bonds Three new products offer high income but the risk again is of capital erosion. Life Association of Scotland offers 10.1 per cent net, paid quarterly for five years; Save &amp; Prosper's High Income bond promises a guaranteed income of either 8 per cent net or 10 per cent net;, while Acuma, the financial planning arm of American Express, has a choice of rates on its Fixed High Income bond of 10, 9 and 7.5 per cent. You will be paid back a proportion of your original investment after five years but, in order for the whole amount to be returned, the stock market will have had to have rise by a defined amount. Annuities The aim is to convert capital into income, but with some interest on top. You pay a life office or friendly society a fixed sum in return for regular monthly payments for the rest of your life (or for a fixed period in the case of a temporary annuity). The amounts paid depend on your sex and age. In general, annuities offer better value the older you are and the longer you live, since any capital which is left on your death will be kept by the life office. Annuity rates have been falling - see page IV. Guaranteed income bonds You pay a lump sum to a life office and get a fixed income for a specified period. At the end of the period, your capital is returned to you. Rates paid depend on the amount invested and the length of time the capital is to be tied up, as the Highest Rates table on page VI shows.</p>

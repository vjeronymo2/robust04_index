			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MADONNA: ONE STEP OVER THE LINE  </P> <P> I am 23 years old and have been a Madonna fan since she first arrived on the  scene, but after having seen her recent "Blond Ambition" tour in Los Angeles, I  am outraged.  </P> <P> Madonna has always been known for her image of sexual promiscuity; however, in  her current tour she has managed to step over the line between sexually  suggestive and sexually explicit.  </P> <P> I am concerned about the 10-year-old girls who idolize Madonna and use her as a  role model.  </P> <P> I feel that the public has a right to be forewarned of explicit sexual acts  that take place at concerts such as Madonna's. It seems strange to me that you  must be 17 to enter an R-rated movie, yet a child can walk into a Madonna  concert and see her have simulated intercourse with her bed.  </P> <P> MARY E.

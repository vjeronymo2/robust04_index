			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Glimmer of hope for Ukraine On the face of it, Ukraine's presidential elections are following a depressingly familiar pattern. In the past year, the country has experienced higher levels of inflation than any in the former eastern bloc and a sharp fall in production. But the vast majority of voters in the first round of the elections on Sunday still chose two candidates from the former communist old guard. The front runners, who will face each other in a run-off ballot next month, are President Leonid Kravchuk, a former party ideology secretary, and Mr Leonid Kuchma, the one-time missile factory director who served as prime minister for most of last year. Neither has demonstrated that he understands what building a modern economy requires. Mr Kravchuk, who has led Ukraine since independence in 1991, has preferred to focus on the political struggle to consolidate Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of perceived Russian threats. Mr Kuchma's dalliance with reform was brief, and ended in something close to hyperinflation. Uninspiring as the economic record of the two contenders is, however, all is not yet lost. Indeed, there is now a chance that whoever is elected will be forced by the depth of Ukraine's economic crisis to follow in the steps of Russia's prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin. Like Mr Kuchma, the Russian leader learnt about economics as a Soviet factory manager. But when left in undisputed charge of the Russian economy he had no alternative but to persevere with a tough macroeconomic strategy and tight monetary and fiscal controls. Scathingly critical Ukrainians are neither blind nor apathetic: nearly 70 per cent turned out at the polls and voters were often scathingly critical of their government even as they cast their ballots. One reason Ukrainians may have chosen to entrust their government to a member of the old guard is that they are finding that the state is not as all-powerful as it was. Like grass pushing through concrete, a private economy is emerging despite the best efforts of the government to keep it under ground. According to official data, which do not fully reflect the growing shadow economy, the private sector accounted for 30 per cent of GNP in the first quarter of this year. Many people have simply opted out of the official economy. The average salary is about Dollars 10 a month and in many enterprises and institutions has not been paid at all for the past two or three months. Even the IMF describes the credit squeeze as draconian. It is leading to the effective privatisation of many public services as officials who are formally civil servants demand private payment for their services. Despite this, relying on garden plots and private commerce, most Ukrainians are better fed and dressed than ever. Promising aspect The ability of Ukrainians to survive despite their bad government does not absolve the next president of responsibility. The promising aspect of this election is that both candidates appear at last to be implicitly acknowledging this fact, in two ways. First, Ukraine's dispute with Russia - too often used by politicians as an alibi for their failure to deal with the economic crisis - may be becoming less relevant. Even Mr Kuchma, whom some have painted as Russia's candidate, has emphasised his commitment to preserve Ukraine's sovereignty. Both candidates, and the electorate, appear to have realised that, on its own, independence is no guarantee of economic prosperity, and that reunion with Russia, even if it were possible or desired by the voters, would also be no panacea. Second, both presidential candidates are now at least promising a government which stops thwarting the initiative of its people. The immediate challenge for the victor will be to provide macroeconomic discipline and initiate the structural reforms needed to underpin a market economy. That means demonstrating the will to contain inflation by resisting the temptation to issue fresh credits to loss-making factories and other state institutions. Whichever candidate is elected should be aware that a constituency for market reform now exists. A more prosperous and confident electorate at the next elections will punish any leader who fails to understand this.</p>

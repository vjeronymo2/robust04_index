			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, February 14 (TANJUG) -- Several parties  from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on Monday strongly  condemned the NATO threats to bomb Serb positions in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, pointing out that this would jeopardize the  search for a peaceful solution to the crisis in this former  Yugoslav republic.    President of the opposition parliamentary Democratic Party  Zoran Djindjic said that the NATO ultimatum "is contrary to U.N.  Security Council resolutions and dangerously threatens the peace  process" in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Speaking at a meeting in Knjazevac, a town in southeastern  Serbia, Djindjic assessed that it was evident that the ultimatum  did not have any humanitarian or security foundations, but was  primarily a tool to "pressure the Serb negotiators in Geneva."    "Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must join the  efforts to oppose this dangerous and irresponsible policy of the  NATO pact," he said.    The League of Communists-Movement for Yugoslavia most  sharply  condemns the by-passing of the U.N. in seeking a solution for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, said a statement released by the party,  assessing that the ultimatum was a "threat to all small peoples  and states if they do not bow to the will of the mighty."    "As in World War II, the Communists will place themselves at  the head of the battle against any foreign aggressor and in the  interest of the people they will resolutely oppose Western  military powers and all supporters of the civil war in former  Yugoslavia," said the statement.    The Democratic Party of Yugoslavia sent an appeal to all  warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina to see reason and opt for  compromise and agreement by easing tensions at all points.    The Party of Serb Unity warned that peace could not be  achieved with threats and ultimatums.    "If only one bomb falls on Serb positions and homes in  Bosnia, the Party of Serb Unity will put into operation its  military agreement with the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia  and call Russian volunteers to stand in the defence of the  Christian Orthodox religion, side by side with their Serb  brethren," said a party statement.</p>

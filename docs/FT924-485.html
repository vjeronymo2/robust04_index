			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / As they say in Europe . . .: Fear of towels on deckchairs - James Morgan considers Anglo-German attitudes THERE would be no traditional English Christmas were it not for the Germans. Prince Albert has a lot to answer for by smuggling in trees, cards and carols in his baggage. The English still live too much in the shadow of the Tannenbaum, a tree strewn with goodies but also a dark conifer that sheds sinister needles to prick the English into spasms of hostility. Germany is either an object lesson or a series of highly charged negative symbols. That latter cross is one that Germans have to bear universally. In Britain, though, the Germans attract uncritical admiration, even for their stupidities. Thus subsidies for British coalmines, which may or may not be rational, are justified by the colossal sums that the Germans waste in similar projects. Germany can throw billions away on a not very good railway system and this is used to berate Whitehall's attitude to British Rail. Germans study British Rail to see how to run a reasonably economical system. Germany can spend twice as much per head as Britain on its health service and land up with results that are often inferior. So it is that Germany appears in British eyes as a kind of Manichean conflict within itself. Good and evil fight it out between Rhine and Oder. And that disturbs the Germans: they are regularly infuriated not just by the references to jackboots and swastikas but note also the British view that every deckchair in every resort from Benidorm to Barbados is covered by a German towel by 8am. Even the London correspondent of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Bernhard Heimrich, could not forebear to mention this curious belief when he gave his readers an long account of British attitudes at about the time of the Queen's state visit in October. He was more intrigued by the number of people in British public life who wrote novels and the dominance of German themes in historical fantasies. Not only was there Len Deighton's SS-GB and Robert Harris' Fatherland but also the 1986 novel by the noted parliamentary Euro-rebel Michael Spicer - Prime Minister Spy. In this work, the inhabitant of No 10, Rupert Higginson, turns out to be the bastard son of Adolf Hitler and a vegetarian cook - 'conceived in a moment of non-culinary pleasures of the flesh in the Fuhrerbunker', apostrophised Heimrich delicately. His piece was called Angst auf dem Sandbank, a reference to Erskine Childers' The Riddle of the Sands, which was published in 1903. (Just one of the many works of this type which have never been published in Germany.) Heimrich noted - this was in October - that: 'The British Teuton-genre, whose leitmotiv was freshened up in the latest strife (with the Bundesbank) by the shrill colours of the prole-press, is older than Hitler's war, even older than the first war.' Now, since this was for a German audience, considerable pyscho-analytical insight was needed. When Childers wrote his book, 'Freud's free association method was scarcely ten years old, but 'sands' is really the most striking word the author and his readers could have come across. It expresses the inimitably British mixture of security and threat: the self-confidence of an island nation which is protected by the sea, and which simultaneously feels vulnerable to seaborne attack and coastal erosion.' The conclusion is that in this type of book the British are not really concerned about the past or historical might-have-beens. In Heimrich's eyes, the obsessional nature of the relationship with the German threat represents fear of the future and of the truth. For example, the information released last summer about the flight of Hitler's deputy, Rudolf Hess, to Britain in 1942 sparked speculation in Britain about there having been some double game between London and Berlin. This episode parallels French concern about collaboration under the Vichy regime. But of course, notes Heimrich, in Britain the truth will not be known until well into the next millennium because of governmental secrecy. The next item for legitimate speculation is why the Germans are so concerned about the curiosities of their image in British eyes. It is not just that it hurts. I am firmly of the belief that the analysis of the role of the British 'Teuton Myth' in forming the contemporary German psycho-syndrome could provide the subject matter for another productive essay. But it will not come from my pen. There was, however, an odd illustration of Anglo-German attitudes at the Edinburgh Summit. A German TV correspondent asked his British technician to save him a chair. 'You'd better put a towel over it,' said the Brit. The German understood immediately. 'I don't have one here.' 'I'll give you one for Christmas.' James Morgan is diplomatic correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

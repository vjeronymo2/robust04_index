			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Japan sends warning on attempted coercion JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission yesterday warned leading banks and brokers it would closely monitor their entry into new business areas to ensure there were no violations of anti-monopoly laws. The FTC, issuing its first guidelines for the financial industry, warned that banks must not use their influence with corporate clients to coerce them to do business with a new securities subsidiary. The warning also applies to brokers opening a trust banking subsidiary. Commission officials and many brokers are concerned that leading banks will be able to coax their customers to ensure the new subsidiaries will have a steady stream of business, but it will be up to the FTC to distinguish between coaxing and coercing. The FTC said anti-monopoly laws would be violated if a parent bank provided services to a customer on the understanding that the customer would use its new broking subsidiary. Attempts to prevent a customer from doing business with a competitor would be a violation. The FTC is likely to demand information from banks and brokers establishing subsidiaries to ensure that the structure complies with the financial reform legislation. The commission will have difficulty tracing informal links among Japanese corporate groups which help determine choices. Some bank customers will feel an obligation to shift bond business to a new subsidiary.</p>

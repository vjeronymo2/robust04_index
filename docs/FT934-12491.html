			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Choosing between Germany and France Investors plumped for Europe last week; according to the FT-Actuaries World Indices, it showed a gain of 2.8 per cent in local currency terms, and 7.1 per cent for October so far. This compared with a rise of 1.1 per cent in Japan and a fall of 1.4 per cent in the US. Hong Kong had an average performance after starring with a gain of 8.6 per cent in the week before; Mexico relieved the North American tedium with a rise of 4.3 per cent. The European week started well and took off again on Thursday when the German Bundesbank cut its discount and Lombard rates - the French equity market reacted most obviously, with the CAC-40 index ahead 2.3 per cent on the day. Germany picked up on Friday, but trailed on the week. That set the stage for the renewal of the argument over which senior bourse to choose for recovery, Paris or Frankfurt. A top German equity salesman says that German institutions had been sceptical and English fund managers uninterested in German stocks, but that US investors were pouring money into the Frankfurt bourse. Goldman Sachs looked at what it called the 'French-German conundrum' towards the end of last week: Mr Sushil Wadhwani and Mr Mushtaq Shah said that, on most measures, the French equity market was significantly under-valued and the German market overpriced. 'If interest rates were to fall to the 5 per cent area over, say, the next nine months in both countries, then,' they said, 'we could be very surprised if French equities did not significantly outperform the German market on a 12 to 15-month horizon.' Nomura's Mr Nicholas Knight, however, maintains his support for the UK, and gold: 'The German and French equity markets have been looking for rate cuts all year,' he says; 'this development is in the price, and it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change   % change in                 % change in local currency**      sterling** USDollars**              1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year   Start of   Start of     Start of                                          1993       1993        1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +2.68   +10.61   +29.96   +32.68     +31.48      +27.91 Belgium       +0.61    +7.82   +25.85   +23.05     +16.00      +12.86 Denmark       +2.76    +6.70   +40.12   +36.78     +31.27      +27.72 Finland       +3.78   +15.27  +141.23   +97.00     +84.03      +79.04 France        +3.91    +6.06   +31.65   +23.54     +19.91      +16.67 Germany       +2.67    +9.64   +35.60   +33.44     +32.62      +29.02 Ireland       +3.25    +6.69   +56.03   +46.44     +30.44      +26.90 Italy         +2.21    -0.13   +57.44   +41.77     +33.28      +29.65 Netherlands   +3.91    +9.94   +36.70   +33.13     +32.18      +28.60 Norway        +3.27   +10.81   +53.15   +40.12     +36.57      +32.87 Spain         +3.22   +10.52   +58.43   +45.59     +28.02      +24.55 Sweden        +1.74    +8.93   +83.68   +40.87     +27.13      +23.68 Switzerland   +3.05    +9.18   +41.61   +30.16     +32.92      +29.32 UK            +2.46    +5.92   +23.09   +13.94     +13.94      +10.85 EUROPE        +2.80    +7.15   +33.42   +24.62     +22.48      +19.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     -0.67    +5.53   +36.54   +27.61     +27.70      +24.24 Hong Kong     +0.91   +16.09   +32.97   +56.68     +61.13      +56.76 Japan         +1.10    +2.69   +29.08   +26.96     +50.58      +46.50 Malaysia      +1.73   +14.41   +80.80   +72.31     +81.87      +76.95 New Zealand   +1.03    +8.84   +63.20   +41.21     +57.40      +53.14 Singapore     -1.40   +12.13   +77.31   +46.92     +57.49      +53.23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        -0.23    +5.83   +19.30   +16.65     +16.87      +13.71 USA           -1.37    +0.95   +11.60    +6.08      +9.04       +6.08 Mexico        +4.30   +10.46   +28.70   +11.77     +15.20      +12.08  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  -0.98    +5.53   +32.56   +23.93     +47.15      +43.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +0.53    +3.64   +23.28   +18.02     +25.10      +25.11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on October 22nd 1993.

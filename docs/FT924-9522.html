			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Community seeks companies' skills, not cash: Chris Tighe reports from a disadvantaged North Shields estate that wants business on tap, not on top THE WINDOWS of the Cedarwood drop-in centre on North Shields' Meadowell estate are stained white from anti-graffiti solvent and clouded with damp from the washing spinning in the machine in an adjacent corridor. The handleless door of the meeting room has to be held shut to prevent an invasion of shrieking toddlers, but the concentration of the senior businessmen inside is unbroken. With a combined annual turnover totalling many billions of pounds, they went last week to the Meadowell estate at the invitation of Prince Charles, Business in the Community's president, to discover the corporate benefits and practical difficulties of business involvement with the community. The Tyneside visit was one of 16 'Seeing is Believing' trips run this year by BIC, founded to encourage companies to make community involvement an integral part of successful business practice. Many trips take high-flying executives to deprived areas they would never otherwise see. The visit to the Meadowell estate, scene of riots last September, was amiable, not confrontational. Some executives chuckled when Mrs Kath Thompson, one of the residents doggedly working to improve the estate, smilingly suggested a model for companies' involvement in the community: 'on tap, not on top'. They murmured assent when the visit's leader - Mr Richard Maudslay, managing director of Rolls-Royce's Industrial Power Group - spoke of businesspeople's fear that community involvement just means being asked for money. Mr Maudslay's message, echoed throughout the trip, was that business has much else, in skills, resources, knowhow and influence, to contribute to the community. A variation on that theme came from the Rev David Peel, the Cedarwood Centre's project leader: 'You can do things to people, for people or with people; we try to do things with people.' BIC trips are rich in contrasts. Among the visitors to south Meadowell's streets of boarded-up, vandalised houses was Mr Henry Clarke, deputy chief executive of The Crown Estate, which includes such upmarket addresses as Pall Mall and St James's in London. Treasury deputy secretary Mr Michael Scholar, responsible for the pay and conditions of 580,000 civil servants, listened attentively as a local employer explained the 'benefits trap', which makes some residents poorer if they take a job. Mr Maudslay spoke of the 'terrible culture clash' when executives, keyed up by recession and redundancies to make every minute count, tried to cope with unstructured meetings attended by unemployed people with endless time. The visitors, who will report back to Prince Charles at a seminar next month, left Meadowell thoughtful but not despairing. The enthusiasm of residents such as Mrs Thompson impressed many. Mr Mark Higson, operations director of Courtaulds subsidiary International Paint, said: 'I'm fairly shocked by the state of Meadowell but I'm very struck by the idea (that) business needs to offer practical help, not a cheque book.' Several believed that lack of work was the root of Meadowell's ills.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: First quarter loss of Pounds 8.9m for BOC - Pounds 85m provision for restructuring programme which will take three years to complete BOC Group fell into loss in the first quarter of its financial year as the result of an Pounds 85m provision against restructuring. The charge, announced to shareholders last month, left a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.9m for the quarter. BOC's shares rose initially on relief that the figures were not worse - some analysts had forecast a pre-tax loss of more than Pounds 10m, but they closed down 17p at 681p. The company warned that pressures on profit margins in industrial gases would remain strong until economic recovery in its markets gathered strength. Nor was there any indication of the company's progress towards finding a successor to Mr Patrick Rich, the chairman who last month said he would be retiring almost two years early in April. Losses per share were 7.18p compared with earnings of 11.81p. Earnings per share before exceptional items were 9.42p. Operating profits for the three months to end-December 1993 were Pounds 97.1m - 11 per cent less than a year ago but slightly more than in the previous three months to end-September. An indication of the difficulty the company is having with its profits margins in gases is illustrated by virtually unchanged profits in the division - Pounds 75.4m against Pounds 74.7m last time, while turnover expanded from Pounds 545.3m to Pounds 610.7m. Total turnover for the first quarter was Pounds 843.5m (Pounds 776.8m). Profits from the healthcare division fell sharply on a year ago because of generic competition for its anaesthetic, Forane, on which US patent protection expired in January last year. Healthcare turnover was Pounds 136m (Pounds 152m) with operating profits of Pounds 14m compared with Pounds 32.6m. Sales growth from Forane's successor, Suprane, are still well short of bridging the gap. Medical systems, medical devices and speciality products divisions all performed well, said BOC. Mr Charles Lambert, chemicals analyst with Smith New Court, said that the results had done little to clarify the long-term prospects for the group and that the growth in turnover was the result of acquisitions in Germany and Poland. The provision includes Pounds 25m for restructuring BOC's gases business worldwide and the balance will be largely for the healthcare side. The restructuring programme begins this year and will last about three years. When complete it should produce annual savings of Pounds 60m a year, says BOC.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chamber of Deputies President Guillermo Bedregal  Gutierrez, who is the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement]  leader, noted yesterday that the announcement of the new U.S.  drug enforcement strategy will cause political and social  conflicts in our country.    The Chamber of Deputies president said the announcement of a  reduction in U.S. cooperation in the field of alternative  development will prompt "dissatisfaction" among coca producers.    Bedregal pondered: "We will have a very serious political  conflict if the crops are reduced just to reduce them, without  the proper alternative development planning. The poor coca  producer, who is tied to the crisis in Bolivia, will be hard  hit."    Bedregal wants the announcement handled "with much care,"  but  announced that the discussions to approve the national budget  will consider the issue when establishing our country's drug  enforcement activities. He said the deputies may discuss this  issue after the carnival adjournment.    Guillermo Richter, the Senate Government and Drug  Trafficking  Committee chairman, said he agrees that repression mechanisms  should be "as efficient as possible" to prevent illegal  activities.    Richter said: "I would have liked greater support in  economic  and financial terms -- not just from the Clinton Administration,  but also from the international community -- to help our country  and other states that are troubled by this scourge promote  alternative development."    The U.S. Government's announcements mainly involve countries  that produce raw materials to process drugs -- like Bolivia  which produces coca leaves that are traditionally used for  medicinal purposes, and cocaine.    While opinions on the U.S. President's announcement were  voiced in Congress, executive branch sources linked to this  issue -- the Ministry of Government and the Social Defense  Secretariat -- did not comment.    Unofficial sources announced that the government will wait  for the return of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who went  to Oruro yesterday, before adopting a position or beginning  discussions to establish the drug enforcement policy that will  be implemented in our country.</p>

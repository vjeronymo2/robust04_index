			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Rise in US retail sales: Modest growth expected as inflationary pressures ease US consumer spending rose significantly in the second quarter while inflationary pressures moderated, official figures indicated yesterday. This suggests that the US economy, after sharp price increases and negligible growth in an erratic first quarter, is returning to last year's path of moderate growth and subdued inflation. Fears that the Federal Reserve, the central bank, would push up interest rates in the near future have all but evaporated. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.4 per cent between May and June and sharply revised upwards estimates of spending in previous months. The Labour Department said consumer prices were flat last month after a marginal 0.1 per cent increase in May. Official figures earlier this week showed a 0.3 per cent decline in wholesale prices last month, the biggest in two years. In May the Fed reacted to signs of rising inflationary pressures by shifting from a neutral monetary stance to a bias toward raising short-term rates. However, it is now expected to take a more relaxed attitude towards pressures and to postpone a tightening of monetary policy at least until the autumn, perhaps until next year. Retail sales in April and May were revised up sharply to show monthly gains of 1.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively, against previous estimates of 1.5 per cent and 0.1 per cent. The latest figures suggest that real consumer spending grew at an annual rate of about 3 per cent in the second quarter, a sharp rebound after growth of less than 1 per cent in the first quarter. The recovery was led by big increases in car sales. Sales of clothing and general household goods also improved noticeably.</p>

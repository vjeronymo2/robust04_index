			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROCKWELL, ITALIAN FIRM ALLY TO PURSUE INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTS  </P> <P> Rockwell International Corp. has formed a strategic alliance with an Italian  aerospace and defense electronics manufacturer to go after business in the  international aircraft avionics market.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Rockwell's Defense Electronics division in Anaheim said  details of the agreement with the Milan-based company, Fabbrica Italiana  Apparecchiature Radio-elettriche S.p.A., will be released at a press conference  Wednesday in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The Italian company has "some expertise that will really be valuable to us,"  said Rockwell spokeswoman Christine Rodriguez. She said that Fabbrica is a  leading developer of aircraft radar.  </P> <P> Rockwell spokesman Tony Longo said the two firms plan to compete for contracts  to upgrade avionics equipment for the roughly 1,800 F-5 fighter planes used by  air forces worldwide.  </P> <P> Rodriguez said the agreement is part of a growing trend within the U.S. defense  industry for companies to team up with international partners to bid on large  contracts.  </P> <P> Fabbrica has about 1,100 employees and had 1989 sales of $128 million. Its  major shareholders include Setemer Ericsson, the Italian defense subsidiary of  Sweden's Telefonaktiebolaget L M Ericsson; and Finmeccanica, a financial  holding concern of Italy's IRI Group.  </P></p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Finding the correct chemistry - David Sparks meets three scientists who have turned a problem into a business opportunity TIGHTENING standards for safety and pollution mean that chemical and drugs companies must rethink how they make products. That presents opportunities for a small Durham company, High Force Research, set up by Stuart Penny, Roy Valentine and Bob Redfern: chemists and a chemist turned marketing man. The company specialises in improving chemical processes. Last year it won a second Smart award from the Department of Trade and Industry to develop a technique for removing toxic phenols from the waste that goes into drains. The three started in July 1988 with a large job. They took up a request, turned down by the company they then worked for, to devise a safe way to manufacture a new drug, buparvaquone, to cure a devastating cattle disease, East Coast fever. Coopers Animal Health (now part of Pitman-Moore) had found the drug after 30 years' work, but its laboratory process involved toxic mercury, the potentially explosive use of hydrogen peroxide, and corrosive fluorine compounds in a low-flashpoint solvent unsuited to factory use. 'We asked the local universities if they had a spare lab we could rent,' recalled Redfern. ''You mean the Mountjoy Research Centre,' said the chemistry department in Durham.' Mountjoy, a centre for small research companies, perched on the hill above the university science laboratories, was ideal - 'though the rent is now higher than in London Docklands,' said Redfern. 'Being near Durham city centre is attractive, and this has allowed English Estates to raise rents to ridiculous levels.' He added: 'You need a good library close by if you are doing our sort of chemistry. The university has glass-blowers, chemical stores, instruments, scientific expertise. One academic is a consultant for us.' Regional selective assistance from the DTI covered part of the cost of setting up High Force which also received support from local councils. Coopers and the contract helped find the rest of the money. Valentine, who left school at 16 but then gained a doctorate at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, felt chemists made too little use of computers. He devised a computer-controlled reaction vessel to test and perfect the buparvaquone process. High Force Research now makes the Automated Laboratory Reactor and has sold it to multinational companies doing manufacturing research. The main competitor is a much costlier Swiss machine. Redfern said: 'We are getting a lot of work as a result of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health standards. Where workers are in contact with such substances - dry-cleaning fluids, for instance - employers must assess the risks, take precautions and monitor the outcome. It is making them look more closely at what they do.' Environmental standards are also bringing change, restricting what you can discharge from a chimney or allow to go down the drain. High Force devises processes to make products not now made in Britain. A UK company was importing a raw material from Japan and wanted a local source. 'We developed a process and approached a production company to adopt it. Together we aim to be the main supplier. 'Our turnover was several hundred thousand pounds in 1990-91, showing a modest profit. And we are holding our own despite the recession. One problem is that the past six or 12 months have been a time of merger, divestment and reorganisation among our customers which paraslyses decision-taking. We believe, now the election is out of the way, that people are starting to think about the longer-term. 'From our profits we have invested over Pounds 100,000 in laboratories and equipment. It is nice to be master of your own destiny. If you're a little cog in a big organisation, you have no control over what happens to you. One of the nicest things is to be free of committees and rigid structures. We can organise in an informal way.'

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mikio Omi, director general of the Science and  Technology Agency [STA] announced on 3 June a plan to regularly  disclose the amount of plutonium Japan has in stock. This is a  part of the measures designed to show at home and abroad the  transparency of Japan's plutonium utilization, in which other  countries are interested. He explained this plan in response to  a question asked by Osamu Imamura (of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ]) at the House of Representatives Science  and Technological Committee meeting on the same day.    In response to an inquiry by Tadatoshi Akiba, lower house  Dietman (of the SDPJ), the STA disclosed last October the amount  of plutonium in stock. However, the agency will make regular  announcements in the future. Regarding the frequency of and how  to make the announcements, the STA will study some possibilities  while taking several factors into consideration, including  progress at meetings on the framework of international plutonium  utilization.    Director General Omi stressed: "To obtain understanding and  cooperation from the people, it is important for us to disclose  as much information as possible, except information on the  protection of property rights, such as know-how regarding the  protection of nuclear materials."    The amount of plutonium in stock as of late December last  year, when the same agency made the announcement, was 1,600  kilograms. Moreover, 2,900 kg of plutonium was stored in Britain  and France, where plutonium is being reprocessed for Japan. The  government announced previously that it would continue to  maintain a balance between the supply of and demand for  plutonium. Therefore, the government needs to disclose the  amount of plutonium in stock to actually show that it is abiding  by its own announcement.</p>

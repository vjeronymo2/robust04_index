			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Japanese banks reveal scars from end of financial bubble JAPAN'S banks yesterday revealed some of the scars suffered in the collapse of the country's financial bubble, as the 11 leading commercial banks reported sharply lower first-half profits and a dramatic increase in their loan loss reserves. The plunge in pre-tax profits, down by an average 37 per cent, came despite a general fall in interest rates during the six months to September, allowing the banks to exploit a favourable rate spread and boost profits on banking business by an average 47 per cent. But those increases were wiped out by appraisal losses on securities holdings, undermined by the Tokyo stock market's continuing weakness. Appraisal losses for commercial banks, called 'city banks' in Japan, rose 124.7 per cent last time to a combined Y417.5bn (Pounds 2.2bn). The banks also reported an increase of Y326.8bn to Y1,099.2bn in loan loss reserves, some used to cover exposure to collapsed property developers, including the Olympia &amp; York group of Canada as well as smaller Japanese companies. Tokai Bank set aside half its Y41.1bn loss reserves to cover Olympia &amp; York Developments debt. As a result of the losses and provisions, net profits at Fuji Bank plunged 56.1 per cent, Dai- Ichi Kangyo Bank 42.4 per cent, Sakura Bank 40.8 per cent, Sumitomo Bank 40.7 per cent and Mitsubishi Bank 37.6 per cent. Traditionally, Sumitomo has been the most profitable Japanese bank, but it lost that title to Sanwa Bank, which saw a 69.2 per cent increase in business profit to Y198.6bn and a 34 per cent drop in net profit to Y40.2bn. Mr Paul Heaton, of Smith New Court Japan, said Japanese banks are likely to experience falling profits for the next two years. 'Unlike banks in the US, the Japanese banks cannot take their losses in one big hit and report zero profits. It's not the way in Japan. They will spread it out, but that also means they will take time to solve their problems,' Mr Heaton said. One source of comfort for the leading banks was that all succeeded in clearing the 8 per cent hurdle for their capital to assets ratio, as defined by the Bank for International Settlements.

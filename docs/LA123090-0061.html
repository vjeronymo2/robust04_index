			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE IN THE NEWS: RETIREE ENDS A RECORD STREAK  </P> <P> It may be hard to believe, but Roy Okamura hasn't missed a day of work during  his 30 years as a forklift operator at Sysco Food Services.  </P> <P> He'll have his day soon, though; Okamura, 68, retired last week.  </P> <P> Monday, he won't rise before dawn to get to work by 6 a.m., as he's done every  weekday since May 15, 1961, except for vacations. He won't walk briskly around  the block for exercise before hopping on the orange-and-black forklift and  unloading crates of frozen food from delivery trucks.  </P> <P> Instead, he and his wife, Loy, plan to relax and travel to Japan for the first  time to see relatives.  </P> <P> Company officials say Okamura is the only one of the 924 employees at the  company's Walnut division with a spotless attendance record.  </P> <P> "It's phenomenal," said Michael Ducharm, Sysco's director of transportation and  Okamura's former supervisor. "He's worked days when he had the flu."  </P> <P> Indeed, on Thursday morning, Okamura showed up for work as usual, even though  his throat was so sore that he could barely talk. Another time, co-workers  said, a heavy carton fell on Okamura, knocking him down. His head was bleeding,  but Okamura got up and went back to work.  </P> <P> During a break Thursday, Okamura said his work ethic hails from his days as a  potato farmer in his native Pocatello, Ida., during the 1940s.  </P> <P> "When you're a farmer, you've just got to keep going," Okamura whispered. "If  you sit back, you're just gonna go broke."  </P> <P> Dressed in his normal work attire -- gray golf hat, lined denim jacket and  rubber leg guards -- Okamura said he's taken aback by all the fuss about his  attendance record. Even when Sysco awarded him a plaque last year, he didn't  bother hanging it up in his Los Angeles home because he said he would feel  uncomfortable displaying it.  </P> <P> Co-workers, however, weren't so low-key about their colleague. "They don't make  men like that anymore," said receiving clerk Carlos Vidal.  </P> <P> "We're gonna put him in the Guinness Book of World Records," Stanley Robinowitz  said.  </P> <P> Okamura smiled, shrugged his shoulders and went back to work.  </P></p>

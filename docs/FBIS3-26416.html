			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, February 7 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President  Bill Clinton proposed today to cut 181,000 uniformed and  civilian defense personnel in fiscal year 1995 that begins  October 1.    The cut, contained in the 1.5 trillion dollars fiscal 1995  budget, would lead the U.S. Military to an active force of 1.52  million people.    That includes 510,000 for the Army, 442,000 for the Navy,  174,000 for the Marine Corps and 400,000 for the Air Force.    Although the 1995 budget for national defense increases to  263.7 billion dollars from 260.9 billion dollars this year, real  spending would actually decline 0.9 percent if projected  inflation elements were taken into account.    That decline is far from the 5.9 percent real drop planned  for 1996 under the Clinton administration's five-year spending  plan, representing its intention to hold the line on overall  spending.    The 1995 defense budget includes 252.2 billion dollars for  the Department of Defense, 10.6 billion dollars for nuclear  weapons programs of the Department of Energy and 900 million  dollars for other defense-related spending.    It includes 2.8 billion dollars for the closing of military  bases, 5.7 billion dollars for environmental cleanup and  pollution prevention at military facilities, 5 billion dollars  for military construction and 3.3 billion dollars for military  housing.    Reflecting the military "bottom-up review" conducted under  former Defense Secretary Les Aspin that stresses readiness, the  1995 budget gives an increase of 1.7 billion dollars for  readiness in real terms.</p>

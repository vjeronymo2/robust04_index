			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Mitsubishi's Dollars 2bn rescue of trust bank breaks barriers Mitsubishi Bank, one of the world's largest commercial banks, yesterday announced a rescue takeover of the troubled Nippon Trust Bank. The deal is a move towards the consolidation of a Japanese banking sector crippled by bad debts. Mitsubishi will become the first Japanese city bank, or commercial bank, to operate a full trust bank subsidiary. It said it would buy Y200bn (Pounds 1.3bn) of new shares, giving it a 68.8 per cent stake in Nippon Trust from November 10. It is already the second largest shareholder, with 5 per cent. Nippon Trust has been struggling under the weight of bad loans made during the boom years of the late 1980s, when property and other asset prices rose sharply. It acknowledged that non-performing loans, brought about by the subsequent decline in the property market, were now far higher than the official figure of Y130bn disclosed in May. Industry sources put the actual figure as high as Y500bn. Nippon Trust plans immediately to write off Y200bn of those loans, producing a collapse in profits in the current fiscal year, according to its president, Mr Tomoaki Hirano. In the year to March 1995, it would record a net loss of Y163bn, the first post-tax loss in Japanese banking history, against a profit of Y1.7bn last year. 'We have come to the conclusion that asking for outside help is the only way we can survive,' Mr Hirano said. With Mitsubishi's assistance, the trust bank plans a three-year reconstruction programme involving up to 25 per cent cuts in costs. The rescue was approved by the Ministry of Finance when it became clear that Nippon Trust's net liabilities exceeded its capital, according to ministry sources. Officials said the ministry would allow Nippon Trust Bank to continue full operations as a trust bank because of those 'exceptional circumstances'. The ministry last year changed banking regulations to allow city banks to establish trust bank subsidiaries. But the new rules prevent city banks from operating some of the most profitable aspects of trust banking business such as pension fund management and loan trusts. The decision is likely to create concern among banks that Mitsubishi has been handed an unfair advantage. Most city banks are planning to establish trust banks next year. Unlike Mitsubishi, they will be severely constrained under the new rules. Trust banks are also understood to be unhappy, since Mitsubishi Bank can now be expected to eat into their core business.

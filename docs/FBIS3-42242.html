			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Igor Andreyev, Arkadiy Zheludkov, and Valeriy </F> Yakov: "Terrorists Maintain Tension in Yakutsk, While the  Authorities Play at Secrecy"]    [Text] For three days now the editorial office's  correspondents have been trying to find out the details of the  case of the "Retribution" terrorist group which has demanded 500  million rubles [R] and $500,000 from the government of the  Republic of Sakha-Yakutia, threatening to blow up vitally  important facilities in Yakutsk.    After the republic Prosecutor's Office instituted criminal  proceedings in connection with the threats, we contacted Nikolay  Valentinskiy, deputy prosecutor of Sakha-Yakutia. According to  our interlocutor, the inhabitants and the law-enforcement organs  learned of the critical situation in the city from reports in  the central media.    There is no panic in Yakutsk, he said. All enterprises,  including schools, are functioning normally. N. Valentinskiy  did not confirm, but nor did he deny the editorial office's  information that a description had been obtained of one of the  terrorists, who brought an audiocassette to the mayor's office  with the "Retribution" group's demands on it. N. Valentinskiy  refused to supply any other details of the incident, citing the  ban on providing the press with information until the inquiry  has been completed.    We were unable to obtain any more information from the  republic Security Ministry office. According to the minister's  aide, the law-enforcement organs are operating in accordance  with a special plan. The criminals have not contacted them  again. There has been no agreement so far on the place or time  of a meeting.    Vladimir Fedyunin, Sakha-Yakutia first deputy minister of  internal affairs, was more definite. "It is total rubbish," he  said in connection with the description of the terrorist. V.  Fedyunin refused to say any more to IZVESTIYA, on the assumption  that there might be calls from the terrorists' accomplices.    Confidential sources reported that information on the  willingness to make a payment was broadcast on Yakutsk  television Channel 12 at the appointed hour on 3 February. The  money was to be collected by someone in a Moskvich car after a  signal had been given on television. There was no agreement,  nor could there have been any agreement on the place where the  money was to be handed over--our correspondent was citing  private conversations with republic Internal Affairs Minister  Valeriy Fedorov and General Prosecutor Vasiliy Kolmogorov.    Local law-enforcement organs checked on potential hoaxers  suspected of similar threats in the past, but they obtained no  information on the terrorists. According to the law-enforcement  organs' current data, there have been no reports of any  "Retribution" terrorist group.    There was an earlier occasion, in 1993, when an unidentified  citizen also called the local authorities and threatened to blow  up power facilities in Yakutsk unless he received some money.  It turned out to be a hoax.    We were told at the Russian Ministry for Emergencies that an  aircraft carrying a rescue team and the necessary equipment and  medicines had been prepared in connection with the situation in  Yakutsk, in case of unforeseen developments.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / FT Guide to the Week 28 MONDAY Norway on a knife-edge The Norwegian government and its allies in business and industry hope to pull off the surprise of the Nordic autumn by winning a Yes vote in the country's referendum on joining the European Union. With Austria, Finland and Sweden already having voted in favour of membership, Brussels is hoping Norway will make it a clean sweep of the applicant countries. Russian first deputy prime minister Oleg Soskovets visits Japan to sign trade and investment accords designed to put some life back into economic ties between the two states. Soskovets has said that 'political interests should be set aside as a subject of negotiations' - meaning he does not want to talk about the Kurile Islands, which Russia has had since the end of the last war and which Japan wants back. UK politics: The government could fall if a rebellion by Eurosceptics in the ruling Conservative party forces a losing vote on increasing Britain's European Union budget contribution. If that happens, the cabinet has pledged to resign, precipitating a general election. Mid-East peace: Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, meets Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres in Brussels on the eve of a critical two-day meeting of international aid donors. European Union foreign ministers prepare in Brussels for the European Council summit in Essen on December 9-10. Subjects include: Bosnia and a strategy for enlargement to central and eastern Europe. A draft agreement of Turkey's planned customs union with the EU, scheduled to take effect on January 1 1996, will also be discussed. Dry crossing: The English High Court begins hearing a request from Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, for duty-free sales within the European Union to be declared unlawful. Duty-free sales are not allowed on Eurostar trains traversing the tunnel. Eurotunnel says present duty-free regulations give ferries and airlines an unfair advantage and are a nonsense in the single market. Saleroom: A colourful landscape, Flower Garden, by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt is the highlight of Christies' auction of Impressionist and Modern art in London tonight. Painted about 1906, it should top Pounds 4m. FT Surveys: Pakistan and Energy Efficiency. Holidays: Albania (Independence Proclamation Day), Panama. 29 TUESDAY Britain awaits its Budget Chancellor Kenneth Clarke (left) unveils his second Budget this afternoon against an unusually favourable background of stronger than expected economic growth and low inflation. In spite of the government's unpopularity, the chancellor is expected to refrain from cutting taxes and focus instead on cutting government expenditure and reducing the budget deficit in 1995-96 and subsequent years. It is thought likely that Clarke - a self styled 'son of the industrial Midlands' - will act to help small businesses as part of a strategy for sustained growth and low inflation. Congress tackles Gatt: The US House of Representatives meets in a special 'lame duck' session to vote for the implementing legislation giving approval for the Uruguay Round pact agreed last December. Supporters say they may round up almost 300 votes, well above the 218 that are needed for passage. Then on Thursday, the Senate votes on the Uruguay Round legislation, which needs 60 out of 100 votes to pass. It is expected to be close, although the endorsement last week by Senate Republican leader Robert Dole should help to carry the day. Mid-East peace: Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation start talks in Cairo on the next stage of Palestinian self-rule: the redeployment of Israeli troops out of areas of the West Bank that are still occupied, and the procedures for holding national Palestinian elections. After a recent upsurge in violence and tension between the PLO and its Islamic opponents, Israel and the PLO are seeking ways of speeding implementation of the peace accords which are running some 9 to 12 months behind schedule. Franco-German summit: Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand will lead their respective delegations to the 64th Franco-German summit, a two-day affair in Bonn. Foreign, defence and economic ministers are among those who will be speaking to each other about handing over the European Union presidency to France, the European council in Essen in early December, and the forthcoming summit of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to be held in Budapest on December 5-6. FT Surveys: Bristol and Global Custody. Holidays: Albania (Liberation Day), Liberia. 30 WEDNESDAY Ireland seeks a government Ireland's parliament is due to reconvene to vote on a new government, after the break-up two weeks ago of the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition and the resignation of Albert Reynolds as prime minister. He has been replaced as party leader by Bertie Ahern, the former finance minister, who hopes to replace him as prime minister as well. Italy's Berlusconi government will hold a crucial meeting with trade union leaders. Its outcome will determine whether an eight-hour general strike goes ahead on December 2. The strike has been called to protest against the 1995 budget and in particular plans to cut benefits in Italy's state pensions system. The government is ready to make concessions but the unions will keep everyone guessing until the last minute - not least those planning to travel to Italy on Friday. BCCI affair: Creditors of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International will be watching carefully as a planned settlement put forward by the liquidators Touche Ross goes before courts in Luxembourg. Further ratification of the deal, based on a Dollars 1.8bn contribution from the government of Abu Dhabi, is needed in London and the Cayman Islands. An earlier deal fell on appeal in Luxembourg. Asylum in Europe: Justice and home affairs ministers of the European Union begin a two-day meeting in Brussels. They are expected to conclude two agreements on asylum policy, on minimum procedural guarantees and a draft model for bilateral readmission agreements with third countries. There is some concern among human rights groups that the proposals fall short of international standards. Saleroom: Anything by Beatrix Potter, the children's book writer and illustrator, is always much in demand and Sotheby's expects bids of up to Pounds 4,000 for a fragment of a diary she kept in August 1905. It covers her reaction to the death of her fiance and publisher Norman Warne from leukaemia. A watercolour of Cinderella's coach (detail below) that she gave to Warne on the day he proposed in July 1905 is expected to fetch about Pounds 20,000. Holidays: Philippines (Bonifacio Day). 1 THURSDAY Nato ministers meet Nato foreign ministers in Brussels confer in the shadow of mounting US-European differences of policy on Bosnia, and arguments over how quickly the alliance should expand eastwards (to Dec 2). The US is expected to press for clearer and faster procedures for admitting members. Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, addresses the Western European Union in Paris. Kozyrev is expected to moot a new security order for Europe: he has recently talked of 'surpassing' Nato and the CSCE in search of an all-European group. Mexico's president-elect Ernesto Zedillo starts a six-year term, continuing the Institutional Revolutionary party's 66-year grip on the post. Zedillo's inauguration speech will stress stable economic growth and political and judicial reform as the theme of his presidency. World Aids Day: The French government and World Health Organisation hold the Paris Aids Summit - 42 countries are expected to attend. Saleroom: The autograph of Schumann's Second Symphony is auctioned at Sotheby's in London and may fetch Pounds 800,000 (Dollars 1.3m). FT Surveys: Management Buy-Outs and Software at Work. Holidays: Portugal (Independence Day). 2 FRIDAY Strife in former Yugoslavia Foreign ministers from the 'contact group' - consisting of the US, Russia, the UK, France and Germany - try to reach agreement on how to promote a peace settlement in Bosnia and if possible Croatia as well. The meeting follows a warning from John Major, the UK prime minister, that the group must intensify its efforts because time is running out. Russia, in a sharp disagreement with the US, has warned against further use of air power by Nato and blamed the Bosnian government for the latest fighting. Georgia's president Eduard Shevardnadze and rebel Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba hold talks in Geneva with Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general, and Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister. Negotiations between officials in Geneva in November produced some progress towards a political settlement, but none on the vexed issue of the return to Abkhazia of 250,000 refugees. Saleroom: Sotheby's in London offers for sale a letter written by Alain-Fournier, author of the romantic novel Le Grand Meaulnes. It is the only known letter written to his first love Yvonne, the inspiration for the heroine of the same name in the novel. It is estimated up to Pounds 3,500 (Dollars 5,740). Holidays: United Arab Emirates (National Day). 3-4 WEEKEND Taiwan votes for governor On Saturday, Taiwan holds for the first time popular elections for the mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung cities and the governor of Taiwan province, the area outside the two biggest cities. The polls represent an important step in the island's democratisation and are seen as a vote of confidence in the ruling Kuomintang. They are also a gauge of public sentiment on relations with China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province. Japan's Diet is scheduled to finish its extraordinary session on Saturday, but it will probably be extended to ensure ratification of the Gatt Uruguay Round agreements. Northern Ireland's hardline Democratic Unionist Party holds its annual conference in Dungannon on Saturday. Its leader, the Rev Ian Paisley, is becoming increasingly isolated in opposing the Northern Ireland peace process being orchestrated by the governments in London and Dublin. The Swiss vote on Sunday on a law which would give the police powers to detain foreigners indefinitely. Tourists need not worry, however. It is aimed mainly at drug dealers who, once inside Switzerland, throw their passports away and apply for asylum. Zurichers' patience with the open drug scene seems to be running out.

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: CWS slips 11% to Pounds 23.1m but upbeat about prospects THE Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), which is the biggest commercial farmer in the UK and a growing force in retailing, saw annual pre-tax profits fall by 11 per cent as the company encountered very difficult trading conditions in the 'deepest recession since the Second World War'. But, Sir Dennis Landau, the chief executive who was presiding over his last results presentation before his retirement in June, said the company had maintained its investment programme through the downturn and was 'in better shape than it has been for many years'. Profits before tax and exceptional items slid from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 23.1m as lower investment income and a higher interest charge took their toll. But sales grew from Pounds 3.03bn to Pounds 3.14bn in the year to January 11, and trading profits were Pounds 2.5m higher at Pounds 47.1m. CWS is a substantial food manufacturer and continues to supply goods and services to the 65 independent co-operative societies in the UK. Food manufacturing activities contributed Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 12.7m) to trading profits. But CWS's retailing activities are becoming an increasingly important part of the overall business and contributed profits of Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 7.2m). The retail arm was further strengthened through mergers with the Milton Keynes, Cumbrian, and Greater Nottingham societies. A few of CWS's stores continued to trade on Sundays despite the group's initial reluctance to trading seven days a week. CWS's other interests - spanning milk delivery, travel agencies, opticians, funeral directors, and engineering contractors - produced a mixed performance. In particular, engineering and property suffered 'significant set-backs' and were unlikely to return to their former prosperity for many years, Sir Dennis said. However, Sir Dennis, who has been chief executive for the past 12 years, finished with an upbeat assessment of the company's future prospects. He said there had been radical changes within the co-operative movement which would ensure that CWS remained 'a relevant and successful organisation for many years to come and a viable alternative to both the public and private sectors of the economy.' He said that although personally he did not favour the creation of a single co-operative society by the end of the decade he would not be surprised if one emerged. A surplus of Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 23.2m) was shown for the year. But after swallowing reduced losses of Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 10.9m) at its banking arm, the company transferred Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 12.3m) to reserves.</p>

Everyone is  agreed that you are the man who has made it possible for the  West to recover its honor by issuing an ultimatum to the Bosnian  Serbs. After GATT this is a new success for you, and for French  diplomacy, but now it is you whom people are going to associate  with the first risks and perhaps the first deaths. You arrived  in Zagreb yesterday evening. Does what you have already heard  make you optimistic or not?    [Juppe] I will be wary of being optimistic. I have come here  to present France's position, as defined by the president, the  prime minister, and all of the ministers with authority in this  matter. I had a twofold objective: The first is to convince my  interlocutors of the seriousness of the situation and of the  Atlantic alliance's determination to ensure that this ultimatum  is enforced, and my second objective is to give a reminder that  there are peace proposals, a plan, a plan of the European Union,  on the table in Geneva, which may evolve. I believe moreover  that our American friends are in the process of giving thought  to this and working on it. It is a plan which contains the only  possible solution, because there is no military solution to this  conflict, of course.    [Giesbert] Something that may appear strange is that one  only  hears from you in connection with this matter. Are you sure of  the complete and total support of Edouard Balladur and Francois  Mitterrand ?    [Juppe] I am certain of it.    [Giesbert] You are hardly going to tell me otherwise.    [Juppe] That is because, quite simply, it is the truth.    [Giesbert] But the Serbs do not look as though they have  decided to comply. Have you seen what Radovan Karadzic, the  leader of the Bosnian Serbs, has said, for example: Let Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe ask Austrian Foreign Minister Mock what  happened to Austria in 1914, when it issued an ultimatum to the  Serbs. This is a way of reminding us that the last Serbian  ultimatum ended in a world war.    [Juppe] Yes, you know, Franz-Olivier Giesbert....    [Giesbert, interrupting] This is a terrible threat.    [Juppe] I am not going to launch myself into a controversy,  and I believe one has to keep one's head in this matter. I will  tell you that the delegation of Bosnian Serbs is still present  in Geneva. So, on the one hand we have the hot air and on the  other, I believe, an awareness of the danger. Moreover, the  fact that these talks are continuing is the best demonstration  of this.    Let me remind you that yesterday, or the day before  yesterday, the Bosnian Serbs apparently signed an agreement in  which they pledged to withdraw their heavy weapons, so let us  not go to extremes right away. The ultimatum exists, we are  determined to implement it, the Atlantic alliance will honor the  commitments it has made, and in the next 10 days ahead of us let  us step up the calls for greater reason and wisdom.    [Giesbert] Yesterday, however, Radovan Karadzic also said:  We  will not withdraw from Sarajevo because the town is not under  siege; it is divided in two.    [Juppe] We did not ask for this. One has to have a look at  what the proposals or the demands of the Atlantic alliance are,  and those which feature in the peace plan, and as everyone very  well knows, we have not demanded the withdrawal of the Serbs; we  demanded the withdrawal of the artillery batteries which are  carrying out the shelling which you are aware of, with the  massacres which you are aware of. This is what features in the  alliance's ultimatum, and this is not at all a demand for the  Serbs of Sarajevo -- who, it is true, have been there for  centuries -- to leave. In the European Union's plan, what is  anticipated is UN administration of Sarajevo for the very  purpose of guaranteeing the coexistence of all the communities,  and finally to determine the status of this town. So, let us  not mix everything up, and let us not distort the positions of  the international community.    [Giesbert] Nevertheless the temperature has been rising. You  were not able to see Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the Russian  nationalist leader, on television yesterday evening, because you  were aboard the plane for Zagreb, but he threatened us, France,  the French people, with terrible reprisals.    [Juppe] Two or three weeks ago Mr. Zhirinovskiy also  threatened Germany, I believe, with a world war. He sketched  out a map of Europe which eliminates several countries which  currently exist, so this does not have much to do with the  alliance's decision. I have said what I thought about Mr.  Zhirinovskiy's attitude, and if you want to make me say that we  should be watchful with regard to the situation in Europe, well,  I am already convinced of that.    [Giesbert] There is of course the problem of Russia, which  denies NATO's right to decide on air strikes.    [Juppe] The latest Russian statements are not encouraging at  all. Having said that, I do not believe that Russia has the  capacity to paralyze the system at the United Nations, not even  at the Security Council. Moreover, we shall be endeavoring to  convince Russia that it too must join the search for a peace  plan. We have been urging them to do so for quite a long time,  the United States has joined our efforts, and, as far as I am  concerned, I shall seek to speak to Mr. Kozyrev in the same  language.    [Giesbert] In Sarajevo, your destination, there was a fresh  outbreak of shooting last night. There is a danger of new  provocations.    [Juppe] Yes, that is why the ultimatum is more necessary  than  ever. A cease-fire having been signed 48 hours ago, we note  that once again this cease-fire has amounted to nothing but  words on paper. We shall therefore achieve tangible results  only if the heavy weapons are drawn back or are placed under UN  responsibility. This has, I think, provided further proof that  we cannot stay as we are at present.    [Giesbert] Let us consider the possibility of having to  envisage the worst possile scenario. The military are very  skeptical. You have no doubt read what they are saying. There  are 300 to 400 Serb artillery pieces deployed around Sarajevo,  they are very mobile, they can be moved very quickly, the ground  is mountainous and thickly wooded. Should it prove necessary,  do you really believe that the Serb guns could be destroyed?  That is the big question.    [Juppe] Yes, of course, that is the big question. But I  would like to make it very clear to you, Mr. Giesbert, that in  this affair there is no question of having the diplomats ranged  on one side and the soldiers on the other. In such a grave  situation, we are not so irresponsible as to fail to coordinate  our efforts very closely. The decision, I repeat, was taken in  close liaison between the defense and foreign ministries and  there were consultations with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces],  General Cot, General Rose, and also with the NATO military.  Besides, all of this had been under consideration for months,  since it was last July that NATO drew up the necessary plans.  It is true that we are in a grave situation. This is why every  effort must be made to bring the warring parties to their  senses. But we have not got into this situation lightly,  without having pondered matters at length.    [Giesbert] Alain Juppe, you are now leaving for Sarajevo.  Will you be meeting the Bosnian Serbs?    [Juppe] No, the Bosnian Serbs are in Geneva. I was willing  to meet....    [Giesbert, interrupting] There are some in Sarajevo.    [Juppe] I was willing to meet them, I was even prepared to  go  to Belgrade if it served a useful purpose. But I have decided  that the virulence of their first reactions failed to create the  necessary conditions. If matters evolve, the message which I  have brought here with me must be addressed to everyone, and is  as follows: Take note, the ultimatum risks creating -- has now  created -- new circumstances. We are determined to enforce it,  so let us go back to the negotiating table.    [Giesbert] As far as the Bosnian Serbs are concerned, you  are public enemy number one. Are you not afraid that all this  hostility might be focused on France?    [Juppe] Let us not disguise things. Above all, having asked,  if not demanded, for a burst of dignity from the international  community and from France in particular, I would not wish  everyone to scatter in all directions just because we are faced  with a difficult situation.    [Giesbert] There is a lot of talk of war, but you believe in  peace.    [Juppe] There is no other solution, and as far as I am  concerned I shall tirelessly do my utmost to see that this plan  -- over which at present the differences are of the order of 0.5  to 1 percent, 2 percent maximum -- is brought to the table  again. We are not going to get into a big argument just over  one or two cities, since we are here to deal with it.    [Giesbert] Alain Juppe, have a good day, and courage.    [Juppe] Thank you.</p>

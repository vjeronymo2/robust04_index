			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Developer pays DM40m for Berlin stake Christiani &amp; Nielsen, the international contractor and property developer, has paid DM40m (Dollars 22.7m) to acquire a 71.73 per cent stake in a DM1bn property development close to Berlin. Nobleclear, the development company, was previously owned by UK property developers Mr Ronald Lyon and Mr Godfrey Bradman and East German Investment Trust. After the purchase East German Investment Trust will retain 18 per cent and Mr Lyon 10.27 per cent of Nobleclear. Mr Bradman has sold his stake. Nobleclear plans to develop the 309 acre site at a cost of DM800m over the next four to five years. It will provide a mix of residential, light industrial and commercial buildings in one of the largest out-of-town developments in the region. Christiani, the former Danish construction group, was acquired by its Thai subsidiary for Dollars 80m at the end of 1992. It is the second time this year that Mr Bradman, former chairman of collapsed UK developer Rosehaugh, has decided to give up a property development opportunity. His plan to lead a consortium to develop a Pounds 300m (Dollars 438m) retail and residential development at White City in west London collapsed after British Rail and the BICC engineering group accepted an alternative offer for the land.</p>

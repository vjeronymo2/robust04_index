			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Waterford rationalisation successful MR DONALD Brennan, managing director of Morgan Stanley, is to hand over the chairmanship of Waterford Wedgwood to Mr Tony O'Reilly towards the end of this year once the luxury crystal and ceramics manufacturer's rationalisation programme is complete, writes Tim Coone. Speaking at the annual meeting, Mr Brennan said the rationalisation plan for the crystal and ceramics divisions 'has been put in place with considerable success'. He said the acceptance of the plan by the Waterford Crystal workforce last January, that division's return to operating profits, and improvements in cost reductions and production efficiencies at Wedgwood had put the group 'in a better position today than many believed possible a year ago'. He acknowledged the sacrifices in job losses but said as a result of rationalisation more than IPounds 10m (Pounds 9.8m) had been permanently removed from the cost base in a comparison with overheads in 1991-92. 'I seriously doubt if we would be meeting here today had not the capital infusion been made in 1990 and this plan put in place and well executed', he stated. Mr Brennan was appointed chairman a year after Morgan Stanley and Fitzwilton, the industrial holding group headed by Mr O'Reilly, bought jointly a 29.9 per cent stake in the group for IPounds 79m.</p>

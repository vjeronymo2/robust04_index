			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Minister digs in on terror insurance THE government yesterday refused to back down from its plans to increase premiums charged for terrorism insurance, in spite of protests from the City, business organisations and insurers. Mr Neil Hamilton, the minister for corporate affairs, said 'there was no option' but to go ahead with the rate increases. Last month Pool Re, the government-backed reinsurance company, announced rises that would come into effect for all policies sold after July 1. Owners of the largest properties in areas most vulnerable to terrorist attack face increases of more than 300 per cent in premium rates. Mr Bernard Harty, the chamberlain of the Corporation of London, which manages about a third of properties in the City, said the increase would 'add to cost at a time of recession'. However, Mr Hamilton said that the insurance represented 'good value for money'. A building in central London valued at Pounds 100m would pay Pounds 144,000 for terrorism insurance, which he said was a relatively small amount compared to rental and other costs. Businesses in some areas will benefit from rate reductions, he added. Insurers fear that the rate rises could persuade many businesses to run the risk of not carrying insurance protection, and undermine the effectiveness of the Pool Re scheme. This was agreed last year after insurers decided to withdraw terrorism cover from standard commercial policies following bombings in the City. Matters have been complicated by the Bishopsgate bomb this year which exhausted funds collected to date by Pool Re. Increasingly, business appears to favour the addition of a compulsory levy to all insurance policies, spreading terrorism cover costs more widely across the country. Mr Harty said organisations attending a meeting at the Department of Trade and Industry yesterday were looking into alternative schemes that they hoped to present to Mr Hamilton before the end of the year.</p>

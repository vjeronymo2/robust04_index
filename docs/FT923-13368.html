			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (13): Ready to supply transplants - Profile of Nippondenso WHILE Japanese automotive components makers are moving with far greater caution to follow the country's vehicle makers into Europe than they did into North America, some of the Japanese industry's leading players are already establishing a substantial presence. This month Nippondenso, Japan's biggest automotive components maker, beginsproduction of air conditioners and heaters at its Pounds 65m UK plant at Telford, Shropshire. Production of ignition coils began at its Spanish plant in Barcelona last year, while in September volume output will begin in the UK on a new 250,000-a-year radiator assembly line. The facility has been built with an investment of around Pounds 16m at ND Marston, the former IMI Radiators business, acquired by the Japanese group for Pounds 25m in 1989. Nippondenso has established an important joint venture relationship in Europe with Magneti Marelli, Fiat's 66.5 per cent-owned automotive components subsidiary. The Italian company has taken a 25 per cent stake in NDM Manufacturing, the Telford air conditioner and heater plant, and in ND Marston. In return, Nippondenso has acquired a 25 per cent holding in the Magneti Marelli Italian-based subsidiary Borletti Climatizzazione. Nippondenso's latest move in Europe was to reach agreement last month with the Champion spark plug division of Cooper Industries of the US to expand the two companies' existing North American production link to Europe. Champion Spark Plug Europe in Belgium will begin producing conventional spark plugs designed by Nippondenso from August. The Japanese group will supply some of the materials and will market the finished products under its own brand name. Champion is expected to produce around 8m units a year for sale by Nippondenso in Europe. The build-up of Nippondenso manufacturing facilities in Europe coincides explicitly with the development of Japanese-owned car production. When Toyota and Honda, the Japanese car makers, begin production at their UK assembly plants later this year, they will be the two main customers for Nippondenso's UK-based air conditioner and heater plant. Mr Michio Ohiwa, managing director of Nippondenso International (UK), the holding company for the group's European manufacturing operations, says Nippondenso had a turnover in Europe of around Pounds 170m in 1991 based largely on imports from Japan. By 1995/96 - when both the Toyota and Honda car plants should be reaching their outlined capacities of 200,000 and 100,000 cars a year respectively - Mr Ohiwa forecasts the company's turnover in Europe should have tripled to more than Pounds 450m a year, of which local production could be around 50 per cent. The local content of the UK-produced air conditioners and heaters is expected to start at around 60 per cent (based on operating costs) rising to 75 per cent as volumes increase. Mr Ohiwa acknowledges it is proving difficult to develop a new customer base in Europe. Nippondenso has based its long-term European strategy, however, on deriving half of its sales from the Japanese transplants and half from the traditional European car makers (including Ford and GM). Nippondenso has strong backing for its international expansion. It is firmly anchored in the sphere of Toyota, financially probably the strongest of the world's car makers, which holds a 23.3 per cent stake in the company. Toyota, Japan's largest and the world's third largest vehicle maker, is Nippondenso's biggest customer, accounting for around 50 per cent of its turnover. The company's main strengths are in car heaters and air conditioners, which in 1990 accounted for 35.3 per cent of consolidated group sales of Y1,511.6bn (Pounds 6.4bn), and in electrical automotive and electronic control products which contributed 30.4 per cent of group sales. Fuel management systems accounted for a further 15.2 per cent of sales and radiators for 5.8 per cent. (Net profit peaked at Y63.1bn (Dollars 497m) in 1990, but pre-tax profits fell by around 25 per cent last year.) The share of net sales accounted for by car heaters and air conditioners has gradually fallen since the mid-1980s, as advances in electronics have led to a growing importance for fuel management products such as electronic fuel injection systems. Nippondenso dominates its domestic Japanese market capturing more than 40 per cent of many of the product segments in which it manufactures including 55 per cent of radiators, 51 per cent of air conditioners and 52 per cent of electronic fuel injection systems. At the same time it claims world market leadership for 11 of its product lines, including starters and alternators, radiators, car heaters and air-conditioning compressors, and windscreen washers. It is in second place in car air conditioners behind Harrison Radiators (a subsidiary of General Motors), in windscreen wipers, and fuel pumps and injectors for electronic fuel injection systems behind Robert Bosch of Germany, and in ignition systems behind Delco (a GM subsidiary). While Nippondenso's investment in manufacturing facilities in the US began in earnest in the mid-1980s - within two to three around 60 per cent of its North American sales will be derived from the local Japanese car plants and 40 per cent from the big three US car makers, GM , Ford and Chrysler - its incursion into Europe began in 1989. The first step was the announcement of an intended 50:50 joint venture in Spain for distributorless ignition coils with Valeo, the leading French automotive components maker. This was followed later that year by the acquisition of IMI Radiators, now re-named as ND Marston. In 1990, it disclosed plans for the Pounds 65m investment in the Telford air conditioner and radiator plant. The Telford plant is expected to have a workforce of more than 450 by 1995 when output is intended to reach 400,000 air conditioners and the same number of heaters a year. ND Marston has a workforce of around 1,000 producing mainly radiators and oil coolers, while the workforce at the Spanish ignition coil plant is expected to grow from 70 to 150-200 at full production. Nippondenso has tried all the obvious routes in Europe for foreign expansion: investment in a green field site with the Telford plant, acquisition with IMI Radiators, joint venture with Valeo in Spain and contract manufacturing with Champion. According to Mr Ohiwa the most favoured route remains the joint venture. The joint venture with Valeo in Spain ended prematurely last year, even before volume production began, because of Valeo's decision to pull out of the ignition sector with the sale of its operations to Sagem, the French electronics and defence group. The Spanish venture is now a wholly-owned Nippondenso subsidiary. Equally, the original takeover of IMI Radiators was dictated more by force of circumstances than design. Nippondenso was well into negotiations about a production agreement with IMI Radiators, when it was shocked to learn the company was for sale, and for sale by auction, an unusual business approach for Japanese. IMI Radiators was its first significant takeover worldwide. The subsequent burgeoning of its relationship with Magneti Marelli allowed it to get back on the favoured joint venture track, however, by bringing in the Italian company as a minority partner. Mr Ohiwa insists that Nippondenso is concerned not to create overcapacity in its market sectors in Europe, and that joint ventures offer the best way of establishing local production with the least disruption.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             JAPANESE AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS INDUSTRY 1989            Companies with sales of more than Dollars 1bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                        Dollars m Nippondenso                                                9,056 Bridgestone                                                8,799 Sumitomo Rubber                                            3,015 Sumitomo Metal                                             2,951 Aisin Seiki                                                2,898 Sumitomo Electric                                          1,970 Yazaki                                                     1,848 Diesel Kiki                                                1,757 Yokohama Rubber                                            1,664 Mitsubishi Electric                                        1,515 Koyo Seiko                                                 1,507 Hitachi                                                    1,500 Toyo Tire &amp; Rubber                                         1,362 Calsonic                                                   1,283 NTN                                                        1,275 Toyoda Gosei                                               1,258 NEC Corporation                                            1,159 Koiti Manufacturing                                        1,099 Atsugi Unisia                                              1,032 Asaki Glass                                                1,014 Nippon Seiki                                               1,006 Total                                                     48,968 Number of companies                                           21 Segment average                                            2,332  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

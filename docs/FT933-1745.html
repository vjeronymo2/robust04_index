			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Michelin slumps to FFr3.2bn loss MICHELIN, the world's largest tyre manufacturer, plunged to a net loss of FFr3.19bn (Dollars 567.6m) in the first six months of the year. It blamed the recession in its European markets and exceptional charges related to an ambitious cost-cutting plan. The company, one of France's largest industrial groups, said the sharp decline, from net profits of FFr820m in the first half of 1992, largely reflected the impact of a FFr2.64bn provision for a rationalisation programme. The scheme, announced in April, is aimed at cutting costs by FFr3.5bn, or 10 per cent of the total, over the next two years. Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, finance director, said that the group had decided to take all the restructuring costs in the first half of the year. 'We wanted to remove all uncertainty,' he said. Even without the impact of exceptional charges, however, the group suffered a sharp downturn. Operating profits fell 71 per cent, to FFr793m, on sales down 12 per cent to FFr30.62bn. Michelin shares slipped FFr2.7 to FFr174.6. The fall at the trading level was attributed to the depressed international demand for cars and trucks. Michelin said the recovery in the US market had failed to offset a sharp fall in European and Japanese sales. In the European market alone, car production fell 16 per cent in the first six months, compared with last time. Output of trucks and commercial vehicles fell by about 27 per cent. The UK was the only country to register an improvement. 'We have to be prepared for a long-term crisis,' warned Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere. He said the cost-cutting measures - which will reduce the workforce to about 122,000 from the current 130,000 by the beginning of 1995  -would strengthen the competitiveness of the group and free cash to cover investments and reduced debts. In spite of the difficult economic environment, the company reported some encouraging signs. The market for replacement tyres - which are sold at about twice the price of tyres which go directly to car manufacturers - had seen an improvement in the second quarter. Demand in the US continued to improve, although competition remains intense. Michelin said it expected to report a profit in the US in 1994, after a loss this year. Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere expressed confidence that the group's debts could be maintained at the current FFr29.9bn, because of productivity improvements. However, he said it was 'urgent that interest rates be brought down' to ease the company's financial burden. A one percentage point cut in France, Germany and Spain would reduce financial charges by about FFr150m, according to the finance director. Industry analysts said that the first-half performance was largely in line with expectations. However, until consumer confidence improved in Michelin's principal European markets, the outlook for trading would remain gloomy. The need for the company to reduce stock levels in the second half is also expected to affect capacity utilisation and profitability.</p>

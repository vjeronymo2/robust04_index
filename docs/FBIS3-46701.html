			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter O Yong-hwan on the research report "The </F> Environment for Reunification and North-South Relations," issued  on 3 December by the Research Institute for National  Reunification, affiliated with the National Unification Board  (NUB)]    [Text]  <H5>  The World Situation </H5>   The world order will further assume an aspect of  multilateralism in 1994. Accordingly, it is expected that the  United States will be in favor of the trends toward pluralism;  that the regional powers' right of speech will be strengthened;  and that the roles of international institutions and  international organizations, including the United Nations, will  be enhanced.    Powerful countries will constantly make efforts for  disarmament, including cutting nuclear weapons. However, the  regional arms race will be intensified, because uncertainty may  take place as a result of the weakening of the influence of the  United States and Russia. In this connection, the need for  multilateral cooperation to cope with the issue concerning  regional security will be raised.    In particular, because of the relative economic stagnation  of  the United States and the European Community (EC) and because of  the rapid economic growth of the East Asian countries, the world  order cannot but become more multilateral.    It is expected that the settlement of the Uruguay Round (UR)  negotiations and the establishment of the World Trade  Organization (WTO) will promote the free trade system in the  international economic order.    In addition, as the atmosphere for security and economic  cooperation is heightened in international society,  international concern and cooperation toward the environment,  narcotics, and terrorism--the factors traditionally irrelevant  to security--will be increased.    Accordingly, in order to stably manage the world's security,  economy, and other factors traditionally irrelevant to security,  international society's cooperation and the leadership of  advanced countries, including the United States, will be more  necessary.  <H5>  The Situation of Northeast Asia </H5>   The factors of constant tension--including the enhanced  roles  of Japan and China, the regional arms race, the instability of  Russia, and the North Korean nuclear issue--exist in Northeast  Asia.    However, the relations among the four powers in the region,  which have been important in stabilizing the regional order,  will be improved. Accordingly the atmosphere for cooperation  among the four powers will be maintained.    In connection with the issue concerning security, it is  expected that U.S.-Chinese relations, Japanese-Chinese  relations, and U.S.-Japanese relations, which have become three  pivots in maintaining the Northeast Asian order since the end of  the Cold War, will be developed to promote cooperation.    In particular, because since September 1993, the United  States has strengthened cooperation with China, including the  revision of a hard-line policy against China and because China  has also positively promoted the improvement of its relations  the United States, there will be considerable progress in  U.S.-Chinese relations this year.  <H3>  The Atmosphere for Cooperation Among the Four Powers Will Be  Maintained </H3>   Taking into consideration the roles of the United States and  China in Northeast Asia, the improvement of the relations  between the two countries will have a positive influence on the  stability of the regional situation.    It is expected that because of the settlement of the UR  negotiations and because of the agreement on establishing the  Trade and Investment Committee in the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC), economic exchange among the Northeastern  Asian countries will be further expanded.    However, because the United States may put more  market-opening pressure on regional countries which may enjoy  great economic booms, trade friction between the United States  and regional countries may take place.    It is expected that such an atmosphere in Northeast Asia  will  have a positive influence on the reunification environment  rather than a negative influence.    The development of relations among the four powers--United  States, Japan, China, and Russia--will contribute to resolving  North Korea's nuclear issue and establishing peace in the  region. The development of the relations among the four powers  will play a positive role in leading North Korea to open its  door.    The fact that the neighboring four powers are in favor of  maintaining the present situation on the Korean peninsula while  North Korea wants to resolve the issue concerning the Korean  peninsula, including the nuclear issue, through negotiations  with the United States rather than direct negotiations with the  ROK, may be a stumbling block to improving North-South relations.  <H5>  North Korea's Inner Situation </H5>   Above all, it seems that in political domains, North Korea  will constantly intensify the unity around the leader [suryong]  and the implementation of the 10-point program of great unity of  the whole nation.    To consolidate the system for Kim Chong-il's power  succession, North Korea will constantly strengthen its  idolization work for Kim Chong-il. Accordingly, there is a  possibility that Kim Chong-il may be appointed chairman of the  party military commission.    Internally, as to the issue concerning the  agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first  economic policies, North Korea may fully encourage farmers and  workers to invigorate the stagnant economy. Externally, North  Korea may promote a limited openness to induce foreign capital  and technology.    At the same time, it is expected that to minimize a bad  influence caused by the change of the neighboring environment,  North Korea may fully hold rallies of all kinds of social  organizations in a bid to strengthen internal social control.  <H5>  The Strengthening of Internal Social Control </H5>   However, because of the influx of overseas information  through openness, social and economic deviation may be increased  gradually in North Korea.    In the meantime, it is expected that regardless of economic  stagnation, North Korea may adhere to a policy giving priority  to the Army to strengthen Kim Chong-il's authority.  <H5>  North Korea's External Relations </H5>   Based on their traditional friendly relations, North Korea  and China will continue to strengthen political relations,  economic exchange and cooperation, and military exchange.  However, to promote sustained economic development, China may  seek to change benefactor-type relations based on ideology into  give-and-take cooperative relations.    North Korean-U.S. relations will depend upon the progress in  the negotiations over North Korea's nuclear issue. Taking into  consideration the two sides' will to avoid catastrophe, North  Korean-U.S. relations may be positively developed.    Accordingly, it seems that North Korea and the United States  may discuss the issue of enhancing the dialogue level according  to the holding of the third round of the North Korean-U.S.  high-level talks, the issue of promoting economic cooperation,  and the issue of expanding the exchange of people.    The rapid development of North Korean-Russian relations may  be difficult. However, according to Russia's policy based on  actual interest, the economic exchanges between the two  countries will be improved gradually. At the same time,  regardless of the readjustment of the military allied relations,  military exchange and cooperation will be maintained between  North Korea and Russia.    North Korean-Japanese relations will be improved politically  and economically both.    In particular, it seems that the North Korean-Japanese  negotiations to establish diplomatic relations, which have been  brought to a deadlock since the eighth round of the talks, will  be resumed. Accordingly, the economic exchange between the two  countries may become actually brisk.  <H5>  North Korea's Strategy Toward the South </H5>   This year, there may be not a considerable change in North  Korea's strategy toward the South, including its existing policy  on the theory of excluding the South Korean Government and its  reunification tactics.    Accordingly, North Korea will denounce the South Korean  Government by using various propaganda means and will constantly  agitate the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification,  the National Alliance of Youths and Students for the Country's  Reunification, and the Alliance for the ROK Youths. However,  because the ROK movement circles have been weakened since the  civilian government was launched, because the United States and  Japan have put pressure on North Korea to resume North-South  dialogue, and because the neighboring environment has changed,  North Korea may attempt to change its tactics while adhering to  its basic strategy of revolutionizing the South.    In other words, as a tactic for holding the third round of  the North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, North Korea may propose  that "the pannational council for forming a reunified state" in  which the South Korean Government and other figures of all  strata participate be formed.    In addition, it is highly likely that as a tactic for  demonstrating its legitimacy, North Korea may propose that "a  scholastic fact-finding team for King Tangun," in which the  South Korean Government figures and other figures from all  strata participate, be formed.  <H5>  North-South Relations </H5>   Above all, it seems that even though a point of compromise  may be found through North Korea's acceptance of the ad hoc  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in  1994, the stage for ensuring the transparency of the nuclear  issue will not be reached.    Accordingly, it is highly likely that North Korea's nuclear  issue will be a stumbling block to improving North-South  relations this year.    As to North-South dialogue, various issues which have been  caused by the North Korean systems unrest, the nuclear issue,  and the North's hard-line policy toward the South, may make it  difficult to reach a point for North-South reconciliation.    In connection with North-South dialogue, in case North Korea  accepts the IAEA's inspections, the North and the South will  promote talks to exchange special envoys. However, taking into  consideration North Korea's pretentious dialogue strategy, it is  highly likely that in connection with the issue concerning the  exchange of special envoys, North Korea may avoid discussing  agenda related with nuclear issues, including North-South mutual  inspections.    In addition, even though North-South dialogue is resumed to  reopen the channel for North-South high-level talks and to  implement the North-South Basic Agreement, North Korea may avoid  implementing the basic agreement. This is because North Korea  has actually denied the channel for high-level talks through its  proposal for the exchange of special envoys and it is concerned  about the possibility of unrest caused by brisk exchange and  cooperation.    Accordingly, even if a point of compromise is smoothly  reached in North Korean-U.S. negotiations, the stage for fully  implementing the basic agreement may not be reached.    North-South economic exchange and cooperation will depend  upon the progress of the negotiations over the nuclear issue.  However, if North Korea assumes the attitude to accept nuclear  inspection, North-South economic exchange and cooperation will  be brisk.    Even if North-South economic exchange becomes brisk, taking  into consideration North Korea's lack of foreign currency and  the backwardness of its production capacity, the rapid  development of North-South economic cooperation may be  difficult. However, it is expected that if processing-for-wages  trade [imgagong kyoyok] smoothly develops, the North and the  South will launch a small-scale joint venture in the light  industry field at the Nampo industrial complex.    North-South social and cultural exchanges may be expanded  gradually. However, it is highly likely that North Korea may  avoid discussing and delaying the issue concerning separated  family members.</p>

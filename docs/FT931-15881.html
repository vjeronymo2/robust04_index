			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Hungary sees end to 3-year economic slide HUNGARY'S Finance Ministry has forecast an export-led economic upturn and rising investment in 1993 which will halt the precipitous slide in output of the last three years. The authorities predict gross domestic product will stabilise this year and could grow by up to 3 per cent. This follows a cumulative fall in GDP of nearly a fifth between 1989 and 1992. However, Mr Mihaly Kupa, the finance minister, warned yesterday against premature optimism, saying the burst in consumption in the last quarter had much to do with pre-empting price rises due to VAT changes from January 1. The timing of the rebound is important to Hungary's government. The ruling conservative coalition is approaching parliamentary elections in 1994, facing voters dissatisfied with its economic record and a daunting gap in the opinion polls. Mr Kupa's goal of 'healthy but not forced growth' ties in with the official expectation that investment growth of 2-6 per cent and export growth of 5-7 per cent will drive the recovery. The rosy prognosis for investment however presupposes an acceleration of privatisation and a continuing decline in interest rates, which remains uncertain.</p>

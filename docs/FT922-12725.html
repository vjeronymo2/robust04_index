			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / South Korea and China close to diplomatic links CHINA and South Korea are moving closer to establishing diplomatic relations after a visit to Beijing this week of Mr Lee Sang-ock, the South Korean foreign minister. Mr Lee is attending a United Nations gathering on economic development in Asia, but the issue of normalisation between the two countries is expected to be prominent in discussions with Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart. Economic ties between the two countries have been rapidly expanding, with South Korea's recent approval for the Bank of China to establish a branch in Seoul a measure of the growth since the opening of trade offices in both capitals. The volume of trade between China and South Korea totalled Dollars 5.7bn last year when each granted the other most-favoured-nation trade status. Political differences have kept them apart. China has backed the North since partition of the peninsular after the second world war and the US has been patron to South Korea through the cold war decades. North Korea is certain to be unhappy about the prospect of political ties between its former 'closer than lips and teeth' ally, China, and its bitter political and ideological enemy. The South Korean foreign minister is attending the 48th session of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which opened in Beijing yesterday with a speech from Chinese Premier Li Peng. The meeting is the first UN major forum to be hosted by China in four decades. Li Peng told the 700 delegates to ESCAP, originally called the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East when it was founded in Shanghai in 1947, that it had returned to its original home.</p>

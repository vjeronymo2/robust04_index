			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Swedish industry says enough is enough - Robert Taylor explains how proposals to reduce energy taxes threaten to break up the government The future level of Sweden's energy taxes on industry, currently the highest in the world, is threatening to provoke a political crisis this spring and the possible break-up of the country's non-Socialist coalition government elected last October. Olof Johansson, the environment minister and Centre party leader, is threatening to resign from the cabinet if his colleagues decide to push ahead with proposals to make drastic cuts of up to SKr4bn (Pounds 385m) in Sweden's energy taxes on industry. The sudden outburst from Johansson has focused national attention on Sweden's use of energy taxes both as an instrument of economic policy to raise revenue and an incentive for manufacturers to reduce the pollution they cause. The non-Socialist coalition is coming under enormous pressure from industrialists who argue the current level of energy taxes is pushing up their costs at a time when they are in deep recession. A government-commissioned inquiry into the taxation of energy use in industry published two months ago has added weight to industry's argument. Under the chairmanship of Professor Lennart Hjalmarsson from Gothenburg's national economy institute, the inquiry's conclusions make unpalatable reading for those who believe high taxes are a powerful weapon to encourage industry to deal more rigorously with pollution. 'Energy taxation policy must be seen as part of a long-run growth policy and should not contribute to a further worsening of Sweden's long-run productivity problems,' the report argues. It suggested that the total abolition of energy taxes on Swedish industry would increase industrial production especially in the basic industries to the tune of SKr20bn and create 10,000 more jobs. The study drew particular attention to the harmful impact of energy taxes on the country's cost-sensitive export industries. It estimated energy costs account for 8 per cent of the value-added sales in pulp and paper and 9 per cent in mines and quarries. The total energy tax bill for Swedish industry totalled Skr6bn in 1990. The Swedish government is sympathetic to the proposals despite the attitude of its environment minister. Those who oppose such a sweeping change, however, are unlikely to give up their cause without a struggle. The country's powerful environmental lobby is determined to uphold the current energy tax levels on industry. 'Any step to cut the government's energy taxes would be interpreted in no other way than to suggest we don't care about environmental problems,' argues Stefan Edman, vice president of Naturskyddsforeningen, Sweden's society for nature conservation. The inquiry recommended an 80 per cent cut in energy taxes on industry with a uniform increase in general taxes on electrical energy and heating oil to meet the annual SKr4bn gross tax revenue loss that would be incurred. It also calculated that the energy tax per tonne of steel manufactured in Sweden adds SKr140 to its cost and SKr360 for special steel compared with a mere SKr4 in Germany, SKr9 in Britain and no charge at all in France. The Swedish forestry industry estimated earlier this week that it is paying as much as SKr1.2bn a year in energy taxes, which accounts for half of its current profits. The Swedish farmers organisation LRF is also critical of any move to implement Hjalmarsson's recommendations. 'Sweden's role as a trendsetter on environmental issues would be weakened and the risk is that on-going work to reduce carbon dioxide emissions would lose momentum with Sweden setting a bad example,' it argues. The environmentalists are worried that many companies might abandon any attempt to introduce anti-pollution measures if their energy costs fell. 'It would mean the most obsolete and inefficient companies would be able to compete more easily against their modern, cost effective competitors,' argues Edman. There is also a fear that the recommendations would deal a heavy blow to current attempts to promote biomass technology - energy generated from the burning of wood shavings - which is expensive at the moment. Many Swedish environmentalists hope biomass will become an important source of industrial and domestic energy and enable the country to start phasing out its nuclear power industry. They argue that employers would have less incentive to switch to biomass if alternative energy sources were cheaper than at present. In addition, the report warned that the high level of Swedish energy taxation threatens to lead to the relocation of industry outside the country and discourages inward industrial investment. Many opponents of cutting industry's energy taxes also dislike the idea of creating a wide price differential between the industrial and domestic uses of energy as individuals paid higher energy bills and industry enjoyed lower ones. Strong consumer resistance could be expected if industry is seen to be enjoying exemption from the burdens of paying more for their energy. At present the Swedish authorities accept that the current level of energy taxes is impossible to sustain for the whole of industry. An array of exemptions and modifications has been introduced to protect companies in areas of Sweden where unemployment is high or industry is vulnerable. As a result, in 1990 alone 103 companies were allowed energy tax reductions totalling SKr693.7m with nearly half that figure being accounted for by 37 plants in the pulp and paper sector. Nevertheless, employers argues that the industrial pollution problem must be tackled through co-ordinated international action. As the country's employers federation pointed out yesterday in its latest study of the impact of energy taxes on industry, Sweden accounts for only 10 per cent of the total sulphur pollution and 15 per cent of the nitrogen emissions falling on the country. The rest comes mainly over the Baltic sea from heavily polluted Poland, the former Soviet Union and eastern Germany. It is only through harmonising industry's energy tax levels across national frontiers that resolute action is possible to reduce industrial pollution and encourage companies to invest in cleaner production processes. This is why the Swedish government - notwithstanding Johansson's resignation threat  -remains keen to bring down levels of energy taxation on industry to harmonise with those planned for the EC which Sweden hopes to join in 1995.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Wealth of options for new economy Sir, Mr Christopher McCoy (Letters, September 10) commits the same error in logic as Lord Lawson ('A paean of praise to capitalism', September 4/5). That market societies have outlived centrally planned ones in Europe is self-evident. But we should not let this blind us to the workings of our economic system and trumpet its alleged moral superiority from the base of a false premise. I have argued that dynamic, economically efficient market societies are not built on stable families but in fact cause their break-up. There is plenty of evidence for that in North America and western Europe. To warn that free markets undervalue long-term social relationships is not to recommend we embrace the opposite, outdated extreme of socialism. There is a wealth of mixed options between laisser-faire and central command  -I would hope that we can evolve a mix that prizes and preserves cherished social institutions.

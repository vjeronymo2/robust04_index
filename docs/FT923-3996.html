			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Reduced costs help Plantsbrook jump 40% PLANTSBROOK Group, the UK's largest quoted funeral services company, formerly known as PFG Hodgson Kenyon, yesterday reported a 40 per cent increase in interim profits. The improvement was helped by a fall in administrative costs, lower interest charges following the March rights issue and a one-fifth rise in operating margins to 23 per cent. Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 3.51m to Pounds 4.91m on sales 7 per cent lower at Pounds 26.2m. Administration costs were cut by 16 per cent to Pounds 11.5m and interest charges fell from Pounds 2.03m to Pounds 1.34m. The interim dividend is maintained at 1p; fully diluted earnings per share were 4.31p. The group has now sold or closed 29 of the funeral homes bought in a burst of acquisitions in 1990 and 1991 which boosted debt and took gearing before the rights issue to 415 per cent. Gearing has now been reduced to 75 per cent from 108 per cent after the rights issue. The group is planning to focus on funeral homes in urban conurbations, a change from the policy that greatly expanded its network.</p>

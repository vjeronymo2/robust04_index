			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Vision of peace starts to flicker: Mideast peace talks have stalled since Yitzhak Rabin's election in June When Yitzhak Rabin meets President Bill Clinton in Washington today, he will present the US leader with a symbolic - if unoriginal - statuette of the dove of peace. Though Mr Clinton may be charmed by its elegance, many people in the Middle East may wonder whether it is an appropriate gift from a man whose commitment to push for peace in the region has been called into question since he was elected prime minister of Israel last June. Such were the hopes and expectations that accompanied Mr Rabin's triumph over the long-dominant Likud party and its obdurate leader, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, that it was not uncommon to hear the new premier compared as an agent of change with President F W de Klerk of South Africa. Mr Rabin himself spoke of reaching within nine months a critical first-stage agreement with the Palestinians on the keystone issue of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Now those nine months have almost passed and such a breakthrough does not seem much closer. Instead, Mr Rabin and Mr Clinton will discuss how to salvage the process of peace negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbours begun under Mr Shamir, but which has faltered since last December. Over the past three months, the talks have been derailed by Mr Rabin's decision in mid-December to expel summarily more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon following a spate of killings of Israeli soldiers by Moslem fundamentalists. The shock that the unprecedented expulsions caused has been compounded by a spiral of violence in the occupied territories that has pushed casualty tolls back towards the levels of the early days of the intifada, the five-year-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule. So far the Palestinians have refused an invitation by the US and Russia, co-sponsors of the peace process, to reopen negotiations next month. The Palestinians - some of whom had imagined that Mr Rabin might do for the West Bank and Gaza what French President Charles de Gaulle did for Algeria - express exasperation. 'Rabin is simply not ready to make peace,' says a senior West Bank leader. Instead of de Gaulle - or de Klerk - they see an old military foe who led such bitter campaigns against them as the mass expulsions of Arabs from the towns of Lydda and Ramle during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and the crushing defeat of the 1967 six-day war. But is the irascible Mr Rabin really little more than a tough ex-general who lacks the vital extra dimension of peacemaker? Certainly, he never could be described as a dove. In his own Labour party, he has long been the leader of its hawkish faction, scorning colleagues who would negotiate openly with the Palestine Liberation Organisation and accept, ultimately, Palestinian statehood in the West Bank and Gaza. He will never, say his aides, negotiate directly with what he calls 'the Tunis gang' - the Tunis-based PLO leadership of Mr Yasser Arafat - which most Arabs argue is as vital to the peace process in the Middle East as is the African National Congress to negotiated change in South Africa. But this is by no means the full story. Mr Rabin is prepared, in line with Labour policy, to cede 'land for peace' - that is, to return to Arab rule large portions of the West Bank and Gaza. He offers no shift on Israel's determination to maintain control over all of Jerusalem and its environs and he sees Palestinian sovereignty as being expressed through a union of sorts with Jordan, not independence. But he has made no bones about his belief that Israel can achieve peace only through making territorial compromises. Most strikingly, Mr Rabin has repeatedly said he is willing to sanction a significant Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights as the price for peace with Syria, Israel's most threatening neighbour. Since the election, he has been encouraged by what he sees as positive signals from President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus - and discouraged by the lack of progress on the West Bank and Gaza. As a result, he has reversed his earlier strategy of dealing first with the Palestinians before negotiating seriously with Syria. Moreover, this apparent willingness to make concessions reflects Mr Rabin's sense that he is playing a historical role. He had a prominent part as a young commander in Israel's fight for independence in 1948; he was chief of staff when the West Bank, east Jerusalem, Gaza and the Golan were captured in 1967. Now, at 71, he wants to be the leader who achieves a broad-fronted peace. 'It is his last chance and he doesn't want to lose the chance,' says a close associate. However, while de Gaulle and de Klerk took decisive paths, Mr Rabin is hesitant over how to proceed. This stems in part from his fear of the opposition he might face from Israel's volatile and often violent right wing. At the same time, he seems to lack conviction about how far he should go. Mr Rabin's tightly knit circle of officials and advisers now says that Labour's election victory - which enabled it to form a coalition with the left-liberal group Meretz and the Shas religious party - did not constitute a mandate for a sharp change in policy. One called it 'an accident' in which concerns over the economy, corruption within the Likud and the swing vote of Russian immigrants delivered the shift from the Likud's unyielding 'greater Israel' stance to the 'land for peace' policy of Labour and Meretz. 'Rabin knows it better than anyone - that Israel still thinks Likud,' said the same official. The argument is that, in the absence of a dramatic event such as a summit between Mr Rabin and President Assad, public opinion will take time and careful education to change. A move has been made - mainly through speeches and interviews by Mr Rabin - to plant the idea among Israelis that important concessions will be needed on the Golan and, eventually, in the West Bank and Gaza as well. But the limits have not been defined, nor the time-scale set out. Mr Rabin has said that the opportunity for a breakthrough in the peace talks will not last long. He fears that Islamic fundamentalism and a resurgent Iran may pull regional developments in a more menacing direction for Israel if agreements are not reached soon - perhaps by the end of this year. The Israeli public, too, may have limited patience if he cannot fulfil his election promises of peace. What seems to be missing is a clear vision of what has to be done to achieve it, and a willingness to carry it through. 'Peace does not mean paradise, but if there is no peace there will be hell and Rabin is aware of that,' says Professor Yehoshafat Harkabi, an expert on the Arab-Israeli conflict and intelligence adviser to Mr Rabin. 'The problem is what price he is willing to pay for peace. I am suspicious that he himself is not sure how far he is prepared to go.'</p>

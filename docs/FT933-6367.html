			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar declines on rate news THE DOLLAR and European currencies weakened against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday after the Bundesbank surprised dealers by keeping its official interest rates unchanged, writes James Blitz. Expectations had been for a cut of up to  1/2 percentage point in the discount rate, which sets the floor for all German money market rates. The decision not to cut led to a firming in the D-Mark's value against most currencies in thin trading. But there was a strong impression that European currencies could start to show a clearer trend against the D-Mark when foreign exchange volumes pick up at the start of next week. In Europe, the Bundesbank announcement pushed the franc below the FFr3.50 level to the D-Mark in mid-afternoon after it had closed on Wednesday at FFr3.4720. It ended yesterday at FFr3.502. An analyst said France's unemployment figures for July, due out on Monday, would be important in determining how much pressure the currency market must put on the Bank of France to reduce rates. The Danish krone was also weaker, finishing at DKr4.125 per D-Mark, well below the previous close of DKr4.085. Sterling was 1 1/4 pfennigs higher at DM2.5150. It was the Belgian franc which, of all European currencies, caused most concern: it slid to a low of BFr21.35 per D-Mark from Wednesday's close of BFr21.12. The announcement by a group of Flemish economists earlier this week that the Belgian currency should sever its link with the D-Mark was the cause of the currency's slide. 'The Belgian franc is the European currency we worry about more than any other,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London. However, Mr O'Neill believes that it is the performance of the dollar/D-Mark currency pair that will dominate the foreign exchange market's attention over the next few weeks. Yesterday the dollar declined against the German currency, closing 2 pfennigs down on the day at DM1.6680, a nine-week low. Mr O'Neill thinks this trend could continue as dealers gradually turn their attention away from the newly relaxed ERM. In New York the dollar finished at DM1.6652. Poor US economic data, a large budget deficit and German intransigence continue to hang over the dollar. 'A move down to DM1.60 is certainly possible over the next three months,' said Mr O'Neill. 'And I have to say that I do not rule out the possibility of the dollar hitting new historic lows.' The Japanese authorities continued to take full advantage of the upswing in the dollar/yen rate, heavily intervening to support the US currency in Asian trading. The intervention helped the dollar to get back above the Y105 level, but Japanese intervention was ineffective in a thin market, and the dollar closed at Y104.40 from a previous Y104.90. It ended in New York at Y104.35.</p>

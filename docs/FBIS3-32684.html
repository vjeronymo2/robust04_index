			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon </F> Carpio with unidentified reporters in Guatemala City; place and  date not given; from the "Telepress" newscast -- live]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Reporter] The defense minister  said yesterday that political sectors had approached military  headquarters days before the 28 January referendum for the  purpose of promoting a coup d'etat. Can you identify the  political sectors involved and what are your views on this issue?    [De Leon] Unfortunately, Guatemalan history contains  numerous  incidents such as these which someday, I believe, we will  overcome precisely by strengthening the democratic system; we  will forget that the word coup d'etat exists, but we are still a  long way from that. Indeed, I find it embarrassing for  civilians and for myself as president and as a civilian, that  civilian politicians knocked at the headquarters doors, and that  it was the military officers who turned them away, so to speak.    Unfortunately, as the defense minister said, we do not have  sufficient evidence to take them to court for this action which,  of course, constitutes a crime. Knocking at the doors is a  phrase that does not apply exactly to this topic, but it is true  that there have been rumors to the effect that certain  politicians attempted to take advantage of the circumstances.  Fortunately, as I said recently, the officers of the Guatemalan  Army are professionals who are fully convinced of their role  within the democratic system. Therefore, I repeat, today more  than ever in Guatemalan history, there is absolutely no  possibility of a disruption of institutional order.    This proves the position held by the constitutional Army  which recently, on 25 May for example, gave tangible proof of  its adherence to the mandates and decisions of the  Constitutionality Court. The Army, the same as other sectors of  Guatemalan society, strengthened the democratic process. The  circumstances prevail today; that is why I said today that I am  devoted to governability, economic and social issues, a  broad-based national agreement, and basic issues because  institutionality has been saved.    We have managed to strengthen institutionality over the past  seven or eight months since the events of 25 May, which also  strengthens the democratic system, but we must strengthen it  even more. That is one of the goals of the broad-based national  agreement but, I reiterate with regret, there are Guatemalans  who still believe they can resort to coups d'etat but,  fortunately, the Armed Forces clearly understand the role it  must play in a democratic system. Therefore, I am dismissing  the possibility of a coup. The people would not tolerate such a  thing and just imagine the international isolation we would  suffer. Therefore, I have totally dismissed the possibility of  such an action.    This does preclude the possibility that individuals who were  dismissed from the Army may have made certain remarks and  started these rumors, and that civilians supported them in the  hope of succeeding. Fortunately, however, things never got past  the rumor stage, and things are going to remain this way because  at this time there is no room for coups, at least in Guatemala.    [Reporter] Who were the persons involved?    [De Leon] If I knew that they would be standing trial right  now.    [Reporter] You have spoken of politicians; can you speak of  the involvement of any political parties?    [De Leon] No. There have been references to politicians  [words indistinct] civilians. [laughs] That description would  be the traditional [words indistinct] for them but they are  politicians after all.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [De Leon] Yes. If we knew who they were they would be  standing trial.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [De Leon] No, no, no. Rumors were spread and because of the  atmosphere that prevailed certain politicians tried to take  advantage of them. [Words indistinct] at present we do not have  any (?evidence). If we did you could rest assured that those  individuals would be standing trial for the crimes allegedly  perpetrated. No, no, I believe you should erase the term coup  d'etat from your minds. There is no room here for coups and the  people behind the rumors have probably had their last hurrah.  [passage omitted]</p>

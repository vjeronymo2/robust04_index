			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with P.M. Nazarov, manager of the Maritime Kray </F> department of the Pension Fund, by I. Permyakova, UTRO ROSSII  correspondent; place and date not given: "Why This Pension Fund  Is Necessary"]    [Text] A decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian  Federation on the establishment of the Pension Fund of Russia  (PFR) was adopted on 27 December 1991, and a pertinent statute  was developed. The obligation of the fund is "to ensure the  collection of insurance premiums necessary to finance the  payment of state pensions, while fully making good use of the  rights granted to it for these purposes." But it was necessary  for this to organize a state data bank by the end of 1992 on the  payers of insurance premiums to the PFR....to initiate  preparatory work on the organization of an individual account of  mandatory insurance premiums coming in from working citizens,  keeping in mind in the future to increase the size of state  pensions owing to the resources they contribute.    By no means all of our readers understand what the  basic functions of the Pension Fund include and what  specifically required its creation, and therefore I. Permyakova,  our correspondent, turned for an explanation to P.M. Nazarov,  the manager of the Maritime Kray department of the Pension  Fund.    "Our fund," explained Pavel Mikhaylovich, "is federal, and  therefore, we transfer a considerable part of the collected  resources to Moscow. But the gist of it is in the following.  According to the law, each employer must participate in the  establishment of the PFR, just as every employee must who is  accepted for work. In addition, the employer pays 28 percent of  his income monthly, and the worker, 1 percent. This is done  somewhat differently in the civilized countries of the West:  When a person assumes one or another position, an account is  opened in his name in an appropriate insurance company to which  a certain percentage of wages is transferred and frozen there  until the worker goes on pension. In Finland, for example, a  person does not have to go for his social security after he  becomes a pensioner: They will come to his home and process  everything. If he transfers from one enterprise to another, his  personal account follows him, as before remaining inviolable.  It is not this way in our country: Monetary inflation does not  make it possible for us to operate in the European fashion;  money is being devalued. Therefore, this kind of solution was  found: Collect 28 percent from any organization and 1 percent  from the person who works in it. It turns out that the one who  is working now provides for the old age of the generation that  has left for a rest.... And our main task is to finance the  payment of pensions.    [Permyakova] So that it turns out: It is not enough that  you work for the people of Maritime Kray--you also finance  Moscow?    [Nazarov] I will explain: There are 88 territorial  (regional) okrugs in Russia. There are such oblasts and krays  (Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays and Tambov and Kursk Oblasts, and  some others) that were always subsidized, but in the Far East  there are very many people who work here (especially fishermen),  but who are registered in the Western part of Russia. They will  not be able to make use of the resources transferred from  enterprises to the local Pension Fund, owing to which a specific  surplus is established that we transfer to the center for their  maintenance. Actually, in [line of text missing] more than 50  billion rubles [R].    [Permyakova] Well, nonetheless, was there a need to  establish your fund?    [Nazarov] Judge for yourself. Previously, resources for the  payment of pensions were placed in the budget. But inasmuch as  the social sphere was always financed according to the residual  principle--the resources set aside for its needs were spent on  all kinds of things!--there was practically no money left to  fortify the welfare of the indigent strata of the population.  In connection with the changes in the economy of the country,  the idea came up about separating the pension fund from the  budget, so that no one would be able to use it for unplanned  purposes.    [Permyakova] Did I understand correctly that owing to the  collection of resources, the Pension Fund can increase the  amount of payments to groups of the population that are poorly  protected against inflation?    [Nazarov] Correct. But, unfortunately, we are still  collecting much less than we could. After all, many enterprises  are on the brink of bankruptcy. Many large enterprises are our  debtors: R8 billion for the fishermen, R5 billion for  enterprises of the defense complex and R4 billion for the  Ministry of Defense, and R3 billion for the nonferrous metals  industry--for a total of R26 billion. Under an optimal variant,  we receive up to R40 billion. Our task consists precisely of  collecting, controlling, and using these resources. On the  whole, we transfer up to R27 billion to social protection  organs. We levy fines on enterprises that hide their  indebtedness, and we direct the sums received for social  protection [one or two lines missing] last year we gave R1.768  billion for these purposes. In addition, R1.325 billion went  for rendering material assistance; for health improvement and  convalescence of participants and invalids of the Great  Patriotic War--R56 million; and for boarding school houses and  shelters and for their reconstruction and the construction of  new buildings of this designation--R121 million. The Red Cross  and the organization of medical-social assistance to solitary  people and people of old age at home received R10 million. One  hundred million rubles were given directly to social security  departments.    [Permyakova] In light of the inflation, these figures could  prove to be inadequate....    [Nazarov] This year we plan to transfer R6 billion for all  such needs, and a billion was already given for the first  quarter by 20 February.    [Permyakova] It is no secret that many enterprises are  really in catastrophic condition and are increasing the  percentage of so-called hidden unemployment, when people are  forcefully sent on leave without maintenance. How can they  settle accounts with you?    [Nazarov] We take all of this into consideration. If an  enterprise is trying to be honest with us and with its own  workers, we give an extension. But those who have enough money  both for wages and construction, but who evade payment of the  pension tax--we fine these harshly, and Moscow is requiring  tough measures from us. In 1993, we exacted R3.869 billion from  violators. At the same time, the government decided to forgive  the indebtedness of those enterprises [line missing] that cannot  pay their workers even the minimum wage....    [Permyakova] Pavel Mikhaylovich, the attention of our  readers was attracted by a note in one of the city newspapers,  "Do not take money from grandmothers." Some people understood  this to mean that the Pension Fund does not support them.... Is  it possible that the notorious Pension Fund also takes from old  people?    [Nazarov] In no way! A pension tax is not collected on any  kind of stipends, benefits, and pensions! In this case, the  question exactly concerns the concealment of one's incomes and  corresponding indebtedness to the Pension Fund of a large number  of enterprises, owing to which pensioners also do not receive  what they have coming to them. But, by the way, the Pension  Fund itself does not engage either in the payment of pensions,  or in rendering social assistance to the indigent strata of the  population. These things, as I have already mentioned, are  handled by the social protection organs, but we finance them.  For the payment of pensions in the kray, R137.5 billion were  expended from PFR resources, and for social protection--R1.768  billion (while the note for some reason indicates a total of  R120 million, which constituted allegedly 60 percent of what was  planned). It should be known that only resources collected from  violators are directed to the social protection of the aged.  The work will be perfected, control will be improved on the  part of our employees, the sums of fines will be increased, and,  consequently, more resources will be directed to social  protection [line missing] Pension Fund is established in order  that its resources go only for the needs of the people of scanty  means. This money is kept in banks; we do not see the cash, it  can be used temporarily only by the bank, and last year we  received R1.560 billion from banks for the use of our resources,  and we paid various taxes of R510 million into the budget.    [Permyakova] Pavel Mikhaylovich, one more, indelicate  question, which an American would not answer. But life is life,  and as long as the majority is infringed upon in its earnings,  people cannot help but be interested in what the average wage of  your workers is.    [Nazarov] Well, it is a good and lawful question. First, I  will note that we do not set the wages for ourselves; they are  established by Moscow--by the federal organs of social  administration. Yes, we have a decent wage. It is R275,000,  and we hope that it will grow. We take into account years of  service, and we add on bonuses. For what? Workers of the  Pension Fund monitor 26,000 enterprises of various types [two  lines missing] 8,551, and of these, violations of established  payment procedures were disclosed in 7,516 (and this is 88  percent of the number that were checked!) and about R4 million  was recovered! Each worker of our fund has to make 50  checkups--almost as much as there are weeks in a year. Numerous  beginning commercial structures try especially hard to evade tax  payments, and we find them through the banks and tax  inspectorates. It happens that they tear up our acts there,  threaten and taunt us, muddle up accounts, although all that  they have to do is to calculate wages, transfer 28 percent from  the monthly incomes of enterprises and 1 percent from each  worker. But no, almost everyone is a violator. But after all,  each of us will sooner or later move into the pensioner  category....    [Permyakova] Have you, Pavel Mikhaylovich, been associated  with the financial structure for a long time?    [Nazarov] I am a financier to the marrow of my bones. I  graduated from a financial institute more than 30 years ago. I  worked in a bank for 13 years as chief [line missing] of the  financial administration of the kray executive committee, and  from 1991 I became the manager of the Pension Fund. I was born  in Amur Oblast, and I have been living in Vladivostok since 1955.</p>

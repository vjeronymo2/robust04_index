			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- China encourages its  automobile companies to establish transdepartmental and  transregional giants by merger, annexation or setting up stock  companies.    According to a new policy, four or five auto giants  competitive in the world market will be set up by the end of  this century. The output of these giants is expected to produce  70 percent of China's total.    During the past 40 years China has put about 34 billion yuan  into the auto industry.    Statistics show that China's annual output capacity of 1.3  million automobiles is distributed across more than 120 plants.  With low-quality products and high production costs, China's  auto industry can meet neither the demand of domestic market nor  the challenge of international competition.    According to experts, when the annual output increases from  1,000 to 50,000 at an auto company, the production costs will  decreases by 40 percent; when output increases to 10,000, costs  decrease by another 15 percent; when output is 20,000, costs  decrease by a further 10 percent; and when the annual output  hits one million, the production costs will decrease by about  another 10 percent.    Most of China's auto companies do not reach the minimum  effective annual output scale of 60,000 to 100,000, except for  eight major enterprises.    According to the policy, China will not approve any new  projects for assembling vehicles in the coming few years.  Attention will be paid to lowering production costs and to  extending production scale in the existing companies.    China is expected to have 20 million automobiles running by  2000, of which 4.5 million will be sedan cars. This indicates  that China's auto output during this period will hit three  million, including 1.5 million sedan cars.    To reach the target, the only way out for China's auto  industry is mass production, experts said.    To cope with the competition in the domestic and  international markets, some large auto companies in China have  begun to look for partners for co-operation or targets for  annexation nationwide in recent years.    Auto industries in the developed countries such as the U.S.  and Japan have experienced mergers and annexation in the course  of their development. China's auto industry will do the same in  order to become a pillar industry, the experts said.</p>

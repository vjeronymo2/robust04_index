			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business SNARK" file: "Transcaucasia Economic </F> News"]    [Text] Baku--Azerbaijani Ministry for Economics submitted  the revised forecast of social-economic development for 1994 to  the Ministry of Finance.    By the Milli Majlis proposal, this forecast has to be used  by  the Ministry of Finance to correct the budget draft.    According to the forecast, the inflation in 1994 reaches 600  percent. The first option outlined 240 percent inflation.    A Finance Ministry official told that his department does  not  accept the projected inflation level as inadequate to the real  economic situation. Only during the first quarter of the  current year, the inflation exceeded 300 percent, while the  production output reduced for 25 percent.    On the basis of 600-percent level, the Economy Ministry  expects the GNP at amount of 910 billion manats, and national  income of 677 billion manats. The initial forecast gave  respectively 313 and 272 billion manats.    A conference with participation of the Milli Majlis  commissions on economic policy and budget along with the  corresponding ministries took place in the Azerbaijani Supreme  Soviet.    There was discussed the economic prognosis for 1994,  submitted by the Economy Ministry. The prognosis was rejected  because of its "unreality." The prognoses on the inflation rate  (600 per cent) and the rate of National profit rose the greatest  censure of the conference participants.    Meanwhile, the specialists of the Finance Ministry forecast  a  1000 per cent inflation rate in 1994. The prognoses were sent  for revision.</p>

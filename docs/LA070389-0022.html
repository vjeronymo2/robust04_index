			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TAMMIE GREEN'S FIRST LPGA WIN IS A MAJOR TRIUMPH  </P> <P> Tammie Green made her first LPGA victory a big one, holding off Pat Bradley and  Betsy King for a one-shot victory at the $600,000 du Maurier tournament in  Montreal, the third of the year's four majors.  </P> <P> Green, in her third year on the tour, shot a par-72 at the 6,261-yard  Beaconsfield Golf Club for a four-round total of nine-under-par 279.  </P> <P> Bradley, a three-time champion, matched the best score of the day and the  tournament with a 67 but could only manage a share of second with King, this  year's leading money-winner, who closed with a 70.  </P> <P> Patty Sheehan and 1979 winner Amy Alcott shot 69s and were next at 281.  </P> <P> Green, the 1987 rookie of the year, won $90,000 and has $172,821 in winnings  this year. Her previous best was second at last year's Sara Lee tournament and  this year's Dinah Shore, the first of the majors.  </P> <P> "It's like a big, dark cloud has just passed," Green said of her first LPGA  victory. "I've had this frustration of not winning one when I thought my game  was good enough to win. Then to win a major is the best way."  </P> <P> Mark McCumber and Peter Jacobsen finished in a tie after 72 holes and a 3  1/2-hour rain delay and will finish the $1 million Western Open golf tournament  at Oak Brook, Ill. with a sudden-death playoff today.  </P> <P> The two came down the stretch tied through the last three holes and decided not  to have the playoff for the top prize of $180,000 until this morning because of  darkness.  </P> <P> McCumber shot a final-round 69 for a 72-hole total of 13-under-par 275 and  Jacobsen had a 68 as both broke the Butler National Western record of 276 set  by Tom Weiskopf in 1982.  </P> <P> Paul Azinger shot a 69 and missed the playoff by one shot.  </P> <P> Briton Nick Faldo birdied the last hole in the final round of the $472,000  French Open golf tournament at Chantilly, France, for a one-under-par 69 and a  one-stroke victory to retain the title he has won four times.  </P></p>

Thereafter, increases in annual operating expenses will not exceed the annual rate of inflation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) As the marketing agent for Federal power, Western will participate in the decision making process with other resource agencies whose operating decisions significantly affect Federal power rate and repayment obligations whenever possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Proposals for construction of new facilities will be assessed using integrated resource planning principles and must meet at least one of three criteria before construction may begin:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Increased revenues from new facilities must exceed their annual cost over the cost-evaluation period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Customers must benefit sufficiently to support new facilities in spite of a possible rate increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The new facilities will be funded by non-Western sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Construction-Related Projections <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A customer organization has a series of questions about construction-related cost projections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some of the commentators said: .&blank;.&blank;. they have been unable to find support in the 1995 Work Program for a majority of the significant (>$100,000) additions and replacements included in the 1994 rate brochure and rate brochure PRS&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For a detailed outline of the budget process, Western refers the reader to earlier replies to questions about O&amp;M. To reiterate, the FY 1995 Work Program had, in many instances, higher cost projections than the FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission. Western has used the lower figures in the ratesetting PRS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of CRSP construction, this change dramatically reduced the cost projections. Table VI on pages 12 and 13 of the April 1994 Rate Brochure shows a $276 million decrease in budgeted power-related construction costs through FY 1998 between the FY 1995 Work Program (referred to in the brochure as the FY 1994 Congressional Budget Submission) and the FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission. Western has used the lower figure where it is considered reliable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (The commentor) has been unable to find support for the investments included in the Collbran/Rate Brochure PRS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is not possible to find the correlation between the investments in a budget document or work program and those in a PRS without some intermediate steps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The annual figures in the 1995 Work Program are only planned cash expenditures. Investments are large items, often taking more than 1 year to complete. The total spent on any one investment, then, is the sum of the annual expenditures shown in the work programs, plus any applicable IDC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western is required to record an investment in a PRS in the year that it becomes operational. This permits the establishment of the proper repayment period and begins the annual payment of interest on investment (due until the investment's cost is completely repaid). Future investments appear in a PRS in the year they are planned to be in-service, if that is within the 5-year budget window. Future investments (excluding future replacements) planned for completion at some time after the 5-year window are normally excluded from a PRS, unless legislation directs otherwise (as is the case with the CRSP's participating projects). Annual cash outlays for an investment that takes more than 1 year to complete have no counterpart in a PRS. Indeed, there may be several years of investment costs shown in work programs and budgets which do not appear in PRSs. However, the total sum, plus IDC, will appear in the PRS in the year when the item is anticipated to be operational.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is not unusual for the first future year in a budget document to show projections higher than those shown in the previous budget document for that same year. It is common to have obligated amounts at the end of the year just closed that do not get paid in that year. They are then carried over and added to the next year. Also, CWIP that has been completed, but that did not get moved to plant-in-service in the financial records, is carried over to the next year (with the assumption that it will be moved to plant-in-service at that time). This also adds to the total amount shown in the subsequent year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (The commentor's) Table 7 below uses information provided in response to WAPA/CREDA&hyph;76 to illustrate the differences between the 1995 Work Program and the PRS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

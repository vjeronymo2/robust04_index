Significant and wide-ranging steps toward financial and  taxation reform will affect the establishment of a socialist  market economic system, long-term national stability, and this  year's financial state and economic development. They are the  centerpiece of reform of the entire economic system. We must  work hard to ensure success.    Liu Zhongli said: Since reform and opening up, we have not  stopped reforming the financial and taxation systems. This has  played an important role in promoting economic development.  Constrained by the then-prevailing conditions, in our previous  reform we emphasized readjustment of the distribution structure  but failed to devote adequate efforts toward changing  mechanisms. As reform has deepened continuously, the failings  of the financial and taxation systems -- such as the irregular  tax revenue system, the irrational distribution structure, and  entrenched local interests -- have become increasingly  pronounced, and they came to the fore when we implemented last  year's budget. Therefore, faster financial and taxation reform  is not only urgently required for creating a socialist market  economic system but also for smoothing the relations of  distribution and for ensuring sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic development.    Liu Zhongli said: A financial and taxation reform package --  which encompasses reform of the taxation system, the tax-sharing  system, and the profit distribution system for state-owned  enterprises -- covers all main aspects of the financial and  taxation systems. The goal of reform is to change mechanisms,  and to establish a new financial and taxation management system  and operating mechanisms in keeping with the demands of  socialist market economic development. Specifically, the goal  is to smooth and regularize the relations of distribution  between the central and local authorities, and between the state  and enterprises; to improve the state's financial function; to  enhance the central government's macroeconomic regulation and  control; and to promote a beneficial economic circle and rapid  economic development in our country.    Liu Zhongli said emphatically: Comprehensive reform of the  financial and taxation systems can help coordinate various  reform measures and avert friction between the old and new  systems. He expressed the hope that all localities and  departments would actively publicize the policy among cadres and  people to dispel doubts, coordinate their actions with the  overall situation of reform and development, promptly uncover  and solve new problems in implementing reform measures, ensure  that all reform measures would be put in place without delay,  and achieve the desired results.    It is understood that all the study and report sessions  jointly held by the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department  and the other four departments have come to an end. Earlier,  leaders of relevant departments -- including Hong Hu, vice  minister of the State Economic Restructuring Commission; Zhou  Zhengqing, vice president of the People's Bank of China; Jin  Xin, director of the State General Administration of Taxation;  Liu Xiangdong, assistant minister of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation; Yao Zhenyan, vice minister of the State Planning  Commission; and Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the State  Council Research Office -- expounded the content, goals, and  major implications of reform of the financial, taxation,  banking, investment, and foreign trade systems. They had also  introduced, theoretically and practically, our country's new  ideas for future reform and development.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with People's Deputy Vasyl Durdynets by </F> UKRAYINSKA HAZETA correspondent Oleksandr Skoryna; place and  date not given: "Vasyl Durdynets Calls People's Deputies Toward  the `Center'"]    [Text] A deputy group called the "Center" has been set up  in the structure of the new Ukrainian parliament. Its initiative  core is headed by Vasyl Durdynets, a newly elected deputy and  formerly the deputy head of the Ukrainian Supreme Council of the  previous, twelfth convocation. Considering that a rather  "motley" public has come to "power" and that it probably will  not be easy to find a common language for all, the idea of an  apparently unifying "Center" is rather attractive and is very  much needed in our current conditions. In order to learn about  the Center in detail and firsthand, I met with Vasyl Vasylyovych  Durdynets. Our conversation was democratic, friendly, and, of  course, candid. First, it was pleasant to learn that Vasyl  Vasylyovych respects UKRAYINSKA HAZETA; second, I encountered a  true patriot of the Ukrainian state.    Over the four years of its work, said my esteemed  interlocutor, the Supreme Council adopted 402 laws and 1,108  decrees. This is a considerable volume of work. But people  appraise it, of course, not by the numbers but by the way these  documents are being implemented and are working to strengthen  the economy, legality, and law and order, for the social good of  the people, especially their security and standard of living. To  be honest, in making decisions on many problems the former  membership of the Supreme Council unfortunately gave preference  to corporate, departmental, regional, and political interests  rather than being guided by the interests of all the people. Of  course, pulling the blanket to one side this way could not  benefit the entire society. It would be wrong to continue such a  practice... Out of such considerations, the Center deputy group  was set up within the structure of our new parliament. It unites  the deputies who have come to the Supreme Council to do  constructive work. This strong, and, as was to be expected,  centrist bloc can take upon itself the main constructive  lawmaking activities.    [Skoryna] How?    [Durdynets] How? First, on the basis of coordinating the  positions of groups, factions, and individual deputies it can  recommend candidates for the Supreme Council's permanent  leadership bodies, the new government, work out coordinated  proposals, and decide on principal all-state problems.    Look, in the new parliament membership we have both the  extreme left and the extreme right. In order to avoid rocking  our already fragile state boat, we need a consolidating basis.  The people elected us to finally adopt such laws as would work  for their benefit, for the good of Ukraine. All of us without  fail will have to make this happen.    Our bloc is called "For Accord and Collaboration." When we  achieve accord, we will have collaboration. If there is no  accord between deputies of different political views,  directions, and interests, there will be no constructive  collaboration from the very first days of the work of the newly  elected Supreme Council.    By the way, why do I say "new convocation." There is  currently an idea to call the current Supreme Council not the  thirteenth but the first convocation. And I must say that there  are all the grounds for this, as well as the legal basis. We are  beginning a new count of the activities of the parliament of a  new state, elected on the basis of new laws.    [Skoryna] How do you form the membership of your group? What  is required of a deputy who wants to participate in its  activities?    [Durdynets] A deputy may read the program, which clearly  describes the group's goals and tasks, the conditions for  joining it, and its organizational basis. If he agrees with all  this, he submits an individual application indicating his  surname, name and patronymic, and the electoral district he  represents.    However, if over time a deputy in his practical activities  deviates from the obligations he undertook as part of becoming a  member of our association, at the general meeting we will bring  up the question of expelling him. Our work is built on  democratic principles and openness, but elementary discipline  and organization are also necessary. Without them, the group is  not going to last long...    [Skoryna] Vasyl Vasylyovych, you and I remember well with  what drive and how dynamically a group of deputies that  functioned under the name People's Council began its work within  the previous convocation of our parliament. Under the leadership  of its inspirer, they stayed after plenary sessions, labored  over new draft laws and initiative propositions until late at  night, set the tone by their organization, purposefulness, by  being specific in bringing up issues and preparing drafts of  various documents. Just as persistently, they brought each  undertaking to a logical end. After some time, however, the  drive began to diminish, and deputies began to split from the  group one after another. Will something like this not happen to  the newly created group?    [Durdynets] I hope that this will not happen. We are not  dragging anyone to join by force. Here is the program. If it is  in line with your own views, join in the work; if not--act at  your own discretion. Once again, nobody wants to keep anyone in  the group by force. But if you did agree to participate, then  you have to work conscientiously.    [Skoryna] That is, as I see it, by the very fact of joining  the Center group a deputy once again reaffirms to his voters  that he has come to the first parliament of independent Ukraine  not to engage in empty talk or pursue some sort of personal  political ambitions. That is, not so that he may show his face  on television, but to do painstaking, purposeful work for the  good of his electorate, and the good of the country.    [Durdynets] Exactly. And we, on our part, assist members of  our group in every way to gradually make good on their election  pledges. This is important for the authority of the deputy and  the Supreme Council. Voters can see, feel at their everyday  level that a change for the better is not just voted for but is  being implemented. And then he will know that his vote, his  instructions to his deputy, do play a role in this. We need to  work together to build an authority that will work for our  independent state, and a state that will work for the people.    [Skoryna] Vasyl Vasylyovych, I see in the list of the Center  group persons of, one may say, diametrically opposite views. You  have here Landyk and Zvyahilskyy, Yukhnovskyy and Pilipchuk,  Zhulinskyy, Yavorivskyy, and others. Will this not be another  attempt to harness to the same cart a swan, a crayfish, and a  pike? Will these people be able to work in the same key?    [Durdynets] I am convinced that they will because we at the  Center are united by a common goal. Today the greatest problem  for Ukraine is economic crisis. To overcome it, economists,  jurists, industrial managers, political scientists, scholars,  and government members must join forces. That is, all deputies  who want and can work constructively on documents either  submitted or initiated by us for the Supreme Council's  consideration. That is why we did not invite people to the group  individually--you, you, and you... We asked everyone who wants  to work together, for instance, with Academician Yukhnovskyy,  writer Yavorivskyy, the jurist brothers Kostytskyy... The people  who have gathered here are specialists of different profiles,  different political views. And I feel that they are united by a  common constructive idea--building a strong independent state.  For this we first need to build a strong economy, which will  provide people with the ability to work better, earn more, and  live better. This is the main point. Everything else is  secondary.    [Skoryna] I also think that it is time to free the Supreme  Council of political battles and move them to political clubs,  party meetings, newspapers, television, radio, and so on. We  have had enough verbiage in 70 years. Otherwise it is like it  happens in everyday life--a good housewife in an hour or two  manages to milk a cow, feed the pig and the chickens, and cook  borscht, while her neighbors have barely covered half the  village in their gossip in the same time. So it is with us:  Neighboring countries are striving to build their lives, while  we are still trying to figure out where to go and what to do.  Sometimes it is funny to watch all this, but more often it is  sad. That is why we need to salute you and the deputies who urge  their colleagues to get down to business. What concerns me and  many Ukrainians is another "center," the one created in the  parliament by the do-gooder Kuchma. What do you think about it,  Vasyl Vasylyovych? I figure that every parliament may have  different factions, but two centers... This is practiced only in  soccer...    [Durdynets] First, I would like to refrain from criticizing  them. I think they have already realized this: They worked up so  much publicity with their interregional reform bloc before the  elections... Gatherings, meetings, conferences, and so on, and  so forth. And how many deputy seats did they win? Only a few  here and there. However, we will collaborate with them if they  express willingness to unite on the basis of what I described  above... And the foundation of everything is to put the  interests of Ukraine first.    Our colleague Volodymyr Lanovyy was at our meeting, for  instance. He is putting together his own faction, but said that  he intends to collaborate with us in the same bloc. Chornovil  said the same. And the same goes for other faction leaders who  understand the need to unite...    [Skoryna] Please name the organizational core of your  Center.    [Durdynets] As you may have guessed, they are well-known  figures--Ivan Plyushch, Ihor Yukhnovskyy, Valeriy Cherep, Mykola  Zhulynskyy, Oleksandr Bandurka, Roman Shpek, Volodymyr Bortnyk.  Mykola Surgay, Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, Anton Buteyko... we  consult, coordinate our work... There is already a plan for the  first session. In addition to pressing organizational matters,  it is necessary, without wasting any time, to consider three  sets of priority questions. They are: the way of extricating the  country from the deep economic crisis (fundamental reform of the  monetary-credit and tax system, taking under control foreign  economic activities, issues of prices and price formation,  privatization, and so on).    Another set of issues is establishing order in the country:  ridding the apparat of corrupt, bureaucratic elements; curbing  speculation; and tough--and real, not just  lip-service--suppression of crime. And the third is control. So  that the laws and decrees of the Supreme Council work, are  implemented, instead of remaining, as often happens, mere  declarations.    Our state is in such shape that we have no right to spend  time on rallies, political quarrels, a tug-of-war. We have no  time left for "rousing to action." Therefore, I appeal to my  colleagues--people's deputies for whom our goals and views are  not foreign, who set their sights on constructive activities and  do not want to get bogged down in internal fights--to  consolidate all forces for everyday painstaking, concentrated  work. This what the people of Ukraine expect of the newly  elected parliament.</p>

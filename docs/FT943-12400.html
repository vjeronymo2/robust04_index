			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Rail passengers face 48-hour stoppage from noon Britain's railway network faces widespread disruption from noon today with the start of the first 48-hour stoppage in the seven-week-old signalling dispute. But last night Dr Brian Mawhinney, the new transport secretary, said he did not understand why the conflict could not be settled. 'All the elements exist to enable a settlement to be reached,' he claimed after a meeting with Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, which owns and maintains the railway network. 'The dispute can and must be resolved,' added Dr Mawhinney. He said that the current offer to the RMT transport union 'makes it hard to see why a resolution of this dispute should continue to be so elusive'. Yesterday, it was estimated by Mr Maurice Fitzpatrick, of the accountants Chantrey Vellacott, that the strike would cost the British economy around Pounds 330m this month or around two-thirds of 1 per cent of July's total gross domestic product. If the strike escalated to eight days a month into September it would reduce the full year GDP by about 0.2 per cent, he said. Railtrack said last night that about 30 per cent of the network would be covered by signalling operations over the strike period. It is estimated that a quarter of services will operate, including, for the first time, from London Victoria to Gatwick airport and from London Liverpool Street to Cambridge and Norwich. The two sides in the dispute were involved in a bitter exchange yesterday on whether the signalling services provided by supervisors and management during this week's strike would threaten railway safety. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT transport union's general secretary, said Railtrack could not maintain any service during the strike 'without compromising safety'. He added: 'Railtrack's safety guidelines this week are lower than they were last week and considerably diluted from when this dispute started.' The RMT said staff were being deemed competent to operate signal-boxes without any 'previous hands-on experience'. But Mr Horton said the company would do nothing to endanger passengers and added he would rather run fewer trains than undermine safety. The union still insists on an 'up-front' payment for past productivity before negotiating a restructuring package for signalling staff. It argues that Railtrack is offering only a 4 per cent improvement in earnings which is less than the 5.7 per cent offer discussed in early June and vetoed by the government. Railtrack says the signalling staff are being offered a 2.5 per cent basic pay rise; a 6 per cent unconsolidated supplement worth 3.2 per cent on earnings for immediate changes in working practices and a Pounds 250 one-off payment. Mr Horton also told Dr Mawhinney the package would produce additions to pensions, sick pay and holidays. BR aims for more trains, Page 8</p>

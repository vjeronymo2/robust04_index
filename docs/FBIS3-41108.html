The NSP will also open offices to receive reports on such  crimes in five major cities--Seoul and port cities of Pusan,  Inchon, Cheju and Masan.    An NSP spokesman said that the agency's move is to counter  effectively the growing number of international organized crimes  which occurred in the country recently. It is seen as part of  the agency's effort to suit itself to the changing political and  economic atmosphere.    The NSP will fight against such crimes in the context of  national security, said the spokesman.    The spokesman said the newly established information center  absorbs the "counter-narcotics information center" initiated  last June. Last year, the counter-narcotics center collected  over 300 pieces of drug-related information and distributed them  to the prosecution, police and foreign intelligence agencies,  according to the spokesman.</p>

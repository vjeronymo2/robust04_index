			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  (LDPR), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, will file another suit to protect  his honor and dignity against the leader of Russia's Democratic  Choice, Yegor Gaydar, and the board of editors of the daily  newspaper Izvestiya.    This statement was made by Zhirinovskiy's lawyer, Sergey  Belyak, in an interview with Interfax Wednesday. Gaydar's  article "A Bet on Scoundrels" published by Izvestiya on May 17  served as the reason for the suit. Belyak referred to Gaydar's  phrase from the article: "Zhirinovskiy is the most popular  fascist leader in Russia" and descriptions like "fascist  populist."    On June 7, Zhirinovskiy signed a statement to withdraw his  first suit against Gaydar made on December 7. According to  Belyak, Zhirinovskiy made this step after the signing of the  Social Accord Pact, wishing to show his readiness for  compromises not only in words, but also in practice. At the  same time, Gaydar's new insulting statements have forced  Zhirinovskiy to file another suit against him, Belyak said.    "I have deep doubts that Gaydar understands anything in the  history of fascism and Zhirinovskiy's works if he has ever read  them," Belyak said. He explained Gaydar's actions by "the  desire of an unpopular politician to curse a popular leader."    Zhirinovskiy evaluated the moral damage inflicted on him by  Gaydar at 500,000 rubles.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Stock index futures were boosted by the strong rally in bonds that followed the successful UK gilts auction, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 at 2,913 was better than many traders had anticipated. But for a very brief pause as a large sell order was executed, September moved steadily ahead during the morning in line with the performance in bonds and a squeeze in the cash market. The firm opening on Wall Street brought another bout of active buying of the contract which sent it to the day's high of 2,967. Profit-taking in the dying minutes of the session saw it end at 2,961, up 50 from its previous close, at a strong premium to the underlying market and some two points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 13 points. Volume remained modest, at 14,997 lots. Further buying in after-hours' trading brought September to a close of 2,963. Traded options remained dull and turnover fell to 19,536, against Tuesday's 24,862 contracts. However, volume in the FT-SE 100 showed an improvement on the previous day's total, reaching 9,500. Marks and Spencer stood out among the stock options with the biggest turnover at 4,023 lots. It was followed by Guinness, which traded 1,700 contracts.</p>

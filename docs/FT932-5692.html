			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (12): Expand and modernise - The port MR TU DEMING, director of the Shanghai Port Authority, is busy trying to speed long overdue redevelopment of the city's sprawling and, in many cases, antiquated facilities to cope with the trading boom. 'Current capacity has lagged behind economic development,' he says with massive understatement. 'We should further quicken the port's modernisation, but it requires a lot of investment and takes time.' Lack of funds is proving the biggest drag on efforts to hasten the refurbishment of Shanghai's ports so the city can realise its potential as the main entrepot for the Yangtze river region that stretches deep into China's hinterland and accounts for about half the country's industrial output. Speaking in a gloomy reception room in the Port Authority's headquarters overlooking the Huangpu River on which Shanghai is located, Mr Tu says he is actively seeking foreign investment and would consider almost any proposal to enhance the city's port capacity. 'We're trying every means to carry out all kinds of co-operation,' he says. 'Government investment and assistance from local enterprises and institutions such as the World Bank (the bank recently allocated Dollars 150m) and Asian Development Bank is far from enough.' The port director would like to see more ventures like the proposed RMB6bn 50-year co-operation deal involving Hong Kong businessman Mr Li Ka-shing and his Hutchison Whampoa group in upgrading and managing 50 per cent of Shanghai's container terminals and building new ones. Central government approval for the project is expected soon. In the past 10 years some RMB10bn has been invested by the Port Authority with RMB620m spent in 1992; but given the rapid pace of Shanghai's economic development allied with its ambitions to be one of the world's premier port cities this is clearly inadequate. Lack of funds has not, however, prevented Mr Tu and his associates from formulating an ambitious multi-billion dollar programme that includes: constructing a new deep water container port on the Yangtze to service the ambitious Pudong development zone with a capacity of 2.4m tonnes annually. upgrading the Luojing coal port on the Yangtze north of Shanghai to a capacity of 10m tonnes annually in the first phase. renovating old port areas on the Huangpu River, including the conversion of five bulk cargo berths to container facilities. upgrading grain handling facilities and coal berths on the Huangpu. re-developing port areas for offices, retail outlets and tourism. modernising passenger berths at Huishan on the Huangpu to cope with an expected surge in traffic. constructing a new container port at the mouth of the Jinshan river south of Shanghai with an annual capacity of 20m tonnes. Mr Li Ka-shing's Hong Kong International Terminals (60 per cent owned by Hutchison Whampoa) has been looking into the Jinshan proposal, but it would clearly be some time before such a large-scale venture matured. In the meantime, Mr Tu hopes to increase Shanghai's port handling capacity to 200mtonnes of cargo annually by the year 2000. Last year, the city's ports cleared 163m tonnes, including 730,000 standard 20-foot containers (TEU). This compares with just 66,000 containers in 1982. The Port Authority's plans to re-develop five square kilometres of the old port areas along the Huangpu envisage, says Mr Tu, the building of 'comprehensive trade and business centres'. This would require re-locating port facilities to the mouth of the Huangpu and also to the southern part of Shanghai. Preliminary conversations with potential foreign investors in re-developing this extremely valuable real estate have already got under way. Consolidating some of the port facilities in larger zones would probably be no bad thing. Mr Tu is responsible for 131 berths, 520,000 square metres of warehousing and 1.5m square metres of open storage yards. Shanghai's ports, according to its director, have an average turnaround time (loading/unloading) of 36 hours compared with less than 24 hours in Hong Kong. Delays have been much reduced since the early 1980s, but foreign shipping agents still grumble about inefficiencies, including the time it takes to secure outgoing cargo space. By any standards Shanghai is a busy port. Some 8,000 ships involved in international trade utilised its facilities last year, moving 32m tonnes of cargo which represents about 20 per cent of the total. Coastal and river-born cargo accounted for the rest.</p>

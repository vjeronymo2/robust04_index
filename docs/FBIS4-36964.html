			<p>BFN     [Text] Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami', head of the  Israeli-Palestinian liaison committee, says that the joint IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] and Palestinian police headquarters have  proven themselves a great success. Sami' said the security  situation in the autonomous areas is satisfactory, and voiced  optimism concerning the Gaza-Jericho agreement. He added,  however, that unless the economic situation in the Gaza Strip  improves, the security situation could deteriorate. Our  correspondent Geva' Qra'-'Oz reports that Brig. Gen. Sami'  divulged that in the framework of their preparations for Yasir  'Arafat's arrival in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinians have  started preparing a helicopter landing pad in Gaza, despite the  fact that they are not authorized to do so.</p>

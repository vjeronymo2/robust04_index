			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Letter: UK government must face question of whether to 'monetise' debt Sir, Your leader, 'Spending dilemmas' (November 9), refers to the 'substantial easing' of monetary policy since September 16. Yet that has occurred against a background of a precipitous decline in the annual growth of the Bundesbank's main measure of money (M3) in Britain to 3 per cent at the end of September. Seasonally adjusted lending in that month actually fell. The most important question the chancellor must address in Thursday's Autumn Statement is whether the government should 'monetise' at least part of its deficit. The truth is that there is not enough capital in Britain to raise next year's likely PSBR without sucking up savings that are badly needed in the private sector. Even if base rates were to be reduced, such borrowing would lead to an upward twist in the yield curve. Yet to cut total spending plans in the teeth of a deep and worsening recession would hardly promote recovery, nor would tax increases. The danger we face is not a resurgence of inflation but a credit implosion. Even the difficulties of negative equity in domestic housing pale besides Britain's growing acreage of empty commercial property, ticking away at the heart of our banking system, against which it is secured. Many economists will argue that, even under such circumstances, no responsible government should print money, for that is what monetisation, by whatever means, amounts to. Yet from fiscal 1987 to 1990, a cumulative Pounds 27bn public sector surplus did nothing to dampen runaway monetary growth, precisely because it was used to repay debt rather than 'sterilise' money. The counterpart of the same problem applies today. On Thursday an announcement is needed that the deficit will be at most partly funded, so that interest rates, long and short, can be brought down and kept down until the money supply is restored to health.

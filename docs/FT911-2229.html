			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Fuji Heavy to miss dividend payments FUJI Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars, said yesterday that dividend payments would be passed for the year to end-March, as the company would incur an after-tax loss of Y66.4bn (Dollars 4.82m). The company reported an after-tax profit of Y5.7bn for the previous year, but had offset an operating loss with sales of securities holdings. The stock market plunge last year had restricted the com-pany's ability to sell further shares, and the previous dividend of Y6 will not be repeated. Fuji Heavy has close ties to Nissan Motor, which owns 4.2 per cent of the company and has indicated it could take a more active role in management. Nissan has consigned production of one of its models to Fuji Heavy from October of this year. Officials at Fuji Heavy said yesterday that the company had suffered an after-tax loss of Y51.3bn in the first half and a Y15.1bn loss in the second half, despite strong consumer demand last year. Total output for the Japanese industry in the year to end-March rose 4.9 per cent, while Fuji's output rose 7.3 per cent and its domestic sales, by volume, rose 14.8 per cent. However, the domestic car market has turned down in recent months and Japanese makers are also reporting slower sales in the US and Europe, complicating Fuji Heavy's plans to break even this year.</p>

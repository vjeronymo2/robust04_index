			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'FAR OUT MAN' RESURRECTS HIPPIE ERA  </P> <P> One satisfied viewer at a screening of Tommy Chong's "Far Out Man" (citywide),  exclaimed "A blast from the past!" That is surely the only way to look at this  zany business about a rocker stuck in the '60s, seemingly permanently  traumatized by the departure of his wife after firing her for being a terrible  backup singer. For this comedy to work for you, you've really got to be still  amused by Chong's familiar pothead humor, not an easy task for everyone now  that we're in the '90s.  </P> <P> Actually, Chong seems to be resurrecting his old persona in order to move  beyond it, both as an actor and as a writer-director. That's the right  direction, but in the meantime, like it or not, we're asked to think of someone  who's stoned all the time as funny. (Who but Chong would even think of trying  to make a joke out of a drug overdose?)  </P> <P> You may find yourself more amused by Chong's relatives than him. Chong's  gorgeous daughter, Rae Dawn, plays the Far Out Man's daughter, who is forever  having her big movie scenes interrupted by her father. It's Rae Dawn who at  last manages to get a psychiatrist (Martin Mull, quite funny) to treat her dad  at his ramshackle Hippieland lair, with the roundabout result that the Far Out  Man eventually tries to get his act together by becoming a roadie.  </P> <P> Chong's real-life wife, Shelby, plays his ex-wife, who has taken up with C.  Thomas Howell (Rae Dawn's real-life husband) in hopes of advancing her career  as an actress. Shelby Chong is hilarious as a send-up of every sexy celebrity  wife intent on having her own career, regardless of whether or not she is  talented, and Howell is also a delight in his own send-up of Brat Packer  pretensions.  </P> <P> Serving as the linchpin in this rambling adventure is Paris Chong, Tommy and  Shelby's teen-age son, who plays "Far Out Man's" dismayingly studious kid who  never met his father. In cameos are Paul Bartel, Judd Nelson and Michael  Winslow.  </P> <P> There's an amiable nonchalance in Chong's film (rated R); let's hope that his  next venture is as much a departure and breakthrough for him as his former  partner Cheech Marin's "Born in East L.A."  </P></p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Hong Kong - Other markets The removal of one uncertainty on Friday afternoon, when local banks lifted interest rates by 0.75 per cent, will do little to cheer or inspire investors this week, writes Louise Lucas. The banks had been widely expected to raise rates following the US Fed's move last Tuesday and concern over follow-through in Hong Kong drove the colony's share prices lower in the latter part of last week. The hesitant mood is likely to continue into this week on fears of a further interest rate rise. US trade data tomorrow will be keenly scrutinised in Hong Kong, as any inflationary signals will once again be sufficient to spook bond and stock markets. In the absence of corporate news, local issues this week are likely to be dominated by rumour.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The historic global conference on Sustainable  Development of Small Island Developing States [SIDS] continues  to be plagued with controversy. One of the environmental groups,  Greenpeace, currently attending the conference, says the SIDS  conference is not addressing important environmental issues.  Anna Toney, head of the Greenpeace delegation now in Barbados,  spoke with Michelle Arthur about this matter.    [Begin recording] [Arthur] According to Miss Toney, the  [word  indistinct] conference is not adequately dealing with  environmental issues. She says the real conference promises were  made to host the conference on sustainable development [words  indistinct], but what is happening is Barbados is another talk  shop.    [Toney] Two years later, we come here to Barbados, and yet  again a lot of rhetoric, and I really do believe that there be  threats of environment [words indistinct] development are so big  that they can no longer wait, so [words indistinct] action plan  do germinate some of the issues with very much concern such as  climate change, such as [word indistinct] (bleaching), fisheries  and others. We really hope the developed countries will try to  give in much more on the international side of the action plan  because it is all very well to tell the small developing states  what they should be doing at home when you know that they do not  really have to contribute too much for the environmental  problems they are now facing [as heard].    [Arthur] The Greenpeace delegate is also concerned about the  amount of paper and plastic materials used at the UN conference.  She said the number of press releases and plastic cups and  plates being used should be reduced. Greenpeace also plans to  meet with the Barbados fishing community within the next few  days. Miss Toney says there are many common problems facing the  fishing communities all over the world. The Greenpeace ship is  now docked in Barbados. [end recording]</p>

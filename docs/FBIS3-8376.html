Jovanovic draws the secretary general's attention to the  fact  that the airspace violations took place in the area of Boka  Kotorska and near Uzice and Kraljevo, and said this was an  integral part of a campaign of continuous pressure on the Serb  nation.    "We are particularly concerned because all this is happening  under the auspices of the United Nations and because nothing has  been done yet to stop such provocations," the letter says. "If  these violations continue they could spark off incidents with  unforeseeable consequences for the security of not only the FRY  but also the entire Balkan region, including the peace process  aimed at ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina."    Jovanovic appealed to Butrus-Ghali to take appropriate  measures within the framework of the United Nations and NATO to  prevent "such dangerous provocations" in the future.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Land of Fire and Hatred"] </F>   [Text] It was a noticeable scene last week to see dozens of  Palestinian youngsters pelting the Israeli trucks withdrawing  from Gaza and Jericho with stones. The trucks were carrying  Israeli police equipment to pave the way for the entry of the  Palestinian police force. The Palestinians were supposed to  celebrate the withdrawal of Israel troops from their country,  which has been living under occupation for almost 30 years.    However, it seems that the bitterness is deep rooted, and  why  not? Throughout the years of the intifadah, the Israeli  occupation troops killed, wounded, and jailed Palestinians daily  without mercy. The deep-rooted bitterness felt by the  Palestinians became manifest a few days ago when a Palestinian  youngster committed a suicide operation in northern Israel  against a passenger bus, killing 8 Israelis and wounding 50  others. What is so strange about this after dozens of  Palestinians were killed and hundreds others wounded at the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque 40 days ago in a treacherous attack during  the dawn prayers in the month of Ramadan?    These conditions, which are bad by any standard, are to  blame  for the violence that claims the lives of innocent people.  These conditions make it incumbent on the Israeli and  Palestinian negotiators to do their utmost, and to do it fast,  toward implementing the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, thus easing the  hostilities that can be eliminated only through cooperation and  goodwill. The burden of this largely falls on the shoulders of  Israel because for long years the Palestinians have been  subjected to acts of murder, oppression, terrorism, and  brutality. The sooner Israel recognizes the Palestinian  legitimate rights, the better the atmosphere will be for peace  to be created in the land of peace, which for more than half a  century has been the land of fire.    Without greater, faster, and bolder steps toward peace, the  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, solutions, and agreements will  be prone to collapse, something that does not augur well not  only for the two parties but for the entire region.</p>

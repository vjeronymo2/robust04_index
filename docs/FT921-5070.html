			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Bonds favoured to finance recovery - Debt funding is becoming more attractive to UK companies THE sterling bond market could be in for a bumper year, with UK companies turning to bond market investors rather than the equity market or banks to finance economic recovery. Yesterday's debut bond issue by Cable &amp; Wireless, to finance a heavy capital investment programme, may set a precedent for other companies this year. Analysts at Barclays de Zoete Wedd point to a 'retrenchment and refinancing' among UK companies which has left them well positioned to raise additional debt finance.* The corporate sector financial deficit, the amount of debt owed by UK companies, reached 5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1990, at Pounds 5.23bn. By the end of 1991 the deficit had been reduced to less than 2 per cent of gross domestic product or Pounds 2.48bn. Most refinancing was done through the equity market last year, a ready source of funds in the first half as institutional investors pumped money into equities in anticipation of economic recovery. In all, Pounds 10bn was raised from rights issues, strengthening the balance sheets of UK companies. However, as interest rates fall debt finance will appear more attractive vis-a-vis equity finance. The cost of equity is already high in historic terms. According to BZW, the inflation-adjusted cost of equity capital is currently 11.8 per cent, the highest since 1931 and well above the long-term average of 7 per cent. The current real cost of equity finance is comparable to that seen in 1959, which was followed by three years of negative dividend growth. These considerations are leading some investment institutions to increase their portfolio weightings in favour of bonds, albeit from a very low base. 'With the relatively high percentage of institutional money likely to be allocated to fixed interest this year, it looks very much as if equity investors will become even more choosy,' commented Ms Shira Cornwall, director of BZW sterling bonds. Companies making the decision to raise additional debt finance face a choice between the banks and the bond market. It remains an open question whether banks will be willing to provide finance at a cost acceptable to companies. BZW argues that banks' willingness to make new loans is closely linked to the fortunes of the property market. Large banks are exposed to the property market through loans to consumers for house purchases and loans to property and construction companies. Property and construction companies account for 13.5 per cent of Barclays total loan book. In addition, the value of the banks' property counts as capital, through property revaluations. Nearly 12 per cent of the Tier I capital of Lloyds Bank is related to property revaluations. However, bankers argue that demand for bank finance was so low last year that lending margins are actually now declining as competing banks chase the available business. Even so, many company treasurers recognise that institutional funding from the bond market has a utility over and above its competitiveness in terms of cost. Raising core long-term debt from the bond market leaves bank credit lines free to meet unexpected events. In addition, companies in property-related sectors are likely to face special problems in raising new bank finance. BZW expects a number of long-dated secured debenture issues from property and construction companies this year. For the majority of large UK corporations - such as Cable &amp; Wireless - unsecured bond issues of around 10 years' maturity may be the most attractive option. The proceeds of shorter-dated issues can be swapped into floating-rate funding. In addition, long-dated issues generally carry covenants which tie the borrower to strict gearing and interest cover ratios. Moreover, bond issues of 10 years' maturity or less attract overseas buyers, an important source of sterling funds since the UK currency joined the European exchange rate mechanism. Additional overseas buying was reflected in the maturity pattern of new issues last year. Around Pounds 10.8bn fixed-rate sterling bond issues were launched last year, double the amount raised in 1990. Around 79 per cent of these bonds had maturities less than 10 years, much higher than average. * Funding Out of Recession, available from Barclays de Zoete Wedd, fixed income division, tel: 071-220 7351.</p>

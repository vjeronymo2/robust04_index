			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELUS LEAGUE BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> MATER DEI COMES BACK FOR 68-53 VICTORY  </P> <P> After every basket Mater Dei High School scores, the Monarch fans yell,  "Whoosh!"  </P> <P> That was something like the sound Mater Dei made as it raced past Bishop  Montgomery in the second half to beat the Knights, 68-53, in an Angelus League  game at Bishop Montgomery Saturday night.  </P> <P> It was no easy victory for the Monarchs (20-1 overall, 4-0 in the Angelus  League), the Southern Section's top-rated 5-A team.  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery fell to 11-4 overall, 3-1 in the league.  </P> <P> "(Bishop Montgomery) is a good team, they are a true contender," Mater Dei  Coach Gary McKnight said. "(Bishop Montgomery Coach) Doug Mitchell has done a  great job with them. The Angelus League is stronger than people think; it'll  show up in the playoffs."  </P> <P> The Knights were winless in the league last season.  </P> <P> Mater Dei trailed, 31-28, at halftime, but led the third quarter with a 19-0  run that spanned the period's first four minutes and 29 seconds.  </P> <P> Mitchell called two timeouts during the spurt and yelled to his team that "the  game wasn't over."  </P> <P> But after Dan O'Neil hit a 15-footer to the right of the basket with 3:23 left  in the third quarter for a 47-31 lead, the game was virtually out of reach.  </P> <P> "The kids got together at halftime and just decided that they were going to  play together," McKnight said.  </P> <P> Said Mitchell: "We played hard, but we didn't play intelligent. When they  started that run, we panicked, we started (putting) up bad shots. Hopefully, it  was a learning experience."  </P> <P> Mater Dei is a good team to learn from as the Monarchs committed only three  second-half turnovers in wearing down Bishop Montgomery.  </P> <P> In the first half, Bishop Montgomery struggled to build a 26-18 lead with 4:22  left in the second quarter. Mater Dei began forcing the Knights into  cross-court passes, three of which were intercepted and led to baskets. The  Monarchs cut the lead to three points, and the first half ended with Bishop  Montgomery leading, 31-28.  </P> <P> Darrell Daniel scored 15 points in the first two quarters, but then was held to  one three-point basket in the second half. He led Bishop Montgomery with 18  points.  </P> <P> Mater Dei guard David Boyle led all scorers with 21 points.  </P></p>

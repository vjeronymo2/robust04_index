			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Martin Danes; </F> place and date not given: "Slovakia Should Devalue its  Currency"]    [Excerpt] [Danes] Are you completely satisfied with the  result of Wednesday's [16 February] extraordinary session of the  Customs Union Council?    [Klaus] We achieved what we could. The reversal of  Slovakia's one-off measures and the fact that further solutions  will be sought were the only way out of the situation. The fact  that Slovakia, in the current political crisis, does not want to  deal with its economic problems in a more emphatic manner is not  unusual; it is even very common. Therefore, I do not anticipate  that the current Slovak political representatives would, within  the context of the political crisis, demonstrate more meaningful  courage and adopt a more radical measure, a measure that would  certainly not do them any good on the domestic scene.    [Danes] Do you think that the measure adopted by Slovakia on  11 February--requiring special certificates testifying to the  quality of imported foodstuffs--was motivated unequivocally by  an attempt to reverse its unfavorable situation in the clearing  account?    [Klaus] Of course. Slovakia is making a monthly payment for  exceeding the clearing account that amounts to roughly 10  percent of its foreign currency reserves. That is a distressing  sum.    [Danes] Do you not view the future of the Czech-Slovak  Customs Union skeptically? The current situation of recurring  Slovak deficits in the clearing account is not beneficial to  either of the partners.    [Klaus] The situation in the clearing account is not a  repercussion of the Customs Union. It is a consequence of the  Slovak koruna's poor exchange rate. So, I believe that the  Slovak koruna's exchange rate will be devalued, and not the  Customs Union.    [Danes] You issued a statement last week on the Allies'  ultimatum in Bosnia, and, shortly afterwards, the president  issued a completely different one. Would it not be in the  interest of the Czech Republic's good name abroad to coordinate  your stances on such fundamental international issues in advance?    [Klaus] I think these differences are being overstated. I  do not think that this has caused a tragedy in our country. Let  us not look for fundamental disputes in these statements. I am  absolutely certain that, in the United States, Great Britain,  and France, various opinions are being expressed on how to  resolve this terribly difficult problem. There are radical and  less radical opinions in these countries, opinions that  emphasize an internal solution and opinions that emphasize an  external solution. I think that emphasis on the fact that air  strikes per se will probably not solve anything is the majority  opinion, at least judging by the way I interpret the reactions  of world politicians.

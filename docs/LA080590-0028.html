			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> FRUITS OF THE NEW AGE OF DISARMAMENT;  </P> <P> IRAQ IS ONLY THE START. THIS SHOULD WAKE US TO THE DANGER OF UNCONSIDERED  DEFENSE CUTS.  </P> <P> Just as Japan's move into Manchuria in 1931 was a wake-up call to the West,  heralding what was ahead for the new decade, so the Iraqi drive into Kuwait is  a harbinger of the 1990s.  </P> <P> With his blitzkrieg invasion of oil-rich Kuwait, Saddam Hussein has introduced  us to the new realities of the Near East. The Carter Doctrine, whereby the  United States vowed to resist with force any effort by a hostile power to take  over the Persian Gulf, is dead. If you wish to survive in this region, Hussein  has telegraphed his Arab neighbors, you will answer to Baghdad, not Washington.  The United States is no longer policeman of the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Short of blockading Iraqi ports, an act of war, the U.S. cannot force Hussein  to cough up the tiny country he has just swallowed. As no vital U.S. interest  is at stake, we aren't going to do that. An America that packed up and  abandoned Lebanon after 250 Marines were lost in a single explosion is not  going to send the 82nd Airborne up the Euphrates valley to avenge Kuwait.  </P> <P> Saddam Hussein gambled that the Rapid Deployment Force and Sixth Fleet were, by  and large, a superpower bluff. His gamble paid off. Doesn't look very much like  the end of history, does it?  </P> <P> This display of Iraqi military power came just 24 hours after House Armed  Services had shredded the U.S. defense budget, voting to kill the B-2 Stealth  bomber, gut the Strategic Defense Initiative and cut U.S. armed forces by  129,000 men -- a $24-billion chop.  </P> <P> We are headed for a new disarmament decade; and we had best prepare for more  mornings like Thursday last.  </P> <P> Clearly, 1990 is not 1960. Even after the Reagan buildup, U.S. armed forces and  battle fleets, first-rate though they are, are still only half the size they  were when John F. Kennedy held office. Our missile force is inferior to the  Soviets' and growing more so every month, as Moscow modernizes first-strike  SS-18 missiles and builds hundreds of new second-strike SS-24 and SS-25 mobile  missiles.  </P> <P> There are a half-dozen regional powers, deeply hostile to U.S. interests, which  were inconsequential in 1960. Among them are North Korea, Vietnam, Iran, Iraq,  Syria, Cuba.  </P> <P> Yet, as America's relative power diminishes, U.S. overseas commitments are  still expanding. We are committed to go to war on behalf of 15 NATO allies and  our red line has been moved east to the Oder and Neisse Rivers. We just signed  a pact with Greece to come to its aid in the event of war with Turkey. We have  a commitment to Israel that brought us to the brink of nuclear war in 1973. In  the Persian Gulf, until last week, we had the Carter Doctrine. And we still  have pacts with South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand,  and the Organization of American States.  </P> <P> And, as new commitments are taken on and the old ones call for more U.S. power  to sustain them, we have begun closing bases, drawing down troop levels,  eliminating weapons. If this continues, the United States is headed for  foreign-policy bankruptcy and eventual war.  </P> <P> It is time that Bush informed Congress that if it is going to eliminate forces,  he is going to start terminating commitments.  </P> <P> The congressional assault on the defense budget has taken on an almost mindless  character. Programs cut, like SDI and Stealth, are 21st-Century weapons of  defense and deterrence, while the armor, which Congress spared, is designed to  help win World War II in Europe. We are eliminating new planes needed to strike  and punish potential enemies, while keeping open army bases strategically  located to protect us from the Indians.  </P> <P> The President needs to make some hard choices, and he needs to inform the world  of the consequences of those choices. If we are going to cut back on the Army,  Navy and Air Force, we have to begin sending word to nations like Kuwait that  depended on us, like Kuwait, that they are on their own, so they can begin  making a separate peace with the Saddam Husseins of the new world. How long can  the United States continue spending more for the defense of Europe than  Europeans? How long should we defend the oil lifeline of Europe and Japan, with  no support from the navies of Europe and Japan?  </P> <P> If America's armed forces are to be cut, they should be cut with an eye to  defending the American nation and people first. Missile defense is the highest  priority, followed by the air and naval capacity to defend our continent,  coasts and sea lanes, and to retaliate against an enemy aggressor.  Unsurprisingly, this is where the chowderheads of Capitol Hill first decided to  cut.  </P></p>

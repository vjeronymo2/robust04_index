			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Franco-German telecom deal goes to Commission The European Commission is preparing to examine details of a new co-operation deal between Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications groups. Commission officials confirmed yesterday that the two companies had already made contact informally, but refused to comment on Brussels' likely attitude to a deeper alliance. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom revealed late on Wednesday that they were planning a press conference about their plans on Tuesday in Brussels. Industry observers believe they may be preparing to merge certain areas of their activity, outside domestic 'voice' services. On the same day, telecoms ministers from the European Union will be holding further discussions about the Commission's proposals on liberalisation of the telecoms sector. If the case does fall under the Commission's jurisdiction - either as a merger, or because of other monopoly considerations - the attitude of the Commission's competition directorate will be crucial. The deal could well become one of the most sensitive anti-trust cases yet examined by the Brussels authorities. Competition officials said yesterday they would work closely on the case with other Commission departments, notably telecoms and industry. In his contribution to the Commission's proposed white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment - to be discussed by EU leaders on December 10 and 11 - Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry and telecoms commissioner, has stressed the need to adapt to the existence of an 'information society', using telecoms networks and served by strong telecoms and information technology groups. The Commission is to push through controversial measures to extend liberalisation of the telecoms terminal and telecoms services markets to the satellite communications sector. Brussels yesterday approved amendments which will abolish national restrictions on the provision of satellite earth station equipment, satellite services used by business networks, and mobile tracking services. The Commission can impose these amendments because the original directives were adopted using powers to break open national monopolies. The Commission said it hoped the measures would be in force by the end of next year.</p>

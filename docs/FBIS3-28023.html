			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Yun Pyong-son: "The </F> United States Should Not Make a Miscalculation"]    [Text] The United States is creating a grave crisis which  can lead the situation to a catastrophe [paguk] by overturning  the promise made with us at a decisive juncture when the  DPRK-U.S. talks can be rescued from a stalemate and when the  prospects are opened for a package solution of the nuclear  problem.    Regarding this, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry  issued a statement strongly denouncing the brazen-faced betrayal  of the United States and declaring our position that in the  event the United States overturns the promise made with us, we  no longer are bound to the promise made with the United States;  that if the United States does not want the DPRK-U.S. talks,  neither do we want it; and that if the United States wants to  make any other choice, we will also choose the reciprocal  countermeasure [sangunghan taeung pangdo].    This is indeed correct. As everyone knows, in the DPRK-U.S.  contact held at the end of last year, the two sides agreed that  they will hold a third round of talks, that the United States  will stop the Team Spirit joint military exercise, and that we  will accept a limited inspection [hanjongdoen pomwiui sachal]  necessary to ensure the continuity of the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] safeguards on our nuclear sites, as a  measure for a package solution of the nuclear problem.    Accordingly, we have endeavored in all our efforts to do our  part. However, the IAEA Secretariat foolishly attempted to  realize a full-scope inspection, [chonmyon sachal] which is not  even an object of discussion, and the United States is urging us  to accept it by setting a time limit with an ultimatum-like  attitude that if we do not accept the agency's demand, the third  round of the DPRK-U.S. talks cannot be held and it cannot but  take the road to impose sanctions.    What is graver is that by once again bringing up the issue  of  conducting special inspections of our two military sites, which  have nothing to do with our nuclear activity, the United States  stands in a position of making international-pressure commotions  against us. This is a brazen-faced betrayal and challenge of  the party to the dialogue.    To proceed with dialogue and resolve the issue, one should  faithfully keep the promise in equal position. If any one of  the parties breaks faith with the other, putting forward its  unreasonable demand [pudanghan yogu] to the other, there can be  no dialogue and the problem cannot be solved.    The United States is, however, pursuing a dishonest motive  by  breaking both the promise and faith and insisting on its robbery  demands. Isn't this a betrayal of the party to the dialogue and  an intolerable crime blocking the road for the peaceful  resolution of the nuclear issue?    The whole world recognizes that we are not developing  nuclear  weapons. The nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula is caused  by the United States, which drew nuclear weapons in South Korea  running counter to our nation's opinion, and the threat is  aggravating because the United States has threatened us with  nuclear weapons by ceaselessly conducting nuclear war exercises.    Therefore, the responsible party for resolving the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula is none other than the United  States. It is a robbery act as if the burglar is holding the  stick with which the United States is creating blockage for the  peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue by picking on us about  the non-existent nuclear issue, talking about full-scope  inspection [chonmyon sachal] and sanctions. Contrary to its  repeated promise of not using any armed forces, including  nuclear weapons, and of not using them as a means of threat, the  United States is trying to crush [apsal] our Republic by  committing large-scale nuclear war exercises by all means.    This is proven by the facts that U.S. official circles are  raving that if the Team Spirit joint military exercise cannot be  conducted, then they plan to continue other joint military  exercises--in Hawaii if not in South Korea; that the United  States is full-fledgedly hurrying to deploy Patriot missiles in  South Korea; and that an intelligence support team composed of  specialists has been deployed to and is now in operation in  South Korea.    The United States is only talking about the resolution of  the  nuclear issue through talks but in fact its aggressive strategy  toward the DPRK has not changed a bit. All the facts clearly  show that the United States has no intention at all to  peacefully resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but  invariably seeks only its inner intention to crush our Republic  through strength. It is a miscalculation if the United States  thinks its robbery pressure and military threats can threaten  us. We love peace but would never beg for it. As declared in  our Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, if the United States  chooses any other way, we will also choose a reciprocal  countermeasure.    If a catastrophic situation is created on the Korean  peninsula, the United States will take all the responsibility  for the dear price resulted thereafter. The U.S. hard-line,  conservative forces should look straight at our people's  unshaken will and act prudently.</p>

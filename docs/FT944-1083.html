			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / People: Laing &amp; Cruikshank The run-up to Christmas is always a nervous time in the City because that's when many firms make their cuts. This year one of the victims is Laing &amp; Cruikshank which made an indelible mark on the mining market. Back in 1987 'Lang &amp; Bang' was taken over by Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned French bank, but retained its separate identity and international mining team. Now five out of the seven team members - including Mike Kurtanjek, the department head - have been made redundant and the activities absorbed into other areas within CL. Tim Hoare, who helped build up Laing &amp; Cruikshank but who left CL 18 months ago to set up his own, eponymous, broking business, still concentrating on mining, said: 'This is very sad, the end of an era. Laing &amp; Cruikshank was part of the mining world for 25 years and had a good franchise. I was proud to be part of that and I'm very sorry for the guys that are being made redundant.'</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RONALD COLMAN  </P> <P> I am researching a biography of Ronald Colman for Greenwood Press and I am  trying to locate prints of TV shows he did for "Four Star Playhouse," "The  Halls of Ivy," "G.E. Theater," "Studio 57" and "The Jack Benny Show." I am also  trying to locate copies of his first and last radio shows, both for NBC: "A  Tale of Two Cities" (1935) and "A Christmas Carol" (1956), plus his appearance  on the NBC game show "Double or Nothing" in 1951.  </P> <P> If you know the whereabouts of any of these radio and TV shows, please write  me.  </P> <P> SAM FRANK  </P> <P> P.O.B. 417  </P> <P> Los Angeles, CA 90078  </P></p>

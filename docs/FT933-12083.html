			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Reuters to spend Pounds 350m of cash pile on share buy-back REUTERS, the international news and information group, is to spend up to Pounds 350m buying back its own shares in the largest repurchase operation by a British company since the mid-1980s. News of the plan, under which Reuters would take back 5.8 per cent of its equity, sent the shares up 36p to Pounds 14.40. Reuters, which had planned to unveil the scheme today with its interim results, said it had been obliged to bring forward the announcement by press speculation. Shareholders will receive Pounds 14 a share, but tax credits will make it worth as much as Pounds 17.25 to tax-exempt gross income funds. The tax credits mean individual shareholders will receive Pounds 16.25, but that will be subject to capital gains and income tax. Reuters has been piling up cash over the last few years and had a balance of Pounds 710m at its December year-end. It promised in March to consider ways of returning cash to shareholders - either by a special dividend or share buy-back. Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman, said: 'Whilst the main purpose of the repurchase is to provide shareholders with the opportunity either to receive a cash distribution or to have an equivalent enhancement of their investment in Reuters, the board believes that all shareholders will benefit from the repurchase since it should lead to an increase in Reuters' earnings per share.' In what Reuters described as a 'pioneering scheme', the 34 per cent of the group's equity held as American Depositary Shares will also receive a UK tax refund. The tax credit arises because the Inland Revenue views such cash distributions as dividends, on which advance corporation tax is payable but may be reclaimed. All shareholders will be entitled to sell 5.8 per cent of their holding, although they will be able to sell more, to the extent that other shareholders do not take up their full entitlement. Sir Christopher said: 'The difference between a special dividend and buy-back are quite marked on closer examination. We like this scheme because it gives shareholders a choice - they can either take the cash, or have an enhanced stake in the company.' Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said: 'We have absorbed two messages from shareholders - they want us to continue to invest in the business, but they don't want us to invest just for the sake of investing.'

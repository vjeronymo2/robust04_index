			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Underground puts Pounds 10 bet on raising Pounds 6m Londoners who regularly rage over the inadequacy of the Underground system are this week having to come to terms with an additional experience: a Pounds 10 penalty fare if they travel without a valid ticket. London Underground launched the scheme on Sunday with the aim of stemming fare evasion that is estimated to cost around Pounds 30m per year. Over the past 18 months, LU has spent Pounds 2m explaining the benefits of the scheme and in giving training to 300 inspectors who will operate it. Mr Donal McCabe, a spokesman for LU, said: 'By spending Pounds 2m on the scheme, we expect to get back Pounds 6m which we would otherwise lose, and we can spend this money on helping improve the Underground.' The Pounds 6m, Mr McCabe is quick to point out, is expected to come largely from people paying fares at the outset rather than risking penalty payments. The free flow of as yet unproven statistics form part of a publicity campaign aimed at reassuring Londoners that the scheme aims to help make life easier for the majority rather than more difficult. LU says that the penatly scheme offers a short-term revenue booster while it is unable to finance electronic barriers more widely. The inspectors have been drawn largely from existing staff and trained in 'body language'. LU says this is 'the skill of avoiding confrontational situations' as well as knowing when 'to use discretion in implementing the penalty'. Among the inspectors on the Northern line - popularly known as the 'misery line' - is Ms Nike Omolokun. Ms Omolokun confronts a collective and tense glare as she walks through carriages. She uses a 'Swipemaster' - a computerised gadget through which she runs tickets and checks whether the information provided by the passenger equates with the truth. Ms Omolokun is among the higher paid of London Underground non-managerial staff, with a salary of Pounds 21,400.</p>

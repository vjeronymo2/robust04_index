			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GREAT ESCAPES FAR FROM THE MADDENING CROWD;  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> CRESCENT BAY POINT PARK A HIDDEN GEM  </P> <P> As you slow to enter Laguna Beach after whizzing south down Coast Highway, it's  easy to miss the small blue sign announcing, in white letters, "Vista Point"  that appears a mile past the city limits.  </P> <P> But those who spot it -- and follow their curiosity -- turn right on Crescent  Bay Drive, which ambles through towering palm trees and comes to rest at a  small park snuggled between expensive homes.  </P> <P> Crescent Bay Point Park is not easily found, but those who locate it are  rewarded by relaxing scenery and the antics of marine life.  </P> <P> From the lawn that greets visitors, pathways curve out toward the right and the  left and meet again at the park's tip, which sits on the edge of a cliff  jutting out against the ocean's crashing waves.  </P> <P> To the left, spread out as if on display, curves the beach along Crescent Bay,  and just beyond are the homes and businesses of downtown Laguna Beach, cradled  by the rolling hills behind the city.  </P> <P> Before the view captivates visitors, however, sea lions basking in the sun on  rocks and barking a few hundred feet offshore to the right quickly steal the  show.  </P> <P> The park is maintained by the city of Laguna Beach. It was created in the late  1970s with the help of the county after local residents fought to preserve the  promontory as open space when it appeared the point would be developed with  homes, according to the Laguna Beach Parks and Recreation Department.  </P> <P> Despite the park's seclusion, people still manage to discover it -- people like  David Bunch and his three co-workers, all chemical company executives from  Baton Rouge, La.  </P> <P> The four men, all in coats and ties, were all lined up along the railing at the  park's edge, shading their eyes from the sun with a hand as they looked out at  the view.  </P> <P> The four had flown into Orange County for a business meeting, and before they  left for home they decided to drive along the coast in their rental car, Bunch  said. Spotting the "Vista Point" sign, they turned off of Coast Highway.  </P> <P> "It's a little nicer than I expected. Nice view," Bunch said. "The seals are a  nice bonus out there."  </P> <P> Crescent Bay Point Park is also popular wedding spot.  </P> <P> Jim and Wendy Russell, enjoying the park along with other visitors, said they  had their wedding in the park about four years ago.  </P> <P> One of their first dates was in the park, 30-year-old Wendy Russell said. The  two shared a bottle of wine one evening and looked out on the city lights. So  when they decided to get married, the park seemed an appropriate place.  </P> <P> "It was great," Wendy Russell said. "They (the sea lions) were barking while we  were getting married, and Jim's dad said, 'Well, I guess now you've got the  seal of approval.' "  </P></p>

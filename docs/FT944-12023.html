			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Avoiding postal fudge The government has got itself into an extraordinary tangle over its plans to privatise the Post Office. But the problems are of its own making, and it could cut the Gordian knot if only the Treasury would adopt a less blinkered attitude than it has until now. The issue is simple: can the Post Office be freed from Treasury control if the government continues to hold a large majority stake in the business? Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has been telling Tory MPs that the Treasury will not loosen its grip unless a majority stake is in the private sector, because of rules about the compilation of the public accounts and concerns about the ultimate liability for the debts of a privatised Post Office. It appears the Treasury might, after all, be prepared to countenance a relaxation of control if the state share were limited to 51 per cent. But even that may not be enough for discontented Tory MPs, anxious to avoid confronting electors with a cause as unpopular as selling off the Royal Mail. Opposition to postal privatisation is motivated mostly by ignorance or by wilful misrepresentation. Concerns over the future of village and high street post offices have been met by government guarantees to retain the Post Office's counters division in the public sector. A postal regulator would be charged with controlling stamp prices and protecting universal collections and deliveries. On the experience of British Telecommunications, a regulator would very likely do a better job of defending consumers than does the government now. Yet allowing for the political position, an obvious course suggests itself provided the Treasury is prepared to show the necessary flexibility. The Post Office should be constituted as a public limited company. Only a small minority of the share capital - say 10 to 20 per cent - would be sold off, but a statutory bar would be placed on state aid, and the government would give a statutory commitment to exercise no more than the ordinary rights of a majority shareholder to receive dividends and control broad strategy. The Treasury should then let the Post Office operate freely. Treasury theologians will doubtless shake their heads, but such a policy may be the best way forward in the circumstances. The Post Office is a profitable enterprise, and has been run on business lines for more than a decade. It is not, therefore, a precedent to free the few other remaining public sector enterprises from the Treasury's control. Of course, the government's commitment not to rescue a failing Post Office is only as good as its statutory word. But equally, the state can use - and in the past has used - its power to rescue failing private companies, so the same argument could apply to any strategic industry. In practical terms, granting the Post Office freedom to develop its national and international business is less likely to lead to reliance on the taxpayer than is a continuation of the status quo.</p>

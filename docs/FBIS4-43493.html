			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Dini on Court Ruling on Pensions, </F> Spending"]    [Text] (ANSA) Washington, June 12 -- Saturday's [11 June]  ruling by Italy's constitutional court restoring pension  minimums to as many as 600,000 retired persons for an estimated  cost to the social security system of up to 16 trillion lire is  "bad news" for the Treasury, said Minister Lamberto Dini.    The top treasury official spoke in an interview with ANSA  during a visit here to meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen and Director General of the International Monetary Fund  Michel Camdessus.    Dini called the decision "a potential element worsening the  public accounts balance that the government will have to take  note of during the preparation of the 1995 budget."    The Treasury Minister did not rule out the need for new  budget adjustments soon to counteract the spending increase that  ruling will entail.    Dini said his U.S. and IMF interlocutors, with whom he  talked  about topics that will be discussed during the July Group of  Seven summit in Naples, had shown great interest in the 1995  budget, "from which they expect to be able to evaluate the  economic policy and strategy of the government."</p>

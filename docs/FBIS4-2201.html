			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chao Wen (6872 2429)] </F>   [Text] In order to implement the spirit of the work  conference sponsored by the CPC Central Committee, the Ministry  of Agriculture recently and further made arrangements in line  with the situation in agriculture and rural areas for easing the  burdens of peasants. In its arrangements, the ministry urged  the relevant departments of various localities to unswervingly  implement a series of policies and measures issued by the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council with regard to easing  peasants' burdens. It also urged them to consolidate their  achievements in this regard, to prevent relapse, to enhance the  standardized and legalized management over peasants' burdens, to  protect the economic interest of peasants, and to safeguard the  social stability of rural areas to promote the increase of  peasants' income and the decrease of their expenses.    The six specific measures put forward by the Ministry of  Agriculture are as follows:    1. Successfully grasping examination and verification. The  Ministry of Agriculture jointly with the relevant departments  will strictly examine and verify in line with the law the items  that have been abolished or postponed for implementation by the  CPC Central Committee and the State Council. Local supervisory  and managerial departments in charge of easing peasants' burdens  at all levels should actively coordinate with the relevant  departments to implement in a down-to-earth manner the policies  for easing peasants' burdens under the leadership of local  governments. Efforts should be made to strictly check and handle  documents and items related to giving burdens to peasants, which  have not been approved through legal procedures.    2. Successfully managing and using the funds retained from  peasants for overall projects. In line with the State Council's  "regulations on the management over charges and labor work  undertaken by peasants" and the provision on the 5-percent fixed  volume, we should enhance auditing of specific items of  peasants' burdens and prevent indiscriminate transfer and  misappropriation of funds collected from peasants and from their  labor work. We should achieve results in using the special  fund for special purposes and having peasants take up special  labor work for special projects. Efforts should be made to  resolutely correct faulty collections in 10 fields, which are  proscribed by the formal decree, and to improve managerial  methods on these collections. No one is allowed to collect more  charges from peasants by exaggerating the per peasant income.    3. Earnestly investigating and handling the vicious cases of  adding to peasants' burdens. The relevant departments should  strictly investigate and handle the vicious cases that occurred  in their own locality in 1993 and the prominent problems exposed  in the course of judicial inspection. Efforts should be made to  strictly deal with the vicious cases cropping up this year so as  to further safeguard the stability of rural society.    4. Carrying out consolidation over specific items. By  bearing in mind the current work of anticorruption and workstyle  rectification, we should conduct the management of specific  items in line with the demand put forward by Premier Li Peng in  his "government work report" made at the second session of the  Eighth National People's Congress with regard to "continuously  implementing the measures of easing peasants' burdens and  carrying out consolidation over the specific items to deal with  the prominent problems". We will continue to conduct judicial  inspection over the work of easing peasants' burdens this year.    5. Realistically enhancing the construction of legal  systems.  The Ministry of Agriculture and relevant departments will firmly  grasp the formulation of the "regulations on auditing the  specific items for charges and labor work undertaken by  peasants" and the "regulations on punishing the acts of adding  to peasants' burdens". They will enforce the card system of  supervising peasants' burdens and the system of formulating  budget for peasants' burdens as well as gradually enforce the  system of assigning full-time personnel to supervise peasants'  burdens.    6. Conducting the pilot work of setting an example for and  monitoring peasants' burdens. In line with the directives given  by the leading personnel of the State Council, the Ministry of  Agriculture jointly with the relevant departments will select  counties (cities) according to their regional economic  situation, which have representative characteristics, to carry  out deep-rooted reform in the pilot and demonstration work in  this regard. In line with the level of peasants' incomes, they  will establish the network and centers of monitoring peasants'  burdens so as to grasp, in a timely manner, the level of their  production, business, and incomes, as well as the trends of  their burdens, so that they can render service for macroeconomic  policies.</p>

This  is because Israel was not content with the horrible Hebron  massacre; it added to the many killed worshipers, who were  praying to God at the Ibrahimi Mosque, at least 30 other  martyrs, who were killed by the Israeli army's bullets, in  addition to hundreds of wounded.    Yesterday, Israel, using anti-tank rockets, destroyed a  number of houses in Dayr al-Balah, deployed large military  forces in the West Bank and Gaza Strip cities, closed Jerusalem,  denied worshipers access to the places of worship, and turned  the entire occupied homeland into a large battlefield.    Meanwhile, and out of persistence in provoking our kinsfolk  under the hateful occupation, new groups of Zionist settlers  have headed for Hebron. All this is taking in front of the  international community and the Security Council which failed to  condemn Israel and end its criminal acts that conflict with UN  principles, the Geneva agreements, and human rights.    It is strange that some parties in the international  community are talking and clamoring about human right violations  in many countries while at the same time they are turning a  blind eye to the Israelis' crimes and the serious Hebron  massacre which claimed the lives of more than 50 innocent  Palestinian citizens.    Therefore, it seems that the policy of double standards  continues to be the prevailing practice. This arbitrary policy,  however, cannot make a stable and secure world that would be  kept away from wars and threats. It is sufficient for us to  examine the UN reports, the testimonies of UN observers, and the  resolutions passed by the Security Council and the UN General  Assembly since 1947 to clearly sense that the Zionist military  organizations -- and afterward Israel, which was recognized by  many states in 1948 as an independent entity -- have committed  disgraceful massacres and crimes.    Some 46 years have passed since Israel's establishment and  incorporation into the United Nations. However, Israel still  flagrantly violates the UN principles. A crystal-clear example  of this was the Hebron Mosque massacre. But, has Israel ever  been punished? Has the international community championed its  own principles and the values of justice? In an attempt to  justify the international community's inefficiency, the powerful  western states in the Security Council have claimed that Arabs  reject peace with Israel. More than two years have passed since  the Madrid conference convened; the Washington talks have  entered their third year; and the Arab delegations have  continuously frequented Washington without any result.  Moreover, Syria submitted a document of principles, which the  entire world regarded as a historic event because it contained  positive, constructive, and balanced proposals. Israel,  however, rejected this document because it provides for  exchanging land for peace. Israel wants land first, in addition  to Arab recognition of Israel and the relinquishment of their  own lands and rights. In other words, Israel wants to entrench  occupation, usurpation, and the policy of expulsions and  aggression as a consistent attitude in the Middle East.    The international community should have strongly and firmly  intervened to impose a just and comprehensive peace in the  region. However, nothing has happened in this regard. This is  because the international community has not yet gone beyond the  phase of wishing that Israel would pursue the peace process.  Everything is taking place as if Israel is above the  international law and agreements. It is thus natural that the  instincts of haughtiness and arrogance are overwhelming the  Israeli rulers, so they reject peace, persist in the policy of  killings, annihilation, and expulsions, and seriously pursue the  policies of the old Nazis, knowing that these rulers have long  claimed they were victims to Nazi policy.    The Middle East is still a powder keg. If this keg explodes,  its repercussions will affect the region and the whole world.  Now that the Middle East situation is serious, the United  States has given priority to achieving a just and comprehensive  solution on all fronts of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The United  States made an initiative which the Arabs accepted. But Israel  has not yet accepted it. Israel will definitely not comply with  this initiative if the two cosponsors of the peace process,  along with the international community, do not intervene to  rectify matters and consecrate the Security Council's principles  and resolutions as the only basis for a just and comprehensive  solution.    The question posed is: When will the international community  move and assume its responsibilities, knowing that the Hebron  massacre was a rare opportunity for this council to impose its  authority and consecrate its principles?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Excerpt] Moscow, 17 Mar -- The Russian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs is concerned that a group of experts from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was unable fully to  carry out the tasks of inspecting the nuclear facilities of the  DPRK. A high-ranking source at the Russian Federation Ministry  of Foreign Affairs told an ITAR-TASS correspondent this today.  "This creates quite a serious situation," the diplomat said.    In his words, Russia is holding consultations on this matter  with other IAEA members. He noted however that there is still  some time before the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors, set  for 21 March, at which the results of the inspections are due to  be discussed. Consequently, the situation could develop in a  variety of ways, and the Russian Foreign Ministry will be  following it carefully. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Management buy-outs 'fall by a third' MANAGEMENT buy-out activ-ity fell steeply in the first six months of the year, although it still accounted for just under half of all merger and acquisition deals, according to figures published yesterday. A total of 206 buy-outs and buy-ins were completed in the first half of the year, a drop of more than one third on the same period last year and the lowest half-yearly figure since 1987. This decline in activity was due in part to the hopes of potential vendors that economic recovery was imminent and that if they waited they could obtain a better price for companies they sold. The annual review from the Nottingham University Centre for Management Buy-out Research also said that the end of the recession had reduced pressure on companies to make distress sales of parts of their business. Prospects for a short-term recovery were mixed, though in the longer term, buy-out activity was expected to increase again, the review said. The fall was less marked by value however and showed a drop of just over 10 per cent to Pounds 1.52bn. One reason for the decline was an end to the shake-out which followed the very active takeover market of the late 1980s. Most of the divestment activity which had resulted was complete, the review said. Buy-ins, which involve outside managers joining a company, fell more sharply than buy-outs in the first six months of this year. Buy-in numbers were halved to just 38 deals. Middle range buy-outs, valued at between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m, also declined sharply. Deal structures have changed with equity contributing a smaller share to overall funding. In small buy-outs worth less than Pounds 10m, equity stakes fell from two-fifths to one-third. Vendors and managements contributed on average just over 10 per cent of the total value of deals, the largest proportion since the mid 1980s. Buy-out companies accounted for one-fifth of all new companies coming to the stock market in the first half of this year, the highest proportion ever. UK Management Buy-Outs 1993.

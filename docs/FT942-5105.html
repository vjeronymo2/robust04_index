			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Montell plastics venture may go to court Challengers to a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) plastics joint venture between Anglo-Dutch company Royal Dutch/Shell and Italy's Montedison are likely to take the European Commission to the European Court of First Instance, one step below the European Court of Justice, if it approves the deal. A final decision on the fiercely contested case is likely to be given tomorrow. The Commission is expected to give its approval after having considered concessions put forward by Montedison and Royal Dutch/Shell that they say will limit the strength of the joint venture. But the deal's main challengers - principally US-owned Union Carbide - are not satisfied that the undertakings will prevent the joint venture, Montell, from dominating the European polypropylene market and hindering competition. 'There is a lot at stake,' said one observer of the case. 'The complainants would have to consider their position.' The challengers to the Montell deal argue that concessions - hastily presented by Montedison and Royal Dutch/Shell to the Commission last week - do not answer the objections raised by the Commission in the first place. An advisory committee to the Commission last month recommended that the deal be blocked. It is understood that their objections related to the prospect of a near monopoly on polypropylene technologies. The creation of Montell would be one of the biggest of a series of joint ventures and asset sales in the European chemicals industry in the last two years. Manufacturers are restructuring to cope with recession and strong new competitors in eastern Europe, the Middle East and east Asia. Montell would be easily the world's biggest polypropylene manufacturer. Thanks to a separate arrangement between Shell Oil, the US arm of the company, and Union Carbide, it would also give Shell control over two of the most important polypropylene manufacturing technologies. A decision by the contestants to continue the challenge in the European Court of First Instance would be an unusual step. The Commission has only rarely been challenged, the best known case being when Air France challenged British Airways' acquisition of UK airline Dan-Air. Earlier this year, the court rejected Air France's appeal against the European Commission's finding that British Airways' acquisition of Dan Air was outside the scope of the European Merger Regulation.</p>

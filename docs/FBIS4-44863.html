			<p>CSO     [Text] Bonn, 8 June. Research support should be extended  to the use of new ideas in pilot products. This was the view of  Guenter Rexrodt, Federal Minister for Economics, and Hans  Wohlfart, the president of the Working Association of Industrial  Research Associations (AiF). Technology policy of the  traditional pattern has often been inadequate, said Rexrodt. A  comprehensive innovation policy must include the entire sequence  of the innovation process from the discovery of the idea up to  market readiness, he said. Speaking at the annual AiF meeting in  Cologne, the FDP politician Rexrodt advocated a basically new  approach in this direction in order to facilitate the conversion  of research results into new products.    Wohlfart too said that the efforts of the state and industry  must lead to usable innovations. He urged that pre-competitve  organized industrial cooperative research should be supplemented  by supporting applications research, related to products and  processes, in small and medium companies. This support could  start from the results of cooperative research and extend as far  as pilot applications. Moreover, Wohlfart appealed to  politicians to raise the support for cooperative research from  the current 170 million German marks [DM] to the actual need of  about DM250 million, and to eliminate the freeze on expenditures  for 1994. Rexrodt said that the budget freeze would not burden  cooperative research.    In view of the forty-year existence of the AiF, Rexrodt,  Wohlfart, and Tyll Necker, the president of the Federal  Association of German Industry (BDI), stressed how this  instrument of industrial cooperative research has proven itself.  In 1950, Ludwig Erhard, then the Minister for Economics,  provided DMl million in his budget for the first time for  "strengthening the capability of small and medium industry." In  1954, 20 research association of various industrial branches  joined to form the autonomous organization AiF. During the past  four decades, more than 10,000 projects have been financed with  more than two billion marks of public funds and at least twice  as many from industry's own funds, Wohlfart said. The basic  elements of cooperative research--cooperation of companies in  research associations and availability of the results without  charge--have proven themselves in the new laender as well,  according to Wohlfart. In the new laender, 3000 medium and small  enterprises and 34 research institutes have become members of  AiF associations. Four new research associations from eastern  Germany have broadened the spectrum of industrial branches. As  a project manager, the AiF administers one-third of the federal  government's subsidies for the new laender. The federal  research aid for the new laender was well received by small  firms in particular, according to AiF. Stabilization at a low  level was unmistakable, said Wohlfart, who himself is the  business manager of a textile company in Saxony. However,  eastern German small business had too little capital to be able  to do research themselves. For this reason, continuity of state  research aid was all the more necessary, he said.    Rexrodt feels that a critical examination of AiF processes  and instruments is necessary. He asked whether the right  research projects are being supported and whether the  distribution of means is still flexible enough to keep up with  the rapid pace of worldwide innovation. Wohlfart also felt that  it was important to simplify and streamline AiF administrative  procedures. Important progress has already been made in this  area, he said.</p>

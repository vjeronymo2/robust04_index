			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Just Joshing: When George Bush gives a speech, he sometimes warms up his  audience with news-oriented humor. At a recent New York fund-raiser for  congressional candidate Susan Molinari, he said: "Here I am in the middle of  the battle right here in New York, where one of the great contests of 1990 will  take place. A lot is at stake -- there's been a lot of money spent on both  sides, a lot of press attention." He paused, then quipped. "But I'm not here to  talk about the Trumps."  </P> <P> No Contest: Gretchen Polhemus, Miss USA 1989, has some advice for her newly  crowned successor: "I told her to get an attorney. There's a lot of things in  that contract that are unclear." Polhemus told the Wichita., Kan., Eagle in an  interview published Sunday that she was required to work 12-hour days and  hadn't received all her prizes. The new Miss USA, Carole Gist, 20, of Detroit,  was crowned Friday in Wichita. Pageant spokeswoman Sara Meza said officials  renegotiated Polhemus' contract to give her more days off after she complained.  </P> <P> Keeping Distance: Democratic candidates are not beating down Gov. Michael S.  Dukakis' door for his endorsement this year. Even Dukakis has joked that the  best favor he could do for one Democratic candidate for treasurer, House  Speaker George Keverian, would be to endorse the Republican opponent, Joe  Malone. State Sen. Richard Kraus, candidate for treasurer, said of such an  endorsement: "The negatives are so high right now." Former state Atty. Gen.  Francis X. Bellotti, a leading Democratic candidate for governor, "does not  really place any value on an endorsement at that level," said a spokesman. Rep.  John Flood, who was an outspoken critic of the governor during the presidential  campaign, said he would use a Dukakis endorsement against whoever received it.  "Obviously, it would be used by the campaign as a negative," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Wagrowska: "A Long Run: Membership in </F> NATO"]    [Text] It is anyone's guess how long we will have to wait  for full membership in NATO and Western security guarantees.  The Russian position is the main -- but to be sure not the only  one -- reason why NATO flinches at the thought of admitting  Central and East European states to the bloc. Another major  reason is the organization's unwillingness or perhaps even  inability for serious change. It seems that chances for the  admission of Poland and other states from this region to NATO  will not be realistic until these two problems are solved. For  the time being, we must be happy with the "Partnership for  Peace."    After President's Clinton declaration about the lack of  agreement among NATO countries on the admission of "new  democracies," it is highly unlikely that the situation can  change with only a few hours left before the "16" summit. While  any decision of the North Atlantic bloc can be approved by  consensus, only four states -- Germany, the Netherlands,  Belgium, and Norway -- accept the possibility of NATO's  expansion.    Even if the bloc declares that Poland might become a NATO  member in the future, this would be a nonbinding declaration.  It will contain nothing that would allow Poland and other  Central European states to count on NATO's helping hand in the  event our security is jeopardized.    However, lack of "written" guarantees on the part of the  only  military and political organization in Europe should not be  demonized. If the West thought that defending Poland was in its  interests, it very well might extend us some kind of military  support. Otherwise, Poland and other states of the region would  have to have to expect the support -- rather hypothetically --  of the United Nations and CSCE. Several months ago, NATO  spurned a Hungarian request for security guarantees -- prompted  by the Balkan crisis -- saying that country could count on aid  from the United Nations if its security were threatened.  <H5>  Bad Russia </H5>   According to a widely held belief, the main reason why NATO  flinches at the thought of its expansion into Central and East  Europe is the Russian position. Using an entire range of  diplomatic and political means, Russia managed to force the West  into respecting its interests and accepting its drive to  influence the area west of its state borders. While the West  says it denies Russia the right to veto NATO's expansion, at the  same time it explains its reluctance to have new members by  citing an unwillingness to create new divisions in Europe.    NATO gave Russia the time it needed to realize its  significance. The West has probably committed a new sin with  regard to that country by trusting that the Russian political  establishment will change its perception of the Russian place in  Europe and the world. After all, we all laughed at Andrey  Kozyrev's "joke" at the CSCE conference in Stockholm last year,  when he warned of expansionist policies if the Yeltsin team lost  power in Russia.  <H5>  In the Background </H5>   Such Western policies have created the impression that  Central Europe is being pushed to the background. European  relations increasingly depend on the triangle connecting  Washington, Bonn, and Moscow. Germany, which has been most  vocal about the need to grant Poland and other countries  admission into NATO, gives priority to relations with Moscow,  and the United States proposes its "strategic partnership."  This goes very well with Russia's efforts that Central European  states be given security guarantees. According to this policy,  our countries are left in a gray zone securing a kind of  geopolitical balance in Europe. This would mainly apply to  Poland as a country in a significant strategic location.    The West also seems to attach great importance to the  "order-maintaining role" of Moscow in the CIS. This was proved  at the CSCE conference in Rome which sanctioned Russian  peacekeeping missions on territory of the former Soviet Union.  The Russian Army can guarantee relative stability in that  region and will always be able to head off any worst-case  scenario.    Should the Russian position continue to influence U.S. and  NATO policies so much, we can be waiting for NATO admission for  a very long time. No one is sure how long it will take for  Russian diplomacy to fully accept the sovereignty of countries  which used to be its satellites.    NATO's relations with our country have little to do with the  scenario that is currently developing in Moscow. No matter what  happens -- whether the situation takes a dramatic turn (coup or  Zhirinovskiy-style eruption of nationalism) or democracy  prevails with Yeltsin agreeing to Poland's membership in NATO --  this would have little effect on Western policy concerning us.  This raises the following question: Does the Russian  reluctance to see Poland in NATO give the West a good excuse, a  smokescreen?  <H5>  Behind the Smokescreen </H5>   The fact that the West participates in Moscow's game cannot  be explained only by the fear of Russia or a reluctance to raise  new barriers in Europe. NATO does not want any new members also  because the expansion of a respected and wealthy group of 16  states would change the organization itself. Organizationally  and financially, it is not prepared for rebuilding its  structure, deploying troops according to new principles,  reforming systems of command, and allowing the East open access  to modern military equipment.    Notably, at its Brussels summit, the bloc is not planning to  alter the strategy it adopted at the end of 1991, despite  numerous promises that it will adapt it to meet conditions in  the changing world. The only new element will be a decision  about creating the so-called combined operational forces which  could engage in UN- or CSCE-sponsored actions (also in  cooperation with the East). Also, experts prepared a 900-page  report on NATO's participation in peaceful operations which,  given the bloc's refusal to get directly involved in the  Yugoslav conflict, will only be good for recycling.    In addition, France is increasingly perceived as moving  closer to NATO structures. From now on, the French defense  minister could participate in its meetings. No French minister  has attended a NATO defense meeting since 1966, when France  withdrew from the bloc's military structures.    NATO politicians and diplomats emphasize that the bloc's  purpose should be to "organize" a security system. NATO could  become the cornerstone of a common European system in the future  which would consist of cooperation in the framework of NATO, the  European Union, the CSCE, and the United Nations. However, this  task might not be fulfilled either, if the North Atlantic bloc  turns into an elite company, keeping "new democracies" outside.    "Partnership for Peace"    The concept of the "Partnership for Peace," as it is  presented by its American authors, can be summed up in four  basic points.    1. Becoming a NATO member is a process.    2. The "Partnership" is an initial step toward possible  membership; at first, all of the 22 post-communist states and  NATO's partners from the North Atlantic Cooperation Council will  have equal chances. This, however, does not mean that some  country will automatically gain NATO membership.    3. The "Partnership" will not be a substitute for the  membership for states which have a chance of becoming NATO  members.    4. Besides the above conditions, NATO will not define in the  immediate future any specific conditions allowing, if met,  candidates to count on membership or any timetable for admission.    According to the "Partnership for Peace," consultations with  NATO are possible when some East European state feels that its  security, territorial integrity, or independence are threatened.  From the West's point of view, the following provisions are  supposed to be very important:    1. Defense and budget planning;    2. Democratic (political, civilian) control over the  military;    3. Cooperation in peace missions conducted under the  auspices of the United Nations and CSCE;    4. Specification by each "partner" of troops which  could participate in joint operations;    5. Joint training, exercises, and maneuvers;    6. Search and rescue missions;    7. Establishment of representation bureaus at NATO  headquarters in Brussels and the military headquarters (SHAPE)  [Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe] in Mons; a teamwork  of officers;    The "Partnership" program will also be open for neutral  states which, in contrast to Central and East European  countries, never belonged to the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council.</p>

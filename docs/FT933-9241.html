			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / CIA chief collects body from Georgia THE director of the US Central Intelligence Agency yesterday collected the body of a US diplomat murdered earlier this week in the republic of Georgia. The visit to Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, by Mr James Woolsey, the new CIA director, confirmed reports that the murdered man was a CIA agent. Mr Woolsey flew to Tbilisi after talks in Moscow with Mr Yevgeny Primakov, his Russian counterpart. Mr Fred Woodruff, described as a US political counsellor, was shot dead on Sunday night by an unknown gunman as he was riding in a car driven by the personal security chief of the Georgian leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze. Officials quoted by the New York Times said Mr Woodruff was one of several people known by the Georgian leadership to be working for the CIA. No motive has been officially advanced for the killing however. It may also have been a random shooting incident in Georgia's civil strife, or aimed at Mr Shevardnadze's security chief, or simply to embarrass Mr Shevardnadze, who is fighting both domestic political rivals and separatist rebels. The head of Russia's Security Council, one of the country's top decision-making bodies, has offered to resign, Interfax news agency said yesterday. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, 51, appointed just two months ago, told the agency he had asked President Boris Yeltsin to be relieved of his duties but gave no reasons. It was not immediately clear whether his resignation had been accepted.</p>

Municipal workers, however, have arrived at the Municipal Palace  building and are staging protests outside. They have said they  will support any measure decided on by the United Workers Front  [FUT] and labor organizations.    In Quito, demonstrations and clashes between the National  Police and workers and students are slowly gaining strength,  specifically in the Theater Plaza near the Ecuadoran Federation  of Classist Organizations headquarters where some labor leaders  are protesting. The protest is gaining momentum in nearby areas.  People are blocking traffic in the El Tejar tunnels. Students  and workers are sporadically gathering, and when they are  dispersed, they gather somewhere else to continue their protests.    There is absolutely no transportation in downtown Quito.  There is no means of transportation in the historic part of the  city. Taxis have disappeared. In the [word indistinct] area,  where buses were circulating, they have disappeared given the  growing demonstrations.    This is where the bus drivers union, the Pichincha Drivers  Union, is located. It has also been attacked by people who are  protesting. Diverse sectors have rejected the transportation  sector's attitude, which has not joined the strike. In the  historic part of the city, the strike is all encompassing. We  can observe hundreds of people walking through the historic part  of the capital.    Businesses and banks have closed their doors due to protests  and clashes between the police and workers. Also, people cannot  go about their daily business activities. We were able to  contact Roberto Paz, government under secretary and president of  the National Traffic Council, who made statements assessing what  has taken place in this strike by the FUT. According to the  government spokesperson, everything is normal throughout the  country.    [Begin recording] [Paz] Reports we have indicate that the  disturbances are under control, especially in the [word  indistinct] and the places where students are present.    [Unidentified reporter] Have there been clashes?    [Paz] No, there have not been any clashes with the police,  according to reports we have received. We hope there will not be  any either. We urge the strikers to conduct the strike in a calm  manner to prevent further disruptions. [words indistinct]</p>

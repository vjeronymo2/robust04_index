N. Pryakhin, candidate of technical sciences, </F> All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Nuclear Electric  Stations; UDC 621.311.25:621.39]    [Abstract] The U.S.-developed RETACT (Real-time Advanced  Core and Thermohydraulic) program was used to study processes of  interphase interaction of gas-liquid flow in the circulation  loop and the core of an installation with a water-modulated  VVER-1000 reactor in accidents involving coolant loss. The  researchers examined accidents with uncompensated flows and  partial malfunction of the emergency core-cooling system. The  calculation assumed the failure of one of three emergency  low-pressure feed pump, as well as the failure of the passive  sector of the emergency core-cooling system. The researchers  concluded that, with uncompensated flows of loop one and the  operation of the emergency core-cooling system, water seals form  in the ``cold'' lines of the circulation loop. The behavior of  individual loops is unsymmetrical from the standpoint of the  formation of water seals. The magnitude of flow determines the  formation of the water seals and the variation in the  hydrostatic head of the coolant in them. The formation of the  water seals leads to a worsening of the thermohydraulic state of  the core and, consequently, to it overheating (and triggering of  the emergency core-cooling system). A pipe of at least 50 mm in  diameter must be used to drain the water seals. Figures 11,  references 6: 4 Russian, 2 Western.</p>

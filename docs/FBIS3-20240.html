Moreover, according to polling figures  from Doxa, the League is holding its ground in the proportional  quota, too, achieving 9 percent -- more than it achieved in the  previous general election (8.9 percent). This is essentially a  success for Bossi's strategy, based entirely on the bid to  establish the League's identity in its internal conflict with  [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi. Bossi was also  reassured by the result in Milan's constituency number one, for  which he was elected.    However, the result achieved by the League has not altered  Bossi's basic stances and has not resolved its suspicions and  problems. Essentially, there are two: accession to the  government with the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and the prime  ministership for Silvio Berlusconi. In his initial response  Bossi confirmed this: "The pole for freedom has won, and a  government must be formed comprising the pole for freedom." He  then renewed his rejection of the MSI: "No accords with the  reactionary right." And he barred Berlusconi's path to the  premiership: "Berlusconi is an intelligent man; I do not think  that he will ask again for the prime ministership, partly  because he is someone that has economic vested interests, so it  is better for him not to try." He repeated his charges against  Forza Italia, his problematic ally: "They tried to eliminate  us," he said, "and I must say that they did so intelligently, by  recycling the old and finding a very representative  entrepreneur."    Then Bossi returned to his original forecasts: "The results  are more or less as we imagined; now we must examine them in  detail and try to understand them properly; we could govern with  the pole for freedom, but it must be kept in mind that over the  years the League has protected the democratic framework against  a reactionary right." Bossi was irritated by the National  Alliance's success in the north, too, and repeated, "reactionary  right." He said: "We are in favor of a modern and liberal  Italy, not a reactionary right." "Are you referring to the  MSI?" he was asked. "Just consider the 12 percent granted to  the MSI." Bossi was very cautious, however, and stressed the  need to examine Berlusconi's and [MSI and National Alliance (AN)  leader] Fini's programs, but repeated again: "With us, the  reactionary right shall not pass."    Reporters pressed Bossi on the subject of possible external  backing from the National Alliance for a League-Forza Italia  government. Bossi was evasive, and repeated: "We will have to  examine the figures." By 2220 hours [2020 GMT] the atmosphere  at League headquarters was more relaxed. The League had escaped  the trap laid "by the old regime." But a little earlier, at  2000 hours [1800 GMT], the atmosphere was different, very  different. It was tense. Maroni was bombarded by telephone  calls: "Is it true that Bossi wants to break up the pole for  freedom?" "What is happening within the League?" The calls  were from journalists and politicians, all based on rumors from  Rome. The lower house floor leader was the only important  League politician at League headquarters, where he had been in  charge since 1600 hours [1400 GMT], always humorous and  courteous, but clearly tense. As he passed from one television  channel to another, he reflected: "If the League loses  proportionately with respect to the previous general election,  then we must draw the conclusions and carry out a thorough  political assessment that must embrace not only the League but  the other forces too. If Berlusconi scores a major success, a  spectacular success, the blame will lie partly with those who  failed to realize what was happening in the country, those who  mistook `Avanzi' viewers for the entire electorate. With those  who failed to understand the League's role." In fact none of  this happened. Sunday afternoon [27 March] Bossi said more  simply: "Berlusconi was invented by those on the Left."    "It is time for us to roll up our sleeves; the voters have  decided to grant us a very responsible role, and we will not  disappoint them." Roberto Maroni, the Northern League's great  planner, the man who, on Bossi's behalf, has organized the  complex web of the League's negotiations, did not want to  exclude any possibility. Leaving aside the results as they  emerged, he took his time: "Sunday 10 April in Pontida will see  a crucial step in the history of the new Republic." More than  that, Maroni, and Bossi too, would not say. They made it clear  that there will be a strong defense of the League's  "northernist" role, and repeated that the "negotiations for the  new government will be carried out under the shadow of Milan  cathedral."    The problem that has been facing League leaders for some  days is this: What kind of government? With Berlusconi? With  Berlusconi and Fini? With Berlusconi and the center? Or an  institutional -- or, rather, constitutional -- government?  Though portrayed by the media recently as a quarrelsome and  eccentric appendage to Berlusconi and snubbed in favor of the  novelty of Fini in the new guise of a [French Rally for the  Republic (RPR) Secretary General] Chirac, basically the League  has never lost its central role in the political negotiations.  Late Sunday afternoon [Mino] Martinazzoli [Italian Popular  Party (PPI) secretary] tried to phone Bossi, and Monday morning  MSI lower house floor leader Giuseppe Tatarella, Fini's  strategist, tried to contact his opposite number, Maroni.  Throughout the election campaign very private personal meetings  have gone on between the PDS' [Democratic Party of the Left]  Claudio Petruccioli and Bossi's deputy.    On the basis of the election results as they appeared last  night, the League faces two problems. The first is its  relations with the MSI. After voting at Gemonio, near the  Edoardo Curti junior school, Sunday afternoon, Bossi had no  doubts: "I refuse to have anything to do with the fascists."  With the appearance of a government minister, in his blue  jacket and gray trousers -- undermined by a yellow necktie by  Forattini on loan from his trusted Maroni -- Bossi did not seem  desperate to form a government at any price: "We and Forza  Italia will govern, but not with the MSI." The watchword for  the League leaders is, "if the numbers permit." If the numbers  permit the formation of a government with Forza Italia; if not,  then if the numbers permit the formation of an institutional  government; and so forth. "Of course," Bobo Maroni said  yesterday at 1300 hours [1100 GMT], "how can we say `no' to the  pole for freedom without having an alternative government to put  forward? There must be an alternative; we cannot proceed toward  political chaos...."    The other major problem is the prime ministership, sought by  Berlusconi but denied by Bossi. This is one of the topics of  conflict within the pole. "The League does not give a damn  about Berluskaiser," Bossi, in the guise of prime minister, said  in the bar at Gemonio Sunday afternoon. But his aim seems to be  not so much to gain the premiership for himself or another  League member as to prevent Berlusconi from gaining it, opening  the way, rather, to some technocrat approved by the League.</p>

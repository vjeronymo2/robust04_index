			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'DEGRASSI HIGH,' 'WONDERWORKS' RETURN TO PBS  </P> <P> Two award-winning series for young teens make a welcome return to PBS this  weekend -- "Degrassi High" and "Wonderworks."  </P> <P> In a special one-hour premiere at 6 p.m. Sunday on Channel 28, "Degrassi High"  takes up where two seasons of "Degrassi Junior High" left off. Still proving  itself one of the gutsiest series on television, the show, which previously has  addressed alcoholism, homosexuality and racism, takes on the issue of abortion.  </P> <P> Last season ended with the junior high school burning down, but Spike, Wheels,  the twins Erica and Heather, Snake and the whole gang are now ninth- and  10th-graders, adjusting to life in a new, big-city high school.  </P> <P> While the new students are going through an unofficial, relatively lighthearted  "initiation" at the hands of older students, Erica is dealing with the  discovery that, at age 16, she's pregnant.  </P> <P> No one knows but her sister. Their religion says abortion is wrong and they  have both taken strong anti-abortion stands in the past. Heather calls clinics  "killing centers."  </P> <P> A classroom discussion of abortion, talks with unwed mother Spike and with a  clinic counselor, give both sides of the issue passion and weight. It is clear  that whatever Erica decides will change her life.  </P> <P> That's the strength of this funny/serious series. What happens to each  character will be referred to in the future -- there's no sitcom amnesia at  work. When parents divorce, when illnesses, failures and successes happen, the  kids of Degrassi are affected, change and grow like real people.  </P> <P> "Wonderworks" makes a lower key return with "Sweet 15," a predictable but  well-acted drama about a Mexican-American girl's coming of age. (It airs today  at 8 p.m. on Channel 15 and Sunday at 8 p.m. on Channel 28.)  </P> <P> Marta Delacruz (Karla Montana) is looking forward to her 15th birthday Mass and  celebration that will publicly mark her entry into womanhood. The party will be  costly, but Dad (Tony Plana) is a proud, successful man, living his American  dream.  </P> <P> But Dad has a secret that threatens their security. He is not an American  citizen. Working as a volunteer in her church's Amnesty office, Marta discovers  his secret when she comes across his citizenship application.  </P> <P> Sharon Weil's script traces Marta's path out of childhood as she helps her  father gain his citizenship and gains her own understanding of the hardships he  has endured to give his family a future.  </P> <P> The telling could be shorter (Part 2 of the two-hour drama airs next weekend),  but Montana, Plana, Jenny Gago as Marta's mother, Panchito Gomez as the  handsome older boy who earns his way into Marta's heart, and guest stars Susan  Ruttan, Jerry Stiller and Liz Torres work as a smooth ensemble to make it all  worthwhile.

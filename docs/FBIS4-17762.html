			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian delegation is ready for negotiations  with Chechnya and has the appropriate authority for this, Vice  Premier Sergey Shakhray declared in his interview with Interfax.  "Russia is going to hold the negotiations without any ultimatums  or preliminary conditions but with a precise political  position," he emphasized.    In his opinion, a single position with respect to Chechnya  among Russia's supreme echelons of power is an important premise  for a success.    As Shakhray underlined, "Moscow intends to hold  consultations  with all real political forces and power bodies in Chechnya and  then to precisely fix a draft agreement on the division of  authorities and the subject of these consultations, then it  intends to start negotiations and preparation of a draft  agreement just after the State Duma adopts a corresponding  decision." Shakhray said that it will be necessary to sign the  agreement only after democratic free elections in Chechnya.    Russia will use a similar mechanism as that used with  Tatarstan to achieve agreement at the negotiations. To quote  Shakhray that mechanism was "when we first of all searched for  concrete authorities in various spheres, in transport, oil  processing, agrarian sector, border defense, etc., and then  included the reached agreements into a political formula on  relations."</p>

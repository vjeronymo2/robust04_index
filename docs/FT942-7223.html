			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Sustained growth in fees behind Warburg's Pounds 297m SG Warburg, the investment bank, reported record pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 reflecting sustained growth in commission and fee income from advisory and underwriting activities. At Pounds 297m, profits were double the comparable Pounds 148.2m, on total operating income of Pounds 1.04bn (Pounds 715.8m). Earnings per share were 82.4p (39.6p) or 75.7p (37.5p) fully diluted. The total dividend is increased to 22p (19p) with a proposed final of 16p. Mercury Asset Management, the 75 per cent-owned subsidiary, reported a 33 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 109.5m (Pounds 82.3m) despite a sharp rise in expenses. Earnings per share rose to 42.9p (32.6p) and the dividend is raised 50 per cent to 18.5p (12p), lowering cover to 1.99 times. The investment banking side recovered to Pounds 187.5m, almost three times the Pounds 65.9m of the previous year. Funds under management rose from Pounds 49.7bn to Pounds 60.4bn, of which Pounds 3.7bn was net new cash. A little more than 25 per cent of the new cash came from UK institutions, the source of most of MAM's fund management business. Another Pounds 1bn came from investment trusts, Pounds 400m from charities and private banking with the remainder from international sources. 'The business, in common with the industry, has had a good year,' said Lord Cairns, chief executive. However, he added: 'It could prove to be a peak year in the economic cycle.' After a strong first half, revenues from fee and commission-based activities continued to grow strongly throughout the year. Group fee and commission income rose from Pounds 478.1m to Pounds 749.1m, of which Pounds 446.6m was earned in the second half. While declining to predict whether fees could maintain momentum, Lord Cairns said: 'The pipeline of business is still very strong.' And he noted that new issue underwriting was the single most significant contributor. Although revenues from marketmaking and proprietary trading improved from Pounds 145.5m to Pounds 207.2m, most - Pounds 140.6m - were received in the first half. They were significantly lower in the second six months, which included volatile trading conditions in most world markets in February. However, Lord Cairns said that a greater, and more stable, percentage of overall profits was likely to be derived from trading in the future than is currently the case. Largely as a result of the increased trading activities, gearing rose sharply to 41 per cent, having hovered at about 15 per cent for the previous three years, and may rise further. 'We think our gearing is conservative relative to the industry,' Lord Cairns said. He said that more than 50 per cent of the group's business was now derived from outside the UK and would increasingly be international. Mr Hugh Stevenson, MAM chairman, said that the fund management company's activities were also increasingly international with about 20 per cent of all funds under management being those of non-UK clients. Growing demand for fund management services for so-called defined contribution schemes helped assets of Mercury Life, the life assurance division, to nearly triple to Pounds 155m. However, expenses have risen in the past year by a third to Pounds 133m, while turnover rose more modestly. Mr Stevenson attributed the rise to increased performance-related pay and an increase in back office staff in the later half of 1993 to cope with the sharp rise in trading turnover.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> WHOOPS: Supply-side economist and former Reagan adviser Arthur B. Laffer is  re-evaluating his seat on the board of Irvine-based FundAmerica Inc. He says he  was surprised by last week's arrest of FundAmerica's president and charges that  the company runs a Florida pyramid scheme. Laffer says he joined the board  several months ago after carefully evaluating its marketing approach as a  "club" that gives consumer product discounts to its members. "The concept . . .  makes a lot of sense to me," he says, adding that "everything is up in the air  right now." Dean Takahashi and Kristina Lindgren  </P></p>

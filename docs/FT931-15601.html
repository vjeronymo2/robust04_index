			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Hopes rise at Bosnia peace talks: Serb leader makes first substantial concessions on future constitution MR Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday made his first substantial concessions in the Geneva peace talks, raising hopes that agreements on a future constitution for Bosnia-Hercegovina and a halt to fighting may be reached in the next few days. But as Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, joined the talks officials warned it was still not clear whether the Bosnian Serbs were prepared to accept the international mediators' most vital conditions for an agreement. Although Mr Karadzic said in a radio interview that the Bosnian Serbs were prepared to sign an agreement that they would not secede from a future state of Bosnia-Hercegovina, he maintained his demand that the Serbian parts of the country should be allowed to forge their own international relations. The international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, have proposed the creation of an independent, sovereign Bosnia-Hercegovina, divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, which would not, however, have the power to decide on their own international relations. Specifically, the mediators have rejected Mr Karadzic's demands for 'a state within a state', which could later join a greater Serbia. Yesterday, Mr Karadzic, who has proved to be a master of imprecision and contradiction when it comes to translating his political demands into the language of international law, said: 'We don't demand a state within a state, in the proper sense of the word. What we can't give up is our identity and personality within Bosnia-Hercegovina.' As an example of the kind of status he wanted the Bosnian Serbs to have, he cited the position of Quebec in Canada, 'which has more than 1,000 contracts with France'. Significantly, however, the Bosnian Serb leader said more negotiations were required to provide the Serbs with additional guarantees which would protect their specific identity in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Later Mr Fred Eckhard, the conference spokesman, said that despite Mr Karadzic's reservations, the Bosnian Serb leader was 'leaning very far towards acceptance'. Mr Karadzic has been given until 10am today to give his final reply to the co-chairmen's proposals. President Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, who is due to rejoin the talks today after attending the conference of Islamic states in Dakar, will make sure that the wording of the final constitutional agreement will be as close as possible to that proposed by the mediators. Mr Milosevic, after meeting Mr Karadzic separately, gave the impression that he was anxious to help the conclusion of a peace settlement. France tones down threat; Constitutional plan, Page 2</p>

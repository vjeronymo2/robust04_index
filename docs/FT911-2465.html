			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: South African industrials enjoy a record run - Economic optimism and the easing of sanctions triggered the rise THE SHARP rise in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Industrial Index this year reminds local investment managers of the London adage, 'sell in May and go away'. The index has risen 25.8 per cent from 2,829 on January 16 to a record high of 3,559 on Friday. It slipped to 3,535 yesterday. Industrial stocks, on an average price/earnings (p/e) ratio of 11.3 and an earnings yield of 8.8, are not expensive compared with some overseas shares, but they are high by South Africanstandards. Fund managers agree that the index, if not overvalued, is at least fully valued. They may not yet be thinking of selling, but they will certainly be doing less buying, as value is becoming increasingly difficult to find. Mr Roy McAlpine of Liberty Life comments: 'Already we have seen heavier growth from January 1 in the financial and industrial (sectors) than even the most optimistic commentator would have forecast.' Lending support to the view that the market is due for a breather is the fact that the recent rise in the industrial index has been a rerating - there has been no commensurate rise in earnings or dividends - to which there must be an upward limit. The outlook for corporate profits suggests that the market is looking two years ahead rather than one. Mr Niall Brown of stockbrokers Simpson Mckie says it forecasts 5 to 6 per cent nominal growth in the profits of industrial companies in the next six to 12 months, compared with inflation of 13 to 14 per cent. What, then, hasmoved the index? First, expectations of much improved earnings growth from nextyear onwards. Mr Rob Lee of the Board of Executors, a financial services group,notes: 'In the new South Africa one can imagine that the industrial companies are the ones that potentially can benefit.' Consumer-oriented companies,such as Wooltru, Edgars, Pick N Pay and South African Breweries, which are wellplaced to capitalise upon growth in the urban black market, are all on p/e ratios of close to 20. A second reason is positive economic sentiment. The recession has bottomed out much earlier than the previous two, meaning that earnings have not been that badly hit. Mr Lee says it was mostly an inventory and investment recession. Consumer spending has stayed fairly buoyant throughout, and company balance sheets are in much better shape. While businessmen remain cautiously optimistic about political developments, there is a more definite feeling that things can only improve on the economic front. Interest rates were lowered in March and, although no further cuts are expected in the short term, the trend is downwards. The gradual easing of trade and financial sanctions has also improved sentiment. The buoyant performance of world markets has also helped the JSE Industrial Index, which traditionally tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The index has benefited from two important features of the JSE: the poor liquidity in the industrial sector and the weight of institutional funds. Exchange control has long created a hothouse effect on the JSE, with institutions being forced to chase a limited number of marketable stocks. This has recently been compounded by other factors, including the decline in interestin mining shares as the gold industry's fortunes have waned, which has resultedin an increased focus on industrial stocks. The gold index fell from the year'shigh of 1,367 in mid-January to a low of 971 on February 25, a drop of 29 per cent. It has since rallied, and closed at 1,026 yesterday. Also relevant have been the fall in disinvestment, an absence of big rights issues and no majorprivatisations. These factors, combined with bearish market sentiment, drove institutional liquidity to high levels at the end of 1990. The return of these funds into equities over the past few months has been a significant factor in driving the market upward, as fund managers rushed to ensure that they did notmiss out on the market's strong rise.</p>

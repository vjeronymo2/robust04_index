			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] Egypt is trying to reduce the tension with  Israel that has surfaced in the multilateral arms control talks.  Nabil Fahmi, an aide to the Egyptian foreign minister and head  of the Egyptian delegation to the arms control talks, yesterday  visited Israel for a meeting with David 'Ivri, director general  of the Defense Ministry and head of the Israeli delegation.    In this first-of-its-kind direct meeting between the Israeli  and Egyptian representatives to the arms control talks, the  sides were able to attain understandings that will prevent  unnecessary bickering in the upcoming meeting in Cairo planned  later this month between all the countries participating in the  multilateral arms control talks.    The controversy between Egypt and Israel has centered on  Egyptian diplomatic efforts to disarm Israel of its nuclear  capacity and its demand to raise the nuclear issue in the  multilateral talks as soon as possible.    Israel, on the other hand, demands to start the process by  implementing confidence-building-measures between the region's  countries, and to delay the nuclear issue until stable peace  arrangements are implemented in the area.

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Kinkel pressed to resign as leader of Germany's FDP Mr Klaus Kinkel, leader of Germany's Free Democrats and the country's foreign minister, last night faced mounting pressure from his party to resign following a hostile reception by delegates attending a special meeting in Gera in the eastern state of Thuringia. The party's presidium was expected to meet in emergency session last night to decide whether it would ask for Mr Kinkel's resignation. Other senior party members have already suggested that Mr Wolfgang Gerhardt, party leader of Hesse, is a possible successor to Mr Kinkel. 'He is under extreme pressure to resign. That is no surprise given the string of electoral defeats,' said Ms Irmgard Schwaetzer, the former construction minister. 'He will sleep on it tonight. But we should know tomorrow if Kinkel will stay or resign.' Mr Kinkel's address to the conference was aimed at restoring the party's confidence after it failed to be re-elected to nine state parliaments over the past two years, and even failed to enter the European Parliament. It scraped back into the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, in October only through tactical voting by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats. The FDP won only 47 seats, two fewer than the Greens, and 32 fewer than the 1990 elections. Delegates said they believed that Mr Kinkel, if he remains as leader, could be forced to resign next June during another FDP congress if the party cannot reverse the string of election defeats. Mr Kinkel has been FDP leader since 1992. 'We need time, patience and persistence to modernise our party,' Mr Kinkel told the 662 delegatee who repeatedly interrupted his hour-long speech with boos and whistles. Applause at the end was lukewarm. In a bid to stem the flow of support away from the FDP, especially to the environmental movement, Mr Kinkel singled out the Greens for compromising their principles in order to re-enter the Bundestag in October. 'The Greens are the lap dogs of power,' said Mr Kinkel. But several delegates muttered that the FDP were the lap dogs to the ruling Christian Democrats. The first test following October's federal elections will take place in the state of Hesse, which goes to the polls next February, followed by three other elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Bremen. Hesse is currently governed by the Greens and opposition Social Democrats.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bern, January 24 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee,  said here today that it is possible for China and Switzerland to  further develop their economic and technological cooperation.    Qiao made these remarks when he met with Flavio Cotti,  Federal Councillor and head of the Federal Department of Foreign  Affairs. Both sides exchanged their views on international and  regional issues.    Qiao said Switzerland was one of the first Western countries  to establish diplomatic ties with China. Since then, the two  countries have enjoyed a good relationship.    He also said Switzerland pursues a policy of neutrality and  non- interference in other countries' internal affairs which he  said is similar to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence  that China pursues. Bilateral ties have been based on a solid  foundation, he added.    Qiao noted that since China implemented reform and opening  to  the outside world, the relations between the two countries have  been further boosted.    "China has a big potential market, so it's possible for the  two countries to further their economic and technological  cooperation, which is beneficial to both sides," he said.    Extending his warm welcome to Qiao who is paying his first  visit to Switzerland as the NPC chairman, Cotti said Qiao's  visit will help promote the frequent and close dialogues between  the two countries.    Cotti said he was satisfied with the growth of bilateral  ties, adding that in the economic field, the two countries have  made achievements which attracted wide attention.    "Switzerland is deeply impressed by China's rapid economic  growth and the progress of its economic construction," he said.    Cotti also noted that many Swiss enterprises have invested  in  China and said that they will surely play a useful role in  China's economic construction.    He expressed his hope for increasing the number of such  enterprises while continuing to maintain the quality of  cooperative projects.    He said Switzerland and China also share a very good  relationship in culture. China's time-honored culture, in  particular, has been a great influence on Switzerland.    Besides, cooperation between the two countries in the United  Nations, the UNESCO and other international organizations has  been strengthening all the time, he said.    Qiao arrived here from Zurich on Sunday [23 January]  afternoon.</p>

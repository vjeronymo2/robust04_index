			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Saudi bank prepares to account for itself - NCB is publishing its first audited accounts for four years NATIONAL Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom's biggest bank in asset terms, is preparing to publish its first set of audited accounts for four years. Mr Michael Callen, former head of global finance at Citibank, was brought in four months ago by the Mahfouz family, majority shareholders of the bank, as senior adviser to the chairman Sheikh Mohammed bin Mahfouz. He is hopeful that the accounts will appear shortly. Mr Callen has been given the job of restructuring management, improving operations and restoring the bank's image. This has been tarnished by a fraud indictment in the US against Sheikh Kahlid bin Mahfouz, NCB's former chief operating officer, and a Dollars 10bn law suit launched by Touche Ross, liquidators of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Just how damaging the legal actions have been is difficult to judge. 'I don't know what our reputation is,' said Mr Callen. 'People don't tell you when you're the ugliest girl in the playground.' In spite of its problems, managers say that the audited accounts will confirm NCB's place as one of the biggest private commercial banks in the world. More importantly, they will show NCB's capital:asset ratio to be within the tier one 4 per cent minimum set by the Basle guidelines. The last three sets of accounts to be published - none has appeared since 1989 - were all qualified by the auditors. Since that time the bank's financial position has been something of a mystery, and its position was not eased by the suspension of its credit rating in June 1992 by the Cyprus-based Capital Intelligence, the only rating agency to list the bank. Mr Omar Bajamal, deputy general manager, said the bank was determined that its next set of accounts would not be qualified. References to court actions are expected to appear in footnotes. The closure of the bank's London office last year, enforced by the Bank of England, and the corresponding closure of the New York branch - together the branches had assets totalling some Dollars 2.5bn - had a significant impact on NCB's balance sheet. Mr Bajamal maintained that the bank had improved its Saudi depositor base. Total bank assets, said Mr Bajamal, had dipped below Dollars 20bn in 1992 but had recovered some lost ground in the first quarter of 1993. The bank considered a public placing at one stage but decided that the risk was too great at a time when many Saudi companies were competing for capital. It is still an option, however, when the present difficulties have been overcome. Mr Bajamal said that none of the bank's 230 branches would close as a result of the internal restructuring currently being carried out, but NCB would be shedding 1,500 jobs from its 7,400 workforce in the next few months. He dismissed as wild speculation US reports that the bank's problem loans, many of them said to have been with the Saudi royal family, ran into tens of billions of dollars. However, other sources suggest that NCB's problem loans amounted to about Dollars 2.5bn, almost a third of the bank's loan portfolio and several times its net worth. Many loans are understood to have been restructured. The relationship with the Saudi royal family is one of the most sensitive issues within the bank. The very presence of the royal business means that it is difficult to appraise the bank's position using normal financial criteria. 'The idea that they (the royal family) would just stuff the NCB at the end of the day, given that they own the country and are responsible to the depositors as a result, defies logic,' said Mr Callen. NCB's accounts will be emerging after a difficult period for many of Saudi Arabia's banks, following an end to the construction boom which did much to boost lending margins in the late 1980s. NCB is the only Saudi bank in private hands. There has been some talk of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, the central bank, taking a stake in NCB but this has been successfully resisted by the owners. In the meantime Sheikh Kahlid bin Mahfouz and the bank are separately fighting various legal actions in the US and the UK. He has been indicted on fraud charges by Mr Robert Morgenthau, New York district attorney. NCB, itself in dispute with the US Federal Reserve, has set aside Dollars 22m for possible penalties, although it is arguing against accusations that it violated filing regulations.</p>

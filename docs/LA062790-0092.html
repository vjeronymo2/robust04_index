			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURVIVORS OF CANCER HAVE A 'LAUGH FOR LIFE'  </P> <P> "Well, I had cancer, but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone," said comedian  Richard Belzer, opening Sunday night's "Laugh for Life" benefit at the Westwood  Playhouse. The show, an evening of music and comedy, was the third annual  benefit for Cancervive, a national nonprofit organization for cancer survivors.  </P> <P> Several hundred guests paid as much as $250 each to attend a pre-show reception  and after-show party, where they sampled Thai food provided by Tommy Tang's. It  was an informal event in the best sense of the term -- well organized but  casual -- and the comedians kept things light.  </P> <P> Belzer, a survivor of testicular cancer, emceed the evening, which included  performances by comedians Bob Saget, Bobby Slayton, Kevin Pollak and Charles  Fleischer. Said Saget before the show: "You get a real Peter Pan feeling  performing at things like this, if that's not stupid."  </P> <P> According to Cancervive founder Susan Nessin, the group differs from other  cancer support groups in that members must be recovered and out of treatment  for at least six months. Cancervive focuses on life after treatment, with an  emphasis on reentering the mainstream of society. The group also tries to  educate the public about the difficulties of trying to overcome cancer.  </P> <P> The show opened with a performance by the Tom Scott Orchestra (the  jazz-oriented house band on the late Pat Sajak Show), with a musical number by  the singer Shondra, who performed a new song, "We Can Survive."  </P> <P> Sherry Lansing also presented Cancervive's first Victory Award to actress Lee  Remick in recognition of her recovery from cancer. Accepting the award, Remick  said:  </P> <P> "I'm deeply honored to receive this, and I'm thrilled that I qualify."  </P> <P> It was a sentiment with which many in the audience could identify.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In developing the revised proposal, the agencies sought to address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these concerns in two principal ways. First, despite substantial simplification in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data collection compared to the December proposal, the revised proposal would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide institutions additional time before the data collection would begin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the revised proposal, collection of new data elements would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required until July 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, compared to the December proposal, the revised proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminates the grace period and instead would provide institutions with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional time before assessments under the proposed standards would become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised proposal would also provide institutions with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment options prior to full implementation of the rule. Even though  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments under the proposed standards would not be mandatory until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 1, 1996, small institutions would have the opportunity to be examined, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their option, under the small bank assessment method anytime after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 1, 1995. Anytime on or after July 1, 1995, an institution could also elect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to submit for approval a strategic plan to achieve satisfactory or better CRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance. Examinations under approved strategic plans could begin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed transition schedule, the current regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be repealed in its entirety on July 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies recognize that the revised proposal, like the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December proposal, represents a significant change in existing practices and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that cautious administration is therefore required. Consultation by financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions with the agencies on compliance with the new standards and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures will be encouraged, as will liberal use of agency appeals processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The supervisory agencies will engage in an internal review of the effectiveness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the new regulations. The agencies contemplate reconsideration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations to improve their effectiveness within the next several years. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies intend for the proposed regulations to require demonstrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance but to impose as little unnecessary compliance burden as possible,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the agencies will review the regulations to determine whether they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advancing these goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to this rulemaking, the agencies will work together to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improve examiner training and to increase interagency coordination regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of standards, performance of examinations, assignment of ratings,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and use of enforcement tools. The agencies will work together to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examinations as short in duration as possible, to minimize unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance burden, and to ensure consistency and reliability in the rating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Benefit and Burden of Administrative Compliance Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the reporting, disclosure, and other administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance requirements in the proposal, the agencies invite comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) any administrative burdens that these requirements in the revised proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would place on depository institutions, including small depository institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and customers of depository institutions; and (2) the benefits of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in the revised proposal for depository institutions, their customers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and their communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OCC: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The collections of information contained in this notice of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (44 U.S.C. 3502(h)).

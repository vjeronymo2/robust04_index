			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / GP drugs bill faces curbs The government is considering extending a scheme that gives family doctors an incentive to prescribe economically as part of a drive to curb spiralling drug costs. Ministers are keen to expand the scope of present arrangements that permit GPs whose prescribing costs fall below a target level to keep a proportion of their savings. Some such arrangements have been running on a pilot basis since last April. The need for action was underlined by last month's announcement that allocations for GP prescribing for 1994-95 have been increased by 12.3 per cent. This means GPs in England are expected to spend a total of Pounds 3.2bn on drugs. Ministers are anxious to slow this rate of increase to prevent drugs from taking an ever-increasing share of the National Health Service's overall budget. Family doctors prescribe about 80 per cent of drugs by value. Later this month the government is expected to announce an increase in the standard prescription charge of well above the rate of inflation. If the higher allocation for GP prescribing is an indication of the likely rise in prescription charges - as has been hinted - an increase from Pounds 4.25 to about Pounds 4.75 would be implied. In the Commons yesterday Mr John Smith, Labour leader, challenged Mr John Major at prime minister's question time over the likelihood of prescription increases. 'Any increase would come on top of massive tax increases already being imposed by this government,' he said. Mr Major said the government would make an announcement on any rise when it was in a position to do so. The government expects the expansion of GP fundholding to act as a further brake on escalating drug costs. It says spending on prescribing by fundholders has been rising at about 3 per cent less than that by non-fundholders.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "Taiwan Offers Nuclear Waste to </F> Moscow" -- last two paragraphs are IZVESTIYA conclusion]    [Text] Tokyo -- A fresh piece of news has arrived from the  prosperous island of Taiwan -- Taiwan-Russian business contacts  are threatening to take a major new direction provided the sides  agree a price. It is a question of Taiwan's nuclear waste being  stored on Russian territory for cash.    Chan Chunchen [name as transliterated], director of the  Taiwan Power state corporation, on his return to Taipei after a  12-day tour of Russia, Sweden, and Norway, told reporters that  fruitful talks had begun regarding the handling of Taiwan's  nuclear waste in Russia. According to Chan, his partners in the  talks were representatives of a certain research center who have  10 nuclear dumps on Russian territory under their jurisdiction.  It is at these "capacities" that it is intended to process and  store Taiwan's highly toxic waste products, provided of course  that the financial side of the project is agreed to their mutual  satisfaction.    The problem of nuclear waste from its nuclear power stations  is an extremely pressing one for Taiwan. It is not only a  question of vigorous protests from the population (during a  recent antinuclear demonstration in Taipei, for instance, over  10,000 people came out onto the streets) but of the fact that  the dumps are almost full to bursting. The largest "waste  facility" on the island of orchids, for instance, will have to  be closed next year, but Taiwan's three nuclear stations  punctually produce 130 tonnes of radioactive waste every year  and that has to be put somewhere.    Taipei has examined several options for resolving this  problem or, to be more precise, several locations to which toxic  waste could be sent -- in particular there was a plan to  organize storage in "greater" China and in Sweden. However  Beijing did not respond to Formosa's alluring proposition. The  Swedes resolutely refused. Then along came Russia -- Taipei  calculated that Russia's boundless expanses and its need for  money should incline it to enter into constructive dialogue on  this tricky topic. As you can see, their assumptions paid off  -- that is the conclusion at least that can be drawn from the  brief report made by the head of the Taiwan power corporation on  his work in Russia.    IZVESTIYA was told by the Ministry for Atomic Energy that  there have been no talks regarding the possibility of burying  Taiwan's nuclear waste in Russia. According to a senior  ministry official, the Taiwanese tried to sound out the Russian  side on this score during a recent scientific and practical  conference on nuclear technologies in St. Petersburg. They were  told that in accordance with current law and the president's  edict Russia does not accept foreign states' nuclear waste for  storage. Storage of spent fuel from nuclear power stations  built abroad with Russian assistance is carried out on the basis  of special agreements.    However the ministry official voiced the opinion that a deal  with Taiwan could bring colossal profits and would enable Russia  to resolve many of its economic problems.</p>

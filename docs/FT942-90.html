			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: John Foster cuts losses to Pounds 1.7m On turnover down from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 15.9m John Foster &amp; Son, the mohair topmaking, worsted and spinning concern, reduced pre-tax losses to Pounds 1.74m for the year to February 28, against Pounds 5.1m. Directors stated that difficult trading conditions had continued into the current year with turnover levels down, but in line with budget. Accordingly, and as last year, it is not proposed to pay a dividend. Losses per share were reduced to 15.5p, compared with 45.7p. Net borrowings fell by Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 1.6m. The directors said the implementation of plans laid 18 months ago for the company's recovery were almost complete, 'and although we can at last see light at the end of the tunnel we still expect another difficult year'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Eva </F> Martinkova; place and date not given: "I Am Worried about  Parkinson's Sprouts of Bureaucracy"]    [Text] [Martinkova] The fact that the government has been  in power for half of its term raises the question whether you  have the feeling that certain points in the government policy  statement, adopted precisely two years ago, remain to be  fulfilled.    [Klaus] I really do not have that feeling. The government  policy statement is a document created by 19 government members  -- some of whom did not know each other before -- in the span of  several hours. In the span of four years of the existence of  this government, a number of ideas are being finalized,  completed, pushed from the left to the right, up and down. On  one hand, I take the document seriously, but on the other, I do  not believe that each of its conjunctions or prepositions has a  constant weight. It is possible to say in this global  evaluation that the government program is being fulfilled.    [Martinkova] The proposal of the Civic Democratic Party  [ODS] Executive Council regarding districts as the fundamental  pillars of self-administration has surprised not only the  coalition partners, but also many ODS representatives. What  made the Executive Council present a proposal about which they  could anticipate that it would run up against such resistance?    [Klaus] First, I would like to say that this is not a new  opinion. We voted on the proposal in the Executive Council six  months ago and it won slightly less than 50 percent of  supporters at that time. Now it has acquired a substantial  support of three-quarters of the Executive Council's members.    The ODS is a party that constantly bases its policy on the  citizen. It fears all institutions that are established over  the citizen, be it on small or large territory. That is why we  try to minimize such institutions. If there is something we are  unable to do at present, then it is to suppress completely all  Parkinson's sprouts of bureaucracy that are running wild in our  country. That is one of the things that I am tremendously  worried about.    We are building on the fact that the citizen is the basic  and  absolute value. All the institutions over him are derived from  the citizen, and must be established according to their purpose,  efficiency, and also according to whether people want them or  not. In that sense, it seems to us that the minimal  intervention in the existing regional arrangement would be to  utilize the districts that have existed for 35 years and have,  due to that fact, certain authenticity, no matter how much  people disliked them when they were established in 1960. Adding  an elected component to the district bodies could be the least  painful and most inexpensive way in the process of forming the  regions. That is simply it.    [Martinkova] Serious considerations have appeared recently  as to whether the death penalty should be reinstated. Did you  give it a thought?    [Klaus] I personally do not believe it is necessary. Being  a politician, however, it is my task to think about matters that  I have no desire to ponder. I try to react sensitively to  public opinion. I have noticed in that respect a noticeable  shift in public opinion. I am a bit surprised by it;  nevertheless, I respect it. In the first post-November years,  the standard humanitarian reaction to the death penalty question  was the answer that the death penalty was an extreme solution,  which man should not adopt. People pointed to errors and  mistakes, etc. That opinion met with unequivocal response and  applause in the first post-November years. I have noticed that  it has changed over the past six months. My unchanging  arguments do not have unequivocal support any longer. There are  an increasing number of voices in favor of the death penalty. I  pay great attention to the situation, but it is the only  reaction to this problem I can describe at the moment.</p>

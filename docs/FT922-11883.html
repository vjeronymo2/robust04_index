			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Inco hit by sharp fall in earnings from mining operations INCO, the western world's biggest nickel producer, barely broke even in the first quarter, as sagging metal prices, lower shipments and higher unit costs slashed earnings from its mining operations. Net earnings slid to USDollars 2.2m, or one cent a share, from Dollars 53.6m, or 50 cents last year. Sales were down almost one fifth to Dollars 680m, while operating earnings in the primary metal division slumped to Dollars 42m from Dollars 136m. The alloys and engineered products division suffered a small operating loss. Shipments of almost all metals were lower in the first quarter. Nickel deliveries slipped to 121m lb from 136m lb. Copper shipments declined to 59m lb from 75m lb, and platinum-group metals fell to 69,000oz from 86,000oz. Nonetheless, finished nickel inventories rose to 60m lb on March 31, from 45m lb three months earlier. The average nickel price received by the company fell to Dollars 3.59 per lb from Dollars 3.94 a year earlier. Refined copper prices slipped to 99 cents from Dollars 1.10 per lb. Inco does not disclose unit production costs, but these are understood to be around Dollars 2.50 per lb of nickel and Dollars 1.60 per lb of copper. The company said that the rise in first-quarter costs was due to higher wages and benefits, and increased depreciation and amortisation charges. These factors were partly offset by improved ore grades. Total debt was slightly cut to Dollars 1.26bn on March 31. TransCanada PipeLines, which operates the cross-Canada gas pipeline system, earned CDollars 79.5m (USDollars 67m) or 39 cents a share in the first quarter, up 36 per cent from a year earlier, mainly because of a jump in export volume. Revenues were CDollars 926m, up 9 per cent. Investors Group, Canada's biggest mutual fund distributor, and controlled by Power Financial Corp, is raising CDollars 122.5m of new equity for acquisition opportunities, writes Robert Gibbens. PFC is not participating in the issue and its holding will drop from 74 to 66 per cent. Investors earned CDollars 50.7m on revenues of CDollars 2.8bn last year, and in the first quarter of 1992 revenues were up 45 per cent from a year earlier.</p>

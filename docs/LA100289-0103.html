			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EGYPT PRESIDENT SEES 'OPPORTUNITY' IN ISRAEL CONFLICT  </P> <P> Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said today after a meeting with President Bush  that a "golden opportunity" exists for an eventual settlement of the conflict  between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs.  </P> <P> After meeting with Bush for almost an hour, Mubarak told reporters that the  essential next step in the peace process is to persuade the Israelis and the  Palestinians to enter into a dialogue without conditions.  </P> <P> "It would be a grave mistake to miss the golden opportunity existing today,"  Mubarak said. "A continuation of the status quo is hazardous to both parties."  </P> <P> Hours before the Bush-Mubarak meeting, an Egyptian newspaper reported that the  United States had proposed formation of a joint Egyptian-Israeli committee to  pave the way for elections in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III confirmed the general idea, saying the  panel, with U.S. participation, would give Israel a chance to approve or  disapprove individual Palestinians who would take part in talks with Israel.  </P></p>

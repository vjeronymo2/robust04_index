			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Bao Hongjun (7637 3163 0193): "Hainan </F> Province Fights Corruption by Looking Into Both Its Root Cause  and Symptoms -- Not Only Handling Cases in Earnest, But Also  Deepening Structural Reform"]    [Text] If the situation is judged from appearances alone,  the newly founded Hainan Province gives the impression of  prosperity coexisting with corruption. Before it was designated  a province, Hainan Island was economically backward, but  nowadays it has become one of the most vigorously growing  regions in China. In the last few years, the provincial party  committee and government has persisted in market orientation,  continuously deepened reform, opened wider to the outside world,  and thus achieved inspiring results in economic construction.  In the last six years since the founding of Hainan Province,  economic indexes such as gross domestic product and national  income increased at an average rate of more than 11 percent a  year. Nevertheless, as the economy developed at high speed,  corruption was haunting Hainan like a specter. Hainan is a  small province, with a population of only 68 million people.  Last year it had three cases carried in nationally circulated  notices. In the cases, Jiang Wei, former planning department  director and Li Shanyou, former deputy secretary general of the  provincial government, took 100,000 yuan or so and tens of  thousands of yuan in bribes respectively and, had thus their  cases became well-known as two typical corruption cases.    To punish corruption, the Hainan provincial party committee  has worked hard to investigate and handle cases and done a lot  of work in the last few years. The province has handled 4,421  cases of violating party discipline and investigated and dealt  with 3,810 party members who violated discipline, of whom 15  were cadres at the departmental level and above, 126 cadres at  the office level, and 694 cadres at the section level.  Corruption has disappeared to some extent but in some aspects,  it is continuing to spread.    As the drive of reform and opening up spurs speedy economic  growth, corruption is growing and spreading continuously. In  early 1993 it was this grim situation that the new Hainan party  provincial committee and government confronted.    The facts are thought-provoking. Do reform and opening up  bring about corruption? Apart from investigating and handling  cases, are there any other more effective options in combating  and punishing corruption?    Through a thorough investigation and study, leaders of the  party provincial committee reached a consensus: Some corrupt  phenomena did appear in the course of reform. However, the  fundamental cause for corruption lies with the lack of reform  rather than reform itself. At a time when the old structure was  being replaced by the new one, the old structure and the  imperfect new structure were counteracting with each other.  This gave corrupt elements an opportunity to make  power-for-money deals. Hence, corruption was concentrated in  the offices and departments which "dispose of resources under  the planned economic structure" or retained the power of social  micro-operations. The current spread of corruption is a phased  phenomenon of structural transition and economic transformation  and a kind of "transitional corruption." For example, as prices  are being gradually unified, profiteers living on sales of  approval documents and indexes and on "the dual-price gap" will  gradually disappear from the scene. It is thus clear that to  punish corruption, it is imperative to investigate and handle  cases in real earnest. However, this alone is not enough. Only  when reform is deepened and the legal system is perfected can  the soil on which corruption breeds be scratched out. If the  structure is not reformed and the legal system is not perfected,  corruption will grow everywhere like half-cut Chinese chives.    With this understanding, the party provincial committee and  government intensified reform and determinedly expanded the  tentacles of anticorruption work to the old structure last year.    First of all, let us take the land market as an example.  Land is a nonrenewable element of production. In a market  economy, land resources should be disposed of by the market. To  put it another way, land prices should be determined by the  market and land should not be allocated by the government using  administrative fiats. The land market in Haikou, Sanya, and  Qiongshan was once thrown into confusion because land resources  were disposed of by the government using administrative fiats  and the resulting gap between government- offered prices and  market prices ranged from several to 20 times. Some people would  reap exorbitant profits overnight by selling the "pieces of  land" they gained through connections or position, while the  government's finances and taxes suffered losses. The masses  were quite dissatisfied with such a practice. Last spring,  Hainan resolutely adopted a tender system and auction method in  land transfers, thus thoroughly reforming the land transfer  method. In Qiongshan City, the auction price of a piece of land  was 9 million yuan or so. Once the new move was taken, illegal  land trading at a profit was immediately checked. Haikou even  got instant results in this regard. Last year the city  collected 1 billion yuan in land fees, much more than the total  land transfer fees collected in the previous five years.    While the cries for tenders in the land market have not yet  subsided, more than 100 contenders have begun entering into a  fierce rivalry in the "enterprise leader open recruitment  activities" sponsored by the Organization Department of the  Hainan CPC Provincial Committee. Four outstanding contenders  successfully distinguished themselves and assumed the post of  general manager in the four companies under the commercial and  trade departments. The ways of using enterprise leaders under  the old structure, such as "Bo Le seeing horses for himself [bo  le xiang ma 0130 2867 4161 7456]" and "naming a person for a  particular job behind closed doors" were apt to lead to  unhealthy practices such as appointing people by favoritism,  currying favor from upper circles, and sending gifts and  practicing bribery. As such, Hainan was determined to "employ  people with doors open to society" and boldly explored  organization and personnel systems under the market economic  structure.    Haikou's reform of the tax collection and management system  is another successful typical case of punishing corruption. The  traditional tax collection and management system relied on tax  staff, who collected taxes personally from the taxpayers. Every  tax collector was assigned to collect taxes from 400 taxpayers.  Malpractices such as abuse of power for private gain,  embezzlement, and bribery could be found among some tax  collectors. However, such malpractice could not be curbed  despite repeated prohibitions. In the drive to "rectify  unhealthy practices" alone, discipline inspection departments in  Haikou investigated and handled 17 such cases with 18 persons  involved. In June last year, the city deepened reform,  abolished the tax collector system, and introduced unified  computerized management, under which the taxpayers were required  to pay taxes directly to relevant organs or through social  agency organizations. Malpractices in tax collection and  management have disappeared since then. For example, a certain  enterprise was fined for tax evasion. When its manager  personally went to the tax bureau director to ask for an  exception, he saw the fine bill on the manager's computer  screen, and he had to withdraw his request blushingly.    Some reforms have been introduced such as changing the  "enterprise legal person examination and approval system" into a  "direct registration system"; removing the 10 barriers to  enterprise examination and approval; changing the system of  managing university student job assignments on graduation into a  system under which "the supplier and the end-user meet" and  choose each other and students on graduation seek jobs  themselves in society; introducing an all- worker contract  system by breaking the demarcation line on identity, encouraging  fair competition, and carry out a job assessment system; and  introducing a tender system in distribution of export quotas.  The reforms have a common special characteristic -- operational  procedures being simplified, standardized, open, and fair, and  arbitrariness in doing things being reduced. Like double-edged  swords, the reforms thrust directly into the old structure and  systems. Thus, the intensity of reform was increased and  corruption was checked once and for all.    "Veteran discipline inspectors," such as Cao Bailin, deputy  secretary of the Hainan Provincial CPC Committee and Xie  Mingren, secretary of the Haikou City CPC Committee, maintained:  In regard to discipline inspection and supervision work, there  is also the question of micro and macromanagement and of  effecting a permanent cure and bringing about a temporary  solution. Investigating and handling specific cases belongs to  micromanagement and bringing about a temporary solution.  Deepening reform and establishing a new structure will help  solve recurring problems. This belongs to macromanagement and  effecting a permanent cure. In discipline inspection work, if  we are satisfied with limited investigation of cases and do not  adapt ourselves to the objective requirements of the new  situation for anticorruption, we will find it difficult to keep  the initiative in anticorruption work.    Effecting a permanent cure and bringing about a temporary  solution are the two aspects of anticorruption. Neither should  be overemphasized at the expense of the other. While striving  to effect a permanent cure, Hainan did not relax in the  slightest degree in its efforts to investigate and handle cases  of corruption. From January to December last year, the  discipline inspection and supervision departments of the  province placed 733 cases of party and government cadres  violating discipline for investigation and prosecution, punished  650 party members who had violated discipline, of whom seven  were cadres at the departmental level and above, 34 were at the  office level, and 166 were at the section level. Some typical  cases were exposed to the general public and the several  unhealthy practices against which the masses of people had  strong complaints were effectively rectified. Deepened reform  and anticorruption have injected new vitality into economic  construction. The province's economy is developing healthily  and at high speed. The main economic indexes, such as gross  national product and local financial revenues showed relatively  big increases over the previous year.    While many people have some confused ideas about the  launching of anticorruption struggle at a time when the old  structure is being replaced by a new one, the Hainan Provincial  CPC Committee conscientiously implemented the party Central  Committee's strategic plan of "grasping reform and opening up in  the one hand and grasping anticorruption in the other," and has  proven with its fruitful explorations and practice that the  dialectical unity of "anticorruption and deepening reform" has  opened a path of effecting both permanent and temporary  solutions to fighting and eliminating corruption in the new  period.</p>

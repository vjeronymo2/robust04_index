			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEP-BY-STEP ACCOUNT OF A NORTH RIM DESCENT  </P> <P> "Let's get this over with so I can say I've ridden a mule."  </P> <P> The New Jersey dude was bicycling through canyon country, doing the Bryce,  Zion, Grand Canyon circuit. At the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, he finally  was persuaded to get on a mule. (He was already at home in a bicycle saddle.)  </P> <P> The trip was a one-day venture on the uncrowded North Kaibab Trail, a five-mile  descent to Roaring Springs. The route, first tracked by Paiute Indians,  explores a precipitous side canyon that follows Bright Angel Creek. It offers  an up-close perspective of the canyon that is totally unlike the wide plateaus  and panoramas of the South Rim.  </P> <P> At 7:30 a.m. each morning, up to 20 mule riders assemble at Grand Canyon Lodge  to be bused to the trailhead. A guide advises that this mule trip is less  strenuous than the two-day expedition from South Rim to Phantom Ranch and back,  but it will give a thrill or two.  </P> <P> And that's a fact. The trail drops 4,000 feet, wriggling through shaded woods  and along cliff-hanger ledges where a rider can touch the fossils in the faces  of ancient rock.  </P> <P> Given their lead, the sure-footed Jacks and Jennies measure their way around  "oh-my-gawd-turns," paying no attention to the depths below or towering  pinnacles above. Riders tend to clutch their saddle horns while clinging to  windblown hats and dust-covered cameras.  </P> <P> If a mule tries to nibble something green, wrangler Mike Whitney warns: "When  you lag behind, mules spook, and that leaves a mess of broken bones and brains  on the trail."  </P> <P> One curious rider is told her animal is named Short Cut because his parachute  saddle helps him jump to the South Rim. Tall tales are as traditional as mule  riding, harking back to a time when visitors wouldn't have considered walking  for the fun of it.  </P> <P> If there were no canyon here, it would still be exhilarating backcountry.  Scents of pine and wafts of chill air suggest mountains, not desert. The Kaibab  Plateau is 1,000 feet higher than the South Rim's Coconino Plateau, and  noticeably cooler. Because of heavy winter snowfall, the park's limited  facilities here are open only from mid-May to mid-October. Even in summer it  seems remote.  </P> <P> The lodge sits tight on the rimrock, 5,700 feet above the unseen canyon floor.  It serves as a reservations and Park Service information center, and its dining  room overlooks the gorge, so sunsets are reserved in advance. The patio offers  front-row seats as well.  </P> <P> This, the only lodge on the North Rim, actually provides no lodging at all, but  anchors a complex of rustic, comfortable cabins among the pines. Frills consist  of a gift shop, cafeteria and snack bar. There is a grocery store at the nearby  campground.  </P> <P> The first lodge was opened in 1928 by the Utah Parks Co., a subsidiary of Union  Pacific Railroad, which was boosting tourism in national parks. It burned four  years later, but the present structure is faithful to the original's "Early  National Park" architecture, including rough-hewn limestone walls and  high-timbered ceilings.  </P> <P> Not far from the lodge is Bright Angel Point, with its famous view of the Deva,  Brahma and Zoroaster temples. These are the buttes engraved on a two-cent U.S.  postage stamp issued in 1934.  </P> <P> Reaching the bottom of the canyon, riders dismount for a picnic lunch. At this  point, some tenderfoots may have begun to feel tender in other spots. A dip in  the swirling waters of Roaring Springs cascade is numbing. This sparkling clear  spring is the water source for the entire park.  </P> <P> By the return climb, the mules seem like guardian angels, even as they nose out  over the brink for frequent rest stops -- "so they can see where their front  feet are." Their routine is one-speed all the way, a steady trudge toward an  alfalfa supper back at the stable.  </P> <P> The cyclist looked forward to something more soothing. He had to get back on  his two-wheeler the next day.  </P></p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Business and the Law: Defending London as a financial centre  -Robert Peston and Robert Rice examine the proposed creation of a panel on questions of legal uncertainty The Financial Law Panel sounds the sort of solution only a lawyer would dream up. The Bank of England's Legal Risk Review Committee has recommended the panel be established to help solve problems of legal uncertainty which are said to be threatening London's standing as an international financial centre. 'It is easy for lawyers to persuade themselves they need another legal body,' concedes Lord Alexander, the former Bar chairman and chairman of NatWest who headed the committee. But he adds: 'I was persuaded of the need for it because of the demand from market practitioners.' The Bank of England, which will co-sponsor the panel with the Corporation of London, confirms there has been an encouraging response from the City. More than 100 financial firms have indicated they would be prepared to stump up Pounds 4,000 each towards the panel's estimated annual costs of Pounds 500,000. The panel will have a board of between 10 and 12 individuals, chaired by Lord Donaldson, the former Master of the Rolls, and a full-time chief executive. The other board members will consist mainly of market practitioners and a few lawyers. There will also be a secretariat of four lawyers seconded from City law firms. It is expected to start work in the spring. Lord Alexander drew an analogy between Lord Donaldson's appointment and the appointment of Lord Shawcross to head the Takeover Panel when it was set up in 1968. The Takeover Panel became a success largely because of the zeal and commitment of Lord Shawcross, he said. 'I would expect Lord Donaldson to play a similar role.' The panel's initial role will be to provide an authoritative view on legal uncertainties. Its judgments will not have the force of law, but Lord Alexander is hopeful that they will carry weight if the issues in question ever come to court. If, for example, a financial firm follows the panel's advice but is subsequently sued, Lord Alexander hopes that the courts will at least decide that the firm was acting in good faith and therefore should not be accused of fraud. 'Lenny (Lord Justice) Hoffmann (a member of the review committee) said he thought the courts would give weight to the panel's decisions,' Lord Alexander said. Lord Alexander hopes eventually the panel will evolve into a body more like the Takeover Panel, giving informal advice to firms about the legality of financial transactions they may be contemplating. NatWest's merchant banking subsidiary, County NatWest, might, for example, have acted differently when advising Blue Arrow on its 1987 rights issue if it had had access to impartial external advice. Certainly Lord Donaldson envisages the panel developing along those lines. 'I've insisted on professional indemnity cover against the risk of being sued for negligent advice,' he says. But he is less convinced that the courts will accept the panel's advice as City custom and practice. The courts will require greater certainty than that, he says, before they will accept something as binding practice. The incident which led to the creation of the review committee was the 1990 House of Lords swaps ruling. The Law Lords ruled that swaps contracts between banks and local authorities were invalid because local authorities had never been empowered by government to carry out swaps. The contracts were ultra vires - outside their powers. Banks, many of them foreign, were outraged when they were unable to enforce the contracts. Lord Alexander believes that had the Financial Law Panel been in existence five years ago, the extent of the ensuing financial turmoil could have been reduced. The panel might have been able to point out the loophole in the law in time for the government to act. Even if it had refused to give local authorities the power to enter into swaps contracts, the panel might have advised banks to include clauses in their swaps contracts setting out the basis for making restitution in the event of the deals being ruled unenforceable. 'I think those restitution clauses might have stood up,' he says. The swaps case illustrates the two main reasons why a panel may be useful. First, the City has been adept in financial innovation, creating products which the existing legal framework may not recognise; and second, the law itself can be ambiguous. But is there really a wider legal uncertainty problem? Mr Philip Wood, senior banking partner at City solicitors Allen &amp; Overy, believes the City has 'vastly over-emphasised the problem'. He points out that in the area of judge-made law, for example, apart from the swaps case the review committee was only able to identify one other recent decision which was causing problems. That was the 1986 charge card services case where the High Court ruled it was conceptually impossible for a creditor to charge back his debt to the debtor. In spite of considerable debate over whether the decision was correct, it still stands, putting many apparently simple financing arrangements, such as the pledge of a certificate of deposit in favour of the issuing bank, at risk. Nevertheless the panel is 'not just window dressing', he says. The City is suffering from 'terrific regulation fatigue' and the panel has an important role to play in explaining to parliament how the markets work and why the law needs changing. It can also act as a 'loudhailer' for the City, adding weight to its proposals, he adds. Lord Donaldson was also unsure initially whether a legal uncertainty problem really existed. But a closer examination of the committee's report revealed more than 100 issues raised by City practitioners. One of the panel's first tasks, he says, will be to sort the problems into categories: those which can safely be ignored either because they are 'silly' or 'too narrow in ambit'; those requiring changes in legislation; those where test cases may have to be developed, such as the charge card case; and, those where a definitive answer may be impossible but the panel may be able to advise practitioners that if they follow one route it will involve less risk than another. He is now convinced of the need for the panel and that it can work. 'I'm sure there is a job to be done. I'm just not sure quite what it is yet, or how to do it.'</p>

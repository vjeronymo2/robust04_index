			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (8): This may be turning point on Europe - Andrew Hill considers whether the country can pull its weight in the Community Mr Domenico Comino, Italy's new minister for Europe, is disarmingly frank about his country's image in the European Union: 'Traditionally, we're considered the truffatori (fraudsters) of the Community,' he says. As self-criticism goes, that may be a little harsh, and Mr Comino himself, not surprisingly, hopes to disprove it. However, Italy's reputation in Brussels is certainly lower than might be expected for a country which signed the Treaty of Rome and has since toed an obsequiously pro-European line in its public policy statements. Part of the problem has been the gap between theory and practice. As well as accusations of (mainly agricultural) fraud, Mr Comino identifies 'a certain disengagement' on the part of previous ministers, and a perception that Italy signed up to laws without then enforcing them, as the main reasons for Italy's disproportionately weak political clout in the Union. Whatever the reasons, while axes have proliferated between other member states, Italy has found itself all but frozen out by its biggest partners on important policy developments. In spite of being a neighbour of the former Yugoslavia, for example, Italy has taken a back seat in international diplomatic initiatives in the region, while its own proposals have mostly been politely ignored. But paradoxically, the election of an Italian government more sceptical than any of its predecessors about the European ideal may mark a turning point in Italy's relationship with the EU. The groundwork was laid by the preceding 'technocratic' government, headed by Mr Giuliano Amato and then by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. They impressed Brussels with their manifest desire to clean up Italy's public finances and observe the economic criteria of the Maastricht treaty. Being forced to withdraw from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 was a blow, but three months later Mr Amato managed to persuade his EU partners to authorise an Ecu8bn balance of payments loan to Italy, partly to offset the loss of reserves used to support the lira during the exchange rate crisis. The conditions attached to this loan helped maintain the strong external discipline which Italy needs if it is to reduce its budget deficit and continue to follow the path laid out at Maastricht. In this more positive climate, Mr Ciampi's government also managed to persuade the European Commission and EU industry ministers to approve a final package of subsidies for Ilva, the loss-making state-owned steelmaker, on condition that capacity was cut and factories privatised. For the first time for many years it seemed as though Brussels was actually taking Italian promises seriously. In the early months of the Berlusconi government, ministers have been trying to talk the same language, although they accept that almost no amount of budget rigour will give Italy a chance of being in the first wave of countries moving towards European monetary union. 'We're not even in the picture,' admits Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the budget minister. However, the goal of monetary union remains vital for the country, and the backbone of European legislation an important pillar of the reconstruction of Italy after years of disregarded laws framed by discredited lawmakers. 'The political objective of Europe is fundamental for us,' Mr Pagliarini adds. 'If we look back, the best laws put in place in Italy are the laws based on EU legislation.' For federalist members of the new government, such as Mr Comino and Mr Pagliarini - both from the Northern League - fidelity to the European ideal also means giving more power to the regions. But they will have to bear in mind, that overall policy is being laid out by more sceptical hands. At the helm of foreign policy is Mr Antonio Martino, son of Gaetano Martino, the Christian Democrat foreign minister who signed the articles of the Treaty of Rome. Martino fils is a member of the Bruges Group, inspired by Lady Thatcher's resistance to European integration, although he sees himself as a critic of previous Italian policy rather than an out-and-out opponent of Europe. This sceptical line could well put Italy at one end of a European policy axis, with Britain at the other. Evidence from the recent summit of EU leaders in Corfu, however, suggests that this will take time to evolve. Mr Silvio Berlusconi flew out ready to press for postponement of a decision on the successor to Mr Jacques Delors as Commission president. He breakfasted with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, after which both men expressed their satisfaction at being on the same free market wavelength. But in the debate on the Delors succession, Mr Berlusconi switched to backing Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister and Britain's bete noir - helping to isolate the UK. As an elected rather than a technocratic government, members of the Berlusconi team may find it slightly more difficult than their predecessors to take a strictly purist line on certain issues. For example, there were fears ahead of the Corfu summit that the meeting might be disrupted by a row over the way Italy exceeds its EU milk production quota. In the event, the issue was overshadowed by the Delors succession, but Italy's insistence on a solution favourable to its farmers was reminiscent of the surprise decision by Mr Giulio Andreotti, then prime minister, to force milk quotas onto the agenda of the EU's 1992 Lisbon summit. The new government might find its free market line similarly tested when it comes to lifting all quotas on imports from beyond the EU - particularly cars from Japan or leather goods from China. As Mr Berlusconi will be quick to find out, self-interest often rules at the Brussels negotiating table. The most immediate challenge for the new government, however, is to combat the gut opposition of many of its European partners to the presence of the far right in the coalition. Mr Delors himself has already talked of the 'extreme vigilance' needed when dealing with such a government, and certain EU ministers have publicly snubbed their 'post-fascist' National Alliance counterparts at meetings. One Italian minister points out: 'You put the label on the bottle of wine when the wine-making is over, not when it's only just started.' But it is already clear that Italy will only be able to pull its weight in European and international policy circles if it can dispel the residual fears of its partners quickly.</p>

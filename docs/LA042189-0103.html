			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: KAWAHARA WILL LEAVE PACIFIC STOCK EXCHANGE  </P> <P> Herbert G. Kawahara, who as president of the Pacific Stock Exchange was  responsible for running its day-to-day operations, will resign that post  effective June 1.  </P> <P> Kawahara, 60, a 32-year veteran of the securities business who assumed the  presidency in January, 1988, said his resignation will allow him "to devote  more time to a broader range of personal and professional interests."  </P> <P> Exchange Chief Executive Maurice Mann said Kawahara as president had "made an  important contribution to the exchange's marketing program and was instrumental  in initiating the development of a long-range marketing plan."  </P> <P> Since the resignation came as a surprise, no successor has been named, exchange  spokesman Dale Carlson said. The Pacific Stock Exchange has equity trading  floors in Los Angeles and San Francisco and options trading in San Francisco.  BILL SING  </P></p>

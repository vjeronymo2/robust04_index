			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / German jobs market faces shake-up Mr Ulrich Cartellieri, Deutsche Bank director, last week poked an uncomfortable finger into the guts of Germany's most testing economic problem: structural unemployment. The number of jobless in the country would increase from current record levels by a further 500,000 to 4.5m this year, he said. Few believe it will stop there. Even economists who base their forecasts on comparisons with previous recessions say an end to the cuts is unlikely at least until mid-1995. But past experience is not a reliable yardstick. The cyclical nosedive that started in late 1992 exposed chronic structural deficiencies - most noticeably over-manning and over-payment - which had made much of west German industry uncompetitive. The employers' response has generated widespread concern that unemployment is leading to a structural labour market crisis rather than a temporary, cyclical hangover. As Mr Cartellieri put it, the dole queues were the visible reflection of Germany's deficiencies as a place to do business. By mid-1992, when international competitors had absorbed the worst of recession and were under way with restructuring, west Germany GmbH was still hiring and paying extravagant wage awards in response to the short-lived reunification boom in demand for everything from cars to biscuits. Unit labour costs rose 16 per cent relative to those in other industrial countries between 1989 and 1993, and numbers employed increased 1.4m. The correction, as the unemployment figures and this year's sub-inflation pay awards show, has been sharp and painful. Available evidence suggests the pain is far from over. Even assuming one or two more years of pay restraint, as happened after the recession in the early 1980s, indications from west German industrial companies suggest none is contemplating hiring in the foreseeable future. Even though most are forecasting improved earnings, all are continuing to wield the axe which has already chopped 14 per cent of the region's manufacturing jobs. The wholesale transfer of jobs abroad is also gathering pace. Low-tech, labour-intensive work is being shifted into eastern Europe. Investors, having decided that proximity to markets is worth more than the vaunted 'Made in Germany' label, are building plants abroad for everything from chemicals to BMW cars. Mr Cartellieri's finger pointed to two areas where there is real room for job creation: the under-developed service sector and part-time work. In passing, it delivered a sharp prod to the country's legislators whose rule books, he said, 'hamper the establishment of the simplest entrepreneurial initiative'. As he indicated, antiquated restrictions on shopping hours made little sense in a country where 300,000 unemployed women were looking for part-time work. The greatest and most fruitful prospects appear to lie in services. Official figures show between 35 per cent and 40 per cent of west Germans still earn their keep in industry, compared with around 30 per cent elsewhere in the European Union. Unofficial figures from the Institut der Deutschen Wirtschaft (IWD) in Cologne give the lie to a persistent German belief that anything which is not screwed together or has no wheels is of inferior value. It estimates that employees in all service industries, except retailing, now generate more added-value per head than manufacturing's overall DM90,000 (Pounds 35,000) a year. Banking and insurance workers top the rankings with DM160,000. More encouragingly, it discovered that two-thirds of all the new jobs created in the 1980s boom emerged in the official catch-all category of 'other services', ranging from healthcare to film developing. On the same theme, the Basle-based Prognos forecasting institute said the next 15 years could see the creation of some 2.5m new service jobs. That might eventually cover the losses mounting up as traditional industries restructure. If government responds to the proddings for deregulation from Mr Cartellieri and others, Germany GmbH might even come out of the crisis with its enviable post-war employment record intact.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter by Josip Manolic, chairman of the Croatian </F> Assembly's Chamber of Counties: "Answer to President Tudjman"]    [Excerpts] Mr. President, I am very grateful to you that  you had your speech, delivered in front of the HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Community] Group in the Croatian parliament on 7  April 1994, published in VJESNIK on 10 April 1994, because by  doing so you have given me the opportunity to provide an answer  in the same place and in the same scope to your interpretation  of the political events and to your accusations against me. I  knew that you were coming to the Croatian parliament that day  since the "president's flag" was raised above the Croatian flag.  I asked myself what legal stipulation was the basis for raising  it. I learned later that it was a party meeting, which reminded  me of the famous statement: "L'etat c'est moi!" I would also  like to thank you for releasing me of the obligation to be  silent about delicate issues. [passage omitted]    There is no continuity in the policy toward  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Washington agreement is the most  radical breach with the policy you made. This policy has never  pursued the idea of a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina as the  elementary and only strategic interest of Croatia. You have  signed the Washington agreement under the pressure of several  factors: 1) In the present Bosnia- Herzegovina, the Croatian  nationality has been driven to the verge of ruin; the Croats  were ready to defend themselves by all means from the disastrous  results of your suicidal policy, which they expressed by  founding the Croatian National Council of Bosnia- Herzegovina,  2) Opposition parties, including all right-wing to extreme  left-wing parties, exerted pressure on you; the criticism within  the HDZ became especially loud (I was the loudest), 3) A total  military defeat, which has increasingly involved Croatian troops  in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina resulted in international  isolation and threats of sanctions, which consequently led to  the collapse of the economy and caused social discontent in all  layers of the society; apart from the that, the costs of the war  were so high that all funds are now empty and taxes were raised  to an unendurable level, 4) The will and influence of  international powers.    Obsessed by the myth of enlarging Croatia, you have refused  to accept the reality in Bosnia-Herzegovina, trying to divide it  between Serbia and Croatia from the very beginning. You fell  for Milosevic's trick in Karadjordjevo and insisted on it until  harsh reality forced you to sign the Washington agreement.  Innumerable of your statements prove that you have never even  thought about a coexistence of Croats and Muslims, nor do you  want this today, which can be seen from your insistence on  Izetbegovic being guilty for the conflict between the Croats and  Muslims. Do not forget that I was present at the meeting in  which Izetbegovic proposed the appointment of Mate Boban as  defense minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina. You refused it. You  are praising the contribution to the Cutilliero plan. The  attempt to implement this plan according to your policy --the  ethnic cleansing of Muslims from Livno and Mostar to Travnik,  Jablanica and Konjic -- caused strong fighting between Croats  and Muslims. You should look again at the Smiljko Sagolj  reports and Vice Vukojevic's uniform (and his boast that so many  Muslims were killed in Prozor that they did not fit into two  trucks etc).  <H5>  Plunging Into Catastrophe </H5>   It is true that "we had to have a political and governmental  organization in Herceg-Bosna, the function of which is to  protect the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the strategic  interests of the Croatian state...," but the question is of who  Croatian interests are threatened by. The only possible answer  is that this is Serbian aggression, so that the question has to  be asked into what and why this "political and governmental  organization" developed and in whose interests that was.  Instead of waging a war against the Serbian aggressor, a war  was waged against the allies; instead of protecting the Croatian  people, their displacement was caused. Instead of having  villages and towns, we now have a country that is burnt down,  approximately 10,000 dead people etc.. Whose policy was it and  why did he make it? Was the warning voice of the Catholic  Church not enough to prevent Croatian politics from plunging  into the catastrophe in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is well-known  with what arrogance your politics responded to it.    The fact that, by the signature on the Washington agreement,  the collapse of the Croatian political strategy -- the war  option -- was admitted does not free the creators of this policy  from explaining to the Croatian people how the tragedy came  about.    The thesis about the continuity of "the Croatian policy  toward Bosnia-Herzegovina," with signing of the Washington  agreement, allegedly led to "the overlapping of Croatian  interests with the interests of the Western world.... We were  not forced, ther was no turnabout, it is the continuation of our  policy. The world has accepted us because of the consistence of  our policy," is a transparent mask to cover up the actors of a  policy that is tragic for the Croatian people, both in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Republic of Croatia, to avoid  political responsibility and having to provide answers to the  following questions asked by the Croatian people:    Why did it come to a war against the Muslims? What are the  aims of that war?    Who made the political decision to start the war against the  Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina? No legitimate body has made such  a decision; it was not even made within the HDZ. Who has  committed war crimes that have made the differences between the  Croats and Chetnik criminals disappear?    Who gave the order for the ethnic cleansing of Muslims and  who founded concentration camps? The answer that others also  had them is a bad pretext. The Croats do not deserve to be  blemished and stigmatized as aggressors.    Who is responsible for the exodus of Croats from Bosnia-  Herzegovina?    Who financed the war against Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina?  Who has the records about it and who will be "presented with  the bill for it"?    Who is responsible for thousands of dead and wounded, for  destroyed villages and towns, for the destruction of the  cultural heritage in Mostar and other places etc...?    Who organized smuggling gangs in Herzeg-Bosna and who are  they supported by in Croatian institutions (tobacco, oil, drugs,  weapons, and so forth)?  <H5>  The End of the War Option </H5>   Since you, Mr. President, covered up the responsibility for  all these things with your thesis about the "continuity" of the  Croatian policy, you have practically taken over the obligation  to give answers to the above-mentioned questions. You have to  give answers to these questions primarily to the Croatian  parliament as the highest sovereign body in Croatia.    Let us go back to the question of the present policy toward  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is, as you claim, "in continuity." Is  it expected perhaps that the people who created and carried out  the tragic strategic concept -- the war option -- that collapsed  and was buried by the Washington agreements, will carry out  these agreements sincerely and honestly and be able to cooperate  with Croatian political bodies in Bosnia-Herzegovina? How could  Muslims trust them and vice versa? During the first 10 days  after the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina  was adopted, may of the actions of these people were directed  toward a blockade of the Washington agreements. The state of  Herzeg-Bosna and its "presidential council" did not cease to  exist, for example. The practical enforcement of the agreement  (detention camps, communications, the legitimacy of Croatian  representatives in the parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  treatment of "non-HDZ" political representatives etc.) is also  being inhibited. Will the people of this political profile  carry out the Washington agreements? The United States  certainly does not expect these people to protect them from  Islamic fundamentalism and an Islamic state in Europe! What  will happen with Albania, Kosovo, and Turkey in such a case.  (Not to mention Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece, which "cannot  await" to enter the sphere of Moscow Orthodox interests!) The  Washington agreements could have been implemented without any  victims and destruction two years ago. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Democracy and Risk </H5>   Antifascism is the basis of our present state, as you keep  on  pointing out, at least for international consumption. This is a  historical issue and we thought that the unity of the Croatian  people in the war against the Serbian aggression made this issue  uninteresting. Unfortunately, you were the main actor in  "Vice's" movie [not further specified] where you tried to  disqualify Mr. Cesar, the leader of the Croatian Christian  Democratic Party, because he was an obstacle to the membership  of the HDZ in the European Christian Democratic Union. This is,  at the same time, the answer to you regarding who is  blackmailing whom and for what reason. We should enable the  younger Croatian generations to live a life without burdens from  the past; let us not allow history to make a new division among  Croats.    It is better not to mention the paternalistic overtone you  use when speaking about me -- "he should go to the  Constitutional Court and... be calmed there." Tudjman has  forgotten that an elected member of the parliament, the chairman  of the Chamber of Counties and a member of the HDZ Presidency  and its Main Committee cannot be "calmed" by a decree and the  wish of an individual, because he is politically and morally  responsible to the people and the party membership. I am not  one of those advisers, civil servants, or business adventurers  who enjoy greater or smaller privileges (such as apartments,  company stocks, business premises, membership in administrative  bodies etc.). They can be "calmed" by such privileges, or if  they are consistent, they fall into anonymity. There cannot be  any "calming" in political issues of the highest priority for  the Croatian future. There is no such individual, whatever his  position might be, even if he is the president of the Republic  and the ruling party leader, who could decide on his own about  such important matters.    In his political career, Josip Manolic has not violated a  single postulate of democracy, including the democratic  Constitution and laws. He has behaved and acted consistently  with all democratic postulates. When his attempt to start a  democratic discussion in the HDZ about elementary questions  regarding the future of the Croatian state and its people was  undermined, he -- quite legitimately -- addressed the Croatian  people and informed them of controversial matters within the  HDZ, which are of vital importance to all Croatian citizens. An  honest and responsible politician has to speak in front of the  people. I do not think that you have expected me -- since you  know me well -- to be silent about the dangers of the policy you  have been pursuing just to save my position as chairman of the  Chamber of Counties and a member of parliament. I am not made  for such "honest outcomes." Democracy is a risk for  politicians. Their opinions and attitudes may be contested and  criticized. If the president looks for conspiracy or motifs for  his "overturn" behind an expression of a normal democratic  attitude (mine), this is from fear of responsibility for the  things done.    Mr. President, you have been counterfeiting history. I  quote: "....during 1992 when we were formally recognized, but  did not have real friends."    Croatian politics had the most and the best -- the "real" --  friends during its struggle for independence and international  recognition. You should just think of statements issued during  the struggle for Croatia's international recognition. Think of  the support of Mr. Kohl, the German chancellor, Mr. Genscher,  his deputy, the support of the Vatican and the pope, Mr.  Cossiga, the Italian president, his visit to Croatia. You  should not forget very the intense communication and help  offered by friendly Austria. All of them told you, asked you,  and advised you not to go into a conflict with Muslims. You  have lost real friends because of your agreement on a division  of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Milosevic, you fell for Milosevic's  trick.    I quote again: "Representatives of one international power  told me during a visit: `Mr. President, you probably know that  you have to make a new defense and safety system. We are ready  to help you, but without Josip Manolic, please.'"    Mr. President, I would like to point to two things in  connection with this citation. The first is a blunder that a  head of state must not make unless he wants to humiliate himself  and the state he represents. Can you imagine a head of state  who is visited by a foreign intelligence service spy and asked  to dismiss the head of the intelligence service of his sovereign  country. By this act of yours, you have made "a banana  republic" of Croatia and a figurehead of yourself, which is a  subversion of national interests.    The second thing I want to remind your of is my reaction to  the respective information you gave me. This was a game with  foreign intelligence interests -- their services were looking  for "their space," in other words for persons surrounding you.  The whole thing was not about me, but about you. On that  occasion I told you that I had accepted a decision about a  political function, but that I could not accept the  Constitutional Court because that function would exclude me from  political life. Your explanation was: "The problem is Croatia,  our increasing isolation from the international scene,  especially in the field of economy, but also in other fields,"  and so forth. It was my pleasure to ask you ironically on the  first anniversary of our conversation about my dismissal whether  the Croatian position and your personal position had improved.  No comment. Sanctions had already been prepared at that time,  they had only not been made public. I wanted to remind you that  it was not I who was a problem, but you. Your politics became  an impediment to the recognition of Croatia in the world.  <H5>  "In Croatia's Interest" </H5>   All this was "in Croatia's interest." Your set phrase is:  "The problem is Croatia." You have covered up all personnel  changes in the government and in the ruling party by this  phrase. Even the latest act, by which the autonomy of  parliament was violated -- the president of the parliament was  sent on vacation during a session of the parliament, and you  manipulated the election of the State Courts Council through the  VONS (Defense and National Safety Council); your adviser Pasalic  said in a VONS session: "We need courts that will carry out  official politics." Should the autonomy of the Supreme Court,  of the Chamber of Attorneys-at-Law, of the parliament and  government be abolished because of such courts?! Where is this  leading? To dictatorship and tyranny.    It is necessary to quote one more of your allegations:  "...because the proposal for his dismissal obviously came  because of his contacts with services from the previous regime  and his communist views. It is well-known that he has most  contacts with people from `old services.'"    All my functions in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and in  the parliament were public. I can say with full responsibility  that I have always acted according to the Constitution and laws.  I always helped people who needed help. I am not registered as  a spy with any of the foreign intelligence services. This  enabled me to be sovereign in my job. As far as my contacts  with people from "the old service" are concerned, it is correct  that I have contacts with them, but we have achieved the  following things with this old service:    1. We took power after the multiparty election in 1990  without any single victim owing to visible or invisible people.    2. During the Serbian aggression these people took some of  the burden, made a selection among their own people, and  supported us in all our actions -- the first military attacks  were blocked by people from the old police, who were admittedly  at that time already strengthened by young policemen. Many of  them were real heroes in the war, as for example, Mr. Starcevic,  head of the service for the Protection of the Constitutional  Order, and Zeljko Tomljenovic, deputy minister of internal  affairs. The prize they got, like several hundred others, was  retirement. This was revenge against people who did everything  for us, but were punished only because they came from the old  system. Revenge was not a part of the HDZ program in the  election campaign. Whose policy is this? The pretext for it is  the same phrase: "It is in Croatia's interest."    Mr. President, I do not want to discuss "communist views"  and  our past with you. We went through this rough school of  communism together. I fought against these attitudes for  decades and finally disassociated myself in 1970. I was  excluded from the League of Communists in 1971 together with  other Croatian dissidents.    My work in the HDZ has been characterized by democratic  relations. Your treatment of people, however, was full of  despotism and intolerance toward other opinions. These  characteristics of yours make you close to communistic behavior.  This is reflected in the party in general, which you have  brought to collapse.  <H5>  According to the Statutes </H5>   Mr. President, I agree with your assessment that we do not  agree on anything any longer, especially not in politics.    As far as my dismissal from the function of the president of  the Chamber of Counties is concerned, I have performed it  strictly according to the Statutes and the democratic procedure  (and it is known that the procedure is the essence of  democracy), which has to be respected in first of all in  parliament. This lecture on democracy is necessary if we want  to cherish the democratic culture in future.    I did not work on the above mentioned statutes, they are a  work of your law adviser, who compiled it according to your  instructions -- so the Statutes serve the ruling party. It has  now come into the hands of opposition, and that is where the  problem developed. According to the statutes, only the president  of the Chamber of Counties can convene a session, and this at a  moment he politically assesses as opportune.    In closing, I would like to mention that Croatia is not  destabilized by politicians who ask questions about vital  matters regarding the foreign and domestic safety of Croatia; it  is destabilized by your policy, which has led us to the brink of  disaster.    After all, why are you, Mr. President, upset by these  issues,  why are you using words such as "destabilization," "dead and  wounded," "honorable outcome," "East and West," "Muslim  element," "rift," "constitutional crisis," "overturn of the  president" if -- as you say -- "he will take less than 1 percent  of HDZ members with him"? Why so many words about this 1  percent, why put the whole party and media machinery into  motion, why so much fuss about it?</p>

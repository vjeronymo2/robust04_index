			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R.V.: "Jansa Waging War Again"] </F>   [Text] Janez Jansa and Slovenia's Defense Ministry have  announced that they will lodge a complaint or have already  lodged a complaint with the competent court against several  journalists because of a series of articles in MLADINA of  Ljubljana. The accused include Svetlana Vasovic-Mekina, VREME  correspondent and MLADINA staff member.    The reference is to articles which on the basis of secret  documents obtained and testimony of participants exposed  violation of the embargo, arms smuggling, misappropriation of  military housing and unlawful treatment of former officers of  the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army]. The journalists are charged  with "insulting accusations" (under Article 108 of the Slovene  Punitive Code, which is a variation of the once notorious  Article 133).    Meanwhile, things are not really going as well as they might  for the Defense Ministry in similar current trials. Following a  series of articles in MLADINA about the illegality of certain  moves made by the Defense Ministry (entry and confiscation of  the apartment of Gen. Hocevar, former commander of the Slovene  TO [Territorial Defense]), Gen. Hocevar's son filed suit before  the competent court in Ljubljana and just the other day obtained  a final verdict ordering the Defense Ministry to return the  apartment and restore it to its original condition and pay the  court costs. Thus it will probably be hard for the Defense  Ministry to prove before those same courts that the newspaper  articles about these and similar unlawful acts are "insulting  accusations."    The announcement of the Defense Ministry that it will file a  complaint against the journalists Igor Mekina and Svetlana  Vasovic-Mekina for an interview with Sefket Suljevic, more  precisely, for words uttered by Suljevic in that published  interview, is an interesting precedent, one that was unknown  even in the "leaden times of the communist SFRY [Socialist  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]."    Jansa is reproaching his former colleagues because of the  shocking account of Sefket Suljevic, former captain in the KOS  [counterintelligence service] in the Ribnica garrison, who in  the course of a 10-day battle in June 1991, following an appeal  from the Slovene Presidency, went over to the side of the TO,  but immediately thereafter, according to his own account, was  arrested, imprisoned, beaten, deceived and deported from the  newborn state. The stateless Suljevic also revealed in the  MLADINA interview that gentlemen "from some new military  intelligence service" visited him at his temporary address in  Vienna, where he has been given asylum, and promised that they  would take care of his citizenship and passport for him without  problems (so that he could return to Slovenia, where his wife  and two children live), but all of this was on condition that he  use his former acquaintances in KOS, who are now working in the  present military intelligence service, "to obtain documents that  in any way compromise Milan Kucan or Janez Drnovsek."    Suljevic's story in the last issue of MLADINA, which  indicates that he saved Ribnica near Kocevje from heavy  shelling, and also the very act of surrender in order to go over  to the TO, have also been confirmed by certain quite  distinguished people from Ribnica. Now it is up to "Slovenia as  a law-governed state." Both in the case of Suljevic and also in  the case of the accused journalists.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Agustin Mantilla Campos, former interior minister  under the APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]  administration, will reportedly be the new APRA secretary  general. This was supposedly the order given by ex-President  Alan Garcia Perez to a group of APRA leaders who held a meeting  in Cartagena, Colombia, last week.    This information was disclosed by a source in that political  organization. The leaders who attended the meeting include  Jorge del Castillo and former Ministers Gustavo Seberbein and  Mercedes Cabanillas, among others. The source said that Garcia  is trying to maintain the party's leadership in the hands of  people in his complete confidence, and that he will channel the  necessary resources to them to keep the organization "afloat"  until "his return." Garcia reportedly told them: "I want you to  keep the party, like a boat, afloat. When I return I will make  it into a frigate."    The idea that Mantilla would take over the party leadership  has been talked about for the last few months, especially after  he was released. But this possibility ended when the Supreme  Court annulled that decision and sentenced him to eight years in  prison, which he is now serving.    But according to legislation, Mantilla could be released on  parole after serving 24 months of his sentence. He may  therefore be released in May, which is the month when the APRA  will elect its new leadership.    It has also been reported that the Garcia supporters are  paving the way within the party for getting Mantilla elected.  The source noted that this is reflected in the elections of the  district executive committees and the systematic separation of  leaders or militants who disagree with this strategy.    The source added: "Everything is handled in such a way as to  obey the guidelines given by Alan Garcia. Therefore, there is  no doubt that Mantilla, unless something unexpected happens,  will be the APRA leader in the next few months."</p>

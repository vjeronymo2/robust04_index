			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FREE SPEECH DEFENSE BARRED FROM TRIALS;  </P> <P> JUDGE DENIES ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVISTS CONSTITUTIONAL PLEA ON TRESPASS CHARGES  </P> <P> Anti-abortion activists facing trespassing charges from protests at three San  Diego-area clinics will not be allowed to use the constitutional guarantee of  free speech as a defense, a judge ruled Wednesday.  </P> <P> San Diego Municipal Judge John M. Thompson's order will affect 112 of the 134  activists charged with trespass at clinic protests April 8, April 29 and June  10, said James M. Bishop, head deputy city attorney.  </P> <P> The ruling marked the second time Thompson has denied the protesters use of a  specific defense. On Aug. 4, he ruled that all of the activists facing  misdemeanor charges would not able to put on a "necessity" defense, under which  they would try to show that the protests were necessary to stop abortions.  </P> <P> In addition to trespassing, charges against the protesters include failure to  disperse, resisting arrest and eight conspiracy charges, Bishop said. Some  demonstrators face multiple charges.  </P> <P> There are no felony charges, Bishop said.  </P> <P> Thompson on Wednesday ordered that lawyers will not be allowed to question  prospective jurors about their views on the First Amendment's free speech  guarantees and that the protesters cannot say they were at the clinics to  exercise free speech.  </P> <P> Under the ruling, however, defense lawyers may still be able to claim at the  end of the case, in their closing arguments to the jury, that the protesters  were exercising free speech rights. It depends on how the judge hearing the  case views the evidence, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> But prosecutors said they will be surprised if jurors in any of the series of  cases -- which begin next week -- hear that argument.  </P> <P> "Our position is, no, this is not speech activity, this is conduct," Bishop  said. The law is "pretty clear," he said, "that if your conduct is interfering  with a business, physically interfering with a business, then it's not going to  be protected. And (the protesters) were shutting the clinics down, completely."  </P> <P> Gregory Anthony, the lead defense attorney for the anti-abortion activists, did  not return a phone call Wednesday to his Los Angeles office.  </P> <P> Thompson ordered Tuesday that the trial of the eight alleged conspirators go  first, beginning next Wednesday. Trial of the others will follow consecutively,  in groups of five, he said.  </P></p>

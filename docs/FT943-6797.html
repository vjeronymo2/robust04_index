			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / People: To see the wood for the trees The search is on for a new chairman of the Forestry Commission to take over from Sir Raymond Johnstone (right), the former chieftain of the Murray Johnstone fund management group, who has been looking after Britain's forests for the past five years. Sir Raymond, 64, leaves at the end of the month when his term of office expires. It is understood that he would have been prepared to continue as part-time chairman for a few more years. However, the government appears to have decided that it wants a fresh face to push through the recently published recommendations of its task force's review of the Forestry Commission's estate. When Sir Raymond was first appointed there was a suspicion that he had been brought in to oversee the privatisation of the commission, given that much of his earlier career had been spent bringing companies to the stock market. That was not part of Sir Raymond's original brief, though, and he quickly decided for himself that privatisation was not appropriate. His view was endorsed last month when the government shelved plans to privatise the commission. Sir Raymond has been involved in giving the commission a 'greener image' and a more efficient organisation structure. He oversaw the 1992 reorganisation which separated the commission's departmental, regulatory and management functions and has been heavily involved in improving the commission's relationships with the public and environmental groups. However, there has been a worry in some quarters of the forestry industry that Sir Raymond might have gone 'too green'. There has been a sharp drop in planting of conifers following the dropping of controversial tax incentives in 1988, and there has been a concern that the commission was spending too much time worrying about the environment and not enough about planting more fir trees.</p>

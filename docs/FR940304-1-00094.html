			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Design options <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Both the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whirlpool Corporation provided detailed comments on each design option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 5&hyph;22 and Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation, No. 31 at 6&hyph;13). A number of the comments concerned design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to improve heat exchanger (evaporator and condenser) performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These improvements can be put into two categories; designs for increasing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heat transfer surface area and designs for increasing the heat transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coefficients. The heat transfer surface area can be increased by any of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following methods: increasing the depth of the coil by adding vertical tube  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rows, increasing the frontal area of the coil by increasing the height or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> width, increasing the fin density, or adding a subcooler to the condenser  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coil. The heat transfer coefficients can be increased by using an enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fin design or grooved (rifled) refrigerant tubing. In addition, spraying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condensate on the condenser can improve its heat transfer coefficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation commented that cabinet size could prevent or at least limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of tube rows that could be added to increase the depth of the coil. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, they state that the effect of each successive tube row on system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance diminishes rapidly. The Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers also commented that compressor reliability could be affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The addition of tube rows increases the internal volume of the system and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, the amount of refrigerant required. Compressor reliability could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be reduced as the compressor would be required to pump excess refrigerant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whirlpool Corporation added that a thicker coil will increase air flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restriction and may actually reduce efficiency. (Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 9&hyph;10; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the analysis of additional tube rows, the Department used engineering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design data provided by room air conditioner manufacturers. The data were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on measurements taken from actual room air conditioner units and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included information that specified the number of tube rows that could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added to the existing coils. The computer simulation model which was used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the analysis of room air conditioners considered the effect that additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tube rows have on the entire room air conditioner refrigerant system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation commented that increasing the frontal area of the coil would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require an increase in chassis size. Coils in existing room air conditioners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are already so large that any useful increase would require an increase in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size of the cabinet. The incremental cost for such a change would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant. Whirlpool Corporation added that an increase in frontal area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces the water removal capability of the evaporator coil. (Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 10; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees with the Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers's and Whirlpool Corporation's comments regarding the increase of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the coil's frontal area. Any useful increase in performance would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the cabinet size be increased as well. Manufacturers' cost data for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design were taken into consideration in the analysis. The computer simulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model takes into account the impact of increasing the coil frontal area on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporator's water removal capability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation stated that there is a limit to how high the fin density can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased before air flow becomes too restricted and adversely affects the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency of the unit. In addition, an increased fin density might prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proper drainage of condensate from the evaporator. The Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers added that dirt build-up is a serious concern in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coil design. With a higher fin density, greater dirt build-up is likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in coil degradation and lower unit efficiency. (Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 11; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department solicited comments from room air conditioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers regarding the maximum allowable fin densities for a variety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporator and condenser coils. Their comments served as a guideline to how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high fin densities could be increased for prospective coils. The computer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simulation model is capable of calculating the effect that increased fin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> density has on the air-side pressure drop across the coil and, in turn, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power consumption of the fan motor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the  Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland  [CPRF] issued a statement today denouncing the undisguised moves  in South Korea against the denuclearisation of the Korean  peninsula.    The "unification minister" of South Korea, groundlessly  vilifying the North at the "foreign affairs and unification  committee of the National Assembly" on May 23, said "the  North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation has become  invalid in actuality" and declared they would "discuss the  declaration from a new angle."    The statement brands these remarks as an open perfidy to the  North and an unpardonable anti-national criminal act making the  prospect of North-South relations gloomier, saying: "They meant  a unilateral nullification of 'joint declaration on the  denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula' adopted and  effectuated between the North and the South."    "The arbitrary abrogation of the joint declaration vital to  the nation is a very grave challenge which endangers peace in  the country and the security of the nation," the statement says,  and continues:    "With no excuse can the South Korean authorities justify  their act of abrogating the declaration, taking issue with the  North. There is no justification for the South Korean  authorities to slander the North over the fictitious 'nuclear  issue', while keeping mum about the U.S. nuclear weapons  deployed in South Korea for scores of years.    "It is not fortuitous that they unilaterally scrapped the  hard- won joint declaration on denuclearisation.    "Truth to tell, the South Korean authorities have never been  interested in the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.    "At a time when the uprightness of the North's nuclear  policy  is being proved more clearly, the South Korean authorities  openly nullified the declaration, blaming the North. Their main  purpose in this is to remove the declaration which stands in the  way of their nuclear arms development and openly promote it.    "But the South Korean authorities must ponder over what  serious impact their perfidious nullification of the declaration  will have on the North-South relations in the future and what  catastrophic influence their reckless attempt to promote nuclear  arms development, free from the declaration, will have on the  situation in the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia.    "They will have to bear full responsibility for all the  consequences arising from their nullification of the  declaration."</p>

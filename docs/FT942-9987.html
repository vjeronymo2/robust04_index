			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UN ponders Rwanda troop airlift The United Nations is considering airlifting at least 5,500 troops to Rwanda to ensure the safety of refugees and delivery of humanitarian aid, AP reports from New York. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, announced that Nigeria, Ghana and Tanzania had offered the troops and the 15-nation Security Council was beginning discussions of the plan yesterday evening. A final decision was not expected until the end of the week. Despite the urgency, the troops will be able to do nothing to stop the genocidal slaughter, which has already claimed up to 200,000 lives in a month. In making recommendations to the Security Council, Mr Boutros Ghali said the UN troops would not be authorised to use force to stop the fighting, only to defend themselves. And under the best-case plan, the troops would not begin arriving for a month. The UN withdrew all but a token force of about 400 peacekeepers from Rwanda last month when fighting made their mission  - monitoring a cease-fire and peace accord  - futile. Mr Boutros Ghali said the new troops would put the airport at Kigali, Rwanda's capital and lifeline for supplies, under exclusive UN control and would concentrate on protecting civilians and guarding relief workers and their deliveries. The UN chief warned the 15 Security Council members that time was of the essence. 'The longer the delay in the deployment of the force,' he wrote, 'the greater the prospect of the mission not achieving its purpose.' The US is already on record as supporting such a force and might help airlift the troops, although none of its own. But it will likely take a while for the operation to get off the ground. The United Nations is already running 17 other peacekeeping operations around the world, with more than 70,000 troops. It has unending problems persuading member states to contribute properly trained and equipped troops. One element that might help in the case of Rwanda is the support of Mr Nelson Mandela, South Africa's new president. Mr Mandela declared his support on Tuesday for a UN peacekeeping operation for Rwanda.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Do Fence Me In: Ever feel that it's hard to meet new people in Orange County?  </P> <P> A survey of new-home shoppers by Yorba Linda-based Great Western Real Estate  might provide a clue or two as to why.  </P> <P> The survey, Great Western's 14th annual California Consumer Preference Survey,  found that Southern California home buyers tend to be much more security  conscious than Northern Californians. Asked it they would prefer wide-open  spaces or a walled community with guarded or electronically controlled gates,  54% of Southern California shoppers opted for the walls and gates, compared to  only 39% of the northerners.  </P> <P> No wonder we see so many walled communities in Orange County.  </P></p>

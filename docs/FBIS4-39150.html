			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Plotnikov from Simferopol; from the </F> "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] A session of the Crimean Supreme Soviet today heard  an appeal from the Russian State Duma which is ready, with  account having been taken of the whole sensitivity of the  situation that has come about, to do everything in its power to  help in the search for constructive compromise on the basis of  the Russian-Ukrainian Treaty of 1990.    For two centuries, reads the appeal, Crimea has served --  and will serve, we are convinced of that -- the interests of the  fraternal peoples of Ukraine and Russia. Also today President  Yuriy Meshkov said that the CSCE representative put forward a  similar initiative.    As for the talks, they are currently continuing within the  framework of the joint working commission. The main issue on  which the consensus is being sought is an international human  rights bill. The Crimean Supreme Soviet session is also under  way at the same time. The issue of forming the government has  been under consideration since the morning. Despite the fact  that Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov met the deputies'  requests more than half way, the deputies have, nonetheless,  adopted not his, but their own draft resolution as the basis.  The debate was prolonged into the evening hours.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BLACK JUROR TAKEN OFF PANEL AFTER OTHERS ALLEGE BIAS  </P> <P> In an odd twist to an already complicated legal case, a Torrance Superior Court  judge on Thursday called jurors into his chambers for interviews and then  dismissed one of them after others on the panel said the man was biased.  </P> <P> Judge John P. Shook replaced Harold Winston, 32, with an alternate juror after  hearing two hours of testimony by Winston's fellow jurors. Nine of them said  the Hawthorne man appeared to begin deliberations with a bias against police  officers.  </P> <P> After he was removed, Winston vehemently denied the accusation, saying that  jurors who disagreed with his point of view during deliberations misinterpreted  statements he made and then conspired to have him removed from the panel.  </P> <P> Winston, the only black juror on the panel, said he believes racism played a  role in his removal. The defendant in the murder case, Charles Mack Moore, also  is black and the case involves a raid and shooting by white Gardena police  officers.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Gilbert Garcetti, who prosecuted the case with Deputy Dist.  Atty. Irene Wakabayashi, argued during the trial that Moore was guilty of  second-degree murder for allegedly pointing a shotgun toward Officer David  Mathieson, provoking Mathieson to fire a shot that killed another man, Dexter  Herbert.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Jeffrey Gray argued that Herbert, not Moore, was holding the  gun.  </P> <P> Winston said he was urging jurors to find Moore not guilty because of what he  said was "incredibly flimsy evidence . . . that gave me a lot of reasonable  doubt about whether Mack Moore had that gun."  </P> <P> He said jurors initially voted 10 to 2 in favor of conviction, but that the  vote was split 6 to 6 by the time deliberations were halted Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> He described his reaction to being removed as "a quiet rage."  </P> <P> "I feel railroaded . . . insulted and degraded," he said. "I understand now how  people feel when they go to court seeking justice and they get slapped in the  face."  </P> <P> Prof. Michael Wolfson, a specialist in litigation and trial practice at Loyola  Law School, called the proceedings leading to Winston's removal "rather  unique."  </P> <P> "That's all pretty bizarre, because jury deliberations are this very sacred  kind of secret rite protected in all sorts of ways," Wolfson said. "Jurors are  supposed to do what they do without any basic scrutiny. A jury shouldn't be  able to impeach itself."  </P> <P> Winston said his problems may have arisen from a statement he made that other  jurors misinterpreted.  </P> <P> "I said that in black areas, the police are a little less respectful of life  and they can have this cowboy, shoot-em-up attitude," Winston said. "That  doesn't mean I think that of all officers or all situations."  </P> <P> But juror Stanley Kielniarz, who was one of the first jurors to level charges  of bias against Winston, told Shook during a hearing that Winston started off  jury deliberations a week ago by saying that he does not trust anything a  police officer says.  </P> <P> "When we confronted him with his attitude and we said he should have divulged  his prejudice about police officers (before becoming a juror on the case), he  replied, 'They never asked me that question,' " Kielniarz said.  </P> <P> In response to questions from the judge, Winston denied saying that he  distrusts police officers and said he believed he could continue as a fair and  impartial juror on the case.  </P> <P> In an interview later, Winston said he has no bias for or against police  officers.  </P> <P> "I used to have a lot of college classes with police officers, and I got to  like some of them and not like others of them, just like you would anybody," he  said.  </P> <P> He said Kielniarz accused him at one point of favoring a not-guilty verdict  purely because the defendant is black.  </P> <P> "This (accusation) is racism in its ugliest form," Winston said. "Racism has  been substituted for justice here in Torrance."  </P> <P> Deliberations in the case were halted Wednesday after the jury passed a note to  the court saying that they could not reach a verdict.  </P> <P> Shook, who presided over the case but then left on vacation shortly after the  jury began deliberating, asked Judge Jean Matusinka to fill in for him.  </P> <P> When Matusinka asked the jury whether anything could be done to help them reach  a verdict, several jurors complained that one member of the panel was  inflexible.  </P> <P> During that hearing, Kielniarz revealed that he went to the district attorney's  office during Wednesday's lunch hour to ask what to do if a juror made  statements revealing bias.  </P> <P> The district attorney's investigator who responded to his query testified in a  hearing that he never discussed specifics of the case with Kielniarz and that  he advised him to have the jury foreman talk to the attorneys in the case.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Gray protested that Kielniarz revealed an inherent bias by  going to the district attorney's office with his questions rather than asking  for help from the judge.  </P> <P> Because specifics of the case were not discussed, however, Matusinka ruled that  Kielniarz had not been tainted as a juror by talking to the investigator.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Shook cut short his vacation and returned to court to decide  whether Winston should be allowed to remain on the jury.  </P> <P> "It's apparent to me that Mr. Winston has prejudged the credibility of the  police officers in this case," Shook said as he issued his ruling. "He is  unable to cast aside his personal bias in weighing the evidence in the case."  </P> <P> Gray blasted the judge's decision as "the biggest miscarriage of justice that I  have seen in 12 years."  </P> <P> "The message to the jury is clear: If there is a majority of jurors who  disagree with a minority, all you have to do is run to the judge and say, 'This  guy disagrees with us. Remove him,' " he said. "If a verdict comes in, it's  clear it will be a coerced verdict."  </P></p>

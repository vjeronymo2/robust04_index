			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WEST COVINA;  </P> <P> 2ND PARAMEDIC UNIT DENIED  </P> <P> Over staunch objections by Mayor William Tarozzi, the City Council on Monday  rejected a second paramedic unit for the West Covina Fire Department.  </P> <P> Tarozzi failed to persuade council members to use Redevelopment Agency money  for the new nine-member unit. The council voted 3 to 1 to postpone discussion  until the city completes a financial study. Councilwoman Nancy Manners was  absent.  </P> <P> Estimates of the unit's cost were $255,540 to start up and $480,000 a year to  maintain.  </P></p>

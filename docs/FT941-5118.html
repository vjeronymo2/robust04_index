			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Decline in furniture division cuts Cornwell Parker to Pounds 1.3m A sharp decline in the furniture division's contribution helped to halve pre-tax profits at Cornwell Parker, the furniture and fabrics group, from Pounds 2.92m to Pounds 1.26m for the six months to January 31. Group turnover eased to Pounds 43m, against Pounds 43.1m, which included Pounds 1.18m from discontinued operations. Earnings per share fell from 4.6p to 1.8p, but the interim dividend is being maintained at 1.7p. Mr Martin Jourdan, chairman, described the opening six months as extremely difficult. However he believed that the worst was behind it for the furniture division 'so long as the imminent increases in personal taxation do not seriously affect demand.' Operating profits from the furniture division, which includes Parker Knoll, fell from Pounds 2.32m to Pounds 426,000 on turnover of Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 23.6m). Mr Jourdan said the over-50s target market for Parker Knoll chairs had been affected by lower interest rates, which had reduced older people's disposable income. An attack on a younger market had not been 'as successful as we had hoped', however, in reverting to the core market Parker Knoll now had significantly higher orders than a year ago. The fabrics business turned in a strong performance, with operating profits up 19 per cent from Pounds 923,000 to Pounds 1.1m on turnover up from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 20.3m.</p>

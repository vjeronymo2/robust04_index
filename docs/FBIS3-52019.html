Camacho said the postponement of the reply, which had been  announced on 25 January for 1800 GMT today, is due to the fact  that he had received in the last few hours "new information and  elements that allow progress toward a dialogue."    Camacho reiterated that the only objective of this entire  effort is achieving an end to hostilities, and that is why he  decided to postpone the reply. "This is a delicate moment, which  we must handle with utmost responsibility," Camacho Solis said.  [passage omitted]    Camacho's announcement has created a great deal of  anticipation in Mexico City, where there is conjecture about the  origin of the new information received by the presidential peace  commissioner. The peace commissioner and Bishop Samuel Ruiz of  San Cristobal de las Casas (Chiapas) are in the Mexican capital.  The bishop has been appointed the Mexican Government's mediator  with the EZLN rebels. [passage omitted]</p>

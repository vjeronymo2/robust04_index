			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Nabil Sha'th, head of </F> the Palestinian delegation, in Cairo, by Razi Barqay -- recorded  "a short while ago" -- Sha'th's remarks recorded in English]    [Excerpt] [Barqay] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the head of the  Palestinian delegation, is busy in his Cairo office sending  faxes to 'Arafat and receiving faxes from Jerusalem. In the  course of our interview with him a short while ago, he received  a facsimile from Shim'on Peres. We will return to this later  but first we asked Sha'th about the draft that was formulated in  Cairo. Why has 'Arafat gone back on his agreement? Nabil  Sha'th replied that the reports of a joint paper were an Israeli  fabrication. There was no such document.    [Sha'th] In fact, I do not know which paper Prime Minister  Rabin is talking about. There were minutes that Mr. Peres  dictated to his assistant Yoni [not further specified] in the  meeting on 28 December. These minutes...[pauses] the next day  we got a different draft from the Israeli side which differs  significantly from it. And then, I sent a revised draft working  paper to the Israeli side that I have not received any response  on, so one wonders which agreement it is that Prime Minister  Rabin is talking about.    [Barqay translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues]  We only have a handwritten draft, Sha'th asserted, which has  not even been signed. The word agreement does not even appear  on the draft. We asked Sha'th what the disagreements were about.    [Sha'th] One, is about the size of the Jericho area. Number  two is an issue related to the passages only in relation to the  passage of residents of Gaza and Jericho; whereas we agree on  all the rest of the modalities.    [Barqay translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues]  We asked Sha'th to comment on 'Arafat's claim that Israel was  only offering the Palestinians something akin to an Indian  reservation.    [Sha'th] Whereas the Israeli side is always very sensitive  about any symbol of sovereignty we talk about, like a passport  or a postage stamp, we are also very sensitive about what we  feel sometimes is an attempt to continue Israeli control of  Palestinians in the occupied territories. Mr. 'Arafat's use of  the word Bantustan for example, was as a result of his feelings  that withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho should have given the Gaza  and Jericho residents at least more freedom from direct Israeli  control. Including of the crossing points.    [Barqay translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues]  Does 'Arafat have the power to impose his control, we asked  Sha'th? Most definitely, he replied. 'Arafat was and remains  the boss. All the talk about a revolt are completely  exaggerated. Then, while we were still talking, a facsimile  arrived from Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.    [Sha'th] Would you hold on just a second. We have just  received a letter from Mr. Peres and there is not a clear  approval of going to Taba. In other words, he is still ready to  hold the Taba negotiations but there is no specific date and I  do not know if we are sure about the conditions for going back.  Well, this may be clarified in a telephone call which I am  going to make but as of now I see only a tentative approval that  needs further confirmation. [passage omitted]</p>

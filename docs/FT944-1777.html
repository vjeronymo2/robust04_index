			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Eritrea struggles to rebuild as aid meeting begins: Pledges by donors are likely to be generous Eritrea, Africa's newest nation, will hold its first donors' conference with the World Bank and western governments in Paris today and present its masterplan for rebuilding a country emerging from more than a quarter century of civil war. 'Our global needs are tremendous,' Mr Haile Woldensai, Eritrea's finance minister, said yesterday, declining however to place a figure on Eritrea's aid requirements. 'Every sector of the economy was affected by the war, but we also want to be realistic and take into account the financial constraints of the donor community.' The Eritrean People's Liberation Front has been running the Red Sea state since it defeated the Ethiopian occupation forces in May 1991 following a 30-year liberation war. But Eritrea only became a fully-fledged sovereign state after a referendum on independence from Ethiopia in May 1993. It took another year before it could join the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, hence the delay in seeking international assistance for its reconstruction efforts. Government officials such as Mr Haile still work without pay. So do the teams of navvies - former combatants awaiting demobilisation - who have been rebuilding the bomb-damaged port of Massawa and the country's few dilapidated roads. In the countryside, villagers trek for miles to build small dams and stone terraces on food-for-work projects. Millions of tree seedlings are being grown in nurseries, ready for planting to help fix the soil on the eroded hillsides. The donor community is impressed by the single- minded tenacity with which Eritreans have gone about the task of forging a new nation. The aid pledges at the Paris meeting are expected to be generous. But Eritrea, which inherited no external debt upon independence (President Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, himself a former guerrilla fighter, agreed to shoulder the debt obligations of his country's former province), is wary of falling into the trap of aid dependence which afflicts the rest of the continent. 'We want to establish a new approach between donors and the recipient country,' Mr Haile said. 'Development programmes and priorities should be established by Eritreans, not by the donor community.' The Eritrean government has welcomed offers of international assistance, but it is less keen on accepting the legions of highly-paid foreign consultants who roam around Africa. A recent offer by the Italian government to rebuild the railway linking Massawa to the capital, Asmara, at a cost of Dollars 85m (Pounds 54m), was politely turned down. President Isayas Afewerki told the Italians Eritrea would rebuild the railway on its own. The first new sleepers were laid last month. There are few illusions, however, over the scale of the task which faces the new government. Even after three years of peace, Eritrea cannot feed itself. It depends on international donations to meet the needs of 1.5m people - half of the population. A further 500,000 Eritreans are awaiting repatriation from refugee camps in neighbouring Sudan - a country with which Eritrea severed diplomatic relations two weeks ago because of Khartoum's alleged training of Eritrean Islamic insurgents. Nevertheless, foreign investors, led by the US and Israel, are showing an interest in Eritrea now that a foreign investment code and property and land rights have been established. Several US oil companies, including Mobil, Amoco and Hunt, are negotiating oil exploration contracts for the shallow waters off Eritrea's Red Sea coast. Israel hopes to start fishing operations soon after a 30-year break, while Middle East and German concerns are already negotiating for licences.</p>

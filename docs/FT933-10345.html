			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trade wave buoys CBoT THE MIDWEST floods set off a trading frenzy at the Chicago Board of Trade in July with the exchange's agricultural futures and options turnover hitting a record 5.5m contracts. Soyabean futures volume was up 76 per cent over the same month last year and maize turnover was up 60 per cent. Options volumes in both commodities doubled. The exchange as a whole had its third busiest July on record at 16m contracts. In spite of falling interest rates, CBoT financial futures and options volumes were up only 4.8 per cent in July at 10.5m contracts. Ten-year treasury notes saw the largest percentage gains. Volume at neighbouring Chicago Mercantile Exchange reached a July record of 11.7m contracts, led by 5.6m in Eurodollar futures turnover. In spite of the currency turmoil in the European Community, CME currency futures and options volume was down 8 per cent from July 1992 at 2.9m contracts. For the first seven months of the year CBoT volume was 87.2m contracts, up 11.2 per cent from 1992. The CME year to date volume was close behind at 8.5m, up 9.2 per cent from last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yerevan, January 19 (SNARK)--Today Armenia's Defense  Minister Serzh Sargisyan flatly refuted the information spread  by IMA-press agency which referring to the Azerbaijani Defense  Ministry source runs that on January 18 Armenian assault planes  bombed the settlements of the Kazakhskiy and Kedabekskiy regions  of Azerbaijan.    "Not a craft took off from airfields of Armenia even with  training purpose that day", the defense minister told SNARK.  Moreover, continued Sargisyan," an inspection group from Great  Britain aiming to assess the information in the armed forces  arrived on January 18 in Armenia and is currently inspecting  divisions of the Armed Forces of Armenia".    As to Sargisyan, such news is apparently spread for the  justification of the Azerbaijani Air Forces' recent air raids  upon settlements of Nagorno-Karabakh. Meanwhile, the defense  minister did not exclude the possibility of bombing Armenia, for  such public misinformation could be used by Azerbaijan as a  propaganda trick.</p>

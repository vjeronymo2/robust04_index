			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI HOUSING FOR MARRIED STUDENTS FILLS KEY NEED  </P> <P> Re UCI Protesters (March 8): I have a question: Do students nowadays believe  that their primary function in school is to learn or is it to protest something  they don't like?  </P> <P> More and more it seems to be the latter, especially at our tax-supported  colleges and universities.  </P> <P> I am beginning to resent it mightily.  </P> <P> The current flap over UCI not permitting homosexual couples to live in campus  family housing facilities is an example. The law says that persons of the same  sex cannot marry. The University of California Board of Regents says that only  married couples are allowed to live in the family housing complex. Period.  </P> <P> That doesn't seem difficult to understand. So why do the "protesters" expect  the chancellor to break the law and to violate university policy because they  don't agree with the law or the policy?  </P> <P> Like spoiled children, these so-called students block building entrances, build  shantytowns on public property and waste valuable police resources in order to  get lots of press coverage.  </P> <P> What they should be doing, if they truly believe in their cause, is to invest  their time and talents in getting the laws and the policies changed. This would  allow the serious students (who, thankfully, are in the vast majority) to  pursue the education for which they (and their parents) are paying a lot of  money.  </P> <P> RON WALKER  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

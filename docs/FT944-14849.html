			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / China to hold more N-tests China expects to conduct 'a few more' nuclear tests before it joins an international moratorium on experimental atomic blasts, an official said yesterday. Beijing has said it favours a complete ban on all nuclear arms, but until a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty is concluded, will refuse to join in a two-year-old moratorium adopted by the world's other declared nuclear powers. The official said his government did not want to see the nuclear weapons gap between China and other nuclear powers 'frozen forever', leaving Beijing vulnerable to attack. More tests were needed to improve the quality of new devices.</p>

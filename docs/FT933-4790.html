			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lucas agrees to buy Dowty Fuel off TI Group LUCAS Industries yesterday moved to strengthen its position as Europe's leading manufacturer of aircraft fuel systems with the Pounds 18.9m agreed purchase of Dowty Fuel Systems from TI Group. Dowty Fuel Systems, based in Cheltenham, makes engine controls and accessories, employs 390 people and has net assets of about Pounds 11.9m. But while the deal is relatively modest financially for both Lucas and TI, it is strategically significant. Lucas said last October that it wanted to strengthen its core businesses, of which engine control systems is one, and dispose of its non-core assets. Several sales have followed, but yesterday's announcement represents the first acquisition. Sales by Dowty Fuel Systems totalled more than Pounds 20m last year, and the company will be merged with Birmingham-based Lucas Engine Control Systems to create an Pounds 80m business. No decisions have yet been made on whether to retain the Cheltenham manufacturing site, but Lucas in any case expects to make big savings through the integration. This would enable it to boost profits at the Dowty unit, which made Pounds 1m pre-tax in the last nine months of 1992. Lucas said the products of the merged businesses were complementary. While there was some duplication in main engine and afterburner fuel controls, the Dowty unit would bring Lucas new products such as actuators. The deal would also give Lucas access to big Dowty customers in North America such as Garrett Engines and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. For TI, the sale is part of its restructuring of Dowty Aerospace - following last year's takeover of Dowty - to focus on its world-leading businesses such as aircraft landing gear. The sale is one of TI's largest since the takeover. It is also the first of a number of non-core businesses which TI is in negotiations to sell - for an estimated total of about Pounds 100m.</p>

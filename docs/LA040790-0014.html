			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SATICOY;  </P> <P> BRIDGE REPAIR WORK FINISHED WEEK EARLY  </P> <P> Repair work on the California 118 bridge over the Santa Clara River in Saticoy  has been completed a week ahead of schedule, according to Caltrans.  </P> <P> Caltrans Maintenance Supt.  </P> <P> Ron Cabral said work on the bridge took less time than expected because, among  other things, "once workers opened up the bridge joints, they discovered the  condition was not as deteriorated as anticipated."  </P> <P> Even more helpful, he said, was "the excellent cooperation we had from drivers  in the area who voluntarily took alternate routes, which significantly  decreased the traffic on the bridge." The California Department of  Transportation also increased the number of workers on the project, he added.  </P> <P> Cabral said that even though the bridge is now in excellent condition, Caltrans  plans to widen it in the future. The timing of that project depends on whether  voters approve Proposition 111 on the June ballot, authorizing increases in the  gasoline tax and spending limits, he said. JACK SEARLES  </P></p>

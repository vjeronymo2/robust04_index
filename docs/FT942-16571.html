			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU voting system could look to US example Sir, Ian Davidson's piece on the latest chapter in the ongoing European constitutional showdown, this time on majority voting after enlargement ('Vengeance of a Union scorned', April 2/3) recalls the need for the EU to consider establishing a bicameral legislature. Such a legislature could be modelled on the American system: designed to balance the power between large and small states. The interests of larger countries would be reflected in the existing European parliament, where individual national voting strength would continue to be determined (within certain parameters) by population size. For smaller states, there would be another chamber, a senate, allowing all member states equal representation. Perhaps the Council of Ministers, still composed of ministers from member state governments, could evolve into this second chamber. The creation of such an upper chamber, as was envisaged for the American system, would ensure a measure of state autonomy in a union beginning to forge a larger unified identity. In the federalist papers written by America's founding fathers, they said this about the proposed US Senate: the 'equal vote allowed to each state is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion of sovereignty remaining in the individual states . . . (The Senate) will derive its powers from the states as political and coequal societies . . .' Although it is directly elected now, the US Senate was originally designed to secure the interests of the state governments against a powerful centre. The British government, looking ahead to the 1996 intergovernmental conference, needs to devise a way of promoting a broader European Union, while at the same time reserving to itself those elements of its own sovereignty deemed important.

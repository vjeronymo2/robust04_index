			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Guidance round the insider minefield A LEADING UK stockbroking firm has warned that if listed companies retreat into their shells because of recent insider trading scares, they could risk 'an ill-informed market from which no-one benefits'. A report by Hoare Govett Corporate Finance says that companies should monitor market expectations. If there are material changes in trading, they should consider making a formal Stock Exchange statement. Fears that companies will clam up have followed the public censure of London International Group by the Stock Exchange and the separate conviction of the analyst Mr Thorold Mackie of insider trading offences following a private meeting with a company. In May LIG told 13 analysts and four institutions that profits forecasts for the company were too high. Last week NFC, the transport group, said it might drop its 'best view' forecasts of future profits because of concern about methods of communicating information to shareholders. Hoare's report was written to provide companies with guidance on how to maintain contacts with the market within the present rules. It says companies should make more use of the formal opportunities provided by results announcements and annual meetings to set out their views on current trading. 'This will provide a backdrop against which subsequent informal communication with market participants can take place.' It also advocates that where there is concern about a company's financial position, it should consider releasing a balance sheet and a cash-flow statement at the interim stage. This information could then be discussed more freely. The City tradition of year-end company briefings with analysts is 'unlikely to be satisfactory in the new disclosure environment,' says Hoare. It points out that companies could make formal trading statements either before the closed season or after an important sales period, such as Christmas for retailers. Companies should develop a clear understanding of price-sensitive issues and monitor market expectations carefully, Hoare says. If the need arises for market perceptions to be changed, a public announcement should be made promptly.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT UNION OFFICIALS DENY BANK REGULATOR'S ALLEGATION OF PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Credit union executives Wednesday denied a federal banking regulator's  contention that the nation's credit unions have "a lot of the symptoms that the  S&amp;Ls had" before the recent wave of S&amp;L failures.  </P> <P> L. William Seidman, a federal banking regulator, fired the latest salvo in the  growing war between credit unions and bankers Tuesday when he told an American  Bankers Assn. gathering that credit union executives aren't being truthful by  claiming that their insurance fund is stronger than the insurance fund that  covers savings accounts held by bank and S&amp;L customers.  </P> <P> Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution  Trust Corp., also suggested that the fast-growing credit union industry is  investing in areas in which it lacks expertise.  </P> <P> Hal Stephens, president of San Diego-based Mission Federal Credit Union, which  has 75,000 members, described Seidman's remarks as proof that bankers, and  banking regulators "want to destroy us. They see us growing . . . with a 6%  share of total consumer savings, and they want that business."  </P> <P> Bankers have watched with envy during the past decade as credit unions became  one of the nation's fastest-growing financial service sectors. Assets at the  nation's 15,086 credit unions stood at $203 billion on Dec. 31, 1989, up from  $64.2 billion in 1979. Membership has soared to 60.4 million, up from 41.4  million in 1979.  </P> <P> Jerry Karbon, a spokesman for the Madison, Wis.-based Credit Union National  Assn., on Wednesday agreed that credit unions have enjoyed dramatic growth.  "That growth has been controlled growth and wise growth," Karbon said. "There's  no reason to be worried about credit unions' health and safety."  </P> <P> "Far more banks and S&amp;Ls than credit unions have closed in recent years,"  said Karbon, who predicted that the General Accounting Office and the U.S.  Treasury will document the credit unions' financial strength in current  reviews.  </P> <P> Credit unions believe their growth is directly tied to the wave of expanded  services that have been added to meet customer demand. Besides their  traditional car loans, many credit unions now offer credit cards, checking and  saving accounts, individual retirement accounts and home loans. Some offer  loans to small business operations and others offer basic stock-brokerage  services.  </P> <P> Credit unions also point to customer satisfaction surveys that show credit  union members to be extremely satisfied with how they are served by credit  unions.  </P> <P> But bankers view those expanded services as an encroachment on their  traditional turf. They also maintain that credit unions enjoy an unfair  competitive advantage through their long-standing exemption from paying federal  income taxes.  </P> <P> Credit unions have escaped unscathed when past congresses were eliminating tax  exemptions. But Stephens and other credit union spokesmen acknowledged  Wednesday that bankers will be pressing hard during the coming year to  eliminate the tax exemption for credit unions.  </P> <P> "Bankers have always been after our tax status, but we're a financial  cooperative, and our earnings go back to our members, Stephens said. "So what  do they want to tax? To us, it seems that they've pretty well busted up the  S&amp;L industry, and now they want to take us apart."  </P> <P> Despite their remarkable growth during the past decade, credit unions still  play a relatively small role in the financial services industry. "Citicorp is  larger than all the credit unions combined," Stephens said. "We're really not  that big, with just 6% of personal savings."  </P> <P> But, wary of bankers' intentions, credit unions are asking their 60.4 million  members to let Congress know that "anything they do will be remembered during  the next election," Stephens said.  </P> <P> Karbon expects more pressure during the next year to "streamline and  consolidate the existing regulatory system" by combining the credit union's  deposit insurance fund with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which last  year absorbed the financially troubled Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance  Corp.  </P> <P> Credit union industry executives will fight to retain their historical customer  base, said Tena Lozano, a spokeswoman for the Pomona-based California Credit  Union League.  </P> <P> Credit unions have faithfully served "customers that banks weren't interested  in" when federal legislators created the credit union industry during the  1930s. "Now, suddenly, they're interested," Lozano said.  </P> <P> But Stephens argues that increased market share isn't the only reason that  bankers are attacking credit unions.  </P> <P> "We're the only financial organizations with the chance of giving them a run  for (consumers') money," Stephens said. "But banks have had tremendous losses.  They have terrible problems with LBOs (leveraged buyouts) and foreign loans.  They're trying to take the pressure off of themselves" by attacking credit  unions.  </P> <P> CREDIT UNION GROWTH  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.88IN:2.55IN:2.66IN:2.66IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1979  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1984  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Number of unions  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21,983  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18,375  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15,086  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Members  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 41.4 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 49.3 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 60.4 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Assets  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $64.2 billion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $113 billion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $203 billion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Loans  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $51.2 billion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $75.4 billion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $134.9 billion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Savings deposits  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $55.9 billion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $102.6 billion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $184.8 billion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: The Credit Union National Assn.  </P></p>

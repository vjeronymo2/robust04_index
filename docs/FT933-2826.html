			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bangladesh unveils jute rescue plan BANGLADESH WILL create a Dollars 2.5m loan fund, ban production of synthetic bags and provide interest-free loans in an effort to save its ailing jute industry, Mr Hannan Shah, the jute minister said this week, Reuter reports from Dhaka. Overmanning and inefficiency have been identified as the main reasons for huge losses in the public sector jute industry, he told parliament on Tuesday night. Public sector jute mills had lost Tk250bn (Pounds 4.2bn) since 1972 because of the shrinking international market and low efficiency. The minister said the government would create a revolving fund of Dollars 2.5m to offer mills loans at 3 per cent interest over 12 years. He added that the government would ban production of polythene bags and other synthetic products that posed a major threat to the jute market. However, he gave no date for imposing the ban or for implementing the loan plan. Bangladesh, which is under pressure from the World Bank to sack excess workers and sell loss-making jute mills, earns about Dollars 420m or nearly 17 per cent of its annual receipts from jute and jute goods.</p>

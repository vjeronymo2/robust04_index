			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The market researcher who found the answer - A woman who rediscovered her sense of excitement TO ALEX Walley, who runs Directions Research and Marketing, the thought of setting up her own business was far more frightening than the reality. 'In practice the hardest bit was getting British Telecom to fit the phone lines,' she says. Directions offers strategic market research, to help companies market new or existing brand products and services. The idea is to offer a highly professional service to clients based on detailed interviews with carefully chosen groups. You will not find Alex standing on a street corner asking people what kind of washing powder they use. Alex, who has a degree in maths and psychology, spent 18 months on leaving university with the accountants Thomson McClintock but left to become a market researcher with a medium sized firm. In 1987, she and two colleagues, Liz Cox and Sally Nicholson, were approached by a large advertising agency and asked to set up an in-house research company. 'They were offering us a profit share, fast cars on the company scheme and lovely offices,' she recalls, but she was tired of working long hours for someone else and decided to set up on her own with her two former colleagues. It took a month to set up the business and rent an office in Fulham. This was straightforward in comparison with the efforts to raise a Pounds 10,000 loan from National Westminster and Lloyds Bank to pay for a top of the range desk top printing system. 'Lloyds offered us a high interest personal investors' account,' recalls Alex, 'but no business services. NatWest hummed and hah-hed and said they only looked at serious business people. They didn't say no but they all but did.' The experience deterred her from approaching the other clearing banks; luckily, a loan was arranged through banking contacts with CL Bank Nederland. In contrast, a recent trip to the local NatWest branch to open a petty cash account generated a totally different reaction: 'they were falling over themselves to help us'. In the early days, the main problem was persuading people to take them seriously as a new business. Alex believes this was hard because all the three partners were women. But several clients from their old company commissioned work and since then, the client list has expanded comfortably. It includes TSB Bank and Insurance, the Leeds Permanent Building Society and Courtaulds Textiles. For each project, Alex and her colleagues talk to respondants individually or in group discussions which may last from one and a half to four hours. In the more creative sessions, respondants act out roles. They might pretend, for instance, to be shop assistants treating customers as they would like to be treated themselves. A network of recruiters around the country organise the discussion sessions and find respondants. Alex has taken a very cautious approach. For the first three years, she turned away work rather than risking over-expansion. She did the books herself, once a month on a Sunday afternoon. The number of employees has been kept low - the total now is eight - but Alex has not been forced to make redundancies as a result of the recession in the market research industry. Turnover has stayed at around Pounds 750,000 a year. 'In the first year we practically killed ourselves because we were so convinced we would go bust,' she remembers. They all worked at least 12 hours a day and for most of the weekends. Since then, she says, each has realised that other aspects of their lives - in Alex's case, her two young children - are as important. One thing she has learnt by bitter experience is the importance of a good accountant. Directions' first firm of accountants were a 'small two man band who were very nice and gave us lots of help with book-keeping but blew out when it came to dividends and wouldn't admit they were out of their depth. We lost a lot of money due to incorrect tax advice.' 'The second accountant was a complete disaster, from one of the top 20 firms. We had a partner who couldn't have been more condescending. He didn't get our accounts out on time; one of my partners was actually fined for not returning her tax return on time despite having told her that hehad.' The current accountant is from a medium sized firm and does an excellent job. And, invariably, it's 'the little niggly things which turn into massive problems,' as Alex says. She has just spent several days sorting out the confusion caused by an official from the Inland Revenue who gave the wrong advice about the payment of VAT for hotel rooms used for interviewing respondants. After four years, Alex regards the main problem as balancing home and work. She wants to spend more time with her family, but doesn't want a part-time job. She is also keen to keep the company relatively small so that people work together well. But she is in no doubt that working for herself has been a change for the better. 'As soon as I started, all the excitement came back. I'm in control, I like my clients and I enjoy the work.' Directions Market Research, 88a New King's Road, London SW6 4LU. Tel: 071-736-6925</p>

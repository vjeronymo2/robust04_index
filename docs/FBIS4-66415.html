			<p>Heat   Conductivity/Expansion Reaction Sintering SiN   <F P=102> 94FE0282A Tokyo NIKKEI MATLS &amp; TECHNOLOGY in Japanese Dec 93  pp 16-17 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0282A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI MATLS &amp; TECHNOLOGY </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] Isuzu Ceramics Research Corporation (ICRC, Fujisawa  City, Kanagawa Prefecture), an R&amp;D subsidiary of Isuzu Motors  Ltd., has developed an Si-N-Al-Ti-O-based structural ceramic  material (silicon-nitrogen-aluminum-titanium-oxygen) with high  bending strength, low thermal conductivity, and a low  thermal-expansion coefficient. This ceramic material, a  reaction-sintered product of a mixture of silicon nitride  (Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]) and aluminum titanate  (Al[.sub]2[/]TiO[.sub]5[/]), was developed to be used for  automotive engine components. In energetic pursuit of the  development of ceramic-made adiabatic diesel engines, ICRC was  trying to simultaneously achieve three desirable physical  properties for a ceramic material to be used for the combustion  chamber of an adiabatic engine. The properties were high  strength, low thermal conductivity to manifest excellent  heat-insulation capacity, and a low thermal-expansion  coefficient to discourage the generation of thermal stress due  to repeated heating and cooling.    Previously, zirconia (ZrO[.sub]2[/])-based, partially  stabilized zirconia, and aluminum titanate  (Al[.sub]2[/]TiO[.sub]5[/]) were used to test-produce  combustion chambers of ceramic, adiabatic diesel engines, to  maintain the high adiabatic nature of the chambers. However, the  zirconia-based material had not only a large thermal-expansion  coefficient, but also a high density of 9 g/cm[.sup]3[/];  whereas aluminum titanate was poor in bending strength  (four-point bending) at 30-40 MPa.    After a search for new ceramics that had the desired,  specific physical properties, ICRC zeroed in on  reaction-sintered silicon nitride, which had a relatively low  thermal conductivity of 16 W/m K (after correction to a solid  portion only) bkecause of its high concentration of pores. In  addition, according to Mr. Hidenori Kita, Chief Researcher in  Material Research Department, ``silicon nitride was found to be  made with wide-ranging properties depending on the type and the  quantity of a sintering aid.'' Furthermore, reaction-sintered  silicon nitride appeared to be a promising ceramic material with  high bending strength.    ICRC tested aluminum titanate, alumina silicate  (Al[.sub]2[/]SiO[.sub]13[/]), lanthanum oxide  (La[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]) and cerium oxide (ceria,  CeO[.sub]2[/]) as a potential sintering aid to be added to  reaction-sintered silicon nitride, because these compounds had  been known to reduce thermal conductivity.    One of these sintering aids was added to microfine silicon  (Si) powder with a particle size range of 5-10 m, and the  blended powder was press-molded to form a green compact, which  was subjected to reaction-sintering by heating in a nitrogen  (N[.sub]2[/]) atmosphere. In principle, the nitrification  reaction proceeds from the surfaces of silicon particles inward,  and reaction-sintered silicon nitride is produced when the  nitrification is completed through the core of each particle. No  shrinkage occurs during the sintering process, because the green  compact made of silicon powder is nitrified. As a result, the  dimensions of the sintered compact are exactly the same as that  of the green compact.    Thus, it is possible to fabricate near-net-shape products by  the above method, although the sintered compact has many pores  because of no shrinkage.    The above-mentioned group of sintering aids was narrowed  down  to two, aluminum titanate and alumina silicate, based on their  capabilities to drastically decrease thermal conductivity and to  maintain strength after the oxidation treatment for densifying  sintered compacts. Subsequently, aluminum titanate was selected  over alumina silicate based on the bending strengths, thermal  conductivities, and the absolute values of thermal expansion  coefficients.    It was found that the thermal conductivity of the compact  was  lowest when 35-wt-percent aluminum titanate was added, and any  further addition of the aid rather increased the thermal  conductivity. It was also found that the thermal conductivity of  the reaction-sintered compact containing 35-wt-percent aluminum  titanate was further decreased after it was subjected to a  post-sintering oxidation treatment. Based on experimental  results, the maximum effect of reducing the thermal conductivity  was achieved when the oxidation treatment was carried out at  800C. The reaction-sintered compact containing  35-wt-percent aluminum titanate had a structure, in that  aluminum titanate crystal-rich ceramic parts (with an average  size of 20-30 m) were dispersed in a sintered cluster of  silicon nitride crystal grains with an average size of 1 m.  When this compact was oxidized at 800C, titanium nitride  (TiN), which had been formed by the nitrification of titania  (TiO[.sub]2[/]) and is a component of the complex oxide of  aluminum titanate, was oxidized back into titania. Since titania  was less thermally conductive than titanium nitride, the entire  compact became less conductive.    After the oxidation treatment, the aluminum titanate-rich  core portions were found to have high concentrations of alumina  (Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]), and the peripheral areas were  made of a mixed phase of alumina and titania.    Mr. Kita conjectures that this oxidation-formed structure  consisting of multiple layers of different compositions  ``decreases the thermal conductivity because the structure  impedes heat flow by scattering heat-transmitting phonons.''  However, the heating required for the oxidation treatment tends  to diffuse the constituent elements of the ceramics, and the  porosity is reduced to 20+ percent, which in turn reduces the  volume fraction of ``void'' that is supposed to function to keep  the thermal conductivity of the entire ceramic material low. As  a result, the thermal conductivity increases.    Thus, the oxidation treatment conditions were determined  based on the balance between an advantage of lower thermal  conductivity resulting from the multiple-layer structure and a  disadvantage of higher thermal conductivity resulting from the  decreased porosity.    Incidentally, the newly developed, reaction-sintered,  silicon  nitride-based ceramic material showed a bending strength  (four-point bending) of 125 MPa, a vertical elastic modulus of  75 GPa, and a density of 2.3 g/cm[.sup]3[/]. In addition, the  key property of thermal conductivity of this material was 2.6  W/m/K at room temperature, 2.3 W/m/K at 540C, and 2.4 W/m/K  at 800C; its thermal expansion coefficient was excellent at  3.1 10[.sup]-[/]6/C; and its anti-heat shock strength  was 538C. It is conjectured that the excellent  mechanical properties of this material, including the bending  strength, were attained as a result of the precise size control  for silicon nitride crystal grains to approximately 1 m.</p>

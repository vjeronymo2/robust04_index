			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Sport: Dreams of salmon in a foreign land - Fishing THERE is a certain species of smile, part shame-faced, part trumphant, which is produced by undeserved and unexpected good fortune. I saw it the other day on the face of a man I know and like who runs a first-rate tackle shop in Reading, Berkshire. He had just returned from a week in Scotland, fishing the Deveron, and his smile told me as much as I wished to know. At the end of a season of drought, he had hit it just right. He and his companion had caught 17 salmon in a week. Not bad, eh? Indeed, I thought savagely. That's only 95 per cent more than I've caught in my whole life. Four of my career total of nine came in one morning, and three of those had to go back because they were late-season kippers. I felt like gaffing him but, instead, managed a muted congratulation. He asked me how I had fared in Ireland and an involuntary groan escaped me. For I had just come back from a long and keenly-awaited excursion to the Republic with nothing more substantial than a familiar and impatiently-received tale of failure. The contrasting experiences of my tackle-dealing friend and myself encapsulate the swinish character of salmon fishing. He is, of course, a far better fisherman than me. But there is more to this monstrous disparity than that. My friend was in Scotland; it rained; he caught fish. I was in the Republic of Ireland; it did not rain (or not enough to do any good); I caught nothing. That success and happiness should depend on the willingness of some suitable weather system to drag itself in the right direction at the right time is simply not fair. But it is the name of this particularly bloody game. Having had my gripe, I still insist that the reasons which took me to the Blackwater were sound. What is more, once a new season has come round - and assuming I have managed to ingratiate myself with a stern Providence - I intend to go back to it. It remains my belief that, given a modicum of good luck, it offers as good a chance of decent salmon fishing as any river to which access is possible. Two years ago, the 12 miles of the Blackwater owned or rented by the Blackwater Lodge Hotel, at Upper Ballyduff in Co. Waterford, produced nigh on 1,500 salmon. Last year, the total was 1,200. This year, it has been rather less than a third of that. No wonder the faces in the bar were as dark and twice as long as the pints of stout. Being hotel water, it is fished hard. When I was there, the occasional salmon was still being lured from the paltry flow of water, most of them on horrible purple shrimps. A chum, who came down from Dublin to keep me company, caused a minor stir by employing a fly to catch what was, at two pounds, quite the smallest salmon I have ever seen. I fished a couple of the Blackwater Lodge beats, both of them with a nice variety of water, both of them normally full of fish. I never felt I was in with a significant chance. I breathed the soft air, admired the cows, enjoyed the rhythm of casting and listened to the lamentations of the regulars. The sixth sense, the one which activates expectation of action, was at all times dormant. Elsewhere, the river was little disturbed by the tread of desperate anglers. The Careysville beats at Fermoy, below the Duke of Devonshire's handsome Georgian lodge, were untouched. At Mallow, the locals had packed it in six weeks before to wait for the rain which never came. It can't be as bad again, they said, and I believe them. And the time to go, I was informed reliably, was not September but June. The small summer salmon, the grilse, should then be running the river in numbers sufficient to give anyone hope. And if, unthinkably, this bounty should again be withheld, the area at least offers consoling alternatives in the wonderfully-challenging trout fishing on the Suir and a gaggle of lesser streams. There is, anyway, nowhere I would rather fail to catch fish than Ireland - and few rivers better able to offer comfort in failure than the Blackwater. It is a grand piece of water, flowing through enchanting countryside, and you do not have to be a plutocrat with friends in high places to fish it. Much of it is accessible to the visitor, whether the hotel water or the beats let by Peter Dempster Ltd from Conna, Co. Cork, or (at the top end of the market) the Careysville fishery; all of it within an hour of Cork airport. The salmon fly rod is now hanging from its nail and the reel is in its bag. The time for action and heartbreak is past, the time for dreaming is arrived. In one of those cheering visions, I am standing with a smile quite as triumphant as that of my friend, the tackle-dealer, with my first Blackwater salmon at my feet.</p>

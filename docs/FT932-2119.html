			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Lombard League wins Milan race THE populist Lombard League last night confirmed its hold on the voters of northern Italy by winning the mayoral election for Milan. The run-off in the second round of partial municipal elections throughout Italy also confirmed the strength of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The Christian Democrats and the Socialists  - the dominant parties over the past decade  - are the principal losers. Exit polls and partial counting of votes showed that the Lombard League's candidate, Mr Marco Formentini, scored a clear victory in the northern industrial city of Milan. Mr Formentini notched up about 55-57 per cent of the vote in the second round. In the earlier round, on June 6, he had won nearly 39 per cent of the vote and polls during the past week consistently put him ahead. Nevertheless, his opponent in the run-off, Mr Nando Dalla Chiesa, had put up a strong showing backed by a leftist alliance headed by the PDS. 'The game is over,' said Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's rough-and-tumble leader. 'What happened today is a strong signal that the country wants change. . . . If the League wins, change wins.' The League's victory in Milan underlines the north's desire for new political blood and a radical approach to municipal politics in the wake of widespread corruption scandals. In the other big northern industrial city of Turin the PDS candidate, Mr Valentino Castellani, came from behind and easily topped his rival, Mr Diego Novelli, a former Turin mayor who was supported by a rival group of leftist parties. The PDS did well, according to exit polls, in most of the 145 municipalities where there was a second round contest for mayor. This was the first time under new laws approved in March that Italy has carried out direct elections for mayors, who now have the right to choose 60 per cent of municipal councils and thus ensure stable local government. The Lombard League has vowed to contest the results of first-round voting in Turin and a regional appeal court will consider its case next week. This could lead to the Turin election being annulled.</p>

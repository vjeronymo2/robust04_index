			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP SOFTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> REDMAN WINS HER WALK ON WILD SIDE FOR VILLA PARK  </P> <P> When Villa Park High School pitcher Christina Redman was good, she was very  good. But when she was bad, she was wild.  </P> <P> Despite an erratic pitching performance Tuesday, Redman and Villa Park survived  a two-run seventh inning by Canyon to score a 3-2 victory in a Century League  softball game at Canyon.  </P> <P> Redman missed all of last season's league play because of shin splints and  stress fractures in her legs.  </P> <P> She came into the game having pitched 19 consecutive innings without giving up  a hit. But when Dalynne Large's single ended the streak with two outs in the  third and Villa Park (10-10, 3-0) leading, 1-0, Redman seemed shaken.  </P> <P> Large advanced to second on a wild pitch and Tina French took first on a passed  ball on a third strike. Redman then walked cleanup hitter Chanele Chambrone on  four pitches to load the bases, but Jill Player popped to third to end the  inning.  </P> <P> Villa Park's Michele D'Amato scored the only run of the inning on Steph Will's  single to center field.  </P> <P> Villa Park scored two runs in the sixth. Wills singled and Canyon pitcher  Kristin Heizer walked Redman and Robyn Kerfoot to load the bases. Redman then  scored on a fielder's choice and Munique Hernandez singled in Kerfoot from  second before Heizer retired the side.  </P> <P> Leading, 3-0, in the bottom of the seventh, Redman (7-5) ran into trouble  again, throwing three wild pitches and walking four batters.  </P> <P> After three walks, Large doubled for her third hit to score Del Mazzio. French  then singled to score Kyriazis.  </P> <P> Canyon (11-8, 2-1), ranked No. 6 in the Southern Section 4-A, had the tying run  on third and the winning run on first with power hitter Chambrone at bat.  Redman unintentionally walked her but the Comanches left all three runners  stranded, flying out for the last two outs of the inning.  </P> <P> In the Angelus League:  </P> <P> Mater Dei 4, Rosary 2 (10 innings) -- Mater Dei pitcher Amy Moeller doubled in  the go-ahead run in the top of the 10th inning, then scored on a single by  Theresa Conway. Moeller allowed five hits for the complete-game victory. Mater  Dei is 11-4-2, 1-1-1, Jennifer Salazar had four strikeouts for Rosary (8-7,  2-2).  </P> <P> In the Empire League:  </P> <P> El Dorado 4, Los Alamitos 2 -- Keri Lucas hit a two-run homer for El Dorado  (12-4, 2-1) at Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> Esperanza 7, Katella 1 -- Rachel Veloz pitched a seven-hitter and struck out  four for visiting Esperanza (5-9, 1-2). Shelby Selton had two hits, knocked in  a run, scored a run and stole a base.

Kari Escabeda had the three-run homer in the first for Buena  Park.  </P> <P> Sunny Hills 7, Sonora 5 -- Freshman reliever Stacy Thurber entered in the third  inning and pitched five innings of no-hit ball for the victory. Host Sunny  Hills (12-5, 2-1) scored five runs in the first inning.  </P> <P> In the Garden Grove League:  </P> <P> Bolsa Grande 4, Los Amigos 0 -- Karie Benefiel (3-7) pitched two hitter for the  Matadors (5-9, 3-4) at Bolsa Grande.  </P> <P> Garden Grove 9, Santiago 0 -- Stephanie Smith (12-7) pitched a no-hitter,  striking out 12, for the Argonauts (14-8, 6-1) at Garden Grove. Kim Clark had  two hits and four RBIs for Garden Grove.  </P> <P> In the Olympic League:  </P> <P> Whittier Christian 10, Ontario Christian 1 -- Jennifer Pittman had two hits and  a RBI for the Heralds (5-5, 4-2) at Whittier Christian.  </P> <P> In the Orange League:  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda 5, Anaheim 0 -- Kelly Cook (11-3) pitched a three-hitter, striking  out 11 for Brea-Olinda (11-4, 3-0) at Anaheim.

Bickert, who was  5-9, turned in her uniform last week after Coach Mike Flanegin began  introducing shortstop Linda Lunceford into the pitching rotation more, Flanegin  said.  </P> <P> Woodbridge 3, Orange 2 -- Alisha Nelson (3-3) pitched a four-hitter for the  victory for the Warriors (10-7, 3-0) at Orange.  </P> <P> In the Sunset League  </P> <P> Ocean View 2, Huntington Beach 0 -- Marla Pickard hit a two-run homer with two  outs in the bottom of the seventh to give the Seahawks (13-9, 2-1) the victory  at Ocean View.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley 10, Westminster 0 (5 innings) -- Cami Bigler and Trisha Staake  each drove in two runs for the Barons (14-3-1, 3-0) at Fountain Valley.  </P></p>

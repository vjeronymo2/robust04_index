			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOOR NOTES;  </P> <P> IN BATTLE OF OLD MAN AND THE SEA, ANGLER, 81, IS A WINNER  </P> <P> Bill Coombs is 81, but the Australian proved this week that age is not a factor  when he competed in the 32nd Hawaiian International billfish tournament off  Kailua-Kona.  </P> <P> Coombs caught a 592-pound blue marlin Monday, putting his Gamefish Club of  South Australia into the lead after the first day of the event.  </P> <P> The three-man team was reduced to two before competition began when one member,  Ron Johnson, suffered broken his ribs in an accident. And Coombs was fishing  alone Tuesday after his other teammate, John Johnston, lost part of a thumb  when it got caught in a rope while the crew was hauling Coombs' fish aboard  Monday. Johnston was treated and released at the Kona Hospital emergency room.  </P> <P> "Billy's out there battling the ocean alone," Johnston said Tuesday from his  hotel room at the King Kamehameha Hotel. "I don't know whether I'll do any  fishing tomorrow, but I'll certainly be out there . . . appraising the  situation."  </P> <P> Said Hal Wood, in charge of public relations for the event: "This is a contact  sport."  </P> <P> Wood said that the tournament director, Roy Morioka, was slightly injured  Monday when a chain from a hoist fell on his head.  </P> <P> "He said he got a puka in the head," Wood said. Puka is Hawaiian for hole.  </P> <P> Last year, Peter Goadby of Australia suffered broken legs when he fell off a  cliff while taking a picture on the final day of the tournament. He is back  this year as chief judge, serving from a wheelchair.  </P> <P> With 100 bonus points each for the day's biggest fish and for a fish of more  than 500 pounds, and a 33% bonus because he was using 50-pound line, Coombs'  club earned 989 points.  </P> <P> A total of 19 marlin and five ahi, or yellowfin tuna, were caught Monday. The  yellowfin, caught by Carlos Valenzuela of Guatemala's Club Nautico, took five  hours to bring in and weighed 153 pounds.  </P> <P> Nine marlin had been boated by Tuesday afternoon but the day's final results  were not immediately available. Friday is the last day of the 85-team  tournament.  </P> <P> The California Fish and Game Commission will meet in special session today to  adopt regulations for the dove and band-tailed pigeon seasons.  </P> <P> Two anti-hunting groups, Fund for Animals and Animal Legal Defense Fund, were  successful in stopping archery hunting of bears two weeks ago and have filed  comments in opposition to the proposed migratory bird hunting regulations. They  can challenge Fish and Game's environmental document under terms of the  California Environmental Quality Act.  </P> <P> The dove hunt, popular among California hunters, would start Sept. 1 -- time  enough, both sides say, for all of the legal exercises to be performed either  to save it or sack it. But if there is a hunt, experts say, it should be a good  one.  </P> <P> David Whiteside, who runs the private Antelope Valley Sportsmen's Club, said:  "There's more doves than I've seen in seven to 10 years."  </P></p>

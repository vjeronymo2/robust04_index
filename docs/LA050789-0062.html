			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH PLANNERS WILL EXPAND EFFORTS TO SPREAD WORD ON PROJECTS  </P> <P> Under a proposal that was passed upon second reading by the City Council, the  Planning Commission will increase its efforts to advise residents of  developments proposed for their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The revisions in the commission's notification guidelines were prompted by  complaints from neighborhood activists that they sometimes do not know of  development plans until they have already won city approval.  </P> <P> When dealing with large projects -- more than 45 feet in height, more than  100,000 square feet in floor area and with a seating capacity of more than 500  people -- the commission will send notices to property owners within a 500-foot  radius of the proposed development site rather than within a 300-foot radius,  as now required.  </P> <P> For the first time, resident managers of rental properties within the proposed  area also will be notified.  </P></p>

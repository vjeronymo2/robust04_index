It seems that people can stop worrying about the possibility  that NATO would launch air strikes against positions held by the  Bosnian Serbs. Why? Why did such a dramatic change prevail in  the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina? To put it in a nutshell,  the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is improving, and there have  been a number of notable changes.    First, NATO issued its ultimatum on 9 February. After that,  the warring parties in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, displayed  a cooperative attitude and Moslems and Serbs swiftly reached a  cease-fire agreement. In the following 10 days, the two sides  abided by the agreement and Sarajevo was "at peace." From 17  February onwards, Serbian troops started the massive withdrawal  of artillery and other heavy weapons from areas around Sarajevo.  On 18 February, Karadzic, leader of the Serbs, guaranteed at a  meeting with UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi that they would  effectively place their heavy weapons deployed in within 20 km  of Sarajevo under the control of the UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR]. Although the withdrawal was blocked by heavy snow,  it was obvious that the Serbs did their utmost to fulfill the  requirements of the ultimatum. The Bosnian Moslem Army also  agreed to place its heavy weapons, at the same time, under the  control of UNPROFOR.    The reasons why the Serbs took this decision are: 1) They  are "wise enough to know when to retreat" and they bear in mind  that it is better to preserve their strength rather than be  annihilated; 2) the Serbs have no alternative because the war,  which has lasted for more than two years, has greatly undermined  their armed strength, and they also need a breathing space; and,  3), for the Serbs, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from areas  around Sarajevo will not bring about fundamental changes in the  balance of forces and they will still gain the upper hand. For  the Moslems, the greatest advantage they gain from the  withdrawal is that the siege of Sarajevo, which has lasted for  more than 20 months, can be lifted.    Second, the fact that the Bosnian Serbs have changed their  position is related to Russian mediation. On 15 February,  Russian President Yeltsin told reporters emphatically after  meeting with British Prime Minister Major that Russia could  never be ruled out of a settlement of the problem of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Over the past few days, Churkin, President  Yeltsin's special envoy, has kept mediating between the various  parties involved in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  armed forces of the Bosnian Serbs agreed to withdraw all heavy  weapons from the area around Sarajevo, given that Russia would  dispatch 800 blue helmets to Sarajevo, which was precisely the  result achieved by Churkin when advising Karadzic, the leader of  the Bosnian Serbs, to compromise. Now, people are realizing  more and more that Russia is emerging as a new force in settling  the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that Russia should be  treated with increasing respect.    Third, what should be mentioned is that after the artillery  disaster happened in Sarajevo, the United States reversed its  past "indifference" to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  explicitly supported the ultimatum initiated by France, which  indicated that differences between the United States and its  NATO allies on the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina had narrowed.  Observers held that the United States, its NATO allies, and the  United Nations, by and large, jointly adopted the policy of  "exerting pressure on all the warring parties in  Bosnia-Herzegovina to bring about change" to force the latter to  again return to the negotiating table. However, both Europe and  the United States stressed that the threat of air strikes was  absolutely not "bluff and bluster" but that they "would live up  to their word," otherwise the operational capability and  credibility of the United States, NATO, and the United States  would be doubted by the international community.    Fourth, France, Britain, and other West European countries  have, to different degrees, adjusted their original positions  and sought common ground while reserving differences with the  United States because, as proven by the past year or so, it is  difficult for the European countries to settle the crisis of  Bosnia-Herzegovina alone. Now, the West European countries have  no alternative but to acknowledge that without the active  participation of the United States and Russia, it will  ultimately be difficult to settle the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Hence, Britain and France wish to encourage  the United States and Russia to bring their respective influence  over Bosnian Moslems and Serbs into play to seek an effective  way to settle the conflict.    At this moment, there is no artillery fire in Sarajevo, and  it is obvious that reason has prevailed on all of the parties  concerned. However, NATO has not completely revoked its  ultimatum. Although there is no gunpowder smoke, the problem  still exists. Obviously, NATO is determined to maintain its  high-handed posture over all of the parties involved in the  conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to let the sword of Damocles  hang above their heads so that none dares make a reckless move.</p>

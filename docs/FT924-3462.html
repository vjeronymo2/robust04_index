			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Thinking the unthinkable  -Academics believe it may be time to shift resources from encouraging start-ups to supporting established businesses Do small firms make a significant contribution to the economy or has their role been overstated? Are we doing too much - and not, as is often claimed, too little - to help them? Such unthinkable challenges to the enterprise orthodoxy of the 1980s are now being raised with increasing insistency. Further evidence of a questioning of accepted attitudes emerged at the 15th National Small Firms Policy &amp; Research Conference held in Southampton at the end of last month. Several of the 60-plus, mainly academic, papers reflected a shift away from the idea of encouraging more start-ups and towards support for the established, if still small, firm. Should we abandon support for start-up businesses? asked David Storey, director of Warwick University's Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprise Centre. Putting public money into encouraging more start-ups was less cost-effective than helping established small firms grow faster, he argued. Much funding for start-ups was wasted because very small, new businesses were more likely to fail while only a small number would generate jobs in any number. The problem for policy-makers was to identify which would be successful. 'In short, assistance to start-up businesses is a lottery,' Storey concluded. Even if successful small businesses could be identified in advance they might not be the best means of promoting economic growth. Policy-makers had taken the mistaken view that by stimulating new businesses they would promote greater wealth and more jobs, Storey said. But while Britain experienced a far greater increase of self-employment in the 1980s than other developed countries - and created more new businesses than most of its international competitors - there was little evidence that this had any impact on total employment. Britain should shift its business support policies away from start-ups and towards growing businesses, Storey suggested. Since picking winners at the start-up stage was difficult, government policy should target businesses between three and five years old and with at least 20 employees. A similar questioning of the contribution of small businesses to the US economy was carried out by Paul Joyce and Adrian Woods of the University of North London. They looked at 40 years of data on the US economy from 1946 to 1986. In the mid-1940s businesses were being set up at the rate of 133,000 a year; by 1986 the annual rate was 700,000. But were small firms saving the US economy? the researchers asked. Business start-ups had increased at a time when the performance of the US economy was deteriorating. Corporate profits fell as a proportion of gross national product and net exports declined as a share of profits. At face value, the growing importance of small businesses did not seem to do much for the US economy's overall health, though it could be argued that things would have been worse but for the growth in new businesses, they acknowledged. Why did this happen? The two authors looked at the role of small businesses and concluded that in periods of growth, often connected with increases in the availability of consumer credit, small firms exploited new market opportunities or acted as a target for acquisitive larger companies. In a recession they provided a lifeline for unemployed executives or 'salvaged' markets and resources abandoned by large companies. But new firms created in periods of boom might then hold back economic growth over the longer term because they would be more likely to fail and come to represent a wasted capital investment, the authors suggested. One of the main UK schemes launched during the 1980s to reduce unemployment levels and boost new business starts, the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, may have contributed to a waste of resources or at least not have made the best use of resources, according to Nigel Meager from Sussex University's Institute of Manpower Services. Schemes similar to the EAS were launched in many European countries in the 1980s. Some were focused on the long-term unemployed or other disadvantaged groups while others were more general in scope. Some provided an income over a period of time while others gave participants a lump sum at the outset. The German Uberbruckungsgeld support scheme insisted that participants should be capable of generating reasonable minimum levels of income from self-employment, while the EAS in Britain appeared to accept that many participants would earn very little. This approach led to criticism of the EAS for encouraging the unemployed to enter low-margin, highly competitive sectors where they had little chance of survival or where they would make life difficult for already-established self-employed people. A study of the hairdressing and beauty sector showed that the 'displacement' effect was nearly 100 per cent. Schemes which provided an initial capital subsidy to participants were more likely to encourage people to set up in markets with higher initial barriers to entry but with better long-term prospects for earnings and survival. Participants in the British scheme tended to be concentrated in activities such as car repair, hairdressing, distribution, hotels and catering. In contrast, the French chomeurs createurs scheme, which provided an initial capital sum, led to the setting up of a much larger number of manufacturing businesses. Since responsibility for the Enterprise Allowance Scheme has been handed over to the Training and Enterprise Councils many have brought in different criteria for allocating EAS places. But more needed to be done to provide support for the 'mature' small business, according to David Smallbone of Middlesex University. Forty-five per cent of the businesses surveyed by Smallbone had made no use of external sources of help over the previous 10 years. Of the remainder very few made regular use of outside assistance. While the larger, more successful firms did make more use of outside consultants there was some evidence of a 'support gap' and of unexploited potential. Help for established businesses needed to recognise their more specialised requirements, particularly in areas such as marketing or planning, which involved far-reaching changes in the business. Smaller businesses frequently had problems implementing consultants' recommendations so consultants needed to establish a longer term relationship. Consultants must develop the skills for dealing with smaller clients, Smallbone said. Small business academics frequently complain that policy-makers ignore their findings when devising new initiatives. But the government's plan for a nationwide network of business advice centres, unveiled last week, does reflect changing priorities. The new one-stop shops will concentrate their activities on helping established small firms.</p>

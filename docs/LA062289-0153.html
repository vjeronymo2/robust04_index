			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARWASH'S BID FOR CULTURAL STATUS HASN'T GONE DOWN THE DRAIN YET  </P> <P> Some called the idea frivolous and a joke, but that didn't stop Los Angeles  city officials from refusing to scrub a proposal Wednesday to make a San  Fernando Valley carwash a city cultural monument.  </P> <P> Instead, they gave it a second chance.  </P> <P> Members of the Cultural Heritage Commission were split 2 to 1 in favor of  declaring a 1950s-style carwash at Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards as the  official "Gateway to the San Fernando Valley."  </P> <P> But because three votes are needed before cultural monument status can be  granted, the commissioners decided to postpone voting on the proposal until  after the nomination of a fourth commissioner goes before the City Council next  week.  </P> <P> Commission President Amarjit Marwah said newcomer Reynald R. Landero will be  asked to inspect the carwash site if he is approved for the panel Tuesday; the  commission will resume debate on the issue July 19.  </P> <P> "If it fails, if fails. But at least it will give us a chance," said Marwah,  who supports designating the carwash as a cultural monument.  </P> <P> The carwash, along with an adjoining gas station and coffee shop, could become  the city's 321st such monument if it wins the commission's approval. From  there, the proposal will be sent to the City Council's Recreation, Library and  Cultural Affairs subcommittee before going to the full council for its  endorsement.  </P> <P> Cultural monument status is being sought by Valley homeowners as a way of  thwarting construction of a $15-million mini-mall on the carwash's corner. Such  a designation would block demolition of the carwash, an adjoining Unocal  station and a Tiny Naylor's restaurant for one year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Ready to Start'  </P> <P> Developer Ira Smedra, who condemned the request as frivolous, said his proposed  two-story retail center has already won routine city approval. "I'm ready to  start construction tomorrow," he said.  </P> <P> Smedra said he is dismayed by the stir the carwash monument plan has caused. In  recent weeks, the proposal has attracted worldwide attention -- often being  described as the latest example of Los Angeles' wacky love affair with the  automobile.  </P> <P> "This is a terrible abuse of the system," Smedra said of the monument request,  pledging that his proposed shopping center would be larger and nicer than  mini-malls that have popped up on former gas station sites throughout Los  Angeles during the last several years.  </P> <P> But carwash supporters who jammed a small commission conference room said the  car culture is of particular importance to commuters living in the Valley's  suburbs. They said the 28-year-old carwash's three 55-foot-tall  boom-erang-shaped towers have made it a true landmark for motorists.  </P> <P> Among the crowd of 75 were Pat Galati, who has operated the gas station at the  corner since 1954, and a group of uniformed Tiny Naylor's waitresses led by  Jeri Maier. She has served hamburgers, pancakes and daily specials for the  coffee shop chain for 40 years.  </P> <P> "It may not be as grand as the St. Louis Gateway to the West, but it is our  gateway," Studio City neighborhood leader Walter McIntyre said of the carwash  boomerangs.  </P> <P> Added Jack McGrath, organizer of the save-the-carwash campaign: "In this crazy  world of Los Angeles, the carwash gives you 15 minutes to stop and smell the  roses, to watch the suds. It's a chance for dad and son to talk a little bit  while their car is going through the wash."  </P> <P> Jerry Hays, past president of the Studio City Chamber of Commerce, said his  business group has joined homeowners in opposing construction of a mini-mall on  the carwash site.  </P> <P> "In California, the women all want their faces lifted and the developers all  want to tear everything down," Hays said.  </P> <P> Smedra's position was supported by Debra Mitz, a historical researcher with an  architectural planning firm working on his shopping center project. She traced  the history of the carwash to one built in 1914 in Detroit.  </P> <P> Mitz told commissioners that the Studio City carwash was not the first one  built in Valley. And she charged that its eye-catching three-legged boomerang  tower is not unique to Studio City.  </P> <P> "Subconsciously or consciously, it was copied from this," Mitz said, unrolling  a 30-year-old blueprint for a West Covina restaurant named Thunderburger.  </P> <P> Explaining that the southeastern corner of the Valley owes more of its heritage  to the movie industry than to the car, Mitz asserted that professional  historians view the carwash landmark application as "a joke."  </P> <P> "The professional community is very disturbed by this nomination," she said.  "This would really trivialize the history of Studio City."  </P></p>

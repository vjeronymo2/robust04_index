			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Kohl aims to break Gatt impasse in Bush talks CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany will meet President George Bush today for talks which the German government hopes will help to break the logjam in the stalled Gatt negotiations on liberalisation of trade, writes Quentin Peel. The two leaders are also expected to discuss the state of the world economy and the consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union in their talks at Camp David, the president's weekend retreat. Mr Kohl is flying to the US under heavy domestic pressure to use his good offices to broker a deal on the Gatt talks between his two closest allies - the US and France. German industry this week issued a renewed warning that failure of the trade talks could tip the world economy into outright recession. At the same time he is politically committed to protect German farmers, amongsthe most heavily subsidised in the European Community, and he is extremely anxious not to be seen to isolate France, the major agricultural exporter in the Community. The government spokesman, Mr Dieter Vogel, insisted yesterday that Mr Kohl was not seeking to negotiate in Washington, and was not stepping outside the common EC negotiating position in the trade talks. These talks are bogged down in disagreement on the extent of long-term income support for European farmers and on proposed quantity restrictions on future EC farm exports. But he confirmed that the Chancellor saw the possibility of a trade-off, with the US accepting a freeze on its sales of cereal substitutes to the EC, while the Community would agree to quantity restrictions on its own exports. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the German government said it was still fighting for the interests of German farmers, while accepting that EC surplus farm production must be reduced through logical policies and price cuts. The Gatt round must ensure the basis for future farm policy, including building in income support for farmers and adequate protection from imports. 'This external protection is nevertheless not possible without a satisfactory agreement on the quantity of future subsidised EC farm exports and of so-called cereal substitutes,' Mr Vogel said. The German federation of industry (BDI), the country's main business lobby, stepped up its pressure on the Chancellor with a presentation concluding that success in the Gatt talks was critical both for the world economy and for Germany. Mr Heinrich Weiss, BDI president, said the negative effects for Germany of a failure would be greater than for any other country, with one in every three German jobs dependent on exports. 'A policy which risks failure of the Gatt negotiations because of the controversial special protection for EC agriculture would endanger both national and international well-being,' he said.</p>

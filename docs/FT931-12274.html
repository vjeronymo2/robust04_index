			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Manila leader calls for more foreign investment PRESIDENT Fidel Ramos of the Philippines has made a strong appeal for more foreign investment in his country, saying his government's openness to investors is 'wholehearted and unequivocal'. Mr Ramos, who is on a four-day state visit to Malaysia, said the Philippines was determined to create a favourable climate for investors and was already tackling some of the country's problems, such as power shortages and crime. Urging Malaysian business to pay more attention to the Philippines, the president said investment and two-way trade between the two countries was still very small. Malaysian investments represent less than 1 per cent of total foreign investment in the Philippines. Malaysia's trade with the Philippines is also under 1 per cent of its total trade. Relations between the two countries have been aggravated by a Philippines claim to the east Malaysian state of Sabah.</p>

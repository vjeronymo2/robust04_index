			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the  United States held another working-level contact in New York on  Wednesday to discuss follow-up measures to Pyongyang's  acceptance of nuclear inspections on March 1, but failed to  reach full agreement.    Diplomatic sources in Washington said that Ho Chong, deputy  chief of the North Korean Mission to the United Nations, and Tom  Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for Asian and  Pacific affairs, met somewhere other than the UN headquarters.  The sources said the two sides could not agree on an exchange  of special envoys between South and North Korea and other  problems, adding that they would meet again on Friday.    It is highly likely that they will reach an agreement by  Feb.  25 at the latest, given that the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] strongly urged North Korea to issue visas for IAEA  inspectors and that Pyongyang told Washington it would allow  inspections from March 1, according to the sources.    The sources expected that North Korea would issue the visas  as soon as an understanding was reached with the United States  on the content of their written agreement.    "I expect that the inspection team will enter North Korea on  Feb. 28," one source said.    Meanwhile, North Korea proposed to the United States at  Wednesday's bilateral contact that it would allow nuclear  inspections to ensure the continuity of nuclear safeguards from  March 1 and that the two sides should agree on taking four  simultaneous steps, a North Korean official in New York said.  Shortly after Tuesday's contact with Washington, Han Song-yol,  councilor at the North Korean Mission to the United Nations,  told YONHAP in a telephone interview that the four simultaneous  measures include joint announcement of the third round of  high-level talks by Pyongyang and Washington.    The other three are Washington's suspension of this year's  "Team Spirit," the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise,  North Korea's positive consideration of working-level contacts  with South Korea if the South makes such a proposal, and North  Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear inspections, Han said.    Han accompanied Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean  Mission to the United Nations, at the contact with U.S.  officials including Hubbard and C. Kenneth Quinones, North Korea  desk officer at the State Department.    U.S. officials have conditioned the third round of  high-level  talks on North Korea exchanging special envoys with the South,  so the contact failed to reach agreement, according to Han.    "There is no change in our position that South and North  Korea should exchange special envoys. But we oppose the U.S.  intention to make the issue a precondition for the third round  of high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington," Han said.  He added, "The U.S. side should be held responsible for the  delay in issuing visas to the inspection team, because it is  asking the unfair condition of an exchange of special envoys.  But I think the nuclear inspections will progress well after  all."</p>

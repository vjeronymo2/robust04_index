			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: MCI edges ahead of competition MCI Communications, the second-largest US long-distance telecommunications company, yesterday showed strong growth in traffic and operating earnings as it reported a 7 per cent increase in first-quarter net income after extraordinary items. The company, which is involved in a fierce marketing war with long-distance rivals AT&amp;T and Sprint, reported a 13.6 per cent increase in traffic compared with a year ago - well ahead of the industry average - and a 4.7 per cent rise from the fourth quarter. MCI said growth had come across all markets. It attributed this to new contract awards from large business customers, new products, and its strength in the consumer and small-to-medium business market, achieved with innovative offerings. Its Friends and Family plan, a discount programme in the consumer market, recently achieved 10m subscribers, but now faces additional competition from a new residential service launched by market leader AT&amp;T. MCI's net income totalled Dollars 151m, or 56 cents a share, compared with Dollars 141m, or 51 cents, in the same period of last year, while rev-enues rose 11.8 per cent to Dollars 2.81bn. The income figure included a Dollars 17m extraordinary charge for the early retirement of debt. However, at an operating level, income reached Dollars 340m, up 20 per cent on a year ago, while operating expenses totalled Dollars 2.47bn, up from Dollars 2.2bn.</p>

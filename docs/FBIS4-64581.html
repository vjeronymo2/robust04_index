			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["J. B."-initialed commentary: "Arms Deliveries to Turkish </F> War Lords"]    [Text] Bonn's decision to resume German arms deliveries to  Turkey is strange. The Turks' war against the Kurds on the  territory of the Turkish state is a fact, no matter how it is  expressed in terms of international law. The arms deliveries  onesidedly help one party to the war. Of course, this cannot be  an argument in favor of thinking about whether one should also  provide weapons to the other, the Kurdish side -- if it could  pay for them. One should not send any weapons to this region, no  matter what the borders there are like. Borders are not eternal  -- the Germans in particular have been able to experience this  gratefully, despite CSCE guarantees.    The Federal Government's spokesman noted that German weapons  are not used against the Kurds; the evaluation of the  photographs presented by German observers and Kurdish groups did  not prove that they are. The question is whether this should be  the basis on which the Federal Government can give itself a  clear conscience. If it had said that we have informed  ourselves with the necessary care and by using all means  available to us and can, therefore, rule out that the weapons  delivered by Germany are used against the Kurds, this would mean  a bit more.    It would not mean much more and would be far too little for  the decision that has been made now, however. A country like  Turkey needs more weapons than those it is using against the  Kurds. The more it gets for other tasks, the more it can send to  Kurdistan. Therefore, the German deliveries play a role in this  war against the Kurds in any case.</p>

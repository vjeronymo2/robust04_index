He said that  Libya possesses rockets capable of hitting targets in southern  France, Italy, and Spain. JANA's international affairs editor  commented on this statement. He said:    This is the second statement of its kind made by the British  defense secretary in less than a month. This confirms that the  statements of the British officials constitute part of a  psychological terrorist campaign that has been continuously  waged by western colonialist circles against the Libyan people  and its revolution. This campaign aims at distorting the image  of the Great Jamahiriyah before international public opinion, in  an attempt to prepare it to accept any irresponsible action that  could be taken or carried out against the Jamahiriyah.    This reminds us of the huge campaign of lies and distortion  that preceded the aggression against Libya half-way through the  month of al-Tayr in 1986. These allegations launched by some  western officials against the Great Jamahiriyah could only be  considered real official terrorism which is inseparable from the  unfair sanctions imposed on Libya in the name of the Security  Council by Western countries which dominate this council.    The Great Jamahiriyah has repeatedly stressed that it does  not have the capacity to own those destructive weapons, and that  it has never been interested in them or thought of possessing  them because it was mainly busy building its economy and  achieving self-sufficiency in food and water and implementing  its development plans despite those unjust coercive measures  that seek to obstruct that and deprive Libyans from building  development on their land.    History shows that we have never threatened or attacked the  Europeans in their lands because we consider them human beings  and respect them. As for those who make such statements,  history witnesses that it is they whose relations with us have  always been those of invasion, colonization, and ongoing  attempts to dominate us and control our destiny.</p>

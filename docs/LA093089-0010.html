			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SONGWRITER IRVING BERLIN DIES  </P> <P> Your editorial ("America's Music Master," Sept. 26) on the passing away of  Irving Berlin brought to mind an episode that happened while I was an American  military prisoner-of-war in Germany in February, 1945. Wounded and then  captured in the Battle of the Bulge, my spirits were very low because of a lack  of regular food and the depressing influences of the war. While walking toward  the main gate, I suddenly heard the German loudspeaker system play a wonderful  and marvelous recording of the late Bing Crosby singing Irving Berlin's "Blue  Skies."  </P> <P> When I heard the song, my low spirits picked up; I determined then and there to  overcome any obstacles and to make it through to the end. Forty-four years  later, I still marvel at Berlin's wonderful songs and in particular that one  significant song that carried me through that crisis and a safe return to this  choice and free land.  </P> <P> KENNETH LLOYD LARSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

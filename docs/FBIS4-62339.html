			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] At this moment President Boris Yeltsin of Russia is  due to fly back to Moscow from Stuttgart. His official visit to  Germany has ended. Our correspondents report on the last day of  the trip:    [Begin recording] [Kondratyev] The German mass media are  today using more complimentary than critical language about the  results of the Russian president's talks in Bonn and the  chancellor's home region. The last day of the visit, just as  the previous day, began with political discussions. Klaus  Kinkel, the German foreign minister and chairman of the FDP  [Free Democratic Party], part of the ruling coalition, arrived  for a joint luncheon with Yeltsin at Petersberg, where the guest  is staying. It is Kinkel's Foreign Ministry that will have to  implement the chancellor's promises to Yeltsin, on Russian  membership of GATT and a number of European Union organizations,  full membership of G-7, and signing of a separate protocol on  Russia's special status in NATO's Partnership for Peace.  Russia, for its part, supports the FRG's efforts to become a  permanent member of the UN Security Council.    Kinkel told us after the talks that the two sides also  discussed the role Russia and Germany could play in a Bosnian  peace settlement. Kinkel, who is taking part in the work of the  joint commission on return of art treasures, was not very happy  about Russia's inflexibility over the return of works of art  captured during World War II. Fearing charges of unpatriotic  behavior, our country is not even prepared at the moment to  honor its promise to hand over the Gotha Library, which is  chiefly of significance to Germans.    [Kondratyev, addressing Yeltsin] Boris Nikolayevich, how do  you evaluate the results of your talks with the German leaders?    [Yeltsin] All the issues that we had planned to discuss were  discussed. We have not lost out on a single question.    [Kondratyev] From Bonn Yeltsin flew to Stuttgart, which he  first visited in 1991. No doubt the warm reception that he  received then made such an impact on the president that he  decided to visit his friends in Baden-Wuerttemberg again. From  Stuttgart, Boris Yeltsin will return to Moscow. He has reason  to be satisfied with his meetings on German soil. Germany, as  was repeatedly stressed during the visit, is Russia's main  partner on the European continent. [end recording]</p>

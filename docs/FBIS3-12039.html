			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Mar (EFE) -- Representatives of the  132 countries attending the First World Telecommunications  Development Conference today closed it by approving the Buenos  Aires Action Plan, which will especially favor lesser-developed  countries.    The action plan is one of the most important issues  discussed  during the conference, which opened on 21 March in Buenos Aires.  It includes three great chapters: a cooperation program between  the most developed members of the International  Telecommunications Union (ITU), an action plan for the  Telecommunications Development Office (BDT), and a special  program for the lesser-developed countries.    The initial program contains seven clauses: politics,  strategies and financing; action and development of human  resources; development plans, network and frequency management  planning; integrated rural development; radio broadcasting;  information services; and the application of new technologies  for development.    These clauses are in the second chapter, in addition to  others which mainly refer to coordinated activities of regional  and world interest for assisting individual countries.    It is expected that they will be complemented with  multilateral and bilateral projects carried out and supported by  the BDT and its co-participants in development.    The first chapter deals with upcoming development  conferences. There will be a world conference in 1998 with at  least two regional meetings before then.    A decision was also made to create two commissions to study  the development of telecommunications.    The third chapter contains a special program for  lesser-developed countries to be financed with resources of the  ITU, which specifies that both developing and developed  countries will benefit from the programs.    The BDT action plan emphasizes the need to develop  telematics  (technology of telecommunications and informatics) and  electronic networks to support the remaining proposed programs.    It also features a program to handle the specific needs of  those countries with the lowest incomes and levels of services.    It is expected that at least 70 percent of the funds of the  ITU, a specialized UN organization, will be used to support  activities for lesser-developed countries.    The second chapter of the plan, the largest and most  specific, emphasizes a proposal to "plan frequency management  networks" and to help the development of communications  infrastructure in developed countries.    Regarding "integrated rural development," the project seeks  to extend telecommunications with remote rural communities in  developing countries to cover rural activities such as  agriculture, education, transportation, and health.    The second chapter also proposes a project for "the  development of telematics and electrical networks" connected in  the future by "electronic highways" which will allow developing  countries access to information, education, and training.</p>

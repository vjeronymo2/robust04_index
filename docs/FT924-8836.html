			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Total reinforces takeover defences TOTAL, the French state-controlled oil group, yesterday bolstered its takeover defences and warned that write-downs and restructuring would cost it FFr600m (Dollars 111.3m) this year. The news, two months after Total announced a 47 per cent fall in first-half net profits to FFr1.9bn, hit the share price, which closed last week at FFr239.50, slightly above the FFr230 at which the French state sold a FFr9.5bn stake in Total last June. This deal reduced the government's direct holding from 31.6 per cent to 5 per cent. Including other state institutions, the public sector owns 15 per cent of Total. The group, which made a FFr5.8bn net profit last year, up 41.5 per cent, warned, after a board meeting, that it was holding to a conservative view on how markets would develop in coming months, although refining margins had improved in recent weeks. Accordingly, Total had decided to revise the book value of some non-strategic assets. Total, the latest French company to reinforce its takeover defences, is to limit individual shareholders' voting rights to 10 per cent of the total, or 20 per cent for investors whose shares have acquired double voting rights. The limitation does not apply to an investor with more than two thirds of the capital. Others to have used a similar defence technique include BSN, France's leading foods group, and Alcatel Alsthom, the telecommunications-to-engineering giant, to the anxiety of the French stock exchange authorities who fear that voting restrictions could deter foreign investors. The government owns a golden share in Total, which already gives it the power to reject a hostile bid. Separately, Total announced that initial appraisals of the Peciko gas field in Indonesia showed possible reserves of 100bn cubic metres. This, plus another big recent discovery in Colombia, in which Total has a 15 per cent stake, marks a big step in the French group's strategy of increasing its reserves outside the Middle East.</p>

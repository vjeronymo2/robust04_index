The oil pressure of the  hydraulic system of the turbines failed at 1310 [1210 GMT]  today, plant manager Klaus Distler announced in Biblis. As a  result, the reactor was automatically shut down. The category N  (normal) incident was reported to the nuclear supervisory  authority in the Environment Ministry in Hesse. It was only a  technical failure and did not affect safety, he pointed out.    Distler stressed that the oil pressure normalized again  within a short period. Once the cause of the failure is  discovered, the reactor can operate again.    The Hesse Environment Ministry announced that the approval  of  the nuclear supervisory authority is required to resume Block A  operations. In addition, a report by the Rhenish-Westphalian  Electricity Plant, which is responsible for the nuclear power  plant, has been requested.    Block A started operating on a trial basis at 0430 this  morning. The precondition was approval by Hesse's Environment  Minister Joschka Fischer (Alliance 90/Greens) and by Federal  Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer (Christian Democratic Union).    Biblis A was shut down last December because of the annual  revision. After a fire on 4 March, Fischer first banned a  startup, but had to accept the decision by his Bonn counterpart,  who favored a startup after a clarification of the cause of the  fire.</p>

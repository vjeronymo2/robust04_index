			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Venezuelan currency value down sharply The value of the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, fell sharply after the introduction of a new procedure for sales of foreign exchange by the central bank. The new system narrowed the gap that had developed between the official value of the currency and that on the parallel market. Many bankers and economists said they believed the central bank had taken a step in the right direction by abandoning the system of rationing sales of dollars to banks and exchange houses. It could help to stabilise Venezuela's jittery foreign exchange market. A growing gap had emerged this month between the official rate set by the previous auction system and the rate on the parallel market. The central bank abandoned the limited auction system on Monday and dealers started operating a 'Dutch auction' system, under which the central bank sells foreign exchange to banks and exchange houses offering the highest bids of the day. The new procedure sets no limits on resale margins and is more responsive to market demands. Yesterday, the central bank sold dollars to the banking system at rates ranging from 169 to 182, for an average of 172.91 per dollar. On Tuesday, Venezuelan commercial banks sold US dollars to corporate clients and the public at rates varying from 165 to 185 bolivars to the dollar, after purchasing dollars from the central bank at a maximum rate of 165 to the dollar. The average price at 29 commercial banks for buying dollars on Tuesday was 175.88:1, a 21 per cent devaluation in comparison to the previous day's official dollar price, but a 4.4 per cent devaluation against Monday's price on the parallel market. In all of 1993, the bolivar lost 25 per cent of its value against the dollar. The central bank did not release any figures on the amounts of dollars sold on Tuesday, but these were clearly higher than under the previous system, which probably averaged about Dollars 35-40m per day, bankers estimated. Mr Edgar Romero Nava, president of Fedecamaras, Venezuela's largest commercial and industrial association, praised the central bank's new procedure as 'more transparent' than its predecessor, but warned that it will not work in isolation. He said the government of President Rafael Caldera should also implement 'macroeconomic stabilisation measures' such as a sound fiscal policy, privatisation of state-owned companies and a reform in the present system of employee severance benefits, as well as improving purchasing power for the public.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Rescue fund plan for travel customers THE CREATION of a rescue fund for package tour passengers unprotected by existing schemes was proposed yesterday by the government. Plans are also under discussion by government and industry officials to merge all such schemes into a central fund under a single authority. The proposed fund for unprotected passengers, to be financed by a levy on customers and guaranteed by operators' bonds up to an estimated Pounds 150m, would be used to repatriate holidaymakers stranded overseas by insolvent tour operators. The move is designed to satisfy a European Community directive, due to be implemented by the end of the year, which will require all types of package tour customers to be protected from fraudulent or bankrupt operators. The levy - probably around 1 per cent of a package holiday price - would be raised from those travellers, such as ferry, coach and air charter passengers, not covered under existing industry arrangements. The latest proposals come at a difficult time for the travel package industry, with the Association of British Travel Agents recently admitting that its passenger rescue fund would be exhausted if another holiday group collapsed. A price war in the industry is also putting operator margins under severe pressure. At present, protection is only given to customers of companies which are members of travel industry trade associations, such as Abta. Members of this Pounds 400m fund guarantee around 10 per cent of their turnover in the form of a bond. Some 90 per cent of the 11m overseas package holidays sold annually in the UK are covered by such schemes. Yesterday's proposals would create a parallel scheme extending coverage to all forms of organised package travel. These would include both domestic and foreign holidays, as well as some business trips and social club outings. Abta said yesterday: 'This is an important step forward in consumer protection.' The idea of a new fund and levy came from the five travel and holiday trade associations which dismissed original government proposals as too expensive. As part of its plans to create an eventual central fund, the government has proposed that tour companies wishing to join existing schemes will have to pay a bond of 25 per cent of its turnover. However, if the companies join the new scheme, they will only have to lodge the bond valued at 10 per cent of turnover. The new fund would be administered by trustees appointed by the five industry associations - Abta, the Tour Operators Study Group, the Association of Independent Tour Operators, the Passenger Shipping Association and the Bus and Coach Council - with the DTI acting as regulator. Draft regulations are expected shortly, with parliamentary approval in the autumn ready for the arrangements to be in place by the end of the year.</p>

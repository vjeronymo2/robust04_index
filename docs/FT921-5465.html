			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Withdrawal of Imferon pulls Fisons down 17% FISONS, the pharmaceutical and scientific instruments company, said yesterday that it could abandon its attempt to reinstate a drug banned by US regulatory authorities into the US market. Imferon, an anaemia treatment, was taken off the US market in January 1991 because of production problems. Its absence contributed to a 17 per cent drop to Pounds 190.5m (Pounds 230.2m) in full-year pre-tax profits. Mr Patrick Egan, chairman, said it would cost Pounds 25m to Pounds 30m to modernise Imferon production to meet standards set by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Fisons estimated that profits from US sales of the drug would have been Pounds 15m in 1991. The company said it was considering whether or not to make the requested improvements to its plant in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire. This possibility could put pressure on the FDA to moderate its demands. There is no effective alternative to Imferon in some therapies, said Fisons. The absence from US and Japanese markets of Imferon and another drug banned by the FDA, hay fever treatment Opticrom, last year cost the company Pounds 65m in lost earnings and increased spending on production facilities. 'Last year was a difficult one for Fisons', said Mr Egan. The group, nevertheless, is increasing the dividend for the year to 8.7p (7.5p) with a final of 5.4p. Mr Egan said: 'We are confident as we enter 1992 that most of our difficulties now lie behind us.' He confirmed that an inspection by the FDA of production facilities for both Opticrom and Imferon would probably be delayed until April, instead of March as previously expected. Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 1.22bn (Pounds 1.16bn) thanks to a strong performance from the scientific instruments division. Earnings per share fell to 20.8p (26.3p). Capital spending, partly to comply with FDA rules, pushed capital employed for the year up to Pounds 686m (Pounds 614m). Return on capital employed fell from 37.3 per cent to 29.3 per cent, the lowest for more than three years. Fisons signalled a change of management style giving sales figures for each of its best selling drugs for the first time. Asthma drug Intal, easily the best seller despite its 20 years on the market, turned over Pounds 170m at wholesale prices, 10 per cent higher than in 1990. Its replacement, Tilade, brought in Pounds 20m, an improvement of 45 per cent on 1990. Tilade is still awaiting approval for the US market. Rynacrom and Opticrom, both used for hay-fever, generated sales of Pounds 55m and Pounds 45m respectively. See Lex</p>

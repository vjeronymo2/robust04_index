			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER VIEWS OF THE 'WIRED' ODYSSEY  </P> <P> Re the April 13 story on "Wired," by Nina J. Easton and Jack Mathews:  </P> <P> Only a bumpkin who just fell off the turnip truck would be surprised to learn  that many Hollywood big shots are liars and hypocrites. The fact is, it's  perfectly OK to blaspheme Jesus Christ, Mohammed or God Almighty in this burg;  this ruffles no feathers and might even win you an award or two. But John  Belushi -- hey, that's a different story, and the makers of "Wired" surely knew  as much.  </P> <P> They were probably counting on the adverse publicity to boost "wanna see" for  that crucial opening weekend, before word-of-mouth on the picture's actual  quality had time to spread.  </P> <P> Every press agent since the invention of ink has known there's no such thing as  bad publicity.  </P> <P> T. K. McMAHON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

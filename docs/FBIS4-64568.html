			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Federal Government today  confirmed its support for the Baltic states in their attempts to  achieve a closer relationship with the European Union [EU], and  stressed those countries' function as a bridge between East and  West Europe. In talks with Lithuanian Premier Adolfas  Slezevicius, who arrived in Bonn today on a visit, Federal  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel stressed that Germany sees itself  as the advocate of Lithuania and the other two Baltic states in  their efforts to find a way into the European and transatlantic  structures. It is also in the Federal Republic's interests to  introduce Lithuania as quickly as possible to the EU, the WEU  [Western European Union], and NATO, Kinkel said. The foreign  minister stressed that developing the Baltic states' relations  with the EU will be an important element of the German  presidency of the EU, beginning in July.    In a separate meeting with the Lithuanian premier, Economics  Minister Guenter Rexrodt referred to the Baltic states' bridging  role between West and East Europe, and described the  negotiations on a free trade agreement between Lithuania and the  EU, with the prosepct of association and entry, as "an important  step." In his talk with the premier and Industry and Trade  Minister Karzimieras Klimasauskas, Rexrodt also underscored  Lithuania's successful efforts in tackling the process of  political and economic transformation. The Lithuanian side  praised Germany's support in the negotiations with the EU and  the advice given to the government in Vilnius on developing a  market economy.    Apart from the "good state of bilateral relations," a  "generally gratifying" development of trade between the two  states, with a volume of around 820 million German marks was  noted. Germany is Lithuania's most important trading partner  with a 17 percent share of Lithuania's foreign trade. There are  already around 500 joint ventures, especially in the textiles  industry, agriculture, and engineering.</p>

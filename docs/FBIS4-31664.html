			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "bog, jam": "Deputies Approved Amendment to </F> Referendum Law"]    [Excerpt] Bratislava--[passage omitted] After the lunch  break [at the 8 June meeting of the National Council of the  Slovak Republic], parliamentary deputies approved with comments  the Statutes of the National Property Fund [FNM] of the Slovak  Republic, which define the powers of the FNM Presidium and the  FNM Supervisory Board. The approval of new FNM statutes was  necessary because the amendment to the law on large-scale  privatization from the beginning of this year substantially  changes the FNM's legal status. At the same time, the deputies  approved an amendment to the law on bankruptcy and settlement,  under which the FNM's property is excluded from the law's  jurisdiction.    In a secret ballot, the deputies then elected the ninth and  last member of the FNM Presidium. It is Emil Hubinak, who had  been nominated by the Democratic Union. Blazej Krasnovsky,  candidate of the Christian Democratic Movement, was elected  chairman of the FNM Supervisory Board, and Gregor Danisovic  (candidate of the Party of the Democratic Left) and Jan Lukacik  (candidate of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) were  elected out of 11 candidates as members of the FNM Supervisory  Board.</p>

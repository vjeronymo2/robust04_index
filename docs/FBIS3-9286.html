This  was announced by Ivo Komsic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency and president of the Croat National Council of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bosiljka Bucan reports from the news  conference at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Embassy in Zagreb.    [Bucan] Unlike other agreements on the resolution of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, the Washington agreement's clauses  are precisely defined. They are, according to Ivo Komsic:    [Komsic] "At midnight on Monday Bosnia-Herzegovina will have  its new constitution and will begin to live according to the new  constitution. According to the new constitution elections  should be held in six months. Until then the assembly will be a  constituent assembly and will pass only one law -- the election  law."    [Bucan] The Washington agreement is the basis for the  resolution of the entire crisis. The Serb aggressor side can  reject or accept the agreement. If they accept, they would have  to do the following:    [Komsic] "They must give up the objectives of their  aggression and must try to recreate the prewar situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which will be a very difficult and long  process."    [Bucan] The agreement introduces a new dimension in the  resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. The military  option was not considered and we hope for a political resolution  of the problem.</p>

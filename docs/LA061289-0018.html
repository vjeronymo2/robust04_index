			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEACE BID VIEWED AS INSINCERE, EGYPTIAN REPORTEDLY TELLS ISRAEL  </P> <P> A visiting senior Egyptian official told Israel on Sunday that Arab states and  the PLO view Israel's peace initiative as insincere, Israeli sources said.  </P> <P> The two-day visit by Butros Butros Ghali, deputy foreign minister, was the  first to Israel by a high-ranking Egyptian since the Palestinian uprising  erupted in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 18 months ago.  </P> <P> Sources at his meeting with Israeli Vice Prime Minister Shimon Peres quoted  Butros Ghali as saying: "The feeling is widespread in the Arab world that the  initiative is not serious and aimed merely at gaining time."  </P> <P> The Israeli peace initiative, endorsed by the government but criticized by  hard-liners in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's rightist Likud Party, calls for  Palestinians in the occupied areas to elect negotiators for peace talks with  Israel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Progress With Arafat  </P> <P> "In the past 12 months, we have made not inconsiderable achievements with  (Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser) Arafat. Now it is up to  Israel to make its move," the sources quoted Butros Ghali as saying.  </P> <P> The army lifted a weeklong curfew from most areas of the Gaza Strip just hours  before Butros Ghali arrived. An Arab youth shot by troops during protests in  the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp died of his wounds Sunday.  </P> <P> Butros Ghali told Peres that Israel will have to provide more details of the  proposed Palestinian elections to attract an Arab partner, the sources said.  </P> <P> The Egyptian said Shamir's hard-line statements that he would not allow  international supervision of the vote, or the participation of East Jerusalem  Arabs, does not inspire confidence among Arabs that Israel is sincere.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Commitment to Peace  </P> <P> Israeli commentators said Butros Ghali's visit underlines Cairo's commitment to  peace with Israel, just two weeks after Egypt was readmitted to the Arab League  following a 10-year suspension over its 1979 treaty with the Jewish state.  </P> <P> Egyptian diplomats said Butros Ghali will try to persuade Israeli leaders that  last month's Arab summit in Casablanca adopted moderate resolutions on the  Arab-Israeli conflict that offer a basis for a comprehensive peace.  </P></p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Bonds: Sterling demand fuels interest in EIB offering STRONG demand for sterling securities continued to feed through into the Eurosterling bond market, fuelling interest in the European Investment Bank's Pounds 200m 10-year offering, arranged by Salomon Brothers. The 9 per cent bonds were considered aggressively priced to yield just 9 basis points above the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002. With little 10-year paper for sovereign or supranational borrowers outstanding in the 10-year sector, the lead manager said the pricing was based on perceived demand rather than secondary market levels. The deal sold out swiftly, boosted by strong interest from German investors, who are refocusing on the sterling market due to the uncertainty afflicting their domestic market. Some German mutual funds prefer Eurobonds to gilts for tax reasons. Italian investors, for whom the EIB is exempt from withholding tax, were also active buyers. Some international bond fund managers, however, found the 9 basis point spread insufficient compensation for the loss of liquidity, compared with the gilts market. When Eurobond yields are so close to gilts, spread players are less likely to participate, since there is, at least in theory, less scope for spreads to tighten. However, the EIB deal had tightened to six basis points by yesterday's close, against a flat gilts market. Also in the sterling market, the UK subsidiary of General Motors Acceptance Corporation launched a Pounds 75m issue due December 1995, via Baring Brothers. Neither the GMAC nor the EIB deal (which used a deferred rate setting structure) were swapped. Tight swap spreads in the sterling sector continue to deter borrowers without a need for fixed-rate sterling. 'A lot of UK companies are looking at the market, but those who want floating-rate funds are not meeting their targets, and those who are keen to lock in fixed-rate funds are waiting for rates to fall further,' said one banker. However, there is also concern among some UK companies not to miss the wave of demand which offers a welcome opportunity to diversify from bank funding. In the dollar sector, Hydro-Quebec launched a Dollars 500m 10-year deal, via Credit Suisse First Boston, priced to yield 85 basis points above the 10-year Treasury. Traders said the deal could have been brought at a tighter spread in the US.</p>

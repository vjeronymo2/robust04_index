			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks with visiting U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher on issues related to  Sino-U.S. relations at the Diaoyutai state guesthouse here this  morning.    The talks proceeded in a "candid and business-like"  atmosphere, sources from the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.    In the talks, Qian noted that the meeting between Chinese  President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Seattle  last November marked a new phase of development in bilateral  relations.    Since then, a momentum for improving bilateral ties has  emerged, with contacts increasing and cooperation expanding.    Over a month ago, Qian recalled, he and Christopher met in  Paris and discussed every aspect of the bilateral ties, with  both sides expressing the wish for improving bilateral relations  with joint efforts.    "We hope that your current visit would achieve positive  results," Qian told Christopher.    However, "we are deeply disappointed at things which have  happened prior to the visit of the secretary of state," Qian  said.    A top U.S. Government official came to prepare for  Christopher's visit, and in disregard of Chinese laws, the  official took actions interfering in China's internal affairs,  he said.    Following that, the U.S. media made a fanfare of the event  and U.S. Government officials time and again attacked China.    All those acts clearly go against President Clinton's  statement in Seattle that the U.S. supports a strong, stable,  and prosperous China, Qian said, adding that it also constitutes  a harrassment to the current visit by the secretary of state.    Qian stressed that dialogue needs a good atmosphere and  sincerity from both sides.    "I hope to conduct dialogue with the secretay of state on  the  basis of candidness and mutual respect" so as to enhance mutual  understanding, reduce troubles, avoid confrontation and make the  dialogue conducive to the improvement of the Sino-U.S. relations  and to the success of Christopher's visit, Qian said.    Christopher elaborated to the Chinese side issues of U.S.  concern.    Qian responded that China is a country ruled by law. "We can  only do what Chinese laws allow us to do," Qian said.    Qian also elaborated what the Chinese side is concerned  about, such as U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and the sanctions it  has posed against China.    On Sino-U.S. cooperation in the fight against drug  trafficking, Qian noted that the two sides have signed a  memorandum on jointly fighting against drug trafficking.    He said that in January 1990, a U.S. court, in disregard of  China's judicial sovereignty, granted political asylum to Wang  Zongxiao, a criminal of the goldfish case, who had gone to the  U.S. for the purpose of testifying.    This has imposed an obstruction to Sino-U.S. cooperation  against drug trafficking, Qian said.    Discussing the most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status,  Qian  pointed out that MFN is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial  arrangement reached according to the bilateral trade agreement.  It is the basis of normal Sino-U.S. trade relations and the  disruption of it would ruin the prospects of Sino-U.S. trade  relations, Qian said.    "This would bring harm to both China and the United States,"  Qian noted.    He reiterated, "The Chinese side is firmly opposed to any  linkage between trade and issues that have nothing to do with  trade."    Christopher said that both the United States and China are  countries that bear global responsibilities.    Both sides share common interests in maintaining peace and  security and have identical or similar views concerning many  regional and international issues, he said.    He said the mutually beneficial trade relations are  expanding, which is contributing to the prosperity of both  countries.    Christopher reiterated that a strong, stable and prosperous  China conforms to the interests of the United States.    President Clinton hopes that more constructive relations  would be developed between the U.S. and China, Christopher told  Qian.    Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei and Deputy Chief  of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xu  Huizi attended the talks.    On the U.S. side are Ambassador Stapleton Roy,  Undersecretary  of State for International Security Affairs Lynn Davis and  Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner participated in the  130-minute talks.    Following the talks, Qian hosted a luncheon in honor of the  U.S. visitors.</p>

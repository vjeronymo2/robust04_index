			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Dedicated follower of fashion: The trend away from full-time employment paints a misleading picture Sock Shop's decision to move most of its staff from full-time to part-time contracts is part of an increasing trend in both the retail sector and the economy as a whole. It is also contributing to the rather misleading impression of buoyancy in the jobs market. The net effect of Sock Shop replacing full-time staff with part-time staff will be to increase the number of jobs in the economy, but the number of hours worked will be static and might even fall. Exactly the same effect was produced a year ago when Burton Group shed 2,000 full-time jobs and replaced them with about 3,000 part-time positions. Other big retailers, such as BHS and the Allied Maples Group, have taken similar steps and about a third of all retail staff are now estimated to be part-timers. Campaigners complain that this shift allows the government to claim that new jobs are being created when in fact, adjusting for the increase in part-time work, there is no net job creation at all. Mr Paul Convery of the Unemployment Unit said: 'All that is happening is that full-time jobs are being repackaged as less secure part-time jobs which is actually bad for the economy as a whole in terms of consumer confidence.' The figures do lend some support to this argument. According to the Labour Force Survey - the most authoritative source on employment trends - there was an overall increase of 67,000 in the number of people in work between winter 1992-93 and summer 1993, from 21.18m to 21.25m. But over the same period the number of full-time jobs fell by 38,000 and the number of part-time jobs grew by 105,000. Adjusting for the move to part-time working, the number of new 'full-time equivalent' jobs was only just more than 3,000 - not 67,000. And over the same period the average weekly hours worked fell from 36.4 to 36.3. There are several incentives for employers to switch employees to part-time working. It can create genuine increases in flexibility allowing more staff in shops, for example, at busy times and fewer when they are not needed. It can also be popular with some employees. However, cost-saving is the crucial factor for most companies. Any employee who works less than 15 hours per week, or earns less than Pounds 56, does not have to be covered for National Insurance. As soon as that threshold is reached, then National Insurance has to be paid on all the hours worked. Any employee who works less than 16 hours per week does not qualify for employment protection or for any statutory benefits such as redundancy pay and maternity benefit. For these reasons the trend towards switching from full-time to part-time work is likely to continue, and with it the statistical impression that all is well in the labour market.</p>

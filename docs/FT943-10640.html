			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Expelled Kurdish MPs on trial Six former Kurdish deputies ousted from Turkey's parliament for supporting Kurdish separatism went on trial yesterday on charges of treason. Mr Hatip Dicle, the chairman of the now banned pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DP), Mr Ahmet Turk, Mr Orhan Dogan, Mr Sirri Sakik, Mr Mahmut Alinak and Ms Leyla Zana, have been in jail since March. The indictment was supported with video cassettes showing the former deputies at rallies organised by the Kurdish guerrilla organisation, the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), and tapes of telephone conversations with the PKK's fugitive leader Mr Abdullah Ocalan. A Turkish military spokesman said Turkish aircraft have struck rebel Kurdish targets in northern Iraq twice since Sunday, killing at least 150 guerrillas.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Yu Cheng (6735 2052)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 6 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Recently,  there have been some comments in Hong Kong society asserting  that PRC-invested enterprises in the territory speculate in real  estate, giving an impression to people that PRC-invested  enterprises are to blame for soaring real estate prices.  Obviously, this is not true, because in Hong Kong all kinds of  capital is assigned to the real estate market, and capital from  PRC-invested enterprises only accounts for a limited percentage  of the Hong Kong real estate market as a whole. Quite a number  of PRC-invested enterprises in Hong Kong have a real need for  real estate, and only a small number of them are speculating.    Over the last few years, PRC-invested enterprises in Hong  Kong have been active in developing their business; they have a  strong need for all types of buildings for use as offices and  production sites. This situation is similar to that of other  financial organizations. But PRC-invested enterprises'  activities in the Hong Kong real estate market have aroused  particular concern because of their sensitive background. Apart  from this, their rapid development has also caused such concerns.    According to recent statistics published by the Hong Kong  Government, PRC-invested enterprises play quite an important  role in Hong Kong's economy. Take banking as an example. There  are 15 PRC-capitalized licensed banks in Hong Kong, including 13  licensed banks affiliated to the Bank of China Group, and Ka Wah  Bank and Union Bank, which belong respectively to the China  International Trust and Investment Corporation and the China  Merchants Steam Navigation Company Limited. PRC-capitalized  banks have actively developed their retail business and expanded  their branches, hence the need to buy real estate.    In manufacturing industry, industrial projects with mainland  investments amounted to 39 at the end of 1992, and total  investment stood at HK$4.133 billion [Hong Kong dollars]  calculated by original cost, the third largest source of  industrial investment after Japan and the United States.  Calculated on the basis of original costs, the total value of  their total fixed assets amounts to HK$2.9 billion. This, of  course, includes the value of factory buildings.    A survey by the Hong Kong Department of Industry in 1993 on  regional representative offices set up in Hong Kong by foreign  firms suggested that PRC-invested enterprises had established 67  regional headquarters in Hong Kong and were working hard to  catch up with U.S., Japanese, and British financial groups.    Thus, it can be seen that PRC-invested enterprises have a  strong need to buy all types of buildings.    However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a small  number of PRC-invested enterprises speculate in Hong Kong's real  estate market, but this problem is not serious and has received  proper attention from the relevant Chinese department. Some  comments in society have attributed the cause of real estate  price hikes entirely to speculation, overlooking the basic  factor of supply falling short of demand. These comments have  even blamed PRC-invested enterprises for soaring real estate  prices. Evidently, this is irrational and unfair, because other  financial groups are also speculating in the real estate market.    Real estate prices and rents have kept rising in recent  years. Unquestionably, this has much to do with real estate  speculation, but in a free market economy, all commodity prices  are determined by the balance between supply and demand. The  Hong Kong Government bears a major responsibility for the real  estate price rises of recent years, because it does not have a  strategy and the supply of land is imbalanced. It takes more  than one cold day for a river to freeze three feet deep. In  curbing real estate speculation, the Hong Kong Government should  not just introduce several short-term measures, as these cannot  resolve the problems. Overly rigorous short-term measures could  lead the economy into a predicament.</p>

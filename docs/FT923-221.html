			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Arbed hit by lower metal prices ARBED, the Luxembourg steelmaker, yesterday announced a drastic reduction in net profits for the first half of this year. The group recorded a profit of only LFr364m (Dollars 12.1m), compared with LFr3.2bn in the first half of 1991, and warned there was no sign of an upturn in the global or European economy. Arbed blamed lower metal prices and the worldwide recession and pledged to carry out further restructuring, including cuts in production costs, to limit the damage for the full year. According to Arbed, steel prices are now as low as they were in 1987, the lowest point of the last downward cycle to hit the industry. 'The lack of industrial dynamism has been aggravated by increasingly restrictive monetary and fiscal policy in a number of countries, especially in the area of interest rates,' said the company. Turnover in the first half of the year dropped from LFr105bn to LFr98bn, and the company said it only broke even because steelmaking losses were offset by non-steel activities, such as cement. Arbed, Luxembourg's largest industrial employer, said it had been particularly hit by the weakness of the dollar and losses in the US and Asian markets, as well as heavy competition from east European manufacturers. The removal of EC steel quotas on imports from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary has taken its toll on all EC steel producers, some of which have pressed for a reimposition of limits. Arbed recorded net profits of LFr6bn in the whole of 1991.</p>

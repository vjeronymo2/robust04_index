			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (3): A shock to the system - Bureaucrats receive strong medicine of economic reform RAPID privatisation and deregulation are the central elements of Pakistan's economic reform programme. Pakistan may have an advantage over countries undertaking similar changes in that the public sector mentality has been in the ascendant for only 20 years, since Zulfikar Ali Bhutto nationalised big industry and banks in 1972. A dynamic private sector provides a good base for reform. Upon independence and partition in 1947, Pakistan embarked on an industrial policy under which the private sector was to take the lead in building a manufacturing base. The next two decades saw rapid growth in industry, so that it still accounts for a higher proportion of the economy than might be expected in a country of its income level. A robust private sector developed. Mr Sartaj Aziz, finance minister, says Mr Bhutto's subsequent shift in direction resulted in 'bureaucratic socialism', with overstaffing, politically controlled prices, and absence of the dynamism which comes from private sector risk-taking. The classic result was loss-making public sector enterprises, over-regulation, low investment and run-down infrastructure, a low savings rate, a growth rate financed by excessive borrowing, and a chronic budget deficit. The economy was heavily protected by high tariffs and import restrictions. The present thrust is to re-focus the government into providing the basis for growth, through investment in physical and social infrastructure, while rapidly shrinking its role in production and services. At the same time, it is attempting to remove many bureaucratic shackles on the private sector, to promote exports and foreign investment and remove barriers to the outside world. The bureaucrats, accustomed to decisions being subjected to interminable committees and reports, can scarcely have known what hit them as the privatisation programme got under way last year. Mr Saeed Qadir, a former general and minister under Gen Zia ul-Haq, was appointed to head a Privatisation Commission within weeks of Mr Sharif's election as prime minister. The new body, with only a handful of senior civil servants, began the process with the help of a report commissioned from a merchant bank by the previous government. A deal was struck with labour unions, providing 'golden handshakes' for redundant employees of privatised companies after a year's guaranteed employment. Soon, public sector units scheduled for privatisation were touting themselves in marquees set up outside the commission's office in Islamabad. It is responsible for selling the 115 units which were run by the ministries of industry and production, though not for utilities which are also being opened up to private ownership. So far, 55 units have been sold by public auction for Rs10bn, with an additional Rs4bn of liabilities transferred. Of the 40 sold units whose transfers have actually been completed, a minority were profit-making. Companies being sold cover a broad spectrum, from tractors and textiles to cement and ghee, vegetable oil used in cooking. Some companies have been sold to their employees. The government rejects allegations of corruption in the sales. 'There is no concentration of wealth, no cartelisation, and no preference being given to any party,' says Mr Qadir. In response to such suggestions about the early sales, the commission has opened bidding sessions to the press. Two banks, Muslim Commercial Bank and Allied Bank, have been privatised, and United Bank and Habib Bank are to follow. In addition, new private banks have been permitted and nine have opened. Private housing finance companies have been allowed. Interest rates have been partially deregulated with the introduction of government debt auctions, replacing the requirements for banks to lend to the government at a fixed 6 per cent rate. Public sector monopolies are being dismantled in energy, telecommunications, airlines, shipping, road construction and ports. Of deregulation measures, the most significant is the removal of the need for the private sector to seek government approval for new investments. This has greatly reduced the drawbacks to industrial investment. Industry has also been boosted by cuts in customs duties on imported plant and machinery, tax holidays for new manufacturing units, and lifting of other restrictions on growth. Among measures to promote exports, a public sector monopoly over cotton and rice exports has been abolished and textile export quotas have been opened up for sale. The government has reduced the maximum import duty (excepting some luxury goods) from 125 per cent to 90 per cent (though surcharges remain), eliminated licensing requirements for permitted imports, reduced the list of banned imports, and liberalised procedures for importing machinery. This has been accompanied by the removal of most foreign exchange controls, though the rupee is not yet convertible. Pakistanis may now open foreign currency accounts in Pakistan and trade dollar-denominated bearer certificates. The regulatory incentive for residents to spirit money out of the country, and to keep it out, has been virtually eliminated. Restrictions on foreign investors have also been removed. In most sectors, they are able to operate on a par with residents. They may own 100 per cent of equity and, in most cases, remit dividends and sale proceeds. (Foreign investment is discussed on the facing page). Some of these reforms are taking time to work through the system. For example, imports which are supposedly liberalised still encounter bureaucratic obstacles. The immediate scope for deep cuts in import duties is severely limited by the government's budgetary problems, with customs and excise duties accounting for the bulk of federal tax revenue. The government's unwillingness to address tariff reform more wholeheartedly has disappointed donor officials. But the very speed of reform in other fields has aroused some concern. Mr Shahid Javed Burki, a Pakistani who heads the World Bank's China desk, warned in a recent lecture that 'privatisation without attention to the creation of a regulatory framework within which the private sector must be obliged to work could create a very unhappy situation'. Without such laws and institutions to ensure that they are observed, Mr Burki said, 'it is inviting the kind of response from the people that produced the impulse to put the public sector on the commanding heights of the economy in the first place'.</p>

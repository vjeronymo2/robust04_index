			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Robt Jones ordered to pay damages New Zealand's court of appeal yesterday ordered Robt Jones Pacific, a subsidiary of Tasman Properties, to pay NZDollars 73m (USDollars 40.5m) damages to McConnell Dowell for withdrawing from a contract in 1990 to buy New Zealand's tallest building. The decision reverses a high court ruling that Robt Jones Pacific did not need to pay damages. The damages are believed to be the highest in New Zealand history. McConnell Dowell said it would seek up to NZDollars 23m in costs.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zairean cobalt output forecast to drop COBALT PRODUCTION in Zaire, the world's largest producer, is likely to drop substantially this year, forcing the cash-hungry government to increase prices again, suggests the Wogen Resources minor metals organisation in a note to clients. Zaire and Zambia between them supply about 70 per cent of the world's cobalt, an essential metal for some of the superalloys used by the aerospace industry and for some motor industry products. The two countries recently lifted their producer prices from Dollars 11 to Dollars 25 a lb, responding to a rise in European free market prices which doubled to Dollars 30 last year. Mr Nick French, a Wogen director, points out that the Dollars 25 a lb price is valid for only a few months. 'Indications are that fresh shipments of cobalt cathodes from Zaire reaching the market before April will be almost zero,' he adds. 'Given the high priority for cash in the bankrupt economies of both Zambia and Zaire, with the new President in the former committed to reviving the economy and that of the latter depending on an economic turnround for survival, both will require maximum revenue from cobalt. Thus all pressure will be for a further hike in prices.' He says last year's cobalt price rise resulted from shortfalls in African production for some years. Gecamines, Zaire's state-owned producer, aimed to produce 13,000 tonnes last year but admits it achieved 10,000 tonnes at best. For 1992 various sources have suggested Zaire's output would fall to 6,000 to 7,000 tonnes while one thought that '3,000 to 4,000 tonnes might be more realistic'. Mr French suggests Gecamines is suffering from a 'cash problem, not a political problem', in that it needs more than Dollars 100m to update its operations. He warns: 'Volatility and high prices will be the main characteristic of the cobalt market in 1992'.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN WHO KILLED BABY SENTENCED TO 16 YEARS  </P> <P> A North Hollywood man who struck and killed a 2-year-old boy suffering from  Down's syndrome was sentenced Friday to 16 years in prison.  </P> <P> Anthony Michael Malone pleaded guilty last month to voluntary manslaughter  after prosecutors agreed to drop a murder charge against him.  </P> <P> He received the maximum sentence for manslaughter -- 11 years -- plus five  years for a prior burglary conviction, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffrey S.  Gootman.  </P> <P> The baby, Jonathan Moreno, died July 27, 1988, after he was struck by Malone,  police said. The child was the son of Malone's 19-year-old girlfriend, Theresa  Givens, who was at work when the child died.  </P> <P> Gootman said prosecutors dropped the murder charge because they could not prove  that Malone intended to kill the boy.  </P></p>

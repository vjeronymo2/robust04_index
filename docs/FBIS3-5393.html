			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the Japan Trade Union  Confederation [Rengo], has begun to take a softer stance on the  issue of raising the consumption tax. It is widely believed the  labor leader has embarked on creating a political environment  that is favorable to his plan to appeal to the need to  re-examine the ratio of direct to indirect taxes and approve a  consumption tax hike. At the same time, Yamagishi apparently  hopes to be in control of the regrouping of political parties  which is expected to occur soon. To do this, Yamagishi plans to  guide the ruling coalition parties in their discussions toward  resolving the tax system reform issue by year's end and to  reinforce the influence of the Social Democratic Party of Japan  within the ruling coalition alliance by urging the party, which  has a strong "consumption tax allergy," to shift its policy in  line with a more realistic approach.    In a lecture at the Japan National Press Club on 24  February,  Yamagishi said: "In the process of tax system reform, it will  inevitably be necessary to re-examine the traditional ratio of  direct to indirect taxes. The ratio of indirect taxes must be  increased. Should a source of revenue become necessary, even  after the government has reformed the tax system and cut back on  its spending, then it will inevitably become necessary to raise  the (consumption) tax rate." He thus indicated that he plans to  approve consumption tax hikes in the future.    Yamagishi has been noted to make such remarks occasionally.  He plans to propose as early as in April a Rengo-version of the  tax reform and social welfare vision which will embrace his new  stance.</p>

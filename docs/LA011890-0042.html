			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COLLECTIBLES: 'RED SEAL' WAS A MARK OF QUALITY IN RECORDS  </P> <P> Question: I have some Victor Red Seal records that have been in the family for  years. How far back does the label go? -- T.S.  </P> <P> Answer: Eldridge Johnson, a name somewhat obscure in the history of  music-related inventions, founded the Victor Record Co. shortly after the turn  of the century. As it turned out, the firm became the predecessor of RCA  Victor.  </P> <P> More than two decades later, Johnson was bought out by Radio Corp. of America.  During that time, Johnson's firm manufactured both phonographs and records, but  it's the records that most collectors seek these days.  </P> <P> The term "Red Seal" got started with Johnson's brainstorm to color-code his  records -- he would assign colors to different kinds of recordings. Thus, "Red  Seal" referred to special recordings made by well-known performers.  </P> <P> In time, Victor's Red Seal label became synonymous with a product that was of  top quality in terms of sound recording. (Actually, engineers and music experts  reviewing the old Red Seal records have generally concluded that the sound  quality probably wasn't much better than that of competing recording  companies.)  </P> <P> Few, if any, competitors could touch Johnson for the quality of his performers,  which included some of the best of the time. One of those artists was Enrico  Caruso, who in 1903 cut what is believed to be the first record to sell 1  million copies.  </P> <P> In the field of the phonographs, Johnson scored a real coup in 1901.  </P> <P> That was the year Victor acquired rights to Nipper, the white fox terrier who  listened quizzically to "His Master's Voice" coming out of the speaking horn of  a Victrola.  </P> <P> No product of the imagination, Nipper was a real dog whose British artist-owner  painted the original likeness of his pet in the 1890s, along with the "His  Master's Voice" message displayed in the painting. (The artist's name was  Francis Barraud.)  </P> <P> A variation of the Nipper design was sold in the 1890s to the Gramophone Corp.  of Great Britain. Victor acquired the North American rights to Nipper in 1901.  </P> <P> Nipper became an almost overnight success in terms of an advertising symbol.  His image appeared on all Victrolas and Victor records and, right through World  War II, a cardboard likeness of Nipper sat outside of thousands of record  stores throughout the United States.  </P> <P> Mailbag  </P> <P> Thimble Collectors International's most recent publication is entitled "Thread  Winders for Collectors" by Diane Pelham-Burn. The illustrated 51-page booklet  is free to every new TCI member.  </P> <P> "Thread winders were an essential part of sewing equipment -- like needles and  scissors -- and every work box and basket contained them," says the author.  "They had been in use for hundreds of years, and they remained popular well  into the 20th Century."  </P> <P> TCI has also published a number of other booklets in its continuing research  into thimbles and other sewing collectibles, according to Dorothy Friend, a  member of the TCI board of directors.  </P> <P> To join the club or receive information about it, send a self-addressed  envelope to Thimble Collectors International, 6411 Montego Bay Road,  Louisville, Ky. 40228.

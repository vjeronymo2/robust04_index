			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Pozdnyakov under the rubric </F> "Broadcasting": "Channel 5 Has Received the Right To Control  City Radio Broadcasts"]    [Text] In her speech on one of the programs of St.  Petersburg radio, the manager of RGTRK [Russian State Television  and Radio Company] "Peterburg--5-y kanal" [Petersburg-Channel  5], Bella Kurkova, called the accusations of financial  violations against the management of the television and radio  company an attempt at political opposition and announced her  intention "to fight against them as is proper for a journalist."  In her opinion, it is useful for the national-communist  opposition to undermine the authority of the large television  and radio company on the threshold of elections to the City  Assembly in order to besmirch not just the reputation of the  RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5, but also the reputation of the  political organizations close to the company's management.    According to some information, the deputy mayor of St.  Petersburg, Valeriy Malyshev, sent an edict to all the city's  rayon administrations to prevent any cases of uncontrolled  pre-election broadcasts by rayon radio stations and to see that  thereafter the content of pre-election broadcasts is coordinated  with the management of the RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5. In Mr.  Malyshev's opinion, it is precisely the RGTRK which is the only  rightful broadcaster in the entire city, and all the other  broadcasters (even those registered as mass information media)  which use the city radio broadcast network must ask its manager  for permission to prepare their programs.    But it is possible that the scandals surrounding RGTRK  Petersburg-Channel 5 are the result not so much of political as  commercial grounds. According to some information, the RGTRK  management is working up a variant for creating a joint stock  company (with all buildings, structures, and equipment of the  RGTRK transferred to it) with the participation of the American  company TV and Radio St. Petersburg, which proposes to offer 49  percent of the charter capital of the future joint stock  company, and of another limited partnership whose founders are  as yet unknown. The documents on the joint stock company's  creation were passed through by Dmitriy Mezentsev, head of the  mayor's office committee for press and mass information media,  and arrived on the desk of the minister of the press, Vladimir  Shumeyko. However, the television and radio company's financial  activity is of increasing interest to law enforcement organs.  The procurator's office demanded documents on its deals with the  joint stock company "Kommercheskiy tsentr TV i radio  Sankt-Peterburga" [Commercial TV and Radio Center of St.  Petersburg] and the joint stock company "Nevskiy Glashatay"  [Neva Herald].</p>

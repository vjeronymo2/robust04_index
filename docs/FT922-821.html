			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: ERF cuts loss and plans expansion ERF, the UK's last independently-owned truck maker, cut its pre-tax losses from Pounds 4.47m to Pounds 563,000 in the year to March 28 in the teeth of the worst UK truck market slump since the second world war. Mr Peter Foden, the chairman, also disclosed plans yesterday to lessen ERF's dependence on the volatile UK market by spreading sales to continental markets, in what he described as 'one of the most important steps ERF has taken for many years'. However, the overall result for the year obscured a deteriorating performance in the second half as a result of a large export contract to Zimbabwe coming to an end. At the interim stage to September 30 ERF achieved a pre-tax profit of Pounds 330,000, reversing 18 months of losses. Neither the figures nor the European expansion plan were enough to allay market worries about the lack of recovery in the UK, on which ERF remains, for the moment at least, heavily dependent. According to Mr Rod England, ERF's sales and marketing director, 'there is no sign of an upturn'. Its shares closed down 2p at 220p, influenced also by a final dividend reduced from 3p to 2p after an unchanged interim of 2p. Losses per share fell to 12.75p (44.41p). A brief post-general election upturn had fizzled out. Turnover for the year moved ahead to Pounds 118m (Pounds 103m) and there was a profit at the trading level of Pounds 549,000 (Pounds 3.54m loss). However, this was before an exceptional charge of Pounds 1m to cover the development of a new range of environmentally 'cleaner' trucks, preliminary expenses of the continental European venture and a further 53 redundancies which have reduced ERF's workforce to a total of 754. Mr Foden said that further development of both projects would increase exceptional costs next year, probably to about Pounds 2m. In the absence of a UK recovery, that was likely further to raise the company's gearing from its current level of 17 per cent, up from 6 per cent last year. However, the rise is expected largely to reflect increased on-balance sheet leased assets to bring the new truck range into production. 'Borrowings for operating purposes are likely to remain close to zero and will remain under close control', said Mr Colin Fuller, finance director. ERF expects to produce an unchanged 2,000 trucks this year but warned that whether more redundancies were required would depend on the timing and strength of recovery in the UK market. It plans to unveil its attack on continental Europe at the Paris commercial vehicle show in October, with first vehicles being shipped in November. Initially it is setting up sales operations in France and Spain, and has established two wholly-owned subsidiaries, ERF (France) and ERF (Espagne) to be set up dealer networks and administer the business. Mr Foden said it 'would not be unreasonable' for ERF to gain a 1 per cent to 2 per cent share of the French and Spanish heavy truck markets over the next two to three years. At current market levels, that would add about 1,200 units to ERF's annual sales. Currently, its exports are mainly in the form of kits to South Africa and other African startes, plus New Zealand, accounting for about 30 per cent of unit sales.</p>

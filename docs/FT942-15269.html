			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (8): 'Stifling' barriers may fall to winds of competition - Textile Industry Turkey's textile industry is ready and waiting, if not champing at the bit, for customs union with the European Union. Extensive preparations for the 1995 deadline have been made and a timetable for the reduction of import duties is nearing its target of zero. The industry has long awaited the removal of the 'stifling' tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, in particular the quota restrictions which Ankara has considered both arbitrary and a violation of the 1964 Turkey-EC association agreement and the 1973 additional protocol. Buyers and shippers of textiles and apparel have also caught the industry's infectious enthusiasm for customs union. 'No more quotas, no more form filling, no more phoning up to be told I can't have a re-order because quota limits have been reached,' said a ready-to-wear buyer for high street stores in Britain. However, as the appointed 'zero' hour has neared, the road to free trade has developed ruts, potholes and other obstacles to jolt its travellers. Turkey's application for EU membership continues to gather dust on the shelves in Brussels as Nordic and east European applicants nudge Turkey further down the queue. For many Turkish industries, the prospect of customs union without the benefits of full EU membership and economic integration has increasingly been perceived as half-way to nowhere. The country's textile industry is also wary that the EU may retain some quotas on Turkish imports or use restrictions on the textile sector as a lever to prise open Turkey's other more reticent sectors. The vehicle industry and durable goods manufacturers have been lobbying for more time to prepare for the full effects of competition which will squeeze their market share. The recent deterioration of the economy has fuelled the case for some form of delay or prolonged phase-in period and there has been mounting speculation of slippage in the customs union timetable. Brussels has not committed itself to the elimination of quotas, an issue which will ultimately be decided by EU member states. Turkish producers are worried that Portugal and Spain may seek to retain some restrictions to protect their domestic industries. The quota issue is crucial to the textile and apparel industries which are Turkey's largest foreign exchange earners, with combined exports of Dollars 5.4bn in 1992. The share of total export earnings has risen steadily from 30 per cent in 1989 to over 37 per cent in 1992. The EU buys 72 per cent of Turkey's textile and apparel exports and 26 per cent of the country's total export earnings originate from textile and apparel exports to the EU. The industry is growing concerned that something less than full union will be enacted. Import competition combined with any vestiges of export limitations could devastate an industry which has been struggling to overcome a host of problems and a prolonged period of upheaval. Turkey's recent rapid growth and high rates of investment have coincided with recession in its main export markets. Spiralling inflation, high domestic energy costs and rising raw material prices have reduced Turkey's competitive edge in the textiles sector and its rising export figures have been hard-won. The difficulties have been exacerbated by increased market penetration from Asian producers. Over the past three years, textile exports have been falling both in volume terms and more steeply in dollar terms. This has been offset by the rapid rise in apparel exports which have climbed from Dollars 2.4bn in 1989 to Dollars 4bn in 1992. 'In recent months, the issue of EU quotas has been less of a headache than the domestic economy,' says Mr Mustafa Boyacioglu of the Istanbul Apparel Exporters Association (IKTIB) which represents its 10,000 members producing over 80 per cent of exports in the sector. Currency instability, the lack of a coherent economic programme and rising costs have deterred investment for several months. Last August's export incentives to increase export financing, improve export credit terms, rebates on utility costs and extra cargo flights to avoid the disruption of the overland route via former Yugoslavia have been almost negated by the deteriorating economic situation. Inflation, which last month reached an annualised rate of 73 per cent, is expected to cloud the textile sector's wage negotiating round, which begins in September. The threat of strikes loomed large during the last semi-annual round when average monthly wages were Dollars 246. The textiles groups are better organised than the apparel sector which is mainly comprised of small to medium-sized businesses with a high turnover of employees. The forthcoming round is expected to be bruising and some employers suggest that heavy wage demands would be the nail in the coffin for competitiveness, possibly leading to many closures. Cotton prices also remain a stumbling block. Although there are efforts to build a market, futures and hedging have not been developed and domestic cotton harvests have dropped by 75 per cent, from 1.1m bales in 1983 to 276,000 bales for 1993-94. The area planted to cotton has fallen from 300,000 hectares in 1982 to 75,000 hectares in 1993. Reduced government support for prices has caused a shift in cotton production from the largest cotton-producing area of Adana towards the east where wage costs are lower. The cotton yarn industry is also migrating eastwards, with some ventures spilling into the central Asian republics for cotton milling and processing which rely heavily on cheap labour to survive. The domestic retail market for Turkish cloth and fabrics has declined with the shift towards value-added products such as ready-made garments. Foreign clothing producers have been eyeing Turkey's youthful and increasingly fashion-conscious market but have been kept at bay by import duties of around 40 per cent. EU garment sales to Turkey in 1992 amounted to only Dollars 36m but would rise rapidly after customs union when import duties would be zero. Several EU clothing groups, notably Italian producers, have sought to gain a foothold through licensing agreements to market their products in Turkey and in the Turkish speaking areas of the CIS. Pancaldi of Italy last year signed a five-year agreement worth over L18bn. The Turkish apparel sector is confident that it will be able to withstand the impact of full competition by doubling its exports within five years of the EU lifting quota restrictions. It is, however, acutely aware that its present advantages such as a mature and broad product range, a skilled workforce and quick response and re-order times need to be backed up by further investment and modernisation. Without the latter, Turkey's leading industry will be unable to face either the challenges or the opportunities of the full customs union it has been waiting for.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Carrying the banner of communism: Contenders line up for next Sunday's democratic parliamentary elections 'We must understand this: life puts this issue before us - either we understand the seriousness of our position and mobilise our resources to fight for our very existence, or Russia as an independent country and the Russian people as a historic, spiritual community will disappear from the face of the earth.' Thus speaks Mr Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist party, writes John Lloyd. Mr Zyuganov, a commanding and impatient man of 49 who spent much of his life as a party official, now carries the banner of communism in a post-Communist society - and, according to opinion polls and impressionistic evidence, is likely to carry it into the new parliament with a significant number of deputies. Denounced by other fundamentalist Leninist groups for taking part at all in the weekend's elections, Mr Zyuganov defends the decision as what the vast majority of his party's membership - claimed at around 500,000, and by far the largest in Russia - wanted. But his adherence to democratic norms is delicate, and his anti-reform themes familiar. 'They (the government) cannot claim they are taking the democratic road when they close opposition papers,' he argues. 'We agree that state property must be more widely spread but not by a collectivisation in reverse where you destroy the whole system of production and management'. The theme with which he is most closely associated, however, is that of the need to save Russia from an international conspiracy. In electing him leader, Russia's Communists have chosen a man who projects himself as in basic agreement with the most vigorous of nationalists. 'Russia,' he says, 'is being destroyed deliberately and consistently: (its enemies) are fighting not against socialism, but for the realisation of a plan to push her out of the geopolitical arena. We are the last power in the world which can stand up against the new world order of a global, cosmopolitan dictatorship.' This last phrase has been a codeword for the baleful influence of Jews, the 'rootless cosmopolitans' which Russian chauvinists use as a theme to substitute for that of attacking the nation's ills. Mr Zyuganov developed his ideology within the Communist party, but within that powerful part of the then ruling party which emphasised national greatness and Russian ethnic dominance. Now, Mr Zyuganov is emphasising the need for the unity of the Russian people as the aggrieved victim surrounded by hostile foes - a posture with a long history. There is no contradiction here with socialism and a class approach, he says, because the country needs 'those forces which put first the task of resurrecting the traditional values of Russian power and collectivism. . . . where the whole people. . . . feels itself to be one family'. The family, however, is not one: it never was, except in nationalist or Leninist myth. Yet Mr Zyuganov can expect votes from that considerable part of the population who benefited from state communism, and that larger part who regret the passing of a great power which called itself Soviet but, as Mr Zyuganov says, was Russia writ large.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Vietnamese remember the day the fortress fell: The 40th anniversary of the French surrender at Dien Bien Phu Forty years ago this weekend in a remote corner of north-west Vietnam, the French garrison of Dien Bien Phu surrendered to the besieging Communist Vietnamese forces. To preserve a little amour-propre, General Christian de Castries, the French commander, raised no white flag but simply ordered his troops to cease firing. The French, French Union and Foreign Legion forces were exhausted; with nearly 2,000 dead and 7,000 missing or wounded after 55 days of remorseless fighting they had been pummelled into the mud and could resist no longer. The loss of the battle marked the end of the First Indochina War. Had a 37-year-old John F Kennedy taken more careful note of the French defeat, the appellation First would be redundant. In Geneva, on Saturday May 8, 1954, Pham Van Dong, later to become Prime Minister of a united Vietnam, listened to the strained voice of Georges Bidault, French Foreign Minister, as he conceded defeat. Negotiations at the Geneva peace conference had ebbed and flowed, reflecting events in Vietnam. But General Vo Nguyen Giap, commander of the Communist Viet Minh, had dealt this historic victory in the nick of time. Holding the moral and military high ground, as well as 7,000 newly-captured French prisoners, Vietnam had a strong hand. During the next 74 days of negotiations, the French recognised the Communist government of the north and the end of 150 years of colonial rule in Vietnam. The battle of Dien Bien Phu was one of the most decisive battles of this century: it spelt out clearly what was known to many but what others chose to ignore - colonialism was morally unacceptable, economically ruinous and now militarily unenforceable. But what was Dien Bien Phu? And why did such significance attach to the loss of the French fortress? The town of Dien Bien Phu and its wide open valley provided access to the upper Mekong River and to Luang Prabang, the royal capital, and Vientiane, the administrative capital, of neighbouring Laos. General Henri Navarre, the French supreme commander in Indochina, was determined to prevent further Viet Minh incursion into Laos and built the fort to block the route. Dien Bien Phu's significance was simply this: if the French, with US support, could not hold just one strategic fort their authority in Vietnam (ever tenuous and always imposed) was at an end. By March 1954, after five months of fitful progress, the French garrison was more or less ready: the central command post, complete with underground hospital, air strip and howitzer emplacements, was protected by outlying strongpoints atop flanking hills, each within range of supporting fire from its neighbour. But the strongpoints, supposedly named after de Castries' mistresses - Beatrice, Gabrielle, Anne-Marie among them - fell like dominoes: Beatrice fell after just one day's fighting. The French defence disintegrated, revealing flawed strategy and hopeless under-estimation of what a mobilised People's Army could do. The Viet Minh dragged heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns over high mountain passes to positions in the forested hills surrounding the French camp. Tunnels were dug right through these hills and Viet Minh artillerymen were able to fire from them with virtual impunity, concealed by jungle. Shells rained down on the French, almost immediately preventing use of the airstrip and isolating the strongpoints. The loss of the airstrip was a catastrophe: supplies could not be landed and the wounded, who could not be evacuated, piled up in recesses in the walls of the sick bays and then the trenches. Reinforcements, food, medical supplies (whole medical teams), ammunition and fuel had to be parachuted in. As the Viet Minh advanced with what Giap called 'a tactic of combined nibbling and full scale attack', so the French-held area shrunk from 10 to two, to just one square kilometre. And as the drop zone into which men and material had to be parachuted grew smaller, so the flak which civilian and military pilots had to face intensified. Experienced US pilots claimed the barrage, from Soviet and Chinese-supplied 37mm anti-aircraft guns, was worse than any they had experienced over heavily-defended German targets 10 years earlier. So the Dakotas and C119 transports flew higher and higher as the drop zone grew smaller and smaller. Dreadfully high losses followed, as parachutes drifted over enemy lines. As the action progressed, the beleaguered encampment found itself on the sharp end of its own shells - most terrifyingly the delayed-action 105mm shells, which penetrated the bunkers before exploding - unlike the normal variety which exploded comparatively harmlessly upon impact. Luck was against the French too: in a freak incident, a hapless pilot rolled to avoid the flak and accidentally dropped on to Vietnamese lines a pouch containing detailed maps of French positions, the latest aerial photographs pinpointing Vietnamese anti-aircraft positions and code names of all enemy targets. The pilot had pushed back his canopy in preparation for a drop, but became unnerved by the accuracy of Vietnamese shooting and banked. The pouch fell from the cockpit. Memories of two of the better-known heroes of the battle have faded with time but merit recall. Both were medics who became trapped at Dien Bien Phu. Genevieve de Galard-Terraube, known as the 'Angel of Dien Bien Phu', was a medical orderly who travelled on the evacuation flights that flew between Dien Bien Phu and Hanoi in the early days of the siege. When she became trapped after her aircraft was blown-up on take-off, she remained to care for the wounded. 'She was the only one who could get the wounded to be content with five cigarettes a day without grumbling,' remarked camp doctor Major Paul Grauwin. Grauwin himself had agreed to stand in at Dien Bien Phu for a fortnight as a locum, prior to sailing home to France. He too became trapped when the air strip was closed. He operated on hundreds of abdominal cases and head wounds, and he amputated dozens of limbs in the field hospital. Conditions deteriorated as the monsoon set in: water streamed along the passageways and the clay floor became a sea of mud into which discarded needles fell. And heat and humidity produced a plague of flies and maggots, crawling over the hands, faces and ears of wounded men as they slept at night. Grauwin tried to allay the men's panic by explaining that the maggots ate only pus and rotting flesh leaving a nice clean wound. But in spite of French heroism, and the best efforts of the large German contingent of the Foreign Legion, Dien Bien Phu eventually fell, finally overrun by the waves of Viet Minh infantry sacrificed by General Giap in response to pressure from Geneva for a quick, decisive result. Perhaps the greatest tragedy of Dien Bien Phu is that the Americans, who worked closely with the French in supplying the garrison, and who at one stage offered bombers and even discussed the use of nuclear weapons, failed to see how the French experience applied to their own military adventurism in Vietnam less than 10 years later. It is quite remarkable that they not only believed they could hold a now-divided Vietnam by force but they made the same tactical errors and fell prey to tried, tested, and perfected Vietnamese strategies. The US was, of course, blinded by the holiness of its crusade. But the cost of America's pledge to pay any price or bear any burden for the survival of liberty was to be millions of Vietnamese lives. Today, 40 years on, the scars of battle have healed and France is one of the largest foreign investors in Vietnam. It is nearly 20 years since the unification of Vietnam, and in north-west Vietnam, the government is preparing the country's newest tourist attraction. De Castries' bunker has been rebuilt; the battlefield is liberally scattered with rusting tank hulls (eight in all - two others still see service in the Vietnamese army); and American-made 105mm and 155mm howitzers point menacingly skywards, complete with their maker's stamp - United Engineers &amp; Foundry Co - or servicing details and acquisition number, ORD DEPT M2A1 152473. On hill Eliane 2 (scene of the fiercest fighting and known to the Vietnamese as A1) is a war memorial, a bunker and a tank, Grazielle. Around the back of A1 is the entrance to a tunnel dug by coal miners from Hon Gai. The shaft ran several hundred metres to just below the French strongpoint; it was filled with 1,000kg of high explosives and detonated at 11pm on May 6, signalling the beginning of the final assault. The huge crater remains. Quite whether all this justifies the new twice-weekly air service from Hanoi remains to be seen. Dien Bien Phu can hardly be considered an attractive place in spite of, and because of, the tourist infrastructure of karaoke bars and other essentials. The town is a building site and clouds of dust mingle with smoke from the brick kilns and the burning hills to reduce visibility to a few hundred metres. Apart from a few trees on A1, the hills are stripped of vegetation - not French napalm but centuries of shifting cultivation. The barren hills and polluted atmosphere would have served those entombed French soldiers well - but not, one suspects, French tourists.</p>

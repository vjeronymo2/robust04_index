			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Hyundai labour talks hit snags EFFORTS to settle industrial action at Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, hit snags yesterday, dashing hopes that strikes among seven subsidiaries and their 40,000 workers may end soon. Workers at Hyundai Mipo Dockyard and Korea Flange rejected, by 2-to-1 margins, proposed pay agreements reached between their trade unions and management. Meanwhile, Hyundai locked out workers from the Ulsan plant of Hyundai Wood Industries, which produces furniture and wood products, after union representatives rejected a wage proposal offered by the company. It was the first Hyundai company to be subject to a lock-out during the 53 days of labour unrest. Little progress was reported in talks at Hyundai Heavy Industries, the shipbuilding unit that is the biggest subsidiary still on strike, as the company insisted that negotiations be confined to pay demands and refused to discuss reinstatement of sacked unionists. A scheduled vote yesterday to approve a wage accord at Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry, which initiated the industrial action at the group on June 5, was delayed until today due to complaints that workers had not received a full explanation of the agreement. There are growing doubts whether the agreement, reached at the weekend, will be accepted. Workers at Hyundai Electrical Engineering are also expected to vote today on a proposed accord. A stoppage is also affecting Hyundai Construction Equipment. The problems underscore the fact that Hyundai remains a stronghold of labour militancy, although its workers are among the best paid in South Korea. Hyundai has concentrated most of its manufacturing in the south-eastern city of Ulsan, which facilitates collective union action. A wage accord was narrowly approved last week at Hyundai Motor.</p>

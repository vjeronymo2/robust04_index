The Administrator shall notify the applicant of the decision in writing and specify such terms and conditions that are necessary to insure that emissions from the product will meet the emissions reductions specified in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, and that such emissions reductions can be enforced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) In granting an exemption for a product the Administrator shall establish conditions that are enforceable. These conditions shall include the VOC content of the innovative product, dispensing rates, application rates and any other parameters determined by the Administrator to be necessary. The Administrator shall also specify the test methods for determining conformance to the conditions established. The test methods shall include criteria for reproducibility, accuracy, and sampling and laboratory procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) For any product for which an exemption has been granted pursuant to this section, the manufacturer shall notify the Administrator in writing within 30 days of any change in the product formulation or recommended product usage directions, and shall also notify the Administrator within 30 days if the manufacturer learns of any information which would alter the emissions estimates submitted to the Administrator in support of the exemption application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

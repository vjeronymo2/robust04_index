			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Sell-off schedule 'lost Pounds 1.1bn' THE government should stagger future privatisations to get a better deal for the taxpayer, Mr Robert Sheldon, the Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said yesterday. The sale of the regional electricity companies in one block in 1990 meant that the government lost Pounds 1.1bn, he said. Opening the debate on a series of reports prepared by his committee, which scrutinises government expenditure, Mr Sheldon said it was likely that more finance would be raised by phasing any future sell-offs over a period of time. The government is committed to privatising British Rail and British Coal. The Post Office, however, is likely to remain in the public sector after a recommendation by the Department of Trade and Industry that it should not be sold off. The 12 regional electricity companies of England and Wales were sold in one block for Pounds 5.2bn. But Mr Sheldon said the market decided they were worth Pounds 6.3bn. 'It rose from Pounds 5.2bn to Pounds 6.3bn on the first day of trading - and that was a loss to the taxpayer. Uncertainty of this kind should lead to tranches being examined rather more carefully and rather more fully in the future.' Selling off only part of the companies initially would have enabled a second sale to be set at a better price, Mr Sheldon added. He said he feared that the Treasury preferred to sell nationalised companies in one block to raise revenue more quickly. Mr Sheldon expressed concern that the government had appointed 53 advisers to deal with the power sale, 16 of them without competition. He said: 'Clearly we feel very uneasy about some of these appointments and we feel they should all be subject to competition.'</p>

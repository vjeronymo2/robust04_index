			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: British Vita shares fall after statement Shares in British Vita slipped 16p to 259p yesterday after the foam and fibre group said that it was finding it hard to recover higher raw material costs from its customers in the summer months. Some analysts reacted by trimming their forecasts although the company subsequently stressed that the statement was not meant as a profit warning. Mr Jim Mercer, who heads the European rubber and plastics operations, said that the situation had not worsened since the annual results were announced in March. 'It certainly has not deteriorated and in some areas our ability to push through price increases has improved,' he said. In yesterday's statement the company said: 'While raw materials prices, especially in foam chemicals, have increased, the levels of demand over the summer months in several markets make it difficult to recover these costs until the autumn.' The statement accompanied news of the acquisition for Pounds 9.36m of Jackdaw Polymers, a Lancashire-based group involved in the compounding of engineering plastics. British Vita said the company, which has sales of more than Pounds 10m and has been consistently profitable, extended the scope of its existing compounding activities and complemented its engineering thermoplastic sheet business. The consideration, Pounds 1.25m of which has been deferred under warranty arrangements, is being satisfied by Pounds 5.61m cash and the issue of 936,330 shares. Smith New Court has cut its profits forecast for the present year from Pounds 47.5m to Pounds 45m and from Pounds 55m to Pounds 52m for next year.</p>

His plane just landed in Tashkent airport.    This is his first trip to neighbouring Uzbekistan this year.  In 1993 the leaders of the two republics held five such  meetings in Tashkent, Almaty, Kokchetav, Kzyl Orda and Chimkent.    Those were not spontaneous or off-hand meetings. It is  common knowledge that official contacts and the policy pursued  by the two leaders who have already been recognised by the world  will largely affect the situation in the entire Central Asian  region. Each such meeting helps solve urgent economic and  social problems and lay the foundation for building a common  market in the region.    These issues will feature prominently during the talks  between Nazarbayev and Uzbek leaders. The sides are expected to  sign a package of documents which will bring the two countries  even closer together and provide a basis for stronger  cooperation.    It is symbolic that today's meeting between Nazarbayev and  Uzbek President Islam Karimov has coincided with the first  anniversary of the creation of the term "Central Asia" coined by  the leaders of Kazakhstan and five Central Asian republics at  their summit meeting in Tashkent last January. It was then that  the Central-Asian-region notion was brought to life. Despite  all economic hardships it has taken firm roots in the political  lexicon. Although not all goals were fulfilled at that meeting,  regional integration is beginning to take up real shape.</p>

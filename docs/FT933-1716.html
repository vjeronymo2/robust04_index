			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commodity prices 'to fall' WORLD COMMODITY prices are likely to fall by 3 per cent in 1993-4, a reflection of the continuing low economic growth in major industrial nations, according to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics. The predicted fall would follow an 8 per cent decline in 1992-3. 'The slide in commodity prices has resulted from continued sluggish economic activity in the major OECD economies, generally good seasons for world agriculture, and for metals a failure by producers to cut supplies sufficiently to reduce stock,' Abare said yesterday. More cheerfully, the research organisation predicted that a modest upturn in major western economies by 1994-95, should increase demand for commodities and help prices to rise. But it warned that 'the recovery in these prices may be gradual and patchy'. In the wool market, Abare noted that demand had been weak in the current selling season and that demand from China could become volatile given the general overheating in the domestic economy. On the grains front it suggested that a record Chinese wheat crop and large Russian and US crops had boosted estimates of world wheat production in 1993-4 to 569m tonnes, 10m tonnes more than in 1992-93, and reduced the forecast world wheat price in 1993-4 to USDollars 135 per tonne, USDollars 5 per tonne less than in 1992-93. ABARE noted that oil and gold prices were forecast to rise slightly in 1993-94, but it also pointed to the falling trend in Australian contract prices for iron ore and coal.</p>

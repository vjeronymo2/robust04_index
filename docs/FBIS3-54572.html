The initiative is  based on eliminating the dispute between the General People's  Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Socialist party [YSP] -- on the  grounds that these are the two principal forces which achieved  unity -- and removing the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] from the  coalition so that it will become an effective opposition force  that can achieve a kind of balance in the political system.    The initiative -- which is signed by the National  Organization for the Defense of Unity, Democracy, and Social  Peace and the Saba' Conference for Yemeni Tribes -- says that  the YRG's inclusion in the coalition has caused the dispute  among the three parties to move into state institutions, hence  causing them to play the role of a ruler and an opposition at  the same time -- which has been associated with the crisis all  the time.    A number of Yemeni intellectuals are behind the initiative.  Asked about the bad timing of their idea -- which comes in the  wake of the the announcement of the "Pledge and Accord  Document," which is considered a way out of the current crisis  -- they said that "there are still numerous dangers surrounding  the implementation of the document. The official signing (for  which arrangements have begun to be made recently) does not  guarantee its implementation." [passage omitted]    The initiative urges the YRG to abandon its position on the  Presidential Council ('Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani's seat) in favor  of the GPC and its ministerial portfolios in favor of the GPC  and the YSP. It also urges the formation of a committee  consisting of 12 senior officials from the two parties to  include for the first time Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar --  commander of the 1st Division and half brother of the Yemeni  president -- from the GPC and Col. Qasim Yahya al-Mahla'i from  the YSP, thus representing the military at a high level for the  first time in the dialogue between the GPC and the YSP. Because  the military establishments of the two sides played an important  role in the crisis, whether with regard to the threat of an  explosion or securing a mutual deterrent to prevent this  explosion.    The initiative, a copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has  obtained, stresses the need to consider 22 May -- the day unity  between the two parts of Yemeni was announced in 1990 -- a  starting point for resolving the crisis, building a modern state  organ capable of implementing unionist policies, discussing the  nature of the "coalition relationship" between the GPC and the  YSP, and "determining the causes of tension and conflict in this  relationship," in order to come out with a healthy and sound  view to consolidate the elements of stability in the political  system.    The initiative also urges the formation of a military  committee comprised of the most competent commanders to assume  the task of "reformulating the combat doctrine of the Armed  Forces, drawing up a new defense strategy, supervising the Armed  Forces' withdrawal from the cities and the contact areas (it  specifies a distance of 100-150 km on both sides of the previous  border between the two parts), drawing up a practical plan to  rebuild the Armed Forces and set a ceiling for the troops'  number, and reconsidering the haphazard promotions that have  taken place over the past three years."    The initiative also calls for reexamining the civil service  organ and forming a higher council to supervise administrative  reforms, diagnose current problems, draw up a bill to regulate  work inside it, and to achieve professional stability for  employees "in isolation from partisan and political  fluctuations." And also to study "the bad situation in the  judiciary, to agree on specific measures to purge it of  corruption, to rebuild it in order to ensure its neutrality and  independence, and to ban any interference in its affairs by  other state authorities."    The initiative also broaches the need to acknowledge the  existence of current security conditions and "to analyze the  phenomenon of terrorism and political assassinations" in the  framework of an honest security study.

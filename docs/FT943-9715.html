			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Charter may abandon Swedish group bid: Esab shareholders resist Pounds 260m takeover move Charter, the UK industrial group, yesterday suffered a severe setback in its plans to take over Sweden's Esab, the world's biggest welding equipment supplier, when a group of leading Swedish institutional shareholders rejected its bid. During a dramatic day, reminiscent of the Swedish shareholder revolt that halted Volvo's attempt last year to merge with Renault, five institutions which hold almost 20 per cent of the voting capital in Esab announced, one by one, their decisions to spurn the British offer. Their rejections mean Charter cannot achieve the 90 per cent acceptance it had set as a condition for its recommended Pounds 260m bid by Friday's deadline. Mr Jeffrey Herbert, Charter's chief executive, said the company might abandon the entire deal despite having already secured 53 per cent of the voting capital in Esab. He said the bid price of SKr345 (Pounds 29) a share remained a fair offer, despite a surge in Esab's share price to SKr355 since the offer was made in June. 'Nothing has changed the terms of our offer,' said Mr Herbert, who was in Stockholm yesterday in an unsuccessful attempt to talk round the institutions. 'If we do not reach the required level of acceptances by Friday, our options include walking away or remaining satisfied with the acceptances we have.' Charter's bid was recommended by the Esab board and accepted by Incentive, the Wallenberg family's industrial group that was previously Esab's controlling shareholder with 49 per cent of the voting capital. Under the terms of the agreement with Incentive, Charter can withdraw if it does not receive at least 90 per cent acceptances. The takeover of Esab, which had turnover of SKr7bn last year, was billed as a successful conclusion to Charter's search for an international industrial 'fourth leg' to add to its three existing operations in building materials, coal and rail track equipment. The British group wanted complete control of Esab, which would more than double Charter in size. But opposition to the deal began to surface in Sweden shortly after the bid was announced, despite Incentive's acceptance. Blue and white-collar trade unions at Esab - based, like Volvo, in Gothenburg - began a campaign against the takeover, arguing that Charter had no experience in welding equipment and was likely to scrap the company's matrix management structure and shift production away from Sweden. The unions have representation on the boards of some of the institutional shareholders. But the biggest factor in the rejection was a growing view that the Charter bid was significantly underpriced - despite the 20 per cent premium the offer represented at the time it was made. In July, the Esab share price jumped in line with the Stockholm market. On Monday, Esab announced sharply increased profits for the first half and predicted full year pre-tax profits of SKr390m, well ahead of the previous forecast of SKr320m. The price/earnings multiple represented by the Charter bid fell from 20 to below 17. The half-year results persuaded five of the biggest institutional Esab shareholders to hold out for more money. They included a state pension fund, the Fourth Fund and Skandia, the insurance group, both of which played key roles in the demise of the Volvo-Renault merger.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Investors shun Taiwan airline's flotation THE stock market flotation of China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's flag-carrier, has flopped, underlining the depth of the local stock market's year-old slump, Reuter reports from Taipei. CAL's first public offer of 41m shares last month was initially oversubscribed, but investors had committed funds to buy only 11 per cent of the shares by the payment deadline on January 9, CAL said. The airline will now seek to sell the roughly 36.5m shares not taken up by other means, such as private placements. The offer, at a price of TDollars 68 (USDollars 2.67) a share, aimed to raise about USDollars 110m. It would have cut the stake in CAL held by the China Aviation Development Foundation, a private body, to about 80 per cent from 85 per cent. 'We feel disappointed with the result. But it will not affect our goal of listing on the stock market,' CAL said, adding it planned to list in late February. Analysts said the CAL offer was a bad omen for future big equity offerings in Taiwan, including privatisation issues by the government.</p>

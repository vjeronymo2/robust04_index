			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / High Court sets aside judgment against Iraq THE REPUBLIC of Iraq has succeeded in having a judgment for more than Dollars 500m (Pounds 260m) set aside by the High Court in London. The judgment was obtained against it last year by Kuwait Airways Corporation. In a ruling given in April, but only just made public, a judge in the Commercial Court held that KAC's writ was not validly served. The writ was served through diplomatic channels on the Iraqi Embassy in London in January last year, with a request that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Baghdad. However, Mr Justice Evans said service on a state was deemed to have been effected when a writ was received by its foreign ministry and there was no evidence that the KAC writ was received by the ministry in Baghdad. The judge rejected a claim by Iraqi Airways Company, against which KAC has a judgment for nearly Dollars 490m, that the writ was not validly served on it. He also rejected IAC's arguments that it had state immunity from KAC's legal action and that the English court did not have jurisdiction to deal with the dispute. Yesterday KAC's London solicitor, Mr Christopher Gooding, of Clyde &amp; Co, said Iraq had won only 'a Pyrrhic victory' because the writ would eventually be validly served on it. The case concerns 10 KAC airliners which, after the invasion of Kuwait, were flown to Iraq and handed over to IAC. Six of the aircraft were later flown to Iran, where they were interned by the Iranian authorities. The other four aircraft were destroyed in air raids on Iraq. In January last year KAC started legal proceedings in London and obtained judgment for Dollars 515,274,988 damages against Iraq and Dollars 489,455,380 against IAC, neither defendant having taken part in the proceedings. The judgments were stayed last July when IAC and Iraq gave notice that they wanted to contest KAC's claim and intended claiming state immunity and challenging the High Court's jurisdiction to deal with the dispute.</p>
